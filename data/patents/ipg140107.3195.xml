<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides a display device which forms a drive circuit using a bottom-gate-type TFT made of poly-Si which generates a small leak current in a periphery of a display region. A gate electrode is made of Mo having a high melting point, and a gate insulation film is formed on the gate electrode. A channel layer constituted of a poly-Si layer is formed on the gate insulation film, and the poly-Si layer is covered with an a-Si layer. An n+Si layer is formed on the a-Si layer, and an SD electrode is formed on the n+Si layer. Although holes are induced in the poly-Si layer when a negative voltage (inverse bias) is applied to the gate electrode, the holes cannot pass through the a-Si layer and hence, no drain current flows. Accordingly, it is possible to realize a bottom-gate-type TFT using poly-silicon which generates a small leak current.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP2007-215006 filed on Aug. 21, 2007, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device, and more particularly to an active-matrix-type display device which uses a-Si-type thin film transistors in a display region and forms a drive circuit which uses a poly-Si-type thin film transistor in a periphery of the display region.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a liquid crystal display device, on a TFT substrate on which pixel electrodes, thin film transistors (TFT) and the like are formed in a matrix array, a color filter substrate which forms color filters and the like thereon at positions corresponding to the pixel electrodes is arranged to face the TFT substrate in an opposed manner, and liquid crystal is sandwiched between the TFT substrate and the color filter substrate. An image is formed by controlling optical transmissivity of light passing through liquid crystal molecules for every pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Data lines which extend in the longitudinal direction and are arranged parallel to each other in the lateral direction, and scanning lines which extend in the lateral direction and are arranged parallel to each other in the longitudinal direction are formed on the TFT substrate, and a pixel is formed in each region surrounded by the data lines and the scanning lines. The pixel is mainly constituted of a pixel electrode and a thin film transistor (TFT) which constitutes a switching element. A display region is formed of a large number of pixels formed in a matrix array in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Outside the display region, a scanning line drive circuit which drives the scanning lines and a data line drive circuit which drives the data lines are arranged. Conventionally, in the scanning line drive circuit and the data line drive circuit, an IC chip driver is mounted externally. The IC chip driver may be connected to the TFT substrate by a tape carrier method or the like or the IC driver may be directly mounted on the TFT substrate by a chip-on mounting method.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, to satisfy a demand for the miniaturization of the whole display device while ensuring a display area or the like, a technique which forms a drive circuit using a TFT in a periphery of the display region has been developed. In such a display device, a TFT formed in a display region forms a channel portion using a-Si and a TFT formed in a drive circuit part forms a channel portion using poly-Si. That is, a-Si which exhibits a small leak current is used in the display region, and poly-Si which exhibits large electron mobility is used in the drive circuit part.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, the bottom gate structure is adopted in the TFT which uses a-Si, and the top gate structure is adopted in the TFT which uses poly-Si. Accordingly, it is necessary to form TFTs which have the different structures on one sheet of substrate and hence, the manufacturing process becomes complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">JP-A-5-55570 (patent document 1) discloses the constitution in which, for preventing the process from becoming complicated, a TFT which uses poly-Si also adopts the bottom gate structure. In such constitution, a poly-Si layer which becomes a channel is firstly formed on a gate insulation film formed on a gate electrode, and an a-Si layer is formed on the poly-Si layer. A contact layer formed of an n+ layer is formed on the a-Si layer, and source/drain electrodes (SD electrodes) are formed on the contact layer. By forming the TFT which forms the channel using poly-Si in such a manner, the number of steps which can be shared in common between the TFT which forms the channel using a-Si and the TFT which forms the channel using poly-Si is increased and hence, the manufacturing process can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the constitution of a TFT having a channel made of poly-Si in the same manner as the TFT described in patent document 1. In the technique disclosed in patent document 1, the poly-Si layer is formed on a gate insulation layer formed on a gate electrode <b>103</b>, an a-Si layer is formed on the poly-Si layer, and an n+ layer is formed on the a-Si layer thus forming the contact layer. In such constitution, when the transistor is turned on, an ON current surely flows through the poly-Si layer which exhibits high mobility. However, when the transistor is turned off, there arises a drawback that an electric current leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a plan view of the TFT, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is formed on the gate electrode <b>103</b> with a gate insulation film <b>104</b> sandwiched therebetween, and an a-Si layer <b>108</b> is formed on the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. The SD electrode <b>113</b> is formed on the a-Si layer <b>108</b> by way of an n+Si layer <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is the detailed cross-sectional view of the TFT shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the gate electrode <b>103</b> is formed on a background film <b>102</b>, and the gate insulation film <b>104</b> is formed so as to cover the gate electrode <b>103</b>. The poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is formed on the gate insulation film <b>104</b>, and the a-Si layer <b>108</b> is formed on the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. The n+Si layer <b>109</b> is formed on the a-Si layer <b>108</b>. Since the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and the n+Si layer <b>109</b> are formed by photolithography using the same mask, these layers have the same planar shape. The SD electrode <b>113</b> is formed on the n+Si layer <b>109</b>. The SD electrode <b>113</b> is formed of a barrier metal layer <b>110</b> made of Mo, an Al layer <b>111</b>, and a cap metal layer <b>112</b> made of Mo.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there arises no drawback when an ON current is supplied to the TFT by applying a positive voltage to the gate electrode <b>103</b>. However, when the TFT is turned off by applying a zero voltage or a negative voltage to the gate electrode <b>103</b>, there arises a drawback. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the relationship between a gate voltage and a drain current of the TFT. The characteristic of the TFT is required to be set such that the drain current flows in the TFT when the positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b>, and the drain current is cut off, that is, the drain current does not flow when the zero voltage or the negative voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b>. A dotted line shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> indicates the relationship between the gate voltage and the drain current of the generally-available TFT which uses a-Si. When the gate voltage reaches a certain value, the drain current is saturated and only a trivial leak current flows when the gate potential becomes zero or minus.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, in the stacked structure formed of the poly-Si film and the a-Si film shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, there is observed a phenomenon that even when the gate electrode <b>103</b> is set at the zero potential or at the minus potential, the drain current is not cut. This implies that the TFT cannot play a role of a switching element. This phenomenon is considered to occur due to the following cause.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross-sectional view similar to the cross-sectional view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when the negative voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b>, holes are induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. No potential barrier exists between the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and the barrier metal layer <b>110</b> of the SD electrode <b>113</b>. Accordingly, the electric current generated by the holes directly flows into the SD electrode <b>113</b>. Accordingly, the TFT is not turned off.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention is provided to cope with such a phenomenon that the TFT is not turned off in the TFT having the active layer constituted by stacking the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention has been made to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks and it is an object of the present invention to provide a technique which can, in a bottom-gate-type TFT which forms a channel portion using a poly-Si layer, prevent the poly-Si layer from coming into contact with an SD electrode of the TFT by forming an a-Si layer such that the a-Si layer covers the poly-Si layer.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">(2) In the display device having the constitution (1), the poly-Si layer is formed by applying laser annealing to the a-Si layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">(3) In the display device having the constitution (1), a gate electrode of the bottom-gate-type TFT for the pixel and a gate electrode of the bottom-gate-type TFT for the drive circuit are made of Mo or Mo alloy.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Contents of the present invention are disclosed in detail in conjunction with embodiments.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">[Embodiment 1]</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing the constitution of an essential part of a display device of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a TFT described on a left side in the drawing is a TFT which is formed by stacking a poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and an a-Si layer <b>108</b> and is used for forming a drive circuit part (a TFT for drive circuit). A TFT described on a right side in the drawing is a TFT which is used for forming a pixel portion (a TFT for pixel). A terminal portion is formed on a right side of the TFT used for forming the pixel portion. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for facilitating the comparison of the respective portions, the TFT for drive portion, the TFT for pixel portion and the terminal portion are described such that these portions are arranged close to each other. However, in an actual display device, the respective elements are formed on places remote from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a background film <b>102</b> is formed on a TFT substrate <b>101</b>. In this embodiment, although the background film <b>102</b> is formed of a single-layered SiN film, the background film <b>102</b> may be formed of a two-layered film constituted of an SiN film and an SiO2 film. Gate electrodes <b>103</b> are formed on the background film <b>102</b>, and a gate insulation film <b>104</b> is formed on the gate electrodes <b>103</b> in a state that the gate insulation film <b>104</b> covers the gate electrodes <b>103</b>. In the TFT for drive circuit part described on a left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is formed on the gate insulation film <b>104</b>. The poly-Si layer <b>107</b> constitutes a channel portion of the TFT. A film thickness of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is set to approximately 50 nm. An a-Si-layer <b>108</b> is formed on the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> in a state that the a-Si layer <b>108</b> covers the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. A film thickness of the a-Si layer <b>108</b> is set to approximately 150 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the present invention, not only is the a-Si layer <b>108</b> placed on the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> but also the a-Si layer <b>108</b> completely covers the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. In this manner, the a-Si layer <b>108</b> completely covers the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and hence, as described later, a leak current generated in the poly-Si TFT can be restricted to a level substantially equal to a level of a leak current generated in the a-Si TFT. An n+Si layer <b>109</b> is formed on the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and is brought into contact with an SD electrode <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The SD electrode <b>113</b> is constituted of a barrier metal <b>110</b> made of Mo, an Al film and a cap metal <b>112</b> made of Mo. The whole TFT is protected by a passivation film <b>116</b> formed of an SiN film. On the passivation film <b>116</b>, a leveling film formed of an organic film <b>117</b> is formed for leveling portions where pixel electrodes are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the TFT used for forming the pixel portion is described on a right side of the TFT for drive circuit part. The TFT for pixel portion adopts the same structure as the TFT for drive circuit part except for that a channel portion is not formed of a poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. That is, the TFT for drive circuit part requires a high-speed operation and hence, poly-Si which exhibits high electron mobility is used for forming the channel portion. On the other hand, the TFT for pixel portion does not require a high-speed operation comparable to an operation of the TFT for drive circuit part and hence, a-Si is used for forming the channel portion.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The SD electrode <b>113</b> of the TFT for pixel portion is made electrically conductive with the pixel electrode for supplying a data signal to the pixel portion. That is, a through hole is formed in the passivation film <b>116</b> which covers the TFT for pixel portion and the leveling film formed of the organic film <b>117</b>, and the pixel electrode and the SD electrode <b>113</b> are made electrically conductive with each other through the through hole. The pixel electrode is formed of an ITO film <b>119</b> which is a transparent conductive film.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the terminal portion is described on a right side of the TFT for pixel portion. Terminal-portion lines <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are formed on the same layer as the gate electrodes <b>103</b>. That is, the terminal-portion lines <b>130</b> are simultaneously formed with the gate electrodes <b>103</b> using the same material. The terminal-portion lines <b>130</b> are protected by the passivation film <b>116</b> and the leveling film. In the terminal portion, terminal portion contact holes <b>118</b> are formed in the passivation film and the leveling film for connecting the terminal portion to an external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The terminal-portion lines <b>130</b> are made of metal and hence, the terminal-portion lines <b>130</b> are liable to be easily corroded attributed to an external environment. To prevent the terminal-portion lines <b>130</b> from being corroded, the terminal portion is covered with the ITO film <b>119</b> which is a transparent conductive film. The ITO film <b>119</b> is made of metal oxide and hence, the ITO film <b>119</b> is chemically stable. The ITO film <b>119</b> formed on the terminal portion is simultaneously formed with the ITO film <b>119</b> which forms the pixel electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> show a process for forming the TFTs and the terminal portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an SiN film which becomes the background film <b>102</b> is formed on the TFT substrate <b>101</b> using a plasma CVD method. Thereafter, a wiring layer for forming the gate electrodes <b>103</b> is formed by sputtering, and the wiring layer is processed in a photolithography step. By taking a laser annealing step which follows the photolithography step into consideration, the gate electrode <b>103</b> is made of a material having a high melting point (Mo system).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an SiO2 film which becomes the gate insulation film <b>104</b> is formed using a plasma CVD method. Subsequently, an a-Si film is formed using a plasma CVD method. The a-Si film is converted into a poly-Si film by applying laser annealing. To apply laser annealing to the a-Si film, a dehydrogenation treatment (annealing treatment at a temperature of 450&#xb0; C. or more) is applied to the a-Si film for removing hydrogen in the a-Si film. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a-Si is converted into poly-Si using a continuously oscillating solid laser <b>106</b>. Here, depending on radiation conditions of the laser, it is possible to form a strip-shaped crystal silicon layer in which a crystal grains are largely grown in the scanning direction of the laser. By changing the strip direction of the strip-shaped crystal silicon layer in the channel direction of the transistor, it is possible to acquire the TFT which exhibits high mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a portion to which the laser beams are radiated is formed into the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. Although the laser beams are deemed to be radiated to only one TFT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, in an actual operation, the laser beams are simultaneously radiated to a large number of TFTs for drive circuit part which constitute a drive portion. By making the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> formed in this manner subject to a photolithography step and an etching step as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the channel portion formed of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, the a-Si layers <b>108</b> are formed on the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> in a state that the a-Si layer <b>108</b> covers the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> using a plasma CVD method. On the a-Si layer <b>108</b>, an n+Si layer <b>109</b> doped with phosphor is formed using a plasma CVD method for bringing the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and the SD electrode <b>113</b> into contact with each other. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, the n+Si layer <b>109</b> and the a-Si layer <b>108</b> are processed in a photolithography step and an etching step.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, SD electrode layers <b>113</b> are formed. The SD electrode layers <b>113</b> are formed in the same layer as data signal lines, and are simultaneously formed with the data signal lines. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>, the SD electrode layer <b>113</b> is formed of three layers consisting of the barrier metal layer <b>110</b>, the Al layer <b>111</b> and the cap metal layer <b>112</b>. The barrier metal layer <b>110</b> and the cap metal layer <b>112</b> are made of Mo. Although the electrical connection of the SD electrode <b>113</b> is mainly acquired by Al, Mo is provided for preventing hillock of Al and for preventing the defective connection attributed to oxidization of Al when Al is brought into contact with the ITO film <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>, the SD electrode <b>113</b> is processed using a photolithography step and an etching step. Further, using the SD electrodes <b>113</b> as masks, the n+Si layers <b>109</b> each formed between a source and a drain of the TFT are removed by dry etching. Due to such a process, channel etching portions <b>114</b> are formed. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>, with respect to gate lines at the terminal portion, that is, with respect to the terminal-portion lines <b>130</b>, through holes <b>115</b> are formed in the gate insulation film <b>104</b> by photo etching.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>, the whole TFT is covered with the passivation film <b>116</b> formed of a SiN film. The SiN film is formed using a plasma CVD method. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a photosensitive organic film <b>117</b> for leveling is applied to the passivation film <b>116</b> by coating, and is processed in a photolithography step. A film thickness of the organic film <b>117</b> is set to approximately 1 to 2 &#x3bc;m. Using the organic film <b>117</b> as a mask, the passivation film <b>116</b> formed of the SiN film is etched so as to form contact holes. Thereafter, the ITO film <b>119</b> for forming the pixel electrodes is formed on the organic film <b>117</b> by sputtering, and photo etching is applied to the ITO film <b>119</b> so as to form the pixel electrodes. Due to such processing, the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is acquired. That is, the TFT for drive circuit which forms the channel using the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and the TFT for pixel which forms the channel using the a-Si layer <b>108</b> are simultaneously formed on the same substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> are detailed views of an essential part of the TFT for drive circuit of this embodiment, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a plan view of the TFT for drive circuit, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Although the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> which is the cross-sectional view is substantially equal to the constitution explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>, the relationship between the cross-sectional view and the plan view of the TFT is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is formed on a gate electrode <b>103</b> by way of a gate insulation film <b>104</b>, and the a-Si layer <b>108</b> is formed on the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> in a state that the a-Si layer <b>108</b> covers the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> indicated by a dotted line is completely covered with the a-Si layer <b>108</b>. The poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is not in contact with an SD electrode <b>113</b>. An n+Si layer <b>109</b> is formed on the a-Si layer <b>108</b>, and the a-Si layer <b>108</b> is brought into contact with the SD electrode <b>113</b> by way of the n+Si layer <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, side portions of the a-Si layer <b>108</b> are brought into contact with the SD electrode <b>113</b>. In the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b> for turning on the TFT, electrons are induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>, and a drain current flows corresponding to mobility of electrons. Here, the channel portion is formed of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and hence, mobility of electrons can be enhanced thus realizing a TFT which can perform a high-speed operation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view showing a state of an electric current when a negative voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b> of the TFT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When the negative voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b>, holes are induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> which forms the channel portion. The holes move in the direction indicated by arrows in the drawing due to a voltage applied between the source and the drain. Here, in the constitution of this embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, although the holes induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> are required to pass through the a-Si layer <b>108</b> to generate a drain current, substantially no holes are present in the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and hence, the holes induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> cannot reach the SD electrode <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as cases in which the holes induced in the channel layer formed of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> may generate a drain current, there considered are two cases, that is, a case in which the holes are directed toward the SD electrode <b>113</b> by way of the n+Si layer <b>109</b> and a case in which the holes are directed toward the SD electrode <b>113</b> which is in contact with a side surface of the a-Si layer <b>108</b>. In either cases, the holes are required to pass through the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and hence, a flow of an electric current induced in the holes cannot be generated. Accordingly, this embodiment can restrict an OFF current to a value substantially equal to an OFF current of a TFT which forms the channel using an a-Si film.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph showing a current-voltage characteristic when this embodiment is adopted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a voltage which is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b> is taken on an axis of abscissas, while a drain current is taken on an axis of ordinates. When a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b>, electrons are induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and a drain current flows through the a-Si layer <b>108</b>. Here, the channel portion is formed of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and hence, mobility of electrons is high thus realizing a high-speed operation. On the other hand, when a negative voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b>, holes are induced in the channel formed of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>. However, the holes are blocked by the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and hence, a large current cannot be generated. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the OFF current can be restricted to a small value substantially equal to an OFF current of a TFT which forms a channel using the a-Si layer <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As has been explained heretofore, according to this embodiment, the a-Si bottom-gate-type TFT can be formed in the pixel portion, while the poly-Si bottom-gate-type TFT can be formed in the drive portion. In this embodiment, the channel of the TFT for drive portion can be formed of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and hence, mobility of electrons is high where by it is possible to acquire a TFT which can perform a high-speed operation. On the other hand, when the TFT of the drive part is turned off, an electric current is blocked by the a-Si layer <b>108</b> which covers the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> and hence, it is possible to restrict a leak current to a value substantially equal to a leak current of the TFT which forms the channel using the a-Si layer <b>108</b>.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, with respect to left and right portions <b>150</b> of a poly-Si layer <b>107</b>, an a-Si layer <b>108</b> has a width larger than a width of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> in the same manner as the embodiment 1.

However, on portions <b>140</b> of the a-Si layer <b>108</b> where the width of the a-Si layer <b>108</b> is larger than the width of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>, the SD electrode <b>113</b> is not formed. Accordingly, even when a negative voltage is applied to a gate electrode <b>103</b> so that holes are induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>, a drain current is not generated by the holes. Accordingly, even when the constitution of the TFT of this embodiment in which the channel is formed of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is adopted, in the same manner as the TFT which forms the channel using the a-Si layer <b>108</b>, it is possible to restrict an OFF current to a small value.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As in the case of this embodiment explained heretofore, even when the specific portions of the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> are formed larger than the a-Si layer <b>108</b>, it is possible to manufacture the TFT for drive circuit part which exhibits high mobility in an ON operation and exhibits a small leak current in an OFF operation using the bottom gate structure.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is formed on a gate electrode <b>103</b> by way of a gate insulation film <b>104</b>, and an a-Si layer <b>108</b> is formed on the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>.

In this embodiment, however, an area of the n+Si layer <b>109</b> differs from an area of the n+Si layer <b>109</b> of the embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is substantially equal to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> which is used for explaining the embodiment 1 except for a region of the n+Si layer <b>109</b>. The technical feature which makes the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> different from the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> lies in that the n+Si layer <b>109</b> is formed not only on the a-Si layer <b>108</b> but also within a range which is equal to a range within which an SD layer falls.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Due to the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, even at side portions of the a-Si layer <b>108</b>, a potential barrier is formed between the n+Si layer <b>109</b> and the a-Si layer <b>108</b>. The potential barrier performs a function of restricting a leak current of a TFT when the TFT is turned off. That is, the contact portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is substantially equal to the constitution of a contact portion of the usual TFT which forms the channel using the a-Si layer <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to the constitution of the TFT explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, even when a negative voltage is applied to a gate electrode so that holes are induced in the poly-Si layer <b>107</b>, the holes are double-blocked and hence, it is possible to restrict a drain current to a small value. That is, first of all, the extremely small number of holes is present in the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and hence, it is possible to make the generation of a drain current extremely small. Further, at the upper portion and the side portions of the a-Si layer <b>108</b>, it is possible to further restrict the leak current using the potential barrier formed between the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and the n+Si layer <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the embodiment explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is completely covered with the a-Si layer <b>108</b>.

Here, the n+Si layer <b>109</b> is etched using the SD electrode <b>113</b> as a resist and hence, the SD electrode <b>113</b> and the n+Si layer <b>109</b> overlap with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As in the case of this embodiment explained heretofore, the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> is covered with the a-Si layer <b>108</b> and, at the same time, the n+Si layer <b>109</b> is formed on the a-Si layer <b>108</b> in a state that the n+Si layer <b>109</b> also covers side surfaces of the a-Si layer <b>108</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to manufacture the TFT for drive circuit part which exhibits high mobility in an ON operation and generates an extremely small leak current in OFF operation using the bottom gate structure. Accordingly, it is possible to efficiently form the TFTs in each of which the channel is formed of the a-Si layer <b>108</b> in a display region and the TFT which forms the channel using the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> in the drive circuit on the same substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Heretofore, the explanation has been made by taking the liquid crystal display device as an example in the above-mentioned embodiments. However, a demand for realization of a display device incorporating the drive circuit therein with simplified processing by forming TFTs for pixels in the display region and the TFT for drive circuit formed around the display region using the bottom gate structure is not limited to the liquid crystal display device. For example, also in an organic EL display device, a manufacturing process of TFTs can be simplified by manufacturing TFTs for pixel portions and a TFT for forming a peripheral circuit part using the bottom gate structure. Further, it is needless to say that the present invention is applicable to a TFT for forming a drive circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Here, the organic EL display device includes organic EL layers each of which is formed of a plurality of layers, wherein these organic EL layers correspond to pixel electrodes of the liquid crystal display device.

The TFT in the pixel portion can be formed using a TFT which forms a channel using an a-Si layer <b>108</b>. While a TFT for forming a drive circuit which is formed in the periphery of the display region can be formed using a bottom-gate-type TFT which forms a channel portion using the poly-Si layer <b>107</b> as explained in the embodiment 1 to the embodiment 3.</p>
