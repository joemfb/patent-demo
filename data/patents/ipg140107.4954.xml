<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus using an electrophotographic system such as a copying machine and a printer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a conventional image forming apparatus, when a sheet is nipped by a nip portion of a fixing apparatus and a transfer apparatus and conveyed in this state, if the sheet is pulled from the fixing apparatus, deviation or rubbing of an image is generated in some cases. To prevent the deviation and rubbing of an image, there is a known image forming apparatus having a configuration that a sheet is looped and conveyed in this state upstream of the fixing apparatus. According to this image forming apparatus, passing timing of a sheet is detected using a sensor which is disposed on an intermediate portion of a conveying path, a rotation velocity of a roller of the fixing apparatus is variably controlled according to the detected timing, thereby generating a loop in the sheet at an upstream portion of the fixing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, it is difficult to constantly maintain a conveying velocity of a sheet due to factors such as variation in machining precision of parts constituting the apparatus and thermal expansion, and as a result, it is difficult to constantly maintain a loop amount of a sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, there is a known image forming apparatus having a device which detects a loop amount and maintains the loop amount within a predetermined range based on the detection (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H7-234604). That is, the image forming apparatus body includes a sensor which detects an upper limit and a lower limit of the loop amount formed by a sheet, and control is performed such that when the upper limit of the loop amount is detected, a velocity of a driving portion of the fixing apparatus is increased, and when the lower limit of the loop amount is detected, the velocity of the driving portion of the fixing apparatus is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To detect the loop amount described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-234604, if a mechanical sensor is disposed between the transfer apparatus and the fixing apparatus and the sensor is brought into contact with a sheet, a problem concerning a conveying operation of the sheet is generated in some cases. When a sheet (thin paper sheet) having a basis weight of 60 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or less is to be conveyed, since elasticity of the sheet is weak, there are problems that a tip end of the sheet (sheet tip end, hereinafter) collides against the mechanical sensor which is a loop detector and a conveying track is hindered, and a generation ratio of a paper jam and a wrinkle is increased. Especially in recent years, people are more environmentally aware, recycled paper is utilized of course, and since a using amount of pulp which is a raw material can be reduced, it is expected that a demand for thin paper sheets will increase more and more in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an image forming apparatus in which a loop is formed in a sheet, but a sheet tip end does not collide against a mechanical sensor which detects a loop amount, appropriate loop control is performed without hindering a track when the sheet is conveyed, thereby suppressing generation of an image failure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides an image forming apparatus including an upstream conveying portion which conveys a sheet, a downstream conveying portion which is disposed downstream of the upstream conveying portion and which conveys the sheet, and a loop detector which brings a contact portion into contact with the sheet which is conveyed on a sheet conveying path between the upstream conveying portion and the downstream conveying portion, thereby detecting a loop of the sheet, wherein at least one of the upstream conveying portion and the downstream conveying portion is controlled based on a detection signal of the loop detector, and the sheet is conveyed while maintaining a loop amount within a predetermined range, and a driving portion which moves the contact portion to a projecting position where the sheet conveying path is in contact with a conveyed sheet and to a retracted position where the sheet conveying path is not in contact with the conveyed sheet, and a controlling portion which controls the driving portion such that the contact portion is moved from the projecting position to the retracted position before a tip end of a sheet which enters the sheet conveying path from the upstream conveying portion reaches the contact portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, the contact portion is moved to the retracted position before the sheet tip end reaches the contact portion, and then, it is possible that a tip end of a sheet which enters the sheet conveying path from the upstream conveying portion does not collide against the contact portion of the loop detector. Therefore, a generation ratio of a paper jam and a paper wrinkle can be reduced, and generation of image deviation and rubbing can largely be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one example of a color image forming apparatus of an electrophotographic system. First, an operation of the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> of the electrophotographic system will be described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> includes a sheet feeding portion <b>21</b>, photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y, <b>22</b>M, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>K, chargers <b>23</b>Y, <b>23</b>M, <b>23</b>C, and <b>23</b>K, toner cartridges <b>25</b>Y, <b>25</b>M, <b>25</b>C, and <b>25</b>K which are arranged in every station in a development color-coded manner. The color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> also includes development devices <b>26</b>Y, <b>26</b>M, <b>26</b>C, and <b>26</b>K, an intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b>, primary transfer rollers <b>31</b>Y, <b>31</b>M, <b>31</b>C, and <b>31</b>K, a secondary transfer roller <b>32</b>, a secondary transfer counter roller <b>33</b> and a fixing unit <b>50</b>. The color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> forms an electrostatic latent image by exposure controlled by a controlling portion <b>40</b> based on an image signal, develops the electrostatic latent image to form a monotone toner image, and superposes the monotone toner images to form a multicolor toner image. The color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> further transfers the multicolor toner image to a sheet P, and fixes the multicolor toner image on the sheet P. Each of the photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y, <b>22</b>M, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>K is formed by applying an organic light-transmission layer on an outer periphery of an aluminum cylinder, a driving force of a drive motor (not illustrated) is transmitted and the photosensitive drum rotates in the clockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Chargers <b>23</b>Y to <b>23</b>K electrify the photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y to <b>22</b>K of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K) in every station. Exposure of the photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y, <b>22</b>M, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>K are arranged such that they are sent from scanner portions <b>24</b>Y, <b>24</b>M, <b>24</b>C, and <b>24</b>K, surfaces of the photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y, <b>22</b>M, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>K are selectively exposed, thereby forming an electrostatic latent image. To visualize the electrostatic latent image, the development devices <b>26</b>Y, <b>26</b>M, <b>26</b>C, and <b>26</b>K develop yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K) in every station. The scanner portions <b>24</b>Y to <b>24</b>K, the photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y to <b>22</b>K and the development devices <b>26</b>Y to <b>26</b>K constitute an image forming portion <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A resin intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b> is in contact with the photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y, <b>22</b>M, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>K, and is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by a drive motor (not illustrated). The intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b> rotates as the photosensitive drums <b>22</b>Y, <b>22</b>M, <b>22</b>C, and <b>22</b>K rotate according to an image forming operation, bias is applied to the primary transfer rollers <b>31</b>Y, <b>31</b>M, <b>31</b>C, and <b>31</b>K, thereby transferring monotone toner images sequentially. Transfer remaining toner which remains on the photosensitive drum is collected by a photosensitive drum cleaning portion (not illustrated) provided on each photosensitive member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A sheet P which is previously prepared in a sheet feeding portion <b>21</b> is conveyed by a sheet feeding roller <b>28</b> and a registration roller <b>29</b> and then, a secondary transfer roller <b>32</b> disposed such that it abuts against the intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b> nips and conveys the sheet P. A registration sensor <b>61</b> which detects a position of the tip end of a sheet sent out from the registration roller <b>29</b> is disposed between the secondary transfer roller <b>32</b> and the registration roller <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">By applying bias to the secondary transfer roller <b>32</b>, a multicolor toner image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b> is transferred to a sheet P. The sheet P on which the multicolor toner image is formed is conveyed to a fixing unit <b>50</b> which is a fixing apparatus along the fixing inlet guide <b>62</b>, and the image is fixed. The intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b> is supported by the secondary transfer counter roller <b>33</b>, and is rotated by drive-input to the secondary transfer counter roller <b>33</b>. The secondary transfer roller <b>32</b> and the secondary transfer counter roller <b>33</b> constitute a transfer apparatus <b>34</b>. The sheet feeding portion <b>21</b>, the sheet feeding roller <b>28</b> and the registration roller constitute a sheet feeding apparatus which feeds sheets to the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The fixing unit <b>50</b> melts and fixes a transferred multicolor toner image while nipping and conveying a sheet P. The fixing unit <b>50</b> of this embodiment is inexpensive and has a small thermal capacity, and is a film fixing unit having short warming up time. The fixing unit <b>50</b> includes a fixing sleeve <b>51</b> which heats a sheet P, and a pressure roller <b>52</b> which presses a sheet against the fixing sleeve <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fixing sleeve <b>51</b> is a cylindrical (endless belt-shaped) member formed by providing a belt-shaped member with a resilient layer. More specifically, SUS is used as material thereof, a silicon rubber layer (resilient layer) having a thickness of about 300 &#x3bc;m is formed on a cylindrical endless belt (belt base material) having a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m, and a PFA resin tube (outermost surface layer) having a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m is coated thereon. The pressure roller <b>52</b> is formed in such a manner that a silicon rubber layer having a thickness of about 3 mm is formed on a stainless core metal by mold injection, and this is coated with a PFA resin tube having a thickness of about 40 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fixing unit <b>50</b> is driven by rotating the pressure roller <b>52</b>, and the fixing sleeve <b>51</b> is worn and driven by a surface of the pressure roller <b>52</b>. The pressure roller <b>52</b> is driven by rotating the core metal, but since the outer diameter of the pressure roller <b>52</b> is varied by manufacturing tolerances and thermal expansion of rubber, the surface velocity cannot maintain constantly even if the pressure roller <b>52</b> is rotated at a constant angular velocity. Further, the surface velocity of the fixing sleeve <b>51</b> which is driven by the pressure roller <b>52</b> is also varied by coefficients of friction of both the members, and surface properties and a thickness of a sheet to be used. For this reason, the conveying velocity of a sheet at the fixing portion (fixing unit <b>50</b>) has an extremely large variation element, and it is very difficult to conform this to the paper conveying velocity of the transfer portion (transfer apparatus <b>34</b>). A sheet loop generated by a difference in a paper conveying velocity between the transfer portion and the fixing portion and color deviation generated by a pulling action of a sheet become a big problem in the in-line color image forming apparatus <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Therefore, in the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> of the electrophotographic system, a mechanical sheet detector called a loop sensor is provided between the transfer portion and the fixing portion, and loop control is performed by controlling a velocity of the fixing unit <b>50</b> based on a signal detected by this detector.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, in the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> of this embodiment, the loop control of a sheet P which is performed between the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the fixing unit <b>50</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> includes a contact type loop detector <b>70</b> which detects a magnitude of a loop of a sheet P formed between the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the fixing unit <b>50</b>, and a fixing drive motor M as a fixing driving portion which rotates and drives the pressure roller <b>52</b>. The loop detector <b>70</b> brings a contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>into contact with a sheet P which is conveyed on the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> between the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the fixing unit <b>50</b>, thereby detecting the loop of the sheet P. The fixing drive motor M is a stepping motor, and the fixing drive motor M can switch the conveying velocity of a sheet P by the pressure roller <b>52</b> and the fixing sleeve <b>51</b> which follows the pressure roller <b>52</b> between a plurality of slow velocities and a plurality of fast velocities with respect to the secondary transfer roller <b>32</b> of the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> includes the controlling portion <b>40</b>. The controlling portion <b>40</b> controls projection/retraction of the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>in a loop detection flag <b>71</b> from and into the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>. That is, the controlling portion <b>40</b> of this embodiment controls a solenoid <b>80</b> such that the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is moved from a projection position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) to a retracted position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) before a tip end of a sheet P which enters the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> from the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> reaches the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a</i>. The controlling portion <b>40</b> performs control such that it switches the sheet conveying velocity of the fixing unit <b>50</b> based on a detection signal of the loop detector <b>70</b>, and the loop amount of the sheet P is maintained within a predetermined range.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described above, the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> includes the image forming portion <b>44</b>, and the intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b> which is an image bearing member bearing a toner image formed by the image forming portion <b>44</b>. In this embodiment, the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> constitutes an upstream conveying portion which conveys a sheet P while transferring a toner image born by the intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b>, i.e., which conveys a sheet P while nipping the sheet P. The fixing unit <b>50</b> constitutes a downstream conveying portion which conveys a sheet P while fixing a toner image transferred to the sheet P by the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>, i.e., which conveys a sheet P while nipping the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The solenoid <b>80</b> of the loop detector <b>70</b>, a photo sensor S and the fixing drive motor M are connected to the controlling portion <b>40</b>. The controlling portion <b>40</b> controls a sheet conveying velocity based on a detection signal of the loop detector <b>70</b>, and controls a rotation velocity of the fixing drive motor M such that a loop amount of a sheet P is maintained within a predetermined range and the sheet P is conveyed. Not limited to the above description, the controlling portion <b>40</b> may control a driving state of the secondary transfer roller <b>32</b> of the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> based on a detection signal of the loop detector <b>70</b>, thereby controlling a sheet conveying velocity, and a loop amount of a sheet P is maintained within a predetermined range and the sheet P is conveyed. In this case also, the same effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The loop detector <b>70</b> which is a loop sensor will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4A</figref> and <b>4</b>B. The loop detector <b>70</b> has a loop detection flag <b>71</b> which is provided at its tip end with a contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>and at its rear end with a flag portion <b>71</b><i>b</i>, a photo sensor S which outputs a detection signal according to variation of the flag portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>with respect to a light emitting/receiving portion <b>45</b>, and the solenoid <b>80</b>. The loop detection flag (loop sensor) <b>71</b> includes a torsion spring <b>72</b> as a biasing member which biases the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>toward the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The photo sensor S detects a motion of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> which is operated by contact with a sheet between the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the fixing unit <b>50</b>, and detects a contact state with respect to a sheet according to variation of the flag portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>when the loop detection flag <b>71</b> abuts against the sheet and rotates. The solenoid <b>80</b> constitutes a driving portion which moves the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> between a projecting position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) where the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> is brought into contact with a conveyed sheet P and a retracted position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) where the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> is not in contact with the sheet P. The torsion spring <b>72</b> moves and biases the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> toward the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>, one end of the torsion spring <b>72</b> is supported by a back surface of the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a</i>, and the other end of the torsion spring <b>72</b> is fixed to and supported by the image forming apparatus body.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The loop detection flag <b>71</b> turns in the clockwise direction and the counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> around, as a fulcrum, a shaft portion <b>71</b><i>c </i>which is rotatably supported on the of the image forming apparatus body, and the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the flag portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>are opposed to each other with the shaft portion <b>71</b><i>c </i>interposed therebetween. A turning force applying portion <b>71</b><i>d </i>is formed on the flag portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>such that the turning force applying portion <b>71</b><i>d </i>projects from an arc upper portion toward an outer diameter direction. The loop detection flag <b>71</b> is restricted by a detent member <b>41</b> supported on the of the image forming apparatus body so that the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>does not rotate beyond a home position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The solenoid <b>80</b> has a body portion <b>80</b><i>b </i>fixed to and supported by a position on the of the image forming apparatus body where an extended plunger <b>80</b><i>a </i>can push the turning force applying portion <b>71</b><i>d</i>. The contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>projects into a projecting position where a sheet P which is conveyed on the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> between the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the fixing unit <b>50</b> is brought into contact with the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>, the flag portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>is brought into contact with the sheet P and is moved, thereby allowing the photo sensor S to output a detection signal. In a state where the plunger <b>80</b><i>a </i>retracts into the body portion <b>80</b><i>b</i>, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>turns toward the fixing inlet guide <b>62</b> which defines the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> according to a spring force of the torsion spring <b>72</b> until the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is restricted by the detent member <b>41</b>, and the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>comes to the projecting position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). At that time, while the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is pushed by a back surface of a sheet P, the flag portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>which turns around the shaft portion <b>71</b><i>c </i>as a fulcrum shields light of the light emitting/receiving portion <b>45</b> of the photo sensor S, and the photo sensor S outputs an ON detection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the plunger <b>80</b><i>a </i>projects from the body portion <b>80</b><i>b</i>, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>turns in a direction separating from the fixing inlet guide <b>62</b> against a spring force of the torsion spring <b>72</b>, and comes to the retracted position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>). By turning the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>in the direction of arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> according to a loop amount of a sheet P, the loop detection flag <b>71</b> switches the light emitting/receiving portion <b>45</b> of the photo sensor S between a light transmission state (OFF) and a light shielding state (ON), thereby outputting a corresponding detection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The controlling portion <b>40</b> receives a detection signal of the photo sensor S, and while the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>pushes a sheet P, the controlling portion <b>40</b> determines that the conveying velocity of the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> is faster (pushing) than the fixing unit <b>50</b>. At that time, the controlling portion <b>40</b> controls such that a target velocity of the fixing drive motor M is changed, a driving velocity of the pressure roller <b>52</b> is slightly increased, thereby eliminating a loop. On the contrary, if the conveying velocity of the fixing unit <b>50</b> is too fast, a sheet P starts to be pulled, and the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is not in contact with the sheet P. At that time, the controlling portion <b>40</b> determines that the fixing unit <b>50</b> starts to pull the sheet P, and controls such that the driving velocity of the pressure roller <b>52</b> is slightly lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">By carrying out such a routine sequentially, a sheet P is conveyed while keeping the loop amount within the predetermined range, and an excessive pulled state of a loop of the sheet P is eliminated. However, when such a system is used, it is necessary that a sheet P pushes up the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>and operates at the instant when the sheet enters the fixing inlet guide <b>62</b>. Therefore, there is an adverse possibility that a sheet tip end collides against the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the conveying operation is hindered. For example, when a thin paper sheet having a basis weight of 60 g/m2 is conveyed, since elasticity of the sheet is weak, the sheet tip end collides against the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a</i>, a conveying track is hindered, and a generation ratio of a paper jam and a wrinkle is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To solve this problem, in this embodiment, collision between the sheet tip end and the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is avoided between the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the fixing unit <b>50</b> so that conveyance of a sheet is not hindered, a loop is appropriately controlled, and generation of image failure is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">More specifically, before a sheet tip end enters a position of the loop detection flag (loop sensor) <b>71</b>, the turning force applying portion <b>71</b><i>d </i>is pushed in by the plunger <b>80</b><i>a</i>, thereby turning the loop detection flag <b>71</b>. According to this configuration, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is retracted from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Then, after the sheet tip end passes through the position of the loop detection flag <b>71</b>, the plunger <b>80</b><i>a </i>of the solenoid <b>80</b> is moved backward, and the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is pushed against a back surface of the sheet. After that, detection of a loop amount and loop control are started by the above-described method.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates timing at which the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is retracted from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates that when a sheet tip end position is in a range shown with arrows, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is retracted from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>. In this embodiment, when the position of the sheet tip end reaches the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is retracted from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>. When the sheet tip end position passes through the position of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> (loop sensor position), the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is projected into the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> and comes into contact with the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The timing when the sheet tip end reaches the position of the transfer apparatus (transfer portion) and the position of the loop detection flag (loop sensor) <b>71</b> is detected by the registration sensor <b>61</b> disposed between the registration roller <b>29</b> and the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>. That is, time elapsed until the sheet tip end reaches the respective positions after the sheet tip end passes through the position of the registration sensor is found from a distance from the registration sensor <b>61</b> to the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the loop detection flag <b>71</b>, and from the sheet conveying velocity which is set in the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b>. Therefore, after the registration sensor <b>61</b> detects the sheet tip end, if the solenoid <b>80</b> is operated when given time is elapsed, a desired operation can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>retracted from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> is made to project into the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> before the sheet tip end enters the fixing unit <b>50</b>, and comes into contact with the back surface of the sheet. That is, when a sheet which enters the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> passes through the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>at the retracted position under control of the solenoid <b>80</b>, if there is no subsequent sheet, the controlling portion <b>40</b> moves the contact portion to the projecting position before the tip end of the sheet which has passed through the contact portion reaches the fixing unit <b>50</b>. According to this configuration, the &#x201c;attitude&#x201d; of the sheet can previously be detected before the sheet P enters the fixing unit <b>50</b>. That is, before the sheet tip end enters the fixing unit <b>50</b>, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>comes into contact with the sheet, thereby detecting the attitude of the sheet before it enters the fixing unit <b>50</b>, and appropriate loop control can be performed immediately after the sheet enters according to the attitude. According to this, slack or tension of the sheet can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates this state. That is, the entering attitude of a sheet P is restricted by the fixing inlet guide <b>62</b> in some degree, but the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> has flexibility, and a track becomes straight like a sheet Pa in some cases, or the track swells and sags like a sheet Pb in some cases. If a sheet P enters the fixing unit <b>50</b> with such attitude, the sheet P is slightly pulled or slightly sags due to a velocity difference between the fixing unit <b>50</b> and the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> until the appropriate loop control starts immediately after the sheet P enters the fixing unit <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">However, if the attitude of the sheet P when it enters the fixing unit <b>50</b> is previously known, it is possible to prevent this phenomenon. For example, the photo sensor S is in the light transmission state (OFF) when the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is made to project into the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>, the controlling portion <b>40</b> determines that the track is straight like the sheet Pa. The rotation velocity of the pressure roller <b>52</b> is previously lowered to prevent that the fixing unit <b>50</b> excessively pulls the sheet when the sheet enters. On the contrary, if the photo sensor S is in the light shielding state (ON), the controlling portion <b>40</b> determines that the track slightly sags like the sheet Pb, the rotation velocity of the pressure roller <b>52</b> is previously increased, and controls such that the sag of the sheet is eliminated after the sheet enters.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A result of check of a harmful influence of an image when this embodiment is used and when a comparative example is used is shown below. In the comparative example, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is not retracted when a sheet enters. Sheets of paper having three kinds of basis weights are prepared, 1000 sheets of each kind are fed, and generation ratios of a paper wrinkle and paper jam generated near the loop detection flag <b>71</b> are compared. Table 1 shows generation ratios of a paper wrinkle and paper jam at the position of the loop detection flag <b>71</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">From the result shown in Table 1, in the comparative example, as the basis weight of sheets were reduced in the order of 75 g/m2, 60 g/m2 and 52 g/m2, and the generation ratio of a paper wrinkle and paper jam at the position of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> was increased. In the embodiment, however, sheets of paper having a small basis weight (basis weight of 60 g/m2 or less), it can be found that generation of a paper wrinkle and paper jam can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this embodiment, the registration sensor <b>61</b> detects the timing of retracting the loop detection flag <b>71</b> from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>. However, if the timing when a position of the sheet tip end reaches a position of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> can be detected, it is also possible to use a sensor other than the registration sensor <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The loop detector <b>70</b> provided on the sheet conveying path is utilized and in addition to this, transfer current flowing through the secondary transfer roller <b>32</b> is monitored when a sheet enters the secondary transfer portion (transfer apparatus <b>34</b>). It is possible to perform control such that the sheet reaching timing is detected based on variation in the transfer current, and the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted using this timing as a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this embodiment, the timing of retracting the loop detection flag <b>71</b> from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> is set to the timing when a sheet tip end reaches the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>. However, it is also possible to perform control such that the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is retracted only before and after the sheet tip end passes through the position of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this case also, the same effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">[Second Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A configuration and an image forming operation of an image forming apparatus of the second embodiment are the same as those of the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> of the first embodiment. Members having the same functions as those of the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> described in the first embodiment are designated with the same symbols, and description thereof will not be repeated. Portions of the image forming apparatus which are different from those of the color image forming apparatus <b>42</b> described in the first embodiment will be described mainly.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When sheets are continuously fed, i.e., when a precedent sheet P<b>1</b> which has entered the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> passes through the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>in the retracted position, if there is a subsequent sheet P<b>2</b> which enters the sheet conveying path <b>60</b>, the controlling portion <b>40</b> of this embodiment carries out the following control. That is, the controlling portion <b>40</b> controls the solenoid <b>80</b> such that before a tip end of the precedent sheet P<b>1</b> which has passed the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>reaches the fixing unit <b>50</b>, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is moved to the projecting position. Further, the controlling portion <b>40</b> controls the solenoid <b>80</b> such that before a tip end of the subsequent sheet P<b>2</b> reaches the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a</i>, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is moved from the projecting position to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">That is, when sheets are continuously fed, in the feeding operation of second and subsequent sheets, the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted when the loop control of a sheet which has been just fed is completed. More specifically, the contact portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is retracted when a rear end of the precedent sheet P<b>1</b> passes through the loop detection flag <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates this state. In the first embodiment, timing when the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted is only time T<b>1</b> which is elapsed until a sheet tip end passes through the position of the loop detection flag <b>71</b> after the sheet tip end passes through the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>. The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that time T<b>2</b> which is elapsed until a tip end of a sheet P<b>2</b> reaches the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> after a rear end of a precedent sheet P<b>1</b> which was just fed passes through the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> is added to the time T<b>1</b>. In the feeding operation of the first sheet, the loop detection flag <b>71</b> may be retracted from any timing only if this timing is before a sheet reaches.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to this configuration, the loop detection flag <b>71</b> can be retracted well in advance even when a conveying velocity of a sheet is fast or a distance from the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> to the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is short, and it is possible to reliably control a loop.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Since the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted when a rear end of a sheet passes through the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>, generation of a paper wrinkle can be prevented. The paper wrinkle is generated when the sheet passes through the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>, and the paper wrinkle is prone to be generated at a rear end as compared with the sheet tip end. This is because that the sheet is excessively heated by the fixing unit <b>50</b> and heat shrunk, a kink generated by the shrink grows and becomes a paper wrinkle. At that time, if the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is in contact with the sheet, the contact portion is pushed, kinks gather, and generation or growth of paper wrinkle is promoted in some cases. Since the loop control is not required after the rear end of the sheet passes through the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>, if the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted from the sheet conveying path <b>60</b> at this timing, it is possible to avoid a case where kinks of the sheet gather at one location and grow and become the paper wrinkle.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A result of check of a harmful influence of an image when this embodiment is used and when a comparative example is used is shown below. In a first comparative example, the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is not retracted at both a tip end and a rear end of a sheet. In a second comparative example, the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted only at the sheet tip end. Like the Table 1, sheets of paper having three kinds of basis weights of 75 g/m2, 60 g/m2 and 52 g/m2 are prepared, 1000 sheets of each kinds are fed, and generation ratios of paper wrinkle and paper jam generated at rear ends of the sheets are compared. If a sheet includes much moisture, its elasticity becomes weak, and a kink is prone to be generated, so that the generation ratio of paper wrinkle is increased. Therefore, this experiment was carried out under environment of high temperature and high humidity of 30&#xb0; C. and 80%. Table 2 shows the generation ratio of paper wrinkle at a position of a rear end of a sheet.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">From a result shown in Table 2, it is found that in the first comparative example, as the basis weight of sheets becomes smaller, the generation ratio of paper wrinkle is increased at the position of the rear end of the sheet, but in the embodiment, since the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted at the rear end of the sheet, the generation ratio of paper wrinkle at the rear end of the sheet is reduced. In the second comparative example, in a thin paper sheet having a basis weight of 52 g/m2, paper wrinkle of &#x394; (*) level was generated, but in the embodiment, since the loop detection flag <b>71</b> is retracted at the rear end of the sheet, generation of paper wrinkle of this level could be suppressed. However, (*) in the second comparative example shows that the level of generated paper wrinkle was extremely low as compared with the first comparative example, and the paper wrinkle was sufficiently permissible.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The loop control of sheets between the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> and the fixing unit <b>50</b> is described in the first and second embodiments, but the invention is not limited to this, and the loop control between the registration roller <b>29</b> and the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> can also be applied in the same manner. In this case, the upstream conveying portion is constituted by the registration roller <b>29</b> as a conveying apparatus which conveys a sheet P fed from the sheet feeding apparatus to the transfer apparatus <b>34</b>. The downstream conveying portion is constituted by the transfer apparatus <b>34</b> which conveys a toner image born by the intermediate transfer belt <b>30</b> while transferring the toner image to the sheet P conveyed by the registration roller <b>29</b>.
