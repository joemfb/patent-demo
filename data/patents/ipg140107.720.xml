<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/420,687 entitled &#x201c;Tamper Indicating Padlock&#x201d; filed May 26, 2006, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/685,212 filed May 27, 2005 entitled &#x201c;Tamper Indicating Padlock Design,&#x201d; the entire content of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to locking devices for items to be secured, and more particularly, to padlocks with an indicator for tampering and/or unauthorized opening and two locking units that function independently.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to combination-operated padlocks of the type typically used to secure luggage during travel and transport. While traveling, luggage is out of the possession and control of the owner for long periods of time. For example, after being checked at an airline counter or at airport curbside and before being claimed at baggage claim, while in the possession of porters at a hotel, or even when sitting in a hotel room after check-in. During every one of these periods, the luggage is susceptible to unauthorized search and theft of its contents. In addition, when the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) took over the handling of airport security in accordance with the Homeland Security Act, the need arose for TSA agents to have a means of opening locked luggage without destruction of luggage padlocks used by the luggage owner to safeguard the contents. This need has resulted in the manufacture, sale and use of padlocks with dual opening mechanisms, namely, a combination mechanism for use by the luggage owner and a key mechanism for use by TSA agents with a specially designed key. Specifically, to accommodate the need of travelers for post-inspection luggage security while also accommodating the need of government employees to quickly and easily open and inspect selected and/or suspect bags, padlocks may be purchased by travelers for locking their luggage while allowing government personnel the ability to nondestructively open the locks. More particularly, if a traveler's locked bag is inspected by TSA personnel, the padlock can be opened for baggage inspection using over-ride keys that are purportedly made available only to government inspectors, and then the bag will be relocked by the inspectors to secure that bag while the bag is in transit. Unfortunately, it is now reported that TSA agents are stealing contents of luggage. It is also quite likely that the keys used by TSA agents will find their way into the possession of persons who will use the key to steal the contents of luggage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a lock that provides an indicator that the key lock portion of the padlock has been tampered with, such as by advising the bag owner that an elongate object, including a key, bobbie pin or pick, has been inserted into the keyhole and/or used to attempt to open the lock. In addition, there is a need for a travel lock that provides an indicator of tampering, regardless of whether the shackle of the padlock has been unlocked, or regardless of whether the inserted elongate object, which may or may not be a key, has been turned. Furthermore, there is a need for a travel lock to provide the convenience of having the indicator reset that does not require that the shackle to be released or unlocked to reset the indicator.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">These and other needs are addressed by the various embodiments and configurations of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention provides a duel locking device that preferably comprises both a combination lock and key lock. The device has application as a luggage lock and includes an indicator that indicates whether the lock has been tampered with by the insertion of an object into the keyhole. Preferably, one or more mechanisms are provided to reset the indicator after it has been activated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a padlock for securing an article is provided that has an indicator that warns the owner/user of the lock that the key way of the lock has had an item inserted into it. The item may be an authorized key used by a TSA field agent to open the lock for purposes of inspecting the content of a piece of luggage or the item may be an unauthorized object used in an attempt to open the lock without permission of the owner/user. Thus, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, a padlock is provided comprising a housing and a key lock, wherein at least a portion of the key lock is located within the housing. The padlock also preferably includes a combination lock, wherein at least a portion of the combination lock is also located within the housing. In addition, the padlock includes a shackle for engaging at least a portion of the article, the shackle at least partially contained within the housing and rotatable upon unlocking at least one of the key lock and the combination lock. Furthermore, the padlock includes an indicator having at least first and second positions, and wherein the indicator moves from the first position to the second position upon insertion of an object longitudinally into the key hole or key way of the key lock. In one embodiment, the indicator extends from a non-visible position within the housing to a visible position at least partially exterior of the housing when in the second position. Accordingly, if the indicator is triggered, the owner/user of the lock is warned, at a minimum, that someone has attempted to open the lock or has successfully opened the lock. In either case, the owner/user is advised to promptly check the contents of the luggage for missing objects.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide a mechanism for resetting the indicator without necessarily having to unlock or rotate the shackle. Thus, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, a padlock is provided comprising a housing and a key lock, wherein at least a portion of the key lock is located within the housing. In addition, the padlock includes a combination lock, wherein at least a portion of the combination lock is also located within the housing. A shackle is also provided for engaging at least a portion of the article, the shackle at least partially contained within the housing and rotatable upon unlocking at least one of the key lock and the combination lock. In addition, the padlock includes an indicator having at least first and second positions, wherein the indicator moves from the first position to the second position upon insertion of an object longitudinally into the key hole or key way of the key lock and without turning the inserted object, or releasing the shackle or opening the lock. Finally, the padlock includes a reset mechanism operably interconnected to the indicator for moving the indicator from the second position back to the first position without moving the shackle or without unlocking the lock. In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, the reset mechanism comprises an aperture in the housing and a reset mechanism within the housing. In addition, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, the reset mechanism comprises an extended portion of a brake bolt that holds the indicator in its second position and releases the indicator back to its first position upon activating the reset mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide alternate structure for the different components of a travel padlock. Thus, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a travel padlock for securing an article is provided, the travel padlock comprising a means for containing defining a chamber therein, and a means for engaging an article, the means for engaging located partially within the chamber. The travel padlock further comprises first and second means for locking located within at least a portion of the chamber, wherein both the first and second means for locking are operative to lock and unlock the means for engaging, and wherein at least one of the first and second means for locking comprises a means for receiving. In addition, the travel padlock includes a means for signaling operatively associated with the means for receiving, wherein the means for signaling has a first position and a second position and is moveable between the first and second positions. The means for signaling may extend at least partially exterior of the means for containing when in the second position, and the means for signaling is moveable from the first position to the second position upon insertion of an object into the means for receiving.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is yet a further aspect of the present invention to provide a method of making a padlock, wherein the padlock at least includes an indicator to signal that an object has been inserted into the key way or key hole of the padlock.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also yet another aspect of the present invention to provide a method of using a padlock, wherein the method includes signaling that an object has been inserted into the key way or key hole of the padlock. The method also may comprise providing a method of resetting the indicator from a signaling position to a non-signaling position.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the following disclosure describes the invention in connection with those embodiments presented, one should understand that the invention is not strictly limited to these embodiments. Furthermore, one should understand that the drawings are not necessarily to scale, and that in certain instances, the disclosure may not include details which are not necessary for an understanding of the present invention, such as conventional details of fabrication and assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention comprises a padlock that includes a means for detecting whether an object has been inserted into the key hole or key way of the padlock. For example, when traveling, luggage is often out of the possession and control of the owner. The insertion of an object into the key hole of the travel padlock, for example when someone attempts to pick the key lock, activates a warning indicator within the key lock mechanism in a manner visible to the owner or user. As a result, when the owner retrieves his or her luggage, the owner is able to observe the indicator that remains observable until such time as the owner resets the indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1A</figref>, and in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, a travel padlock <b>10</b> is provided that includes a shackle <b>14</b> for engaging an item to be secured. The travel padlock <b>10</b> includes a body or housing <b>18</b>, that may comprise a plurality of sections, such as a first housing member <b>18</b><i>a </i>and a second housing member <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The travel padlock <b>10</b> also preferably includes a plurality of locking mechanisms, such as a combination lock <b>22</b>, and as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a key lock <b>26</b>, wherein the two locking units <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> can both be used independently to lock and unlock the travel padlock <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the travel padlock <b>10</b> includes an indicator <b>30</b> for indicating whether an attempt was made at opening the travel padlock <b>10</b> by inserting an object O into the key lock <b>26</b>. More particularly, and as discussed in more detail below, an upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> extends from the housing <b>18</b> when a key K or other appropriately sized object O is inserted into the key hole <b>38</b> of the key lock <b>26</b>. The key K or object O do not have to be rotated to trigger the indicator <b>30</b>, nor does the lock have to be open or the shackle released.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an activation member <b>42</b> resides within a cylinder <b>46</b> of the key lock <b>26</b>. The activation member <b>42</b> includes a bottom surface <b>50</b>, a lateral projection <b>54</b>, and a biasing member, such as a compression spring <b>58</b>, located on an upper portion <b>62</b> of the activation member <b>42</b>. When a key K or object O is inserted into the key hole <b>38</b> of the key lock <b>26</b>, the distal end D of the key K or object O impinges on the bottom surface <b>50</b> of the activation member <b>42</b>. As the key K or object O is pushed longitudinally within the key way <b>38</b> of cylinder <b>46</b> of the key lock <b>26</b>, the activation member <b>42</b> also moves longitudinally upward (relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and in so doing, the lateral projection <b>54</b> of the activation member <b>42</b> pushes a distal end <b>66</b> of a lateral offset <b>70</b> of the indicator <b>30</b>, thereby also advancing the upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> in an upward longitudinal direction such that at least a portion of the upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> projects through an opening <b>72</b> in the housing <b>18</b> and above a top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b>. The upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> preferably includes coloring, visual aspects, or other means for contrasting with the housing <b>18</b>, shackle <b>14</b>, and shackle cup <b>78</b> at the top of the cylinder <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, as the indicator <b>30</b> is pushed longitudinally upward from its first or lower position to its second or upper position, a sloped projection <b>82</b> on the side of the lateral offset <b>70</b> slides past a sloped catch <b>86</b> of a transversely oriented brake bolt <b>90</b>. As the sloped projection <b>82</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> moves upward, it laterally displaces the brake bolt <b>90</b> until the sloped projection <b>82</b> longitudinally passes the sloped catch <b>86</b>, at which point the brake bolt <b>90</b> moves back toward the lateral offset <b>70</b> under a force exerted by a biasing member, such as compression spring <b>94</b>, that was compressed as the brake bolt <b>90</b> was initially displaced laterally. The compression spring <b>94</b> preferably includes a first end <b>98</b> acting on a flange <b>102</b> of the brake bolt <b>90</b>, and a second end <b>106</b> acting against an internal flange <b>110</b> of the housing member <b>18</b><i>b</i>. When the brake bolt <b>90</b> moves back to its first position, the indicator <b>30</b> is resettably secured in its second or upper position corresponding to indicating that a key K or object O has been inserted into the key way <b>38</b> of the key lock <b>26</b>. In addition, as the indicator <b>30</b> is moved to its second position, a biasing member, such as compression spring <b>114</b> of the indicator <b>30</b>, is compressed. The compression spring <b>114</b> preferably includes a first end <b>118</b> acting on a top surface <b>122</b> of the lateral offset <b>70</b>, and a second end <b>126</b> acting against an internal flange <b>130</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of the underside of top surface <b>74</b> of the housing member <b>18</b><i>b</i>. A means for interconnecting the biasing members to the various applicable structures of the travel padlock may be used. For example, a post <b>124</b> may be used at the bottom of compression spring <b>114</b> to position the spring <b>114</b> onto surface <b>122</b> of the lateral offset <b>70</b>. Upon removing the key K or object O from the key lock <b>26</b>, the activation member <b>42</b> returns to its initial position because of compression spring <b>58</b> located at the top surface <b>62</b> of the activation member <b>42</b>. The compression spring <b>58</b> of the activation member <b>42</b> preferably includes a first end <b>134</b> acting on the top surface <b>62</b> of the activation member <b>42</b>, and a second end <b>138</b> acting on an interior surface <b>142</b> of the cylinder <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The key lock <b>26</b> may be opened using a properly configured key K, such as an authorized over-ride key made available to TSA employees. The key lock <b>26</b> has a locked position and an unlocked position. The key lock <b>26</b> includes the shackle cup <b>78</b> situated at the top of the cylinder <b>46</b>. When the travel padlock <b>10</b> is locked, an end <b>146</b> of a first leg or short shackle leg <b>150</b> of the shackle <b>14</b> resides within the shackle cup <b>78</b>. When an authorized key K is inserted into the key way and rotated to unlock the key lock <b>26</b>, the cylinder <b>46</b> is also rotated and may be moved axially or in a longitudinal downward direction (relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). When the cylinder <b>46</b> is lowered to its downward unlocked position, the shackle cup <b>78</b> is also lowered, thereby allowing the shackle <b>14</b> to be rotated. More particularly, the end <b>146</b> of the short shackle leg <b>150</b> is no longer located within the shackle cup <b>78</b> but is located above the top of the lowered shackle cup <b>78</b>, thereby allowing the shackle <b>14</b> to be rotated about its second leg or long shackle leg <b>154</b>, and the travel padlock <b>10</b> is then able to be opened. Thus, the short shackle leg <b>150</b> is disposed opposite the long shackle leg <b>154</b>. In the locked position, the end <b>146</b> of the short shackle leg <b>150</b> is disposed within the shackle cup <b>78</b> of the key lock <b>26</b> such that the shackle <b>14</b> may not be rotated about its long shackle leg <b>154</b>, and therefore, the short shackle leg <b>150</b> remains longitudinally aligned with both the cylinder <b>46</b> and the indicator <b>30</b>. The shackle <b>14</b> may be rotated about its long shackle leg <b>154</b> when the padlock <b>10</b> has been unlocked using a key K. That is, the short shackle leg <b>150</b> is able to be rotated out of longitudinal alignment with both the cylinder <b>46</b> and the indicator <b>30</b>. When unlocked, preferably, the short shackle leg <b>150</b> may be rotated in either direction away from the shackle cup <b>78</b> because the upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> includes oppositely positioned recesses or cut-outs <b>158</b>. Alternatively, a single recess <b>158</b> may be provided for allowing the shackle <b>14</b> to rotate in only one direction. Whether one or two recesses <b>158</b> are used, the recesses <b>158</b> also provide a texture or tactile uniqueness that allow a visually impaired user to feel the upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> in its upward position using their finger tips. That is, preferably the upper end position <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> includes not only a visual indicator, but also a tactile feature perceptible to a person's touch.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the combination lock <b>22</b> may also be used to lock and unlock the travel padlock <b>10</b>. In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, the combination lock <b>22</b> includes one or more dial wheels <b>162</b> that are used to provide the combination to the combination lock <b>22</b>. When the combination lock <b>22</b> is locked, the shackle <b>14</b> is prevented from longitudinal or axial movement. When the combination lock <b>22</b> is unlocked, the shackle <b>14</b> is allowed to move axially in an upward longitudinal direction relative to the top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b>. This axial motion of the shackle <b>14</b> allows the end <b>146</b> of the short shackle leg <b>150</b> to clear the top of the shackle cup <b>78</b> of cylinder <b>46</b> when cylinder <b>46</b> and shackle cup <b>78</b> of the key lock <b>26</b> are in their upper position above the top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7B</figref>, and in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, the combination lock <b>22</b> also provides a first means for resetting the indicator <b>30</b> from its second or upper position back to its first or lower position. More particularly, as noted above, upon unlocking the combination lock <b>22</b>, the shackle <b>14</b> can be moved axially to disengage the end <b>146</b> of the short shackle leg <b>150</b> of the shackle <b>14</b> from the shackle cup <b>78</b>. The upper longitudinal position of the shackle <b>14</b> also places a reset lug <b>166</b> that is located on the long shackle leg <b>154</b> of the shackle <b>14</b> into alignment with a reset projection <b>170</b> located on the brake bolt <b>90</b>. More particularly, the reset projection <b>170</b> of the brake bolt <b>90</b> is situated proximate the long shackle leg <b>154</b> of the shackle <b>14</b> such that when the shackle <b>14</b> is in its upper longitudinal position, the reset lug <b>166</b> can be rotated to contact the reset projection <b>170</b> of the brake bolt <b>90</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the reset projection <b>170</b> includes a sloped surface <b>174</b> and a reset surface <b>178</b>. When the shackle <b>14</b> is rotated sufficiently in the direction of arrow A<sub>1 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>A, the reset lug <b>166</b> impinges on the reset surface <b>178</b>, thereby causing the brake bolt <b>90</b> to be pushed substantially perpendicular to, and laterally in a direction away from, a longitudinal axis L<sub>k1</sub>-L<sub>k1 </sub>of the key lock <b>26</b>, and toward a longitudinal axis L<sub>c1</sub>-L<sub>c1 </sub>of the combination lock <b>22</b>. This action moves the sloped catch <b>86</b> of the brake bolt <b>90</b> away from sloped projection <b>82</b> of the indicator <b>30</b>. After the sloped catch <b>86</b> clears the sloped projection <b>82</b>, the indicator <b>30</b> is thrust longitudinally downward from its upper or second position to its lower or first position because of compression spring <b>114</b> that was previously compressed when the indicator <b>30</b> was moved upward by insertion of the key K or object O into the key lock <b>26</b>. In addition, the brake bolt <b>90</b> returns to its first position after shackle <b>14</b> resets the indicator <b>30</b> because of compression energy stored in compression spring <b>94</b> that was compressed as the shackle <b>14</b> was rotated when the reset lug <b>166</b> moved the brake bolt <b>90</b> by contacting the reset projection <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, the sloped surface <b>174</b> of the reset projection <b>170</b> improves the product life and performance of the travel padlock <b>10</b>, because if the shackle <b>14</b> is mistakenly rotated in a direction opposite direction arrow A<sub>1</sub>, that is, in direction A<sub>2</sub>, the reset lug <b>166</b> simply slips off of the reset projection <b>170</b> without forcing the break bolt <b>90</b> toward the longitudinal axis L<sub>k1</sub>-L<sub>k1 </sub>of the key lock <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B and <b>8</b>-<b>10</b>, and in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, a second means for resetting the indicator <b>30</b> is provided, wherein this second means for resetting the indicator <b>30</b> can be performed without opening the lock or rotating the shackle. The housing <b>18</b> may further comprise an aperture <b>182</b> leading to a reset mechanism <b>186</b> of the brake bolt <b>90</b>. In at least one embodiment of the present invention, the reset mechanism <b>186</b> comprises a lateral extension <b>188</b> of the brake bolt <b>90</b>, wherein the reset mechanism <b>186</b> has an exterior surface <b>190</b> that is preferably coplanar with or recessed relative to an outer surface <b>194</b> of the housing <b>18</b> adjacent the aperture <b>182</b>. The reset mechanism <b>186</b> allows an item, such as a pin P, to be inserted into the aperture <b>182</b> to contact the exterior surface <b>190</b> of the reset mechanism <b>186</b> and laterally push the brake bolt <b>90</b> in a direction oriented substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis L<sub>k1</sub>-L<sub>k1 </sub>of the key lock <b>26</b> toward the longitudinal axis L<sub>c1</sub>-L<sub>c1 </sub>of the combination lock <b>22</b>. The inclusion of optional bumpers <b>198</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) assist in protecting the reset mechanism <b>186</b> from being inadvertently depressed. As per the description provided above for resetting the indicator <b>30</b> by rotating the shackle <b>14</b> after unlocking the combination lock <b>22</b>, with sufficient lateral movement of the brake bolt <b>90</b> by pushing in the exterior surface <b>190</b> of the reset mechanism <b>186</b>, the indicator <b>30</b> can be reset from its upper or second position to its lower or first position. Thus, the indicator <b>30</b> can be reset either by opening the combination lock <b>22</b> and sufficiently rotating the shackle <b>14</b> in the direction A<sub>1</sub>, or by depressing the reset mechanism <b>186</b> within aperture <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to above-described figures as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11D</figref>, the padlock <b>10</b> provides a simple way for the owner of the lock to monitor whether someone has attempted to access their luggage. Accordingly, in use, the owner loops the shackle <b>14</b> of the lock <b>10</b> through an article to be secured, such as two opposing zipper pulls of a piece of luggage. After axially aligning the short shackle leg <b>150</b> with the shackle cup <b>78</b> and longitudinally moving the end <b>146</b> of the short shackle leg into the shackle cup <b>78</b>, the dial wheels <b>162</b> of the combination lock <b>22</b> are then rotated to lock the padlock <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, at this time, the indicator <b>30</b> is recessed within the housing <b>18</b> and is not visible, the shackle cup <b>78</b> of the key lock <b>26</b> protrudes from the top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b>, and an end <b>146</b> the short shackle leg <b>150</b> is disposed within and laterally retrained by the shackle cup <b>78</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, if a TSA inspector uses an over-ride key K to unlock the padlock <b>10</b>, the distal end D of the key K impinges on the bottom surface <b>50</b> of the activation member <b>42</b>. That is, the key K is axially directed into the key hole <b>38</b> and engages activation member <b>42</b> that is located within cylinder <b>46</b>. As described above, the activation member <b>42</b> is longitudinally movable within the cylinder <b>46</b> and is engageable with the lateral offset <b>70</b> of the indicator <b>30</b>. Continued longitudinal movement of the key K within the cylinder <b>46</b> advances activation member <b>42</b>, and with sufficient movement, the brake bolt <b>90</b> is moved laterally and the indicator <b>30</b> is triggered. When the indicator <b>30</b> is triggered, its upper end portion <b>34</b> extends beyond the top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b> such that the upper end portion <b>34</b> is exposed and visible, and is disposed about the shackle cup <b>78</b>. Thus, with insertion and advancement of a key K within the cylinder <b>46</b>, the indicator <b>30</b> moves upward such that the upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator is visible. The triggering of the indicator occurs before the key is turned or the lock is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, to open the lock using a key K, the key must be turned relative to housing <b>18</b>. With the key K in its turned position, the key is pulled or moved longitudinally downward. This action axially retracts the cylinder <b>46</b> within the housing <b>18</b> such that a lower end <b>40</b> of the cylinder <b>46</b> extends beyond a bottom surface <b>76</b> of the housing <b>18</b>. Accordingly, when the cylinder <b>46</b> retracts, the shackle cup <b>78</b> also moves longitudinally downward relative to the top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b> such that a top of the shackle cup <b>78</b> is substantially coplanar or below the top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b>. With the cylinder <b>46</b> and the shackle cup <b>78</b> in their retracted positions, the short shackle leg <b>150</b> is able to rotate out of axial alignment with the cylinder <b>46</b>, and therefore, end <b>146</b> of the short shackle leg <b>150</b> can pass through recess <b>158</b> (not shown in FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D because of view) in the upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> to rotate clear of the exposed portion of the indicator <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, after the TSA inspector is finished, the TSA inspector relocks the padlock <b>10</b> by realigning the short shackle leg <b>150</b> with the cylinder <b>46</b> and longitudinally moving the key K and cylinder <b>46</b> upward, then turning the key so that the key can then be withdrawn from the cylinder <b>46</b>. After withdrawing the key K from the cylinder <b>46</b>, the upper end portion <b>34</b> of the indicator <b>30</b> remains visible until such time as the indicator <b>30</b> is reset. Of course, if a key is not used but instead another appropriately-sized object O is inserted sufficiently into the cylinder <b>46</b>, the object O will engage the activation member <b>42</b>, thereby triggering the indicator <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The owner can reset the indicator <b>30</b> by unlocking the padlock <b>10</b> using the combination lock <b>22</b>. In resetting the indicator <b>30</b> using the combination lock <b>22</b>, the owner first rotates the dials wheels <b>162</b> to their proper combination and then longitudinally pulls the shackle <b>14</b> upward in a direction away from the top surface <b>74</b> of the housing <b>18</b>. By doing so, the end <b>146</b> of the short shackle leg <b>150</b> clears the shackle cup <b>78</b> so that the short shackle leg <b>150</b> can rotate out of alignment with the cylinder <b>46</b>. By sufficiently rotating the extended shackle <b>14</b> in the direction of arrow A<sub>1 </sub>about the long shackle leg <b>154</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7A</figref>, the reset lug <b>166</b> of rotating shackle <b>14</b> laterally pushes the brake bolt <b>90</b> so that the indicator <b>30</b> longitudinally retracts within the housing <b>18</b>.
