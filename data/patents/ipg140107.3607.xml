<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0038474, filed on Apr. 25, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to semiconductor design technology, and more particularly, to an input circuit for inputting signals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As an operating frequency of a chip including integrated circuits increases, an inter-chip interface scheme is being developed for high bandwidth and low power consumption thereof. Examples of general interface scheme include an interface scheme using AC Coupled Interconnection (ACCI) for high bandwidth and low power consumption and an interface scheme using a Current Mode Logic (CML)-type driver for high-speed operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an interface scheme using AC Coupled Interconnection (ACCI).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an ACCI (AC Coupled Interconnection)-based interface scheme means a capacitive coupled input/output (I/O) circuit having a capacitor connected to a channel. In particular, a transmitter (TX) uses a voltage mode driver for power saving, and an output stage of the transmitter (TX) includes an impedance matching resistor for removing the influence of signal reflection. The ACCI-based interface scheme has band-pass characteristics of filtering off a DC component and passing an AC component and has a function of converting a Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) signal into a Return to Zero (RZ) signal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an interface scheme using a Current Mode Logic (CML)-type driver.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as compared to an ACCI (AC Coupled Interconnection)-based interface scheme, an interface scheme using a Current Mode Logic (CML)-type driver may provide a high-speed operation due to the CML-type driver.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the interface scheme using a CML-type driver has the following features.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The interface scheme using a CML-type driver has the features of duty cycle amplification causing the duty ratio of differential input signals (IN+, IN&#x2212;) to be distorted while passing a channel, and it may be susceptible to a common mode noise. Here, the common mode noise means the phenomenon that a common mode voltage level of a differential signal swings and fails to maintain a target level.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, the interface scheme using a CML-type driver has the features of generating constant power consumption along a current path (P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>) when a differential signal is transmitted through a channel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An embodiment of the present invention is directed to an integrated circuit (IC) that is capable of providing stable operations against a common mode noise while minimizing a distortion of a duty ratio of a differential input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention are directed to an IC that is capable of minimizing undesirable power consumption while providing a high-speed operation.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an integrated circuit includes an input unit configured to input first Return to Zero (RZ)-type differential signals in response to a voltage level detection signal, a voltage level detecting unit configured to detect a voltage level of second RZ-type differential signals outputted from the input unit and output the voltage level detection signal, and a first signal converting unit configured to output first Non-Return to Zero (NRZ)-type differentials signal corresponding to the second RZ-type differential signals.</p>

However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the semiconductor IC <b>100</b> may also be applicable to any circuit that receives data, command, and address signals.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, when the first RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>1</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>1</b> are inputted into the bias generating unit <b>122</b>, the bias generating unit <b>122</b> adds a bias voltage VDD-&#x394;V of a predetermined DC level to a common mode voltage of the first RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>1</b> to output the RZ-type differential bias signals RZ_BIAS_DATA and /RZ_BIAS_DATA having the bias voltage VDD-&#x394;V as a common mode voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, when the RZ-type differential bias signals RZ_BIAS_DATA and /RZ_BIAS_DATA are inputted into the differential amplifying unit <b>124</b>, the differential amplifying unit <b>124</b> amplifies the RZ-type differential bias signals RZ_BIAS_DATA and /RZ_BIAS_DATA and outputs the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The voltage level detecting unit <b>130</b> samples a voltage level of the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and feeds back the sampling result as the voltage level detection signal VOL_LEV_DET to the differential amplifying unit <b>124</b>. That is, when the common mode voltage level of the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b> swings, the voltage level detecting unit <b>130</b> compensates for this. For example, when the common mode voltage level of the RZ-type differential bias signals RZ_BIAS_DATA and /RZ_BIAS_DATA becomes higher than the bias voltage VDD-&#x394;V, the common mode voltage level of the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b> becomes lower. In this case, since the voltage level detecting unit <b>130</b> detects this (i.e., a PMOS transistor of the sampling unit <b>132</b> is turned on) and outputs the voltage level detection signal VOL_LEV_DET of a logic low level, the loading unit <b>124</b>B supplies the high power supply voltage VDD to the output terminal of the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b> in response to the voltage level detection signal VOL_LEV_DET of a logic low level, thereby compensating for the lowered common mode voltage level of the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b>. Accordingly, even when the common mode voltage level of the RZ-type differential bias signals RZ_BIAS_DATA and /RZ_BIAS_DATA swings, the common mode voltage level of the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b> maintains a predetermined constant bias voltage (VDD-&#x394;V) level.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, when the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b> are inputted into the second signal converting unit <b>140</b>, the second signal converting unit <b>140</b> latches the second RZ-type differential signals RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /RZ_DATA<b>2</b> and outputs the second NRZ-type differential signals NRZ_DATA<b>2</b> and /NRZ_DATA<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, a distortion of the duty ratio of the differential signals may be minimized and a common mode noise in the differential signals may be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, the present invention uses the CMFB (Common Mode FeedBack) circuit and the signal conversion characteristics of ACCI (AC Coupled Interconnection), thereby preventing the swing of the common mode voltage level of the differential input signals while minimizing a distortion of the duty ratio of the differential input signals. The present invent may be more efficiently applied in inputting differential signals such as inverting and non-inverting clock signals CLK and /CLK, the duty ratio of which is one of the important factors.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also, the present invention may provide a high-speed operation and minimize the power consumption by removing an element causing excess power consumption.</p>
