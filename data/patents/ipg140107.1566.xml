<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a mechanical fixture which simulates a four bar link drive system for pedal driven scooters and bicycles. More particularly the simulator allows a wide range of link dimensions to be quickly evaluated for pedal performance and provides an easy way to find a set of dimensional solutions for optimal pedal performance. The simulator replicates the pedal action and accurately permits the evaluation each of the four link dimensions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Pedal driven bicycles have been well known in the art of man powered vehicles. The most common pedal system uses a chain driven pair of sprockets to which pedals are attached to the front drive sprocket while a chain is attached to the front drive sprocket and the rear wheel sprocket propelling the rear wheel to provide movement. This system has the pair of pedals positioned 180 degrees relative to the other, so in combination, they rotate 360 degrees about the axis of rotation of the drive sprocket; with the rider exerting maximum force on each downward motion on each pedal. This is a most simple and efficient way to move a two wheeled bicycle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A more complicated, but arguably superior drive system for a bicycle or scooter has been developed utilizing a four bar link drive mechanism. The drive mechanism employs a drive sprocket attached to a bottom bracket fixed onto a bicycle or scooter frame, a crank link attached to the drive sprocket or the axle of the drive sprocket and rotationally fixed to the rotation of the drive sprocket, a coupling link attached at one end to the crank link and at an opposite end to a foot pedal, the foot pedals being pivotally attached at one end to the crank link and at an opposite end, the foot pedal is pivotally attached at an end, called the proximal hinge location of the vehicle frame forming a four bar linkage assembly wherein the distances between axis of rotations at the various attachment locations define the movement. The distance between axis of the pedal proximal hinge location attachment to the frame and the axis of the drive sprocket forms a virtual frame link F. The distance between the axis of the proximal hinge location of the pedal to the axis of the coupling link to pedal attachment defines a dimension P, the distance between pair of axis of the coupling link defines a dimension C<sub>2 </sub>and the dimension between the pair of axis of the crank link defines a dimension C<sub>1</sub>. The combination of dimensions F, P, C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>define the four bar linkage and are critical to the performance of the foot pedals and the vehicle. This drive mechanism as described provides a reciprocating pedal action wherein the rider can exert downward pressure on each downward pedal stroke to propel the vehicle. The foot pedals are set so when one pedal is at the bottom of its stroke, the other pedal is approximately at its maximum stroke relative to the other so that the rider can provide alternating propulsion strokes with each leg.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This drive mechanism is described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12/554,366 filed on Sep. 4, 2009 entitled &#x201c;Pedal-Drive System for Manually Propelling Multi Wheeled Cycles&#x201d; and 12/848,567 filed on Aug. 2, 2010 entitled &#x201c;Improved Scooter and Pedal Drive Assembly; the entirety of each application being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention does not claim this four bar linkage drive system, but rather teaches and discloses a unique simulator device capable of providing optimal solutions to the physical location and dimensions of the four bar linkage system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">During the development of a reciprocating pedal drive system it was discovered that the positioning of the components on a vehicle frame such as a scooter or bicycle were critical. The dimensions and relative locations of F, P, C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>affected how the foot pedals moved. Minor adjustments of one element affected the entire pedal performance. Selection of these dimensions was such that minor variations in manufacturing tolerances during assembly could result in poor pedal action.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These problems were not simply poor pedal operation, but included a linkage lock up preventing pedal movement or even pedal reversal causing the linkages to change or reverse direction. The present invention describes a device to enable quick and reliable establishment of these critical dimensions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A four bar drive link system simulator has a frame assembly, a proximal hinge attachment bracket, a bottom bracket simulator, a pair of crank levers, a pair of coupling levers and a pair of pedal simulator levers. The frame assembly has a plurality of guide rails, including at least a proximal hinge adjustment rail, and a frame simulator rail. The proximal hinge attachment bracket is connected to the proximal hinge adjustment rail. The bottom bracket simulator is attached or otherwise connected to the frame simulator rail. The pair of crank levers is each attached at a first end to an axle having its axis of rotation in the bottom bracket assembly, one crank lever being on one side of the bottom bracket assembly, the other on the opposite side. The pair of coupling levers is each attached to an opposite second end of the crank lever. The pair of pedal simulator levers is each pivotally attached to an end of the coupling lever and to an axis of rotation of the proximal hinge attachment bracket. The relative dimensions between the axis of rotation of proximal hinge and axis of rotation of the bottom bracket are adjustable by movement along the proximal hinge guide rail or the frame simulator guide rail or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The pair of pedal simulator levers each has an adjustable coupling attachment bracket. Movement of the adjustment bracket changes the dimensional distance between axis of rotation of the proximal hinge bracket and the pivotal attachment end of the coupling lever. The pedal simulator levers also each have a pedal stroke lever angularly adjustable to change the bend angle of the pedal simulator levers. The four bar drive link system simulator may have a second bottom bracket simulator slidably mounted onto the frame simulator guide rail. The second bottom bracket simulator has an axle to which a pair of sprockets can be attached. The frame assembly further may have a rear lateral guide rail onto which an adjustable rear wheel mounting assembly for attaching a rear wheel sprocket and axle assembly is affixed wherein chain alignment of the vehicle can be simulated and adjusted by lateral movement. In a preferred embodiment, the crank lever has a moveably adjustable coupling attachment to change the crank lever length between the axis of rotation of the bottom bracket and the coupling lever attachment. The crank lever may be a spider lever for attachment onto a drive sprocket and the spider lever has the adjustable coupling attachment. Similarly, the coupling levers may have movably adjustable pedal attachments for changing the coupling lever length between the crank lever attachment and the pedal simulator attachment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, is directed to a four bar drive link simulator <b>10</b> which provides a fast, predictable way to establish optimum dimensions for a four bar drive link mechanism used on bicycles or scooters.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To better appreciate the function of the simulator <b>10</b>, it is best to refer to an exemplary scooter <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b> to understand how the four bark drive link mechanism works in an actual vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b>, an improved pedal drive scooter <b>100</b> is illustrated. The scooter <b>100</b>, as shown, has a frame <b>110</b> including a handlebar assembly <b>120</b> including the handle bar grips, a shaft <b>120</b>A which extends through and is secured to a hub on the frame <b>110</b> of the scooter <b>100</b>. The shaft extends below the hub to a forked portion which is secured to an axle on the front wheel of the scooter <b>100</b>. The steering assembly <b>120</b> allows the front wheel to be maneuvered for steering and turning. The frame structure <b>110</b> extends from the hub rearwardly to a yoke which connects the rear wheel to the frame <b>110</b>. As illustrated, the frame <b>110</b> has a step down portion which is connected to the hub and extends substantially downwardly to the bottom of a frame <b>110</b> to which a main frame support bar <b>130</b> is attached. As shown, at the attachment of the main support bar <b>130</b> to the step down portion of the frame <b>110</b>, a supporting gusset is welded providing additional strength and stiffness at this location. Welded onto the main support bar <b>130</b> is a bottom bracket <b>160</b>, this bottom bracket <b>160</b> provides a location for a drive mechanism <b>200</b> assembly to be mounted. The drive mechanism <b>200</b>, as illustrated, includes a drive sprocket <b>600</b>. Attached to the drive sprocket <b>600</b> is a drive chain which extends rearwardly back to the rear wheel sprocket. The sprocket is attached to the axle of the rear wheel and as the device is operated, turns the rear wheel providing forward propulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Attached to each side of the frame <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b>, are a pair of foot pedals <b>220</b>R and <b>220</b>L. The foot pedals <b>220</b>R and <b>220</b>L are attached to the frame <b>110</b> at location <b>50</b>. This location <b>50</b> will be referred to hereafter as the proximal hinge attachment location <b>50</b>. The foot pedal <b>220</b>L is a mirror image of the foot pedal <b>220</b>R. These foot pedals operate in reciprocating motion, up and down and are connected to the drive mechanism <b>200</b> to provide forward propulsion. As the pedals are moved in an up and down direction, the sprocket is rotated moving the chain which in turn moves the rear sprocket, and propels the rear wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The proximal hinge location <b>50</b> extends to the intersection at or near the bend to the reinforced pedal attachment location <b>24</b> and extends a distance P, as illustrated. A virtual frame link is created between the proximal hinge location <b>50</b> of the frame <b>110</b> and the axis if rotation or center of the axle of the drive mechanism <b>200</b>. This virtual frame link distance is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as a dimension F. The two ends of the frame link are fixed in location and do not move except rotationally relative to the other. As the pedals <b>220</b>L and <b>220</b>R reciprocate up and down, the coupling links <b>320</b> and the crank links <b>310</b>L and <b>310</b>R rotate along with the sprocket <b>600</b>. As illustrated, the coupling link <b>320</b> extends from the pedal attachment location <b>24</b> back to a pin location connecting the coupling links <b>320</b> and the crank link <b>310</b>L or <b>310</b>R. This dimension is identified as C<sub>2</sub>. Extending from the coupling link pin location and crank attachment, a distance of C<sub>1 </sub>is illustrated extending back to the drive axle and the sprocket <b>600</b>. It is important to note that the coupling link dimension C<sub>2 </sub>is substantially larger than the crank link dimension C<sub>1</sub>, as illustrated. Preferably, the coupling link dimension C<sub>2 </sub>must be greater than the dimension C<sub>1</sub>, furthermore, it is noted that the proximal hinge location <b>50</b> attaching the foot pedal <b>220</b>L or <b>220</b>R to the frame <b>110</b> extends vertically, preferably, above the drive axle location. This vertical distance is indicated as Y in this exemplary scooter design.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An important aspect of the dimensional positioning of the four bar linkage is proper rotation of the coupling link <b>320</b> and the crank lever <b>310</b>L or <b>310</b>R. If the locations are not accurately located, the drive mechanism <b>200</b> can lock up wherein a lock up phenomena is understood to occur at a top dead center location causing the links to bind, stopping the pedals from moving. A worse problem can occur wherein the linkages can actually reverse rotational direction. In this case a pedal can abruptly slam down as the links rotate opposite to their normal or desired movement. The present invention avoids these issues entirely by a proper selection of four bar link dimensions F, P, C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2</sub>. These problems, while understood to exist, were not fully appreciated. Computer software which models and predicts dimensions for four bar linkage systems relies on the axle in the bottom bracket to be the driving location and as such the predicted optimal locations for such a device acted perfectly when one rotated at the axle by hand, but when the drive propulsion was moved to the location <b>24</b>, as in the actual scooter device, these software optimum solutions would not operate properly. It was determined that each of the link dimensions and the relationship of C<sub>2 </sub>being greater than C<sub>1 </sub>and the proximal hinge location were all critical. This meant finding optimal dimensions was not predictable using standard software generated solutions. The performance of the present invention was greatly enhanced by the selection of the link dimensions and attachment locations on the frame <b>110</b>. The solution found in the exemplary scooter allows for the dimensions to deviate slightly within normal manufacturing tolerance without the lock up or reversal issues that previously existed in the drive mechanism design.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The critical problem of using this type of four bar drive link mechanism in scooters and bicycles was finding a quick, reliable way to design and develop new frames, pedals and drive components that had predictable performance, acceptable manufacturing tolerances and avoiding the lock up or reverse rotational issues that simply were not easily predictable using computer modeling.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">What was needed was a device that not only was reliable, but one in which the design engineers could confidently mimic real world performance of virtually unlimited range of dimensional variation to find optimal performance characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention simulator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> mimics the performance of the vehicle drive mechanism <b>200</b> so that prior to expending the tooling cost on a frame and drive assembly, the designers know with high confidence the performance of the drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the four bar drive link simulator <b>10</b> of the present invention is illustrated. As shown, the simulator <b>10</b> has a frame assembly <b>11</b>, a proximal hinge attachment bracket <b>20</b>, a bottom bracket simulator <b>40</b>, a pair of crank levers <b>31</b>L, <b>31</b>R, a pair of coupling levers <b>32</b> and a pair of pedal simulator levers <b>22</b>L, <b>22</b>R. The frame assembly <b>11</b> has a plurality of guide rails including at least a proximal hinge adjustment rail <b>22</b> and a frame simulator rail <b>13</b>. The proximal hinge adjustment rail <b>22</b>, as shown on the simulator <b>10</b>, extends generally vertically upwardly having guide slots <b>21</b> as illustrated. Attached to the proximal hinge adjustment rail <b>22</b> is a proximal hinge attachment bracket <b>20</b>, this attachment bracket <b>20</b> is slidable on the guide rail <b>22</b> such that it can move up and down vertically as illustrated. This vertical movement enables the proximal hinge location <b>50</b> which will be a location on the frame of the vehicle to be properly duplicated or simulated. The proximal hinge attachment bracket <b>20</b> can be snugly secured at any position along the vertical guide rail <b>22</b> by using a threaded fastener locking the bracket <b>20</b> into a fixed position if so desired. Extending longitudinally along the simulator <b>10</b> is the frame simulator rail <b>13</b>, similarly having a plurality of guide slots <b>14</b> onto which a bottom bracket simulator <b>40</b> is attached or otherwise connected. As shown, the bottom bracket simulator <b>40</b> can be moved along the frame simulator rail <b>13</b> such that it moves forward or aft simulating the location of a bottom bracket that would be welded or otherwise attached to a frame of a vehicle. These two movable brackets <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> of the simulator <b>10</b> establish attachment locations for the crank levers, coupling levers and pedals as illustrated. The proximal hinge location <b>50</b> has an axle <b>23</b> sticking outwardly such that a pedal simulator <b>22</b>L or <b>22</b>R can be slipped onto the axle of the proximal hinge bracket <b>20</b> to fix the location of the pedals <b>22</b>L or <b>22</b>R relative to the proximal hinge location <b>50</b>. This pedal simulator <b>22</b>L or <b>22</b>R as shown can move vertically up and down relative to the simulator <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, one pedal simulator <b>22</b>L is removed from the axle <b>23</b> of the proximal hinge bracket <b>20</b> clearly exposing the axle <b>23</b> as well as a pair of crank levers <b>31</b>L, <b>31</b>R and coupling levers <b>32</b> which are attached to the bottom bracket simulator <b>40</b>. The crank lever <b>31</b>R and the coupling lever <b>32</b> are connected to the pedal simulator <b>22</b>R as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> such that they provide an attachment location onto the pedals and enable the drive mechanism <b>200</b> to then simulate the movement of the drive mechanism <b>200</b> by reciprocating motion of the pedal levers <b>25</b>. To accomplish this one simply grasps the ends of the pedal levers <b>25</b> and moves them up and down repeating that action to simulate the performance of the drive mechanism <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The exploded view of the simulator <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, illustrates the various locations of the components as previously described. As shown, at the forward and rear end of the simulator <b>10</b> a pair of laterally extending guide rails <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are attached to the frame simulator rail <b>13</b> and proximal hinge guide rail <b>22</b> on the forward part of the frame assembly <b>11</b>. On the rear part of the frame assembly <b>11</b>, as illustrated, a second vertical guide rail <b>82</b> is shown along with the lateral guide rail <b>74</b> to which a pair of rear wheel mounting brackets <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> are shown, the rear wheel mounting brackets <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> as illustrated, enable a rear wheel or rear wheel sprocket and hub to be attached such that a chain can be attached to either a sprocket attached on an axle <b>44</b> of the second bottom bracket <b>41</b> as illustrated or alternatively directly to a sprocket attached on the first bottom bracket <b>40</b>. The sprockets not being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, however, it being understood that they can be attached directly onto the axles <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the bottom bracket simulators <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a rear wheel hub assembly <b>99</b> can then be attached to the attachment brackets <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> for a rear wheel such that chain alignment can be predicted and established using the simulator <b>10</b>. This is a second feature of the simulator that enables a direct analysis of chain alignment to be predicted and made utilizing the simulator <b>10</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For better understanding of the adjustment capability of the simulator <b>10</b>, it is understood that the bottom bracket simulator <b>40</b> attached to the frame simulator rail <b>13</b> enables a movement fore and aft along the simulator <b>10</b> whereas the proximal hinge bracket <b>20</b> enables a vertical movement up and down the proximal hinge guide rail <b>22</b> allowing for adjustment of the virtual frame link dimension F. As the virtual frame dimension F is adjusted, correspondingly the pedal link dimension P from the proximal hinge location <b>50</b> to the coupling attachment location <b>24</b> at the foot pedals <b>22</b>L, <b>22</b>R are correspondingly moved.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to accomplish this movement, the pedal simulator <b>22</b>L and <b>22</b>R as shown has a forward portion <b>30</b>L, <b>30</b>R which is shown slightly bent that attaches to the proximal hinge axle <b>23</b> at the forward hub end <b>35</b>. At the rear end <b>37</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, has a slot <b>34</b> into which a cylindrical sleeve <b>38</b> fits. A screw attachment thread hole <b>39</b> has a bolt <b>65</b> attached. A thumb lock down nut <b>66</b> secures a movable bracket <b>36</b> that is attached to the sleeve <b>38</b> at the holes <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B enables this location to be moved fore and aft. This allows the link dimension P to be adjusted by simple turning of the threaded fastener or bolt <b>65</b> which moves the bracket <b>36</b> and correspondingly enables the sleeve <b>82</b> in the slot <b>34</b> to be moved either forward or aft as so desired. The bolt <b>65</b> passes through the hole <b>36</b>C in the bracket <b>36</b> and the bracket is fixed by the thumb nut <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 9A</figref>, a pedal lever assembly <b>25</b> is shown, the pedal lever assembly <b>25</b> includes a pair of threaded fasteners <b>27</b> to which nuts <b>26</b> are applied that extend through a hole <b>28</b> locating a pair of angular orientation brackets <b>25</b>A to be connected to the lever <b>25</b>B as shown, the brackets <b>25</b>A have holes <b>28</b>A at one end that allow the threaded fastener <b>27</b> to slip through a hole <b>29</b>B in the lever <b>25</b>B and be connected by a nut <b>26</b> at the other end. At the arcuate end of the bracket <b>25</b>A is an arcuate slot <b>29</b>A, the fastener can be slipped through the slot <b>29</b>A and into a second hole <b>29</b>B in the lever arm <b>25</b>B and a nut <b>26</b> attached to it. Adjustment of the angle can be achieved by simply loosening the second fastener <b>27</b> such that an angular movement in the <b>29</b>A of the bracket <b>25</b>A can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This pedal lever assembly <b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is then welded or otherwise attached to the portion <b>37</b> of the bracket <b>30</b>L, or <b>30</b>R shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in the exploded view. As illustrated, this enables the pedal lever simulator <b>22</b>L, <b>22</b>R to be adjusted not only dimensionally fore and aft to change the link dimension P by tightening or loosening the bolt <b>65</b>, but also angularly to change the angle of the pedal lever assembly <b>25</b> such that vertical movement up and down can be adjusted. In doing so, it must be noted that as illustrated, the simulator <b>10</b> allows the pedal on one side to be at a substantially horizontal position while on the opposite side the pedal is at the maximum angled position. This is how the pedals operate. The bottom of the stroke which is generally set at a horizontal position and the opposite pedal is at its maximum or peak position of the stroke reciprocating movement alternates these positions and is what drives the drive mechanism in a reciprocating fashion so that the pedals can continuously move. If so desired, at the bottom of the stroke, the angle could be extended slightly below horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The simulator <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> had fixed coupling levers <b>32</b> and fixed crank levers <b>31</b>L, <b>31</b>R such that the dimensions are fixed C<sub>2 </sub>and C<sub>1 </sub>respectively. In order to make additional adjustments with regard to these features, and to find optimal coupling lever and crank lever dimensions, it was determined that an adjustment feature could also be provided on a crank lever and a coupling lever. To achieve this, adjustment slots are provided in both of these components. This feature is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B for an exemplary spider crank lever <b>31</b>AL, the spider crank lever <b>31</b>AL is a type of device that attaches or bolts directly onto a drive sprocket of a vehicle at the four spider arms <b>314</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, this spider crank lever <b>31</b>AL can have a slide <b>311</b> that fits in the slot <b>312</b>. This slide component <b>311</b> is slidably moveable within the slot <b>312</b>, but can be fixed at any location within the slot <b>312</b> by threaded fasteners <b>400</b> as illustrated. The fasteners <b>400</b> fit in slots <b>402</b> and fasten in the holes <b>315</b> in the slider <b>311</b>. The opposite perspective views shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, show the slide <b>311</b> moved to a most forward location wherein the dimension C<sub>1 </sub>would be at a minimum on this device. To make an adjustment increasing the length, one would simply move the slider <b>311</b> aft and the distance between the attachment and the axle <b>42</b> on the bottom bracket simulator <b>40</b> and the coupling attachment opening <b>313</b> shown in the slider <b>311</b> would move in such a direction enabling an increase in length of the dimension C<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B; a coupling lever <b>32</b>A is illustrated having a similar slider <b>311</b> that can be inserted into a slot <b>312</b> in the coupling lever <b>32</b>A. This coupling lever <b>32</b>A can then have the slider <b>311</b> fastened using threaded fasteners <b>400</b> as illustrated. In this component, the coupling lever <b>32</b>A can be designed so that adjustments can be made in the dimension C<sub>2 </sub>between the pedal attachment location <b>24</b> and the crank attachment location <b>313</b>. This dimension C<sub>2 </sub>can be adjusted increasing or decreasing the length if so desired. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the coupling lever <b>32</b>A has the slider <b>311</b> at a minimum location; movement in an opposite direction in the slot <b>312</b> would allow the dimension C<sub>2 </sub>to be increased substantially. As such, a large number of variations can occur within the adjustable crank levers <b>31</b>AL, <b>31</b>AR and coupling levers <b>32</b>A. As these elements are placed on the simulator, not only can the dimensions P and F be adjusted along the guide rails <b>22</b>, <b>13</b>, but also by providing a pedal lever simulator <b>22</b>L, <b>22</b>R with an adjustment feature, along with crank levers and coupling levers with slidable adjustment features, every dimension used in establishing a four bar link system can be adjusted. These adjustments can be made either singularly or in combination to create virtually any combination of four bar drive link system dimensions desired within the range of the components ability to be adjusted. This provides the designer with almost an infinite range of selectable solutions for the drive mechanism used in such scooters and bicycles.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In using the simulator <b>10</b> as illustrated, the drive mechanism can be adjusted in a variety of ways. This drive mechanism dimensions, once established at an optimum by repeated movement of the pedal simulator levers as illustrated, enable the designer to get a feel for the actual movement that will be achieved in the finished scooter or bicycle. Instead of using feet to drive the pedal lever arms <b>25</b>, it is desirable to use ones hands and to move these levers up and down simulating the motion of the feet, in doing so the operator gets a feel for the ease in movement of the four bar link system and as such can make minor adjustments until the movement is felt to be optimal. Once the movement is optimally set, the engineer can simply take the measurements relative to the axis of rotation of each of the attachment locations such that these dimensions are established. These dimensions; F, P, C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>are clearly established by the simulator.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When using the simulator device <b>10</b> the procedure for fixed links outlined below can be followed to establish the four bar drive link dimensions. Step 1: Choose approximate angle of bend for pedals. Step 2: Choose approximate distance between bolts in pedal. Note: increasing distance will decrease pedal stroke angle. In turn, decreasing distance will increase pedal stroke angle. Step 3: Adjust height of proximal hinge and linear distance of bottom bracket until pedal is at an angle of zero degrees from horizontal when at bottom of stroke. Step 4: Continue to adjust linear distance of bottom bracket until drive system rotates freely. Fine tuning is necessary to find the best location of bottom bracket and to obtain tolerances for manufacturing. If pedal stroke angle is not as desired, adjust the distance between the bolts in the pedal. Increase the distance to decrease the angle, in turn, decrease the distance to increase the angle. Repeat steps 3-4. Once desired angle is achieved, adjust the pedal bend angle to zero when at bottom of stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When using the simulator device <b>10</b> the procedure for adjustable links outlined below can be followed to establish the four bar drive link dimensions. Step 1: Choose approximate angle of bend for pedals. Step 2: Choose approximate distance between bolts in pedal. Note: increasing distance will decrease pedal stroke angle. In turn, decreasing distance will increase pedal stroke angle. Step 3: Choose approximate dimensions for links. Note: Linear length of Crank link should be greater than that of the Coupler link. Note 2: Increasing the length of the Crank link increases tolerances, decreasing the length decreases tolerances. The combined length of the longest length and the shortest length must not be greater than the combined length of the remaining two links. Step 4: Adjust height of proximal hinge and linear distance of bottom bracket until pedal is at an angle of zero degrees from horizontal when at bottom of stroke. Step 5: Continue to adjust linear distance of bottom bracket until drive system rotates freely. Fine tuning is necessary to find the best location of bottom bracket and to obtain tolerances for manufacturing. If pedal stroke angle is not as desired, adjust the distance between the bolts in the pedal. Increase the distance to decrease the angle, in turn, decrease the distance to increase the angle. Repeat steps 3-4. Once desired angle is achieved, adjust the pedal bend angle to zero when at bottom of stroke. Once this has been accomplished, the designer can feel confident that the drive mechanism simulation has provided him with a solution that will provide a good, reliable and predictable drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Once this is accomplished, the other aspect of this invention is to use the rear portion of the simulator <b>10</b> to attach a wheel or hub <b>99</b> as illustrated and to attach sprockets <b>98</b> onto the either second bottom bracket <b>41</b> or simply the first bottom bracket <b>40</b> and to provide for chain alignment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Chain alignment is critical because in a two chain system, the drive sprocket <b>98</b>A is on one side extending back to a smaller sprocket <b>97</b> on the second bottom bracket <b>41</b> which is also connected on the opposite side to a larger sprocket <b>98</b>B which is then connected to a rear wheel hub sprocket <b>98</b>C to put drive propulsion to the rear wheel. This creates potential for misalignment of the chains <b>95</b>, <b>96</b>; accordingly it is important that the simulator <b>10</b> provides for chain alignment variations and the engineer can then take measurements off of the simulator <b>10</b> to establish proper dimensions on the frame and locations that the bottom brackets must be welded to the frame in order to achieve proper chain alignment and also to provide proper attachment locations for the rear wheel assembly onto the frame itself. These features are all achieved with the present invention as illustrated and described above, while variations and minor adjustments can be made, it is understood that this simulator will provide a predictable and reliable way of establishing a four bar drive link system for a scooter or bicycle having reciprocating pedals as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated, each of the attachment locations where pivotal motion occurs, it may be desirable to provide bushings or bearings to smooth rotation, assuming the vehicle being simulated employs these components. Therefore, the use of such bushings and bearings is used if they are also used on the vehicle. Furthermore, the axles <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the bottom brackets can be square or round splined ends, but similarly should match the vehicle being simulated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Variations in the present invention are possible in light of the description of it provided herein. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the subject invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the subject invention.
