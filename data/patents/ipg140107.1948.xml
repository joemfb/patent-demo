<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to blends that contain alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol compounds having about three moles of lipophilic substituents per mole of polyol and, more specifically, to the use of such compounds as thickeners in liquid surfactant compositions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid compositions containing surfactants, for example, shampoos, dishwashing liquids and other personal care, home care and industrial products, typically contain thickeners to increase the viscosity of the liquid compositions sufficiently to enable convenient handling. Often, the thickeners comprise an alkoxylated polyol containing lipophilic substituents, for example, ethoxylated methyl glucose esterified with a fatty acid. Such thickeners are typically alkoxylated to an extent sufficient to provide water-solubility and provide viscosification to the liquid surfactant composition. The lipophilic substituent, for example, fatty acid, typically provides associative thickening characteristics to the thickener.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Often, the thickeners are introduced to the liquid surfactant compositions in solid form and mixed under conditions effective to dissolve the thickener into the liquid surfactant composition and cause significant viscosity increases, for example, up to about 2,000 to 100,000 centipoise (cP) or higher. Frequently, the mixing must be conducted at elevated temperatures in the range of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 80&#xb0; C. in order to promote the dissolution of the thickener and obtain the desired viscosity enhancement (known in the art as &#x201c;hot processing&#x201d;). However, formulators of products comprising thickened, surfactant-containing liquids, for example, shampoos, desire the ability to formulate their products at ambient temperatures generally in the range of about 20&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C. (known in the art as &#x201c;cold processing&#x201d;). Additionally, formulators also desire thickeners which can be introduced to the liquid surfactant compositions in a liquid form rather than a solid form. The ability to introduce the thickener in a liquid form can provide a formulator with a greater degree of accuracy in introducing the correct amount of thickener to the liquid surfactant system and also better facilitate automated processing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Given the above, there is a need in the art for improved compositions suitable for use as thickeners in liquid surfactant systems. In one embodiment, the thickeners can be introduced by cold processing and in a liquid state. Methods for using compositions to thicken liquid compositions comprising surfactants are also desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention generally relates to blends that contain alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol compounds having about three moles of lipophilic substituents per mole of polyol and, more specifically, to the use of such compounds as thickeners in liquid surfactant compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Given the above, in one embodiment alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol compounds are provided which are useful, for example, as thickeners in liquid surfactant-containing systems. In another embodiment, the alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol compounds of the present invention are dissolved in a suitable solvent to provide a liquid thickener for use in viscosifying surfactant-containing liquid compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the embodiments detailed below, although the disclosed ranges for the total amount of each component of the compositions of the present invention may individually total more than 100 weight percent when each component is taken individually and totaled using the broadest amounts disclosed herein, one of skill in the art will realize that this is not the case. While overlapping weight ranges for the various components and ingredients that can be contained in the compositions of the invention have been expressed for selected embodiments and aspects of the invention, it should be readily apparent that the specific amount of each component in the disclosed personal care, home care, and industrial care compositions will be selected from its disclosed range such that the amount of each component is adjusted so that the sum of all components in the composition will total 100 weight percent. The amounts employed will vary with the purpose and character of the desired product and can be readily determined by one skilled in the formulation art and from the literature.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, in the compositions of the present invention at least 5 weight percent of the polyol compound(s) have about three moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol. In this embodiment, it has been found that the presence of a sufficient portion of the polyol compounds having about three moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of the polyol can enhance the ability of the composition to thicken a liquid surfactant system, preferably at cold processing temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the present invention provides processes for preparing the compositions which include the steps of alkoxylating the polyol with a suitable alkoxylation reagent, for example, ethylene oxide, and introducing a lipophilic substituent, for example, by esterification with a fatty acid. The processes also provide for introducing the lipophilic substituents prior to the alkoxylation step as well as sequential introductions of the lipophilic substituent and the alkoxylating reagent.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the polyols suitable for use as starting materials in accordance with the present invention comprise any compounds having three or more hydroxyl groups per molecule which are reactive with the alkoxylation reagents and the lipophilic reagents described below. General examples include, but are not limited to, glycerols, polyglycerols, sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol or sorbitan), and saccharides (e.g., glucose and its derivatives). In another embodiment, additional examples of the polyols which can be used according to the invention include, but are not limited to, trimethylolethane[2-methyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol], trimethylolpropane[2-ethyl-2-(hydroxy-methyl)-1,3-propanediol], pentaerythritol (2,2-dimethylol-1,3-propanediol), diglycerol (glycerol dimer), dipentaerythritol, glycerol, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, polyol starting materials for use in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, glucose derivatives (e.g., glycosides including, but not limited to, glucosides, galactosides, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides having up to about 10 saccharide repeating units per molecule and sucrose). In still another embodiment, polyol starting materials for use in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, glucosides (e.g., alkyl glucosides including, but not limited to, methyl glucoside, ethyl glucoside, propyl glucoside, butyl glucoside and amyl glucoside). Such polyols are commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Suitable reagents for alkoxylating the polyols of the present invention include, but are not limited to, alkylene oxides (e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide and mixtures thereof). Other alkoxylating reagents including, but not limited to, higher alkylene oxides can be used in accordance with the present invention. Alkylene oxides suitable for use in accordance with the present invention are commercially available. The amount of alkoxylation in accordance with the present invention is that which is effective to provide water solubility and viscosification in a liquid surfactant composition. Typically, such amounts range from about 50 to about 400, or from about 80 to about 180, or even from about 100 to about 160 moles of alkylene oxide per mole of polyol. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Methods for alkoxylating polyols, for example, by direct alkoxylation, are known to those skilled in the art and as such a detailed discussion herein is omitted for the sake of brevity. Alternatively, partially alkoxylated methyl glucosides, for example, GLUCAM&#x2122; E-20 (PEG-20 methyl glucoside) available from Lubrizol Advanced Materials, Inc., can be used as a starting material which can then be further alkoxylated to contain the desired degree of alkoxylation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The lipophilic reagents suitable to derivatize the polyols of the present invention include any compounds which are reactive with the polyols and have sufficient molecular weight to promote associative thickening when introduced into a liquid, surfactant-containing system. Typically, the lipophilic reagents comprise hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon moieties with from about 8 to about 30, or from about 12 to about 26, or even from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms per molecule. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. The particular structure of the lipophilic reagents is not critical to the present invention and may, for example, be alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkenyl and may be cyclic, branched or straight. Typically, the reagents are fatty acids, fatty esters, epoxides, halides, glycidyl ethers, or vegetable or animal oils. The reagents typically provide either an ester or ether linkage to the polyol. Stated another way, in the case of a glucose derivative, for example, the ether or ester is typically attached to the glucose derivative indirectly through a polyoxyalkylene chain.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Examples of suitable fatty acids include, but are not limited to, natural or synthetic saturated or unsaturated acids which are linear or branched. The fatty acids can be used alone or as a mixture. Natural fatty acids include, for example, saturated or unsaturated linear fatty acids such as caproic acid, enanthic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, decanoic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linolic acid, oleic acid, capric acid and undecanoic acid which are typically obtained by hydrolyzing vegetable oils and animal oils such as coconuts oils, palm oil, tallow, linseed oil and soybean oil. Examples of synthetic fatty acids, include, but are not limited to, linear or branched fatty acids prepared by oxidizing olefin polymers. It is also possible to use fatty acids derived from microorganisms such as, for example, &#x3b3;-linolenic acid. Further, as the lower alkyl ester of the fatty acid, alkyl esters having 1 to 8 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl or propyl ester of the fatty acid described above can be used. The fatty acid esters of hexose or the alkyl glycoside thereof can be synthesized by using various known methods, including ester synthesis using lipase and the like: for example; (1) an ester exchange reaction between starting oils or fats and a hexose or its alkylglycoside, (2) an ester exchange reaction between a lower alkyl ester of a fatty acid and a hexose or its alkyl glycoside, or (3) an ester synthesis between a fatty acid and a hexose or its alkyl glycoside. In addition, a synthesis process using a fatty acid chloride and a hexose or its alkyl glycoside can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Examples of other suitable lipophilic reagents include, but are not limited to, glycidyl ethers, for example, nonylphenylglycidyl ether or dodecylphenyl glycidyl ether, &#x3b1;-olefin epoxides, for examples, 1,2-epoxyhexadecane and their respective chlorohydrins, or alkyl halides, for examples, dodecylbromide, and the above-mentioned vegetable and animal oils. Halogenated products of fatty acids can also be used as the lipophilic reagent.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The amount of the lipophilic reagent used to derivatize the polyols of the present invention is preferably effective to promote associative thickening behavior of the polyol derivatives when present in a liquid surfactant composition. Typically, the average substitution level of the lipophilic substituent is about 3, for example, from about 2.5 to about 4, or from about 2.5 to about 3.9 and more preferably from about 2.8 to 3.6, moles per mole of polyol. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Details concerning the derivatization of polyols to comprise lipophilic substituents are known to those skilled in the art and as such are omitted herein for the sake of brevity. The average amount of lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol (referred to in the art as Degree of Substitution &#x201c;DS&#x201d;) can be determined by any technique known to those skilled in the art, for example, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&#x201c;NMR&#x201d;). The lipophilic reagents suitable for use in accordance with the present invention are commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol compounds comprise a mixture of compounds substituted with varying amounts of the lipophilic substituent depending upon the available hydroxyl groups on the polyol starting material. At least 5 percent of the polyol compounds in the composition have about three moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol. For example, in the case of an ethoxylated, esterified methyl glucoside, at least about 5 percent of the compounds are substituted with about three moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of the methyl glucoside. Typically, at least about 25 percent, or at least about 50 percent, or even at least about 75 percent of the polyol derivatives in the composition have about three moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Typically, the balance of the composition comprises polyol derivatives having one, two or four moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol. In one embodiment, less than about 75 percent, or less than about 50 percent, or even less than about 25 percent of the polyols in the composition comprise one, two or four moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol compounds comprise a mixture of compounds substituted with varying amounts of the lipophilic substituent depending upon the available hydroxyl groups on the polyol starting material. At least 5 percent of the polyol compounds in the composition have about two moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol. For example, in the case of an ethoxylated, esterified methyl glucoside, at least about 5 percent of the compounds are substituted with about two moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of the methyl glucoside.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sequence in which the alkylene oxide and lipophilic substituents are reacted onto the polyol is not critical to the present invention. In one embodiment of the invention, the alkoxylation reaction is conducted first, followed by substitution of the lipophilic substituent onto the polyol. In another embodiment of the invention, the polyol is first substituted with the lipophilic substituent followed by alkoxylation. In still yet another embodiment of the invention, the polyol is partially esterified, for example, to comprise one or two moles (on average) of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol, then ethoxylated, then subsequently esterified, for example, to comprise about three moles of the lipophilic substituent per mole of polyol. Alternatively, the polyol can be partially ethoxylated, esterified and then ethoxylated again to the desired level. Moreover, the starting material can be the polyol, a partially alkoxylated polyol or a polyol that is partially reacted with the lipophilic reagent, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The derivatizations are typically conducted under sub-atmospheric pressure, for example, from about 0.001 to about 1.0 atmospheres, and at a temperature in the range of about 110&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C. for the alkoxylation step and about 120&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. for the lipophilic substitution step. Catalysts may or may not be used for the derivatizations. Typically, however, catalysts are employed to enhance the reaction rate. The catalysts can be acidic, basic, or neutral. In one embodiment, suitable catalysts for the alkoxylation step include, but are not limited to, Na, NaOCH<sub>3</sub>, KOH, NaOH, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. In one embodiment, suitable catalysts for the lipophilic substitution step include, but are not limited to, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, KOH, NaOH, acids including p-toluenesulfonic acid (&#x201c;p-TSA&#x201d;), H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HCl, and others including organic titanates, for example, tetraisopropyl titanate available as Tyzor&#x2122; catalyst from DuPont Company, Wilmington, Del. Further details concerning the manufacture of alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol compounds are known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,687,843; 5,109,127; 5,501,813; and 5,502,175, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The product produced from the derivatization reactions is typically in the form of a solid in a granulated or powdered form. The solid product is suitable for packaging and shipment to customers.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, the alkoxylated, lipophilic polyol derivatives of the present invention are dissolved in a suitable solvent to provide a liquid thickener suitable for use in viscosifying surfactant-containing liquid compositions. Any suitable liquid, or liquids, capable of dissolving the polyol derivatives are suitable for use in accordance with the present invention. In one embodiment, the liquids are aqueous with or without additional water miscible liquids. For example, suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, water, alkylene glycols having about 2 to about 5 carbon atoms per molecule, such as propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, butylene glycol, propanediol and butanediol. Dialkylene glycols (e.g., diethylene and dipropylene glycols) can be utilized as suitable solvents. Other solvents, such as for example, polyalkylene glycols such as CARBOWAX&#x2122; PEG and UCON&#x2122; Fluids available from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich., can also be employed. When the product of the present invention is provided in a liquid form, it typically comprises from about 55 weight percent to about 75 weight percent, or from about 58 weight percent to about 72 weight percent, or from about 60 weight percent to about 70 weight percent, or even from about 62 weight percent to about 68 weight percent of the polyol derivative with the balance comprising the one or more liquid solvents and any desired additives. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Suitable additives include, but are not limited to, preservatives and biocides, which are generally present in minor amounts, for example, less than about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the liquid composition.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another embodiment, when in liquid form the compositions of the present invention have a clarity (turbidity) of less than about 20 NTUs, less than about 15 NTUs, less than about 10 NTUs, less than about 7.5 NTUs, less than about 5 NTUs, less than about 2.5 NTUs, less than about 1 NTU, or even are considered to be clear (i.e., have a turbidity of less than about 0.2 NTUs, or even a turbidity of 0 NTUs). Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The clarity (turbidity) of a composition is determined in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) employing a nephelometric turbidity meter (Micro 100 Turbidimeter, HF Scientific, Inc.) at ambient room temperature of about 20&#xb0; C. to about 25&#xb0; C. Distilled water (NTU=0) is utilized as a standard. Six dram screw cap vials (70 mm&#xd7;25 mm) are filled almost to the top with test sample and centrifuged at 100 rpm until all bubbles are removed. Upon centrifugation, each sample vial is wiped with tissue paper to remove any smudges before placement in the turbidity meter. The sample is placed in the turbidity meter and a reading is taken. Once the reading stabilizes, the NTU value is recorded. The vial is given one-quarter turn and another reading is taken and recorded. This is repeated until four readings are taken. The average of the four readings is reported as the turbidity value. Compositions having an NTU value of about 50 or greater were judged hazy or turbid. Compositions having even higher NTU values and/or turbidities were judged opaque. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the transition between hazy and opaque is not defined by a definitive numerical NTU value. Rather, it can be somewhat subjective based on the level of haziness which is then considered to be opaque. As such, no specific NTU value is attached to the transition from hazy to opaque in regards to the formulations of Comparative Examples of the thickener compositions detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In still another embodiment, the liquid compositions of the present invention are stable after at least 1 freeze/thaw cycle, at least 2 freeze/thaw cycles, at least 3 freeze/thaw cycles, or even 4 or more freeze/thaw cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, freeze/thaw stability is determined by the following method. Initially, the method utilized herein visually compares the turbidity of a sample. It is applicable to any clear to amber colored material which can be obtained as a visually clear liquid at room temperature. It is reported as the average of the turbidity readings.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Specifically, a 6 dram glass vial is filled with the sample material and then placed in a freezer at &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. for 24 hours and then taken out and put into a 25&#xb0; C. water bath for several hours until the vial and the sample are equilibrated to 25&#xb0; C. The sample is placed in a micro 100 Turbidimeter. Next, the sample is rotated several times and readings are taken and averaged, the average number is reported. In the above test method the following equipment is utilized: (a) a Micro 100 Turbidimeter or equivalent is utilized; (b) a freezer capable of reaching &#x2212;10&#xb0; C.+/&#x2212;2&#xb0; C.; (c) 6 dram glass vials; and (d) a water bath capable of holding temperature of 25&#xb0; C.+/&#x2212;1&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus given the above, the stability of a sample after a freeze/thaw cycle is determined by: (1) placing a desired sample in a 6 dram glass vial; (2) placing the vial in freezer for 24 hours; (3) taking the sample out of the freezer and placing the sample in a 25&#xb0; C. water bath, for several hours to equilibrate; (4) placing the glass vial in the turbidimeter, rotating the vial several times and taking readings; (5) averaging the readings and recording the number; (6) taking Brookfield Viscosity measurements to determine if such measurements have changed; and (7) recording any visual changes from the original material.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In light of the composition of Comparative Example 14, this example was re-run two additional times using the same weight percentages of each component as detailed in Table 6. It was discovered during the second and third runs of Comparative Example 14 that the composition disclosed therein actually falls within the scope of the present invention. While not wishing to be bound by any one explanation, it is believed that the first run of Comparative Example 14 suffered from contamination while being prepared, the source of which was eliminated in the second and third runs.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Given the above, the present invention possesses a number of advantages over previously known compositions that can be utilized as thickeners. It should be noted that the present invention is not limited solely to the following stated advantages. Rather, the present invention is to be broadly construed based on the complete disclosure contained herein. One advantage of the present invention is that the compositions disclosed herein eliminate the need for the use of, or inclusion of, propylene glycol which has fallen into disfavor in the personal care field as it has been determined to be a skin irritant. Another advantage is that the compositions of the present invention have an increased solids content derived from the alkoxylated glucose derivatized portion and utilize alkylene glycols or polyalkylene glycols (e.g., 1-3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, or a mixture thereof) and water. The water portion of the present invention permits one to obtain the desired high solids content in conjunction with the desired viscosity, turbidity and freeze/thaw stability, as well as a low alkylene glycol content. Additionally, the reduction of the overall amount of alkylene glycol or polyalkylene glycol solvents in the compositions of the present invention yields compositions that do not negatively impact on the viscosity of the final personal care product to which the compositions of the present invention are added. As noted above, the compositions of the present invention are able to be cold processed.</p>
