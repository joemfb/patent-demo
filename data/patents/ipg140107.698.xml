<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Kits for constructing a modular merchandizing unit include panels, frame members, joint pieces, and a cooling device. The frame members have a lengthwise shape defining outer and inner panel mounting assemblies and a joint capture region. The mounting assemblies include opposing legs extending from a base web to define a panel engagement region. The joint pieces each include a block core and orthogonally arranged plug assemblies projecting from faces of the core. The plug assemblies mate with the joint capture region. Construction of a unit from the kit includes the frame members retaining selected panels as paired inner and outer panels within corresponding engagement regions. The joint pieces interconnect the frame members and paired panels to form a cabinet. The cooling device is mounted the cabinet. A door assembly can also be mounted to the cabinet. Optionally, foam insulation is dispensed between the paired panels.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to cooled product merchandizing units. More particularly, it relates to modular cooled product merchandizing units assembled to a desired shape and size from a kit of parts.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Perishable and other food items are frequently displayed and sold at places of business (e.g. grocery or convenience stores, food courts, etc.). In many instances, the food items are maintained in inventory year-round and are often placed in a permanent merchandizing unit (e.g., large, glass door refrigerator or freezer). Other perishable food items are offered during promotions, and are better suited for presentation to customers in a temporary merchandizing unit. To this end, grocers and other sellers of food items have a need for temporary cooling units that are effective in safely cooling perishable food items. Similar needs arise for display of frozen food items.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One simple temporary merchandizing unit format is a disposable case containing ice packs and ice to cool the perishable items. Due to the limited cooling capacity, sellers disfavor this format. Another disincentive is the cost associated with their disposal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As an alternative, small scale refrigerators or freezers can be employed as a temporary cooled merchandizing unit. However, this approach is disfavored due primarily to the expense and lack of portability. Compressor-based cooling units are typically fairly large and are not easily moved to different locations within a store.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More recently, thermoelectric-based temporary merchandizing units have been developed, and provide many benefits over vapor pressure refrigerators. For example, the thermoelectric cooling device can be arranged in different thermoelectric orientations as no refrigeration fluids are utilized, affording the ability to create more stylized merchandizing unit appearances. Further, thermoelectric-based systems are lighter, potentially less expensive, and have significant life spans due to a lack of moving parts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regardless of the type of cooling technology employed, cooled merchandizing units are conventionally available to grocers and other end users in either an upright configuration or a coffin configuration. With either style, the unit manufacturer may have several &#x201c;standard&#x201d; sizes available for purchase. In many instances, however, the standard styles and/or sizes are less than optimal for a particular end use application. For example, an end user may have limited floor space available for the cooled merchandizing unit; the standard styles and sizes available from the manufacturer may not exactly meet these requirements. Similarly, end users oftentimes envision uniquely shaped merchandizing units for certain products; again, the standard units available from manufacturers may not satisfy these desires.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While a manufacturer could undoubtedly design a &#x201c;new&#x201d; cooled merchandizing unit commensurate with a particular end user's desired style and size, the costs associated with such efforts are highly prohibitive. Designing and manufacturing/assembling a cooled merchandizing unit entails not only intensive research and development efforts, but also the costs of manufacturing tooling necessary to produce and assemble the unit's components. Typically, tooling for a powered cooled merchandizing unit is quite expensive, on the order of 250 thousand dollars. By mass producing and selling only a few &#x201c;standard&#x201d; unit configurations, these costs can be recouped at a per unit price that is economically viable for most end users. However, if only one or a small quantity of a particular &#x201c;new&#x201d; or specialized unit were to be sold, the per unit price necessary to cover the corresponding costs would well exceed what the end user is willing to pay. Oftentimes, this prevents an end user's &#x201c;new&#x201d; merchandizing unit vision from going any further.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In light of the above, a need exists for a modular cooled merchandizing unit, and kits and methods for manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some aspects in accordance with principles of the present disclosure relate to a kit for constructing a modular cooled product merchandizing unit. The kit includes a plurality of panels, a multiplicity of extruded frame members, a multiplicity of molded joint pieces, and a cooling unit. The frame members each have a length between opposing ends and a continuous shape along the length. The shape defines an outer panel mounting assembly, an inner panel mounting assembly, and a joint capture region. The mounting assemblies each include opposing legs extending from a base web to define a panel engagement region. The mounting assemblies are arranged to retain two of the panels in a spaced apart, substantially parallel fashion. Further, the joint capture region is defined between the mounting assemblies. The joint pieces each include a block core and several plug assemblies. The block core forms first-sixth faces. First-third ones of the plug assemblies project from a respective one of the core faces, and each are configured to frictionally mate with one of the ends of a respective one of the frame members at the joint capture region thereof. With this construction, the kit is configured such that the frame members retain respective ones of the panels as paired inner and outer panels. The joint pieces interconnect the frame members and the walls to form a merchandizing cabinet. Finally, the cooling unit is mountable to a face of the cabinet (e.g., side, top, etc.), resulting in a modular cooled product merchandizing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The kits of the present disclosure provide all components needed to create a cooled product merchandizing unit of virtually any size or style as desired by an end user. In this regard, the panels and the frame members can be cut to desired sizes and shapes based upon the desired end size and shape of the merchandizing unit. In some constructions, the kit further includes a source of expandable foam insulation that is dispensed between the paired inner and outer panels. In yet other embodiments, the kit includes a door assembly formed, in part, by extruded door frame members and molded door corner connectors that are configured for pivotable mounting with selected ones of the frame members of the resultant cabinet. In yet other embodiments, the multiplicity of frame members includes at least three different frame member formats, such as a corner frame member, a clip frame member, and a horizontal platform frame member. In related embodiments, the multiplicity of joint pieces includes three-way corner connectors and four-way corner connectors. The so-provided frame members and joint pieces are readily assembleable to one another (along with the panels) to define virtually any sized and shaped merchandizing unit desired.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet other aspects in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure relate to a method of constructing a modular cooled product merchandizing unit. The method includes receiving a multiplicity of the extruded frame members as described above. A desired size and shape of a cabinet of the merchandizing unit is determined, and selected ones of the frame members are selected based upon the determined size and shape of the cabinet. The selected frame members are assembled to one another using the joint pieces described above to form a cabinet frame. In this regard, the frame members and the joint pieces combine to demarcate the cabinet frame into a plurality of frame face regions. Panels are assembled to the inner and outer panel mounting assemblies of each of the frame members associated with at least some of the frame face regions to define closed face regions. In this regard, each of the closed face regions includes a pair of the panels maintained in a spaced apart, substantially parallel fashion. Finally, a door assembly and a cooling unit are assembled to the cabinet frame. Methods in accordance with principles of the present disclosure can be used to form either a coffin-style merchandizing unit or an upright-style merchandizing unit using the frame members and the joint pieces. In other embodiments, methods include selecting specific ones of the frame members to define a perimeter of a door opening, with the methods further including mounting of the door assembly to the door opening.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One embodiment of a kit <b>30</b> for constructing a modular cooled product merchandizing unit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The kit <b>30</b> includes a plurality of panels <b>34</b>, a multiplicity of frame members <b>36</b>, a multiplicity of joint pieces <b>38</b>, and a cooling unit <b>40</b>. Details on the various components are provided below. In general terms, however, the frame members <b>36</b> are configured to retain respective pairs of the panels <b>34</b>, and the joint pieces <b>38</b> are configured to interconnect selected ones of the frame members <b>36</b> to one another. In this regard, various ones of the frame members <b>36</b> can incorporate differing features that facilitate a desired construction format, as can the joint pieces <b>38</b>. For example, certain ones of the frame members <b>36</b> can be selected to define a door opening perimeter configured to interface with an optional door assembly <b>42</b> provided with, or assembled from, the kit <b>30</b>. Further, the kit <b>30</b> can include an optional source of insulation <b>44</b> (shown in block form), such as an expandable foam insulation, for dispensement between various ones of the assembled panels <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The kit <b>30</b> can be employed to create and construct a cooled merchandizing unit with virtually any desired style and size, and in a cost effective manner. For example, one non-limiting example of merchandizing unit <b>46</b> formed from the kit <b>30</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> details an arrangement of various kit components <b>34</b>-<b>38</b> (referenced generally) in constructing the unit <b>46</b>. It will be understood that the unit <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref> is but one example of a modular cooled merchandizing unit configuration available with kits of the present disclosure. While certain general design parameters are implicated by the components <b>34</b>-<b>38</b> (e.g., right angle-type corners and generally planar exterior faces), a plethora of different unit styles and sizes can alternatively be created. Thus, the merchandizing units envisioned by the present disclosure are modular. For ease of explanation, details of the kit components are provided below with reference to some of the specific features identified for the unit <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>; however, the present disclosure is not limited to the unit <b>46</b> design. In more general terms, the panels <b>34</b>, the frame members <b>36</b>, and the joint pieces <b>38</b> are correspondingly configured to interface with one another in multiple different arrangements. While the frame members <b>36</b> and the joint pieces <b>38</b> can be provided in different formats with the kit <b>30</b>, with each different format incorporates common mounting features that facilitate assembly of any one formatted frame member <b>36</b> with any one formatted joint piece <b>38</b>. The panels <b>34</b>, and different formats of the frame members <b>36</b> and the joint pieces <b>38</b> are described below, followed by explanations of modular unit construction.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Panels <b>34</b></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the panels <b>34</b> can assume a variety of forms, and in some embodiments are formed of a cardboard, other paper-based material, plastic, metal, wood, or other rigid or semi-rigid material(s) and combinations thereof. The panels <b>34</b> can be provided with the kit <b>30</b> in a pre-cut form to the sizes and shapes generally reflected in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>. In other embodiments, however, larger versions of the panels <b>34</b> can be provided with the kit <b>30</b>, with individual ones of the panels <b>34</b> later being cut by a user to desired shapes and sizes when constructing the particular merchandizing unit <b>46</b>. Regardless, the panels <b>34</b> are planar or flat, and have a uniform thickness, for example in the range of 24 pt (for paperboard-type panels) to 0.1 inch.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Frame Member Formats</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The frame members <b>36</b> are extruded plastic components, for example extruded polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, polylactic acid, nylon, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, terephthalate, polymeric blends or hybrids, mineral-filled injection molded grade polymers, etc. As previously mentioned, the frame members <b>36</b> as provided with the kit <b>30</b> can have different formats, or can be identical. In general terms, each of the frame members <b>36</b> incorporates features for engaging and retaining at least one pair of the panels <b>34</b> in a substantially parallel arrangement (e.g., within 5&#xb0; of a truly parallel arrangement), with these features being referenced as &#x201c;panel mounting assemblies&#x201d; below. Further, each of the frame members <b>36</b> provides a mating feature at opposing ends <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> thereof (referenced for one of the frame members <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) that facilitates connection with a corresponding feature provided with the corner pieces <b>38</b>, such as &#x201c;guide shoulders&#x201d; and &#x201c;joint capture regions&#x201d; as described below. In some embodiments, the frame member formats included with the kit <b>30</b> include corner frame members, clip frame members, horizontal post frame members, and vertical post frame members. Regardless, the frame members <b>36</b>, as initially provided with the kit <b>30</b>, can have identical lengths selected to be longer than expected for any particular end unit design, with individual ones of the frame members <b>36</b> later being cut to desired lengths by a user during assembly. Alternatively, various ones of the frame members <b>36</b> can be pre-cut to different, standard lengths.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Corner Frame Member <b>60</b></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an end view of a corner or &#x201c;default&#x201d; frame member <b>60</b> otherwise useful as one of the kit frame members <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The corner frame member <b>60</b> shape reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is substantially uniformly defined along an entire length thereof. More particularly, the corner frame member <b>60</b> is extruded to form a first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b>, a first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b>, a second outer panel mounting assembly <b>66</b>, and a second inner panel mounting assembly <b>68</b>. The mounting assemblies <b>62</b>-<b>68</b> are similar in construction, and are generally configured to receive and frictionally retain a portion of a selected one of the panels <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). A guide shoulder or web <b>70</b> interconnects the outer mounting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> with the inner mounting assemblies <b>64</b>, <b>68</b>. Further, a first joint capture region or gap <b>72</b> is defined between the first mounting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and a second joint capture region <b>74</b> is defined between the second mounting assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>. The guide shoulder <b>70</b> and joint capture regions <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are collectively configured to interface with corresponding, common mounting features of the joint pieces <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b> includes a first or exterior leg <b>80</b>, a second or interior leg <b>82</b>, and an outer panel base web <b>84</b>. The first leg <b>80</b> includes or defines a fixed end <b>86</b> and an opposing free end <b>88</b>; the second leg <b>82</b> similarly defines a fixed end <b>90</b> and a free end <b>92</b>. The fixed ends <b>86</b>, <b>90</b> are attached to or contiguous with the outer panel base web <b>84</b>, such that the legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are slightly deflectable relative to the base web <b>84</b> at a pivot point effectively established at the corresponding fixed end <b>86</b>, <b>90</b>. In the normal or undeflected state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, however, the legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> extend in a substantially parallel fashion (e.g., within 5&#xb0; of a truly parallel relationship) from the base web <b>84</b>. The first leg free end <b>88</b> forms a tab <b>94</b> that projects generally transversely toward the second leg <b>82</b>. The second leg free end <b>92</b> also includes or forms a tab <b>96</b> projecting generally transversely toward the first leg <b>80</b>. The first leg tab <b>94</b> can be thicker than the second leg tab <b>96</b> as shown; alternatively, the tabs <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> can have identical constructions. Regardless, and for reasons made clear below, an outer face <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>, respectively, of each of the tabs <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> can have a rearward angle of extension or slope (i.e., projecting not only transversely toward the opposing leg <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> but also toward the base web <b>84</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A panel engagement region <b>102</b> is defined between the legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, terminating at the outer panel base web <b>84</b>. A transverse dimension (i.e., perpendicular to the planes of the legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>) of the panel engagement region <b>102</b> is relatively uniform from the fixed ends <b>86</b>, <b>90</b> toward the free ends <b>88</b>, <b>92</b>, and is generally commensurate with (e.g., slightly larger than) a thickness of each of the panels <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), for example on the order of 0.25 inch. A gap <b>104</b>, if any, defined between the tabs <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> (in the normal or undeflected state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is less than the transverse dimension of a remainder of the panel engagement region <b>102</b>, and is less than the panel thickness. With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b> receives and retains one of the panels <b>34</b> with insertion of the panel <b>34</b> into the panel engagement region <b>102</b>. The tabs <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> frictionally contact and engage the panel <b>34</b>, with a thickness of the panel <b>34</b> causing one or both of the legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> to deflect transversely away from the other (effectively pivoting at the corresponding fixed end <b>86</b>, <b>90</b>). The sloped angle of extension associated with the tabs <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> promotes insertion of the panel <b>34</b> through the gap <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and into the panel engagement region <b>102</b> in the insertion direction I (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). However, the tabs <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> frictionally resist removal of the panel <b>34</b> from the panel engagement region <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b> is, in many respects, identical to the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b> described above. For example, a first or exterior leg <b>110</b> and a second or interior leg <b>112</b> extend from an inner panel base web <b>114</b> in a substantially parallel fashion (e.g., within 5&#xb0; of a truly parallel relationship) in the normal or undeflected state shown. The legs <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> each terminate at a free end <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, respectively, that forms a corresponding tab <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. Further, a panel engagement region <b>124</b> is defined between the legs <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. The inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b> is thus configured to receive and retain an edge portion one of the panels <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> of the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b> are substantially parallel (e.g., within 5&#xb0; of a truly parallel relationship) with the legs <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> of the first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b> in the normal or undeflected state, such that a panel inserted into the panel engagement region <b>124</b> of the inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b> will be retained in a substantially parallel arrangement (e.g., with 5&#xb0; of a truly parallel arrangement) with a panel captured by the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b>. The corner frame member <b>60</b> can be dimensioned such that the free ends <b>88</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> of the first outer and inner panel mounting assembly legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are substantially coplanar. With embodiments in which the guide shoulder <b>70</b> extends at an angle &#x3b1; of less than 90&#xb0; from the first outer panel mounting assembly legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, then, a length of the inner mounting assembly panel legs <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> (i.e., dimension parallel with the X axis labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is less than those of the outer panel mounting assembly legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. In some embodiments, the extension angle &#x3b1; is approximately 45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The first joint capture region <b>72</b> is defined as a transverse gap between the first outer and inner panel mounting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and in particular between the interior leg <b>82</b> of the outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b> and the exterior leg <b>110</b> of the inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b>. For reasons made clear below, the joint capture region <b>72</b> is transversely dimensioned in accordance with a corresponding, common feature of the joint pieces <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) to facilitate coupling of one of the joint pieces <b>38</b> with the corner frame member <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second outer panel mounting assembly <b>66</b> can be identical to the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b>, and includes a first or exterior leg <b>140</b> and a second or interior leg <b>142</b> extending from the outer panel base web <b>84</b> to form a panel engagement region <b>144</b> commensurate with the above descriptions. The legs <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the second outer panel mounting assembly <b>66</b> are substantially perpendicular with the first outer panel mounting assembly legs <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> (e.g., within 5&#xb0; of a truly perpendicular relationship in the undeflected state). Similarly, the second inner panel mounting assembly <b>68</b> can be identical to the first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b>, and includes first and second legs <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> projecting from the inner panel base web <b>124</b> to form a panel engagement region <b>154</b> commensurate with the above descriptions. The second inner panel mounting assembly legs <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> are substantially perpendicular with the legs <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> of the first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b> in the undeflected state. With this arrangement, the second outer and inner panel mounting assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> can receive and retain two of the panels <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) in a substantially parallel manner (e.g., within 5 degrees of a truly parallel relationship) alone or when coupled with other components such as joint pieces <b>38</b> and other frame members <b>36</b>. Finally, the second joint capture region <b>74</b> is defined as a transverse gap between the legs <b>142</b>, <b>150</b> of the mounting assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The corner frame member <b>60</b> can be symmetrical relative to a central plane of the guide shoulder web <b>70</b>, with the inner and outer panel base webs <b>84</b>, <b>114</b> being aligned with the guide shoulder <b>70</b>. Regardless, a thickness of the guide shoulder <b>70</b> and angle relative to the panel mounting assemblies <b>62</b>-<b>68</b> corresponds with an engagement feature commonly provided with the joint pieces <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The extruded shape of the corner frame member <b>60</b> is uniformly maintained along an entire length of the corner frame member <b>60</b>. In other words, the above described features exist at both of the opposing ends <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) of the corner frame member <b>60</b>, as well as along a length thereof</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Clip Frame Member <b>160</b></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another frame member configuration useful with the kits <b>30</b> of the present disclosure is an extruded clip frame member <b>160</b>. In some respects, the clip frame member <b>160</b> is akin to the corner frame member <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and includes an outer panel mounting assembly <b>162</b> and an inner panel mounting assembly <b>164</b>. In addition, the clip frame member <b>160</b> includes a connection web <b>166</b>, first and second guide shoulders <b>168</b>, <b>170</b>, a support web <b>172</b>, and a flange <b>174</b>. Finally, first and second joint capture regions or gaps <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The outer panel mounting assembly <b>162</b> can be identical to the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) described above with respect to the corner frame member <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and includes a first or exterior leg <b>180</b> and a second or interior leg <b>182</b> projecting in a substantially parallel fashion (in the normal or undeflected state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) from an outer panel base web <b>184</b>. As with previous embodiments, a transverse spacing between the legs <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> defines a panel engagement region <b>186</b>, with one or both of the legs <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> optionally forming a sloped, inwardly projecting tab <b>188</b>, <b>190</b>, respectively, that is sized and arranged to receive and frictionally capture an edge portion of one of the panels <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) within the engagement region <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The inner panel mounting assembly <b>164</b> can be identical to the first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) described above with respect to the corner frame member <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and includes first and second legs <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> extending in a substantially parallel manner (in the undeflected state) from an inner panel base web <b>204</b>. Once again, a transverse spacing between the legs <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> establishes a panel engagement region <b>206</b>, with one or both of the legs <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> optionally forming a sloped, inwardly projecting tab <b>207</b>, <b>208</b> at a free end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The inner and outer mounting assemblies <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are arranged relative to one another to receive and retain two of the panels <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) in a substantially parallel fashion (e.g., within 5&#xb0; of truly parallel relationship) either alone or when the clip frame member <b>160</b> is coupled with other components such as the joint pieces <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). That is to say, the legs <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> are substantially parallel with one another (in at least the normal or undeflected state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Finally, the first joint capture region <b>176</b> is defined as a transverse gap between the second leg <b>182</b> of the outer panel mounting assembly <b>162</b> and the inner panel mounting assembly first leg <b>200</b>. The joint capture region <b>176</b> is sized in accordance with a common mounting feature provided with the joint pieces <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The connection web <b>166</b> interconnects the outer panel mounting assembly <b>162</b> with the inner panel mounting assembly <b>164</b>, and establishes the substantially parallel relationship therebetween. For example, the connection web <b>166</b> includes a first segment <b>210</b> extending from the outer panel base web <b>184</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular with the outer panel mounting assembly legs <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>. A second segment <b>212</b> extends horizontally (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) from the first segment <b>210</b>, with the second segment <b>212</b> being substantially perpendicular to the first segment <b>210</b>. The flange <b>174</b> extends from the second segment <b>212</b> opposite the first segment <b>210</b> in a direction away from the inner panel mounting assembly <b>164</b> (e.g., substantially perpendicular to the first segment <b>210</b>). Finally, a third segment <b>214</b> extends from the second segment <b>212</b> at a location spatially between the flange <b>174</b> and the first segment <b>210</b>. As shown, the third segment <b>214</b> projects toward the outer panel mounting assembly <b>162</b>, and locates the inner panel mounting assembly <b>164</b> so as to establish the first joint capture region <b>176</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The first guide shoulder <b>168</b> is akin to the guide shoulder <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) described above with respect to the corner frame member <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and extends inwardly from the outer panel mounting assembly <b>162</b>. In particular, relative to the planes established by the outer panel mounting assembly legs <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>, projection of the first guide shoulder <b>168</b> forms the angle &#x3b1; described above that can be on the order of 45&#xb0;. A thickness of the first retention shoulder <b>168</b> corresponds with a common mounting feature provided with the joint pieces <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) as described below. The second guide shoulder <b>170</b> projects outwardly from the inner panel mounting assembly <b>164</b>, and is aligned with the first guide shoulder <b>168</b>. While the guide shoulders <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> can be spaced from one another as shown, in other constructions, a homogenous web can be employed (e.g., akin to the singular guide shoulder <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The support web <b>172</b> extends from the outer panel base web <b>184</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular with the outer panel mounting assembly legs <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>. The support web <b>172</b> provides a surface for interfacing with a common mounting feature provided with the joint pieces <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). A transverse gap between the support web <b>172</b> and the third segment <b>214</b> of the connection web <b>166</b> defines the second joint capture region <b>178</b>. In other embodiments, the support web <b>172</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The flange <b>174</b> extends from the connection web <b>166</b> in a direction opposite the outer and inner mounting assemblies <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, and is laterally offset from a common plane established by the free ends of the legs <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>202</b>. As described below, the flange <b>174</b> provides a bearing surface against which the door assembly <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), or other components of the assembled cooled product merchandizing unit <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), can be selectively received.</p>

For example, each of the interior faces <b>410</b><i>a</i>-<b>410</b><i>c </i>forms first-fourth slots <b>440</b>-<b>446</b>. The slots <b>440</b>-<b>446</b> are defined as depressions into the corresponding face <b>410</b><i>a</i>-<b>410</b><i>c</i>, and have a width approximating (e.g., slightly greater than) a thickness of the panels <b>34</b>. Further, the slots <b>440</b>-<b>446</b> are arranged and oriented relative to the corresponding plug assembly <b>404</b><i>a</i>-<b>404</b><i>c </i>so as to receive a corresponding one of the panels <b>34</b> otherwise maintained by to the frame member <b>36</b> coupled to the plug assembly <b>404</b><i>a</i>-<b>404</b><i>c</i>. With reference to the first face <b>410</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the first slot <b>440</b> is located between the first plug assembly <b>404</b><i>a </i>and the fourth face <b>410</b><i>d</i>. The second slot <b>442</b> is located between the first plug assembly <b>404</b><i>a </i>and the third face <b>410</b><i>c</i>. Further, both of the first and second slots <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> extend to, and are open at, the second face <b>410</b><i>b</i>. The first and second slots <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> are substantially parallel with one another, and establish an angular relationship with the channel <b>436</b> equal to the extension angle &#x3b2; (e.g., 45&#xb0;). With this construction, and with additional reference to the angled frame member <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, mounting of the three-way corner connector <b>400</b> to the corner frame member <b>60</b>, and in particular insertion of the guide shoulder <b>70</b> into the channel <b>436</b>, aligns the first slot <b>440</b> with the panel engagement region <b>102</b> of the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b>, and the second slot <b>442</b> with the panel engagement region <b>102</b> of the first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b>. As a result, a first panel (not shown) otherwise assembled to the first outer panel mounting assembly <b>62</b> can nest within the first slot <b>440</b>, and a second panel (not shown) assembled to the first inner panel mounting assembly <b>64</b> will nest within the second slot <b>442</b>. The third and fourth slots <b>444</b>, <b>446</b> establish a similar relationship relative to the second outer and inner panel mounting assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>. Thus, the third and fourth slots <b>444</b>, <b>446</b> are orthogonally arranged relative to the first and second slots <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>. The slots <b>440</b>-<b>446</b> in the second and third faces <b>410</b><i>b</i>, <b>410</b><i>c </i>are similarly arranged. Finally, and as best reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the so-defined slots <b>440</b>-<b>446</b> can be continuous across or open relative to adjacent faces <b>410</b><i>a</i>-<b>410</b><i>c</i>. For example, the first slot <b>440</b> is formed by, and open relative to, the first and second faces <b>410</b><i>a</i>, <b>410</b><i>b. </i></p>

In many respects, the four-way corner connector <b>460</b> is identical to the three-way corner connector <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A-7C</figref>) described above, and includes a block core <b>462</b> and a plurality of plug assemblies <b>464</b><i>a</i>-<b>464</b><i>d</i>. The block core <b>462</b> forms first-sixth faces <b>470</b><i>a</i>-<b>470</b><i>f</i>, adjacent ones of which are substantially orthogonally arranged. The plug assemblies <b>464</b><i>a</i>-<b>464</b><i>d </i>can be identical to the plug assemblies <b>404</b><i>a</i>-<b>404</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>) described above, and each include opposing prong bodies <b>472</b>, <b>474</b> having first and second engagement surfaces <b>476</b>, <b>478</b> that combine to define a channel <b>480</b> as previously described. With the four-way corner connector <b>460</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, however, four of the plug assemblies <b>464</b><i>a</i>-<b>464</b><i>d </i>are provided, respective ones of which project from a corresponding one of the first-fourth faces <b>470</b><i>a</i>-<b>470</b><i>d</i>. Thus, the first-fourth faces <b>470</b><i>a</i>-<b>470</b><i>d </i>define interior surfaces of the block core <b>462</b>, while the fifth and sixth faces <b>470</b><i>e</i>, <b>470</b><i>f </i>serve as exterior surfaces during use. With this construction, the first and second plug assemblies <b>464</b><i>a</i>, <b>464</b><i>b </i>extend in a substantially perpendicular fashion relative to the third and fourth plug assemblies <b>464</b><i>c</i>, <b>464</b><i>d</i>; the third and fourth plug assemblies <b>464</b><i>c</i>, <b>464</b><i>d </i>are aligned with one another, and are substantially perpendicular to the first and second plug assemblies <b>464</b><i>a</i>, <b>464</b><i>b</i>. Finally, the four-way corner connector <b>460</b> optionally forms various panel-receiving slots that are open at one or more of the interior faces <b>470</b><i>a</i>-<b>470</b><i>d</i>. For example, in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, first-sixth slots <b>482</b><i>a</i>-<b>482</b><i>f </i>are identified. The first and second slots <b>482</b><i>a</i>, <b>482</b><i>b </i>are open to the first and third faces <b>470</b><i>a</i>, <b>470</b><i>c</i>; the third and fourth slots <b>482</b><i>c</i>, <b>482</b><i>d </i>are open to the first and fourth faces <b>470</b><i>a</i>, <b>470</b><i>d</i>; and the fifth and sixth slots <b>482</b><i>e</i>, <b>482</b><i>f </i>are open to the first and second faces <b>470</b><i>a</i>, <b>470</b><i>b </i>for reasons made clear below.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As described below, the corner connectors <b>400</b>, <b>460</b> facilitate formation of all the joints necessary to complete many desired merchandizing unit end configurations. In other embodiments, kits of the present disclosure can include additional joint piece formats. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> illustrates an optional three-way tee connector <b>500</b>. The three-way tee connector <b>500</b> can be an injection molded plastic component, and in many respects is akin to the corner connectors <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), <b>460</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) described above. The three-way tee connector <b>500</b> includes a block core <b>502</b>, first and second plug assemblies <b>504</b><i>a</i>, <b>504</b><i>b</i>, and a post assembly <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The block core <b>502</b> is a generally cube-shaped body, and defines first-sixth faces <b>510</b><i>a</i>-<b>510</b><i>f </i>For reasons made clear below, the first-third and fifth faces <b>510</b><i>a</i>-<b>510</b><i>c</i>, and <b>510</b><i>e </i>serve as interior surfaces during use, whereas the fourth and sixth faces <b>510</b><i>d</i>, <b>510</b><i>f </i>are exterior surfaces.</p>

The first plug assembly <b>504</b><i>a </i>projects from the first face <b>510</b><i>a</i>, whereas the second plug assembly <b>504</b><i>b </i>projects from the third face <b>510</b><i>c</i>. The plug assemblies <b>504</b><i>a</i>, <b>504</b><i>b </i>can be identical, with the following description of the first plug assembly <b>504</b><i>a </i>applying equally to the second plug assembly <b>504</b><i>b</i>. The first plug assembly <b>504</b><i>a </i>includes first and second prong bodies <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> projecting from the first face <b>510</b><i>a</i>. The first prong body <b>512</b> can be identical to the prong bodies <b>420</b>, <b>422</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) described above, and defines first and second engagement surfaces <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> commensurate with previous descriptions. The second prong body <b>514</b> includes first-third fingers <b>520</b>-<b>524</b> each defining an engagement surface <b>526</b>-<b>530</b>. The second and third fingers <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> extend in a spaced apart, substantially parallel fashion from opposite sides of the first finger <b>520</b> to form a trough <b>532</b>. A terminal end of each of the second and third fingers <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> can be co-planar with the second face <b>510</b><i>b</i>. As shown, the trough <b>532</b> is continuous through the block core <b>502</b> and the second plug assembly <b>504</b><i>b</i>, and is open at the second face <b>510</b><i>b. </i></p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Methods of constructing a cooled merchandizing unit with kits of the present disclosure include the user initially determining a style and size of the desired end unit. For example, the desired unit can have an upright style, a coffin style, etc. The styles and dimensions of the desired unit is virtually limitless with the kits <b>30</b> of the present disclosure. Once the style and size of the desired unit has been determined, various ones of the frame members <b>36</b> are selected. Where necessary, the selected frame members <b>36</b> are cut to lengths corresponding with the selected shape and size. The frame members <b>36</b> and the joint pieces <b>38</b> are assembled to define a cabinet frame that optionally defines at least one door opening. Contemporaneously with formation of the cabinet frame, the panels <b>34</b> are mounted at or along the various faces of the frame (except at the designated door opening), resulting in a completed cabinet. Selection of a particular format frame member <b>36</b> for a particular segment or region of the cabinet frame can be a function of the desired door opening location, as well as other desired features of the end merchandizing unit. Insulation is applied to the cabinet, and other components such as the cooling unit <b>40</b> and the door assembly <b>42</b> are then mounted to the cabinet.</p>

Alternatively, the cooling unit <b>40</b> can be assembled to any other face of the cabinet <b>600</b> (e.g., back, front, side, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Finally, the door assembly <b>42</b> is assembled to the door opening <b>602</b>. In some embodiments, the door assembly <b>42</b> is provided as a completed structure with kits of the present disclosure. Under these circumstances, the cabinet <b>600</b> is constructed such that the door opening <b>602</b> corresponds in size and shape with the provided door assembly <b>42</b>. In other embodiments, a size and shape of the door assembly <b>42</b> can be selected and assembled by the user using additional components provided with the kit described below.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Door Assembly <b>42</b></p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the door assembly <b>42</b> components optionally provided with the kit <b>30</b> can include one or more panes <b>700</b>, a plurality of door frame members <b>702</b>, a plurality of hinge connectors <b>704</b>, and a plurality of handle connectors <b>706</b>. Additional components, such as a plurality of caps <b>708</b>, can also be included.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The panes <b>700</b> are rigid planar bodies formed of a transparent or substantially transparent material having insulative properties. For example, the panes <b>700</b> can be a polyethylene terephthalate Plexiglas material (PETG). The panes <b>700</b> have a substantially uniform thickness, for example on the order of 0.080 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The door frame members <b>702</b> are, in many respects, akin to the frame members <b>36</b>, formed as elongated plastic extrusions and configured to retain two of the panes <b>700</b> in a spaced apart, substantially parallel arrangement. The door frame members <b>702</b> have a substantially uniform shape along an entire length thereof, one example of which is shown by the end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The door frame member <b>702</b> includes or forms first and second pane mounting assemblies <b>720</b><i>a</i>, <b>720</b><i>b</i>, and a connection web <b>722</b>, and guide shoulders <b>724</b><i>a</i>, <b>724</b><i>b</i>. The connection web <b>722</b> interconnects the mounting assemblies <b>720</b><i>a</i>, <b>720</b><i>b</i>, and combines with the shoulders <b>724</b><i>a</i>, <b>724</b><i>b </i>to form a joint capture region <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The pane mounting assemblies <b>720</b><i>a</i>, <b>720</b><i>b </i>are identical in some embodiments, with the following description of the first pane mounting assembly <b>720</b><i>a </i>applying equally to the second pane mounting assembly <b>720</b><i>b</i>. The pane mounting assembly <b>720</b><i>a </i>includes an opposing pair of legs <b>728</b><i>a</i>, <b>730</b><i>a </i>and a pane base web <b>732</b><i>a</i>. The legs <b>728</b><i>a</i>, <b>730</b><i>a </i>extend from the base web <b>732</b><i>a </i>in a substantially parallel fashion (e.g., within 5 degrees from a truly parallel relationship) in the normal or undeflected state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, each terminating at a free end <b>734</b><i>a</i>, <b>736</b><i>a </i>that optionally forms an inwardly projecting tab <b>738</b><i>a</i>, <b>740</b><i>a</i>. A transverse spacing between the legs <b>728</b><i>a</i>, <b>730</b><i>a </i>defines a pane engagement region <b>742</b><i>a</i>, with a gap <b>744</b><i>a </i>between the tabs <b>738</b><i>a</i>, <b>740</b><i>a </i>having a reduced transverse dimension as compared to a remainder of the pane engagement region <b>742</b><i>a</i>. More particularly, a width of the gap <b>744</b><i>a </i>is less than a thickness of the panes <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) such that upon insertion of one of the panes <b>700</b> into the pane engagement region <b>742</b><i>a</i>, the tabs <b>738</b><i>a</i>, <b>740</b><i>a </i>frictionally engage the pane <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The pane base webs <b>732</b><i>a</i>, <b>732</b><i>b </i>extend from opposites sides of the connection web <b>722</b>. For reasons made clear below, in some constructions, the pane base webs <b>732</b><i>a</i>, <b>732</b><i>b </i>can have an exteriorly curved shape.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The connection web <b>722</b> arranges the pane mounting assemblies <b>720</b><i>a</i>, <b>720</b><i>b </i>such that the legs <b>728</b><i>a</i>, <b>728</b><i>b</i>, <b>730</b><i>a</i>, <b>730</b><i>b </i>are substantially parallel (e.g., within 5&#xb0; of a truly parallel relationship) in the normal or undeflected state. Thus, when two of the panes <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) are coupled within respective ones of the pane engagement regions <b>742</b><i>a</i>, <b>742</b><i>b</i>, the two panes <b>700</b> are maintained in spaced apart, substantially parallel arrangement (either by door frame member <b>702</b> alone, or in combination with other components such as the connectors <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>)).</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The first guide shoulder <b>724</b><i>a </i>projects from the interior leg <b>730</b><i>a </i>of the first pane mounting assembly <b>720</b><i>a </i>toward the second pane mounting assembly <b>720</b><i>b</i>. The second guide shoulder <b>724</b><i>b </i>is aligned with the first guide shoulder <b>724</b><i>a</i>, extending from the second pane mounting assembly interior leg <b>730</b><i>b</i>. In some configurations, the guide shoulders <b>724</b><i>a</i>, <b>724</b><i>b </i>are discretely spaced from one another so as to not impede deflection of the interior legs <b>730</b><i>a</i>, <b>730</b><i>b </i>when receiving the panes <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and/or permit insertion of a third pane therebetween. Alternatively, the guide shoulders <b>724</b><i>a</i>, <b>724</b><i>b </i>can be formed as a single, homogenous web. Regardless, a lateral distance between the guide shoulders <b>724</b><i>a</i>, <b>724</b><i>b </i>and an inner surface <b>746</b> of the connection web <b>722</b> corresponds with a common mounting feature of the connectors <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) to promote coupling within the joint capture region <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the connectors <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> are akin to the joint pieces <b>36</b>, provided in either a hinge or handle format. One embodiment of the hinge connector <b>704</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23C</figref>, and generally includes a core <b>760</b>, first and second prong bodies <b>762</b><i>a</i>, <b>762</b><i>b</i>, and a pin <b>764</b>. The hinge connector <b>704</b> can be a homogenous injection molded plastic part having a rigid, structurally robust construction.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The core <b>760</b> defines an exterior surface <b>770</b> (referenced generally) and an interior surface <b>772</b>. The interior surface <b>772</b> provides or forms first and second faces <b>774</b>, <b>776</b>, and an intermediate face <b>778</b>. The first and second faces <b>774</b>, <b>776</b> are generally planar, arranged substantially perpendicular to one another. While the first and second faces <b>774</b>, <b>776</b> are planar, the intermediate face <b>778</b> can have the concave curvature as shown. Other shapes are also acceptable. Regardless, first and second slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b> are formed into a thickness of the core <b>760</b> at opposite sides of the plug bodies <b>762</b><i>a</i>, <b>762</b><i>b</i>. The slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b> are open to the interior surface <b>772</b>, and are substantially parallel with one another, and are generally sized to receive one of the panes <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). In some constructions, the slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b> are formed to have a uniformly increasing width from the first face <b>774</b> to the second face <b>776</b>. That is to say, a width of the slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b> at the first face <b>774</b> is less than a width of the slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b> at the second face <b>776</b>. Optionally, the core <b>760</b> can form an additional third slot <b>784</b> into the interior surface <b>772</b>, located between, and substantially parallel to, the first and second slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b>. Where provided, the third slot <b>784</b> has the tapered width characteristics described above with respect to the first and second slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b>, and intersects the prong bodies <b>762</b><i>a</i>, <b>762</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The first prong body <b>762</b><i>a </i>projects from the first face <b>774</b>; the second prong body <b>762</b><i>b </i>projects from the second face <b>776</b>. Consistent with the above explanations then, a direction of extension of the first prong body <b>762</b><i>a </i>is substantially orthogonal to a direction of extension of the second prong body <b>762</b><i>b </i>(e.g., within 5&#xb0; of a truly perpendicular relationship).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The prong bodies <b>762</b><i>a</i>, <b>762</b><i>b </i>are sized and shaped to frictionally interface with the joint capture region <b>726</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) provided with the door frame members <b>702</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). For example, the first prong body <b>762</b><i>a </i>has a generally rectangular or square shape in transverse cross-section, defining first-fourth sides <b>790</b><i>a</i>-<b>796</b><i>a </i>(best identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>). With embodiments in which the hinge connector <b>704</b> includes the third slot <b>784</b>, a secondary slot <b>798</b><i>a </i>is formed through the fourth side <b>796</b><i>a </i>of the first prong body <b>762</b><i>a </i>and is aligned with (and open to) the third slot <b>784</b>. The second prong body <b>762</b><i>b </i>can be essentially identical to the first plug body <b>762</b><i>a</i>, defining four sides <b>790</b><i>b</i>-<b>796</b><i>b</i>. Further, a secondary slot <b>798</b><i>b </i>is formed through the fourth side <b>796</b><i>b</i>, and is aligned with (and open to) the third slot <b>784</b> (where provided). In accordance with previous descriptions with respect to the tapered width of the third slot <b>784</b>, the secondary slot <b>798</b><i>b </i>in the second prong body <b>762</b><i>b </i>is wider than the secondary slot <b>798</b><i>a </i>in the first prong body <b>762</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The pin <b>764</b> can assume various shapes and sizes, and is generally configured to facilitate a rotatable mounting of the hinge connector <b>704</b> with a separate bushing. Thus, the pin <b>764</b> can have the cylindrical shape shown. Regardless, the pin <b>764</b> projects from the exterior surface <b>770</b> in a direction generally aligned with, but opposite of, the second prong body <b>762</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A-24C</figref> illustrate one embodiment of the handle connector <b>706</b>. In many respects the handle connector <b>706</b> is akin to the hinge connector <b>704</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23C</figref>), and includes a core <b>810</b>, first and second prong bodies <b>812</b><i>a</i>, <b>812</b><i>b</i>, and a handle body <b>814</b>. The core <b>810</b> defines an exterior surface <b>820</b> (referenced generally) and an interior surface <b>822</b>. The exterior surface <b>820</b> has opposing major faces <b>824</b>, <b>826</b>. The interior surface <b>822</b> is defined by a first face <b>828</b>, a second face <b>830</b>, and an intermediate face <b>832</b>. The first and second faces <b>828</b>, <b>830</b> are substantially planar, and are arranged in a substantially perpendicular fashion relative to one another. The intermediate face <b>832</b> can have the convex curvature shown in extension between the first and second faces <b>828</b>, <b>830</b>, although other shapes are also envisioned. First and second slots <b>834</b>, <b>836</b> are formed in a thickness of the core <b>810</b>, extending in a substantially parallel fashion at opposite sides of the prong bodies <b>812</b><i>a</i>, <b>812</b><i>b</i>. The slots <b>834</b>, <b>836</b> are open to the interior surface <b>822</b>, and are sized to receive one of the panes <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). In some constructions, the slots <b>834</b>, <b>836</b> exhibit an expanding width in extension from the first face <b>828</b> to the second face <b>830</b>. Optionally, a third slot <b>838</b> can be formed between the first and second slots <b>834</b>, <b>836</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The prong bodies <b>812</b><i>a</i>, <b>812</b><i>b </i>can be identical to the prong bodies <b>762</b><i>a</i>, <b>762</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23C</figref>) described above. The first prong body <b>812</b><i>a </i>projects from the first face <b>828</b>, whereas the second prong body <b>812</b><i>b </i>projects from the second face <b>830</b>. Thus, the prong bodies <b>812</b><i>a</i>, <b>812</b><i>b </i>are substantially perpendicular to one another. The first prong body <b>812</b><i>a </i>defines four sides <b>850</b><i>a</i>-<b>856</b><i>a</i>; the second prong body <b>812</b><i>b </i>defines four sides <b>850</b><i>b</i>-<b>856</b><i>b</i>. The prong bodies <b>812</b><i>a</i>, <b>812</b><i>b </i>can further form a secondary slot <b>858</b><i>a</i>, <b>858</b><i>b </i>that is aligned with, and open to, the third slot <b>838</b> (where provided).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The handle body <b>814</b> projects from the first major face <b>824</b>, and can be contiguous with the intermediate face <b>832</b> of the interior surface <b>772</b>. Alternatively, the handle body <b>814</b> can assume other shapes, and can be located at other locations relative to the first major face <b>824</b>. Regardless, the handle body <b>814</b> provides a convenient surface for grasping by a user as part of a door opening operation described below.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The optional cap <b>708</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>. The cap <b>708</b> is an injection molded plastic component, and includes a hub <b>870</b> and a flange <b>872</b>. The hub <b>870</b> and the flange <b>872</b> have a cylindrical shape, with an outer diameter of the flange <b>872</b> being greater than that of the hub <b>870</b>. A bore <b>874</b> extends longitudinally through the cap <b>708</b>. A diameter of the bore <b>874</b> is sized to rotatably receive the hinge connector pin <b>764</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>). Finally, an annular barb <b>876</b> is optionally provided along the hub <b>870</b>.

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, construction of the door assembly <b>42</b> includes mounting the door frame members <b>702</b> and the connectors <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> about the panes <b>700</b> (one of which is identified in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) and to one another. With embodiments in which the kit <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) is configured to allow a user to select dimensions of the door assembly <b>42</b>, the user first determines a desired size of the door assembly <b>42</b> and then prepares (e.g., cuts to size) the panes <b>700</b> and the door frame members <b>702</b>. Mounting of the door frame members <b>702</b> to two of the panes <b>700</b><i>a</i>, <b>700</b><i>b </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, and entails a side edge of each of the panes <b>700</b><i>a</i>, <b>700</b><i>b </i>being frictionally captured within the pane engagement region <b>742</b><i>a</i>, <b>742</b><i>b </i>of a corresponding one of the pane mounting assemblies <b>720</b><i>a</i>, <b>720</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the door frame member <b>702</b> can maintain the panes <b>700</b><i>a</i>, <b>700</b><i>b </i>in a spaced apart, substantially parallel arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the connectors <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> not only interconnect the door frame members <b>702</b>, but assist in maintaining the spaced apart arrangement of the panes <b>700</b><i>a</i>, <b>700</b><i>b </i>(one of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). As a point of reference, the outer pane <b>700</b><i>a </i>is dimensioned to be slightly larger than a length of the corresponding frame members <b>702</b>. For example, a length of first side edge <b>880</b> (referenced generally) of the pane <b>700</b><i>a </i>is longer than a length of the first door frame member <b>702</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the first side edge <b>880</b> projects beyond the first door frame member <b>702</b><i>a </i>and is coupled to the first hinge connector <b>704</b><i>a </i>and the first handle connector <b>706</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Mounting of one of the hinge connector <b>704</b> to one of the door frame members <b>702</b> is reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, and includes insertion of the prong body <b>762</b><i>a </i>into the frame member joint capture region <b>726</b>. In this regard, the door frame member <b>702</b> and the prong body <b>762</b><i>a </i>are frictionally engaged or locked to one another, with the sides <b>790</b><i>a</i>-<b>796</b><i>a </i>of the prong body <b>762</b><i>a </i>bearing or abutting against surfaces of the door frame member <b>702</b>. Further, the first and second slots <b>780</b>, <b>782</b> of the hinge connector <b>704</b> are aligned with the pane engagement regions <b>742</b><i>a</i>, <b>742</b><i>b </i>of the door frame member <b>702</b> such that the panes <b>700</b><i>a</i>, <b>700</b><i>ba </i>are physically connected to the hinge connector <b>704</b>.

For ease of explanation, the vertical post frame member <b>320</b> (otherwise coupled to the post assembly <b>506</b>) is omitted from the view, as are the panels <b>34</b><i>w</i>-<b>34</b><i>z </i>(it being understood that the panels <b>34</b><i>y</i>, <b>34</b><i>z </i>are mounted to the first inner and outer panel mounting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the first corner frame member <b>60</b><i>a</i>, and the panels <b>34</b><i>x</i>, <b>34</b><i>w </i>are mounted to the second corner frame member <b>60</b><i>b</i>). The first plug assembly <b>504</b><i>a </i>of the tee connector <b>500</b> is frictionally mounted to the second joint capture regions <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the first frame member <b>60</b><i>a </i>(i.e., the second prong body <b>514</b> is frictionally coupled to the second joint capture region <b>74</b>; the first prong body <b>512</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) being hidden in the view). Though partially obstructed in the view, the guide shoulder <b>70</b> is received within the channel <b>534</b>. The second plug assembly <b>504</b><i>b </i>is similarly fractionally coupled to the second corner frame member <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Notably, the trough <b>532</b> of the tee connector <b>500</b> is open to the second joint capture region <b>74</b> of each of the corner frame members <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>. With this construction, foam insulation dispensed between spaced apart panels (not shown) otherwise coupled to the second outer and inner panel mounting assemblies <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> of the frame members <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>will flow or spread into the trough <b>532</b>, thereby binding the panels, the frame members <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>and the tee connector <b>500</b> together upon hardening. Similarly assemblies are achieved with the four-way tee connector <b>560</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In addition to providing for a plethora of differently dimensioned modular coolers, the kit <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) can be assembled to form a modular cooled merchandizing unit having a style other than the upright style of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref> shows another modular cooled merchandizing unit <b>900</b> constructed from kits of the present disclosure and having a coffin style. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref> is another modular cooled merchandizing unit <b>910</b> constructed from kits of the present disclosure and having an enclosed, cooled section <b>912</b> and open, room temperature sections <b>914</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The kits, methods, and modular units of the present disclosure provide a marked improvement over previous designs. A cooled product merchandizing unit having virtually any style, shape, or size can be constructed. Manufacturers are no longer required to invest in expensive tooling to generate a &#x201c;new&#x201d; merchandizing unit. Instead, any desired merchandizing unit can be quickly designed and assembled using the kits and methods of the present disclosure. Further, following use of the constructed modular cooling unit, some of the individual components can be disassembled and reused. For example, one or more of the frame members, joint pieces, or cooling unit used for a first cooling unit can later be reused with a second cooling unit.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. For example, kits, methods and modular units of the present disclosure can incorporate lighting, such as LED lights. The lighting can be provided with the kit for subsequent assembly (e.g., adhesive, friction fit, etc.) to the resultant modular unit. In related embodiments, a power control system provided with the cooling unit is adapted to deliver converted power to the lighting from a standard in-store power supply.</p>
