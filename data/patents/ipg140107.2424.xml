<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, a color filter (CF) and a manufacturing method thereof are disclosed in the present disclosure. The CF comprises a transparent substrate, a black matrix, first CF units, second CF units and a conductive layer. The transparent substrate comprises an active area and a dummy area. The first CF units in the active area have a trapezoidal cross section, and the second CF units in the dummy area have an inverted trapezoidal cross section. The conductive layer covers the active area continuously but covers the dummy area discontinuously; and thus, the active area can perform normal electrical conduction functions while an insulating effect can be achieved in the dummy area. In this way, even if conductive particles are present in the dummy area during the assembling process of the CF and a TFT, the discontinuous conductive layer in the dummy area can still prevent occurrence of abnormal conditions that the CF and the TFT are at the same voltage level. Thereby, abnormal short-circuits occurring when the CF and the TFT are assembled together can be prevented to improve the product quality.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In LCDs that are widely used, color filtering regions of the three primary colors (red, green and blue; RGB) are arranged in a predetermined pattern to form color filter units.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in a TFT-LCD, a color filter (CF) comprises a CF active area <b>101</b> and a CF dummy area <b>102</b>. Correspondingly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a TFT array comprises a TFT active area <b>103</b>, a TFT dummy area <b>104</b> and curing pads <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a schematic view illustrating a spacing region between the CF and the TFT array after being assembled together. In this figure, the reference numeral <b>106</b> represents a CF substrate, the reference numeral <b>107</b> represents a CF indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, the reference numeral <b>108</b> represents a TFT array substrate, the reference numeral <b>109</b> represents a TFT first layer (TFT M<b>1</b>), the reference numeral <b>110</b> represents a TFT insulation layer, the reference numeral <b>111</b> represents a TFT second layer (TFT M<b>2</b>), the reference numeral <b>112</b> represents a TFT through-hole, the reference numeral <b>113</b> represents a TFT ITO layer, and the reference numeral <b>114</b> represents conductive particles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present inventor has found through long-term research and development that, if conductive particles <b>114</b> are present above the TFT through-holes <b>112</b>, the TFT ITO layer <b>113</b> and the CF ITO layer <b>107</b> might be electrically connected to each other to cause an abnormal condition that the CF is at the same voltage level as the TFT; or if conductive particles <b>114</b> of large particle sizes are present in regions where no TFT through-hole <b>112</b> is formed, then such conductive particles <b>114</b> might penetrate through the TFT insulation layer <b>110</b> to reach the TFT M<b>2</b> <b>111</b> and then connect with the CF ITO layer <b>107</b> during the assembling process, which may also lead to the abnormal condition that the CF is at the same voltage level as the TFT.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present disclosure has the following benefits. In the prior art, the CF and the TFT might be at the same voltage level due to presence of conductive particles in the dummy area when the CF and the TFT are assembled together. In contrast, the present disclosure forms the CF units by illuminating the active area and the dummy area with UV light at different intensities through a graytone light-shielding sheet so that CF units having a trapezoidal cross section are obtained in the active area and CF units having an inverted trapezoidal cross section are obtained in the dummy area; and then during formation of the conductive layer, the conductive layer covering the CF units having the inverted trapezoidal cross section in the dummy area becomes discontinuous, thus providing an insulating effect. In this way, even if conductive particles are present in the dummy area during the assembling process of the CF and the TFT, the discontinuous conductive layer in the dummy area can still prevent occurrence of abnormal conditions that the CF and the TFT are at the same voltage level. Thereby, abnormal short-circuits occurring when the CF and the TFT are assembled together can be prevented to improve the product quality.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an embodiment of a manufacturing method for a color filter (CF) according to the present disclosure comprises the following steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, applying a light-shielding coating <b>121</b> on a transparent substrate <b>120</b> comprising an active area <b>122</b> and a dummy area <b>123</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, exposing the light-shielding coating <b>121</b> on the transparent substrate <b>120</b> by means of a blacktone light-shielding sheet <b>124</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, developing the light-shielding coating <b>121</b> to remove unnecessary portions of the light-shielding coating <b>121</b> to obtain a black matrix <b>125</b>, wherein the black matrix in the dummy area <b>123</b> is usually removed in a general design, so unnecessary portions of the light-shielding coating <b>121</b> are removed through development in this embodiment so as to obtain the black matrix <b>125</b> in the active area <b>122</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, applying a red color filtering coating <b>126</b> on the transparent substrate <b>120</b> covered with the black matrix <b>125</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, through a graytone light-shielding sheet <b>127</b>, illuminating the red color filtering coating <b>126</b> in the active area <b>122</b> with ultraviolet (UV) light at an intensity of 100% and illuminating the red color filtering coating <b>126</b> in the dummy area <b>123</b> with UV light at an intensity of 30%&#x2dc;50%;</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, removing unnecessary portions of the red color filtering coating <b>126</b> through development so as to obtain first red CF units <b>128</b><i>a </i>having a trapezoidal cross section in the active area <b>122</b> and second red CF units <b>130</b><i>a </i>having an inverted trapezoidal cross section in the dummy area <b>123</b>, wherein a length of a side of the trapezoidal cross section that is near the transparent substrate <b>120</b> is longer than a length of a side of the trapezoidal cross section that is away from the transparent substrate <b>120</b>, and a length of a side of the inverted trapezoidal cross section that is near the transparent substrate <b>120</b> is shorter than a length of a side of the inverted trapezoidal cross section that is away from the transparent substrate <b>120</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">repeating the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> only with the color filtering coating to be applied being changed in color; i.e., applying a green color filtering coating to obtain first green CF units <b>128</b><i>b </i>having a trapezoidal cross section in the active area <b>122</b> and second green CF units <b>130</b><i>b </i>having an inverted trapezoidal cross section in the dummy area <b>123</b>, and applying a blue color filtering coating to obtain first blue CF units <b>128</b><i>c </i>having a trapezoidal cross section in the active area <b>122</b> and second blue CF units <b>130</b><i>c </i>having an inverted trapezoidal cross section in the dummy area <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, through the aforesaid three times of exposure and development, the first red CF units <b>128</b><i>a, </i>the first green CF units <b>128</b><i>b </i>and the first blue CF units <b>128</b><i>c </i>having a trapezoidal cross section, as well as the second red CF units <b>130</b><i>a</i>, the second green CF units <b>130</b><i>b </i>and the second blue CF units <b>130</b><i>c </i>having an inverted trapezoidal cross section are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a conductive layer <b>129</b> is plated on the first red CF units <b>128</b><i>a, </i>the first green CF units <b>128</b><i>b </i>and the first blue CF units <b>128</b><i>c, </i>the black matrix <b>125</b>, as well as the second red CF units <b>130</b><i>a, </i>the second green CF units <b>130</b><i>b </i>and the second blue CF units <b>130</b><i>c </i>having an inverted trapezoidal cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The aforesaid &#x201c;intensity of 100%&#x201d; means that the color filtering coating can be just fully illuminated by UV light at this intensity so that both the surface and the interior of the color filtering coating are just solidified, thereby obtaining the CF units having a trapezoidal cross section through development. The &#x201c;intensity of 30%&#x2dc;50%&#x201d; means that the color filtering coating cannot be fully illuminated by UV light at this intensity so that the bottom layer of the color filtering coating is only partially illuminated by the UV light, thereby obtaining the CF units having an inverted trapezoidal cross section through development.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The principle for the color filtering coating <b>126</b> in the active area <b>122</b> and the color filtering coating <b>126</b> in the dummy area <b>123</b> to generate the CF units having different shapes when being illuminated by the UV light at different intensities is as follows: when light waves are projected onto a photoresist surface, the surface layer will firstly absorb the optical energy of individual wavelengths for reaction and, once the reaction is completed, the surface layer will not absorb the energy further; and only until then can the bottom layer have opportunity to absorb the remaining energy for reaction. Thereby, the projected optical energy can be controlled according to this principle in such a way that the surface layer is cross-linked completely and the bottom layer is cross-linked incompletely so as to control the shapes of the CF units.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As can be known from the above descriptions, in the prior art, the CF and the TFT array might be at the same voltage level due to presence of conductive particles in the dummy area when the CF and the TFT array are assembled together. In contrast, the present disclosure forms the CF units by illuminating the active area <b>122</b> and the dummy area <b>123</b> with UV light at different intensities through a graytone light-shielding sheet <b>127</b> so that first CF units <b>128</b> having a trapezoidal cross section are obtained in the active area <b>122</b> and second CF units <b>130</b> having an inverted trapezoidal cross section are obtained in the dummy area <b>123</b>; and then during formation of the conductive layer <b>129</b>, the conductive layer <b>129</b> covering the second CF units <b>130</b> having the inverted trapezoidal cross section in the dummy area <b>123</b> becomes discontinuous, thus providing an insulating effect. In this way, even if conductive particles are present in the dummy area <b>123</b> during the assembling process of the CF and the TFT array, the discontinuous conductive layer <b>129</b> in the dummy area <b>123</b> can still prevent occurrence of abnormal conditions that the CF and the TFT array are at the same voltage level. Thereby, abnormal short-circuits occurring when the CF and the TFT array are assembled together can be prevented to improve the product quality.</p>
