<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed toward a process for producing polydienes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polydienes may be produced by solution polymerization, wherein conjugated diene monomer is polymerized in an inert solvent or diluent. The solvent serves to solubilize the reactants and products, to act as a carrier for the reactants and product, to aid in the transfer of the heat of polymerization, and to help in moderating the polymerization rate. The solvent also allows easier stirring and transferring of the polymerization mixture (also called cement), since the viscosity of the cement is decreased by the presence of the solvent. Nevertheless, the presence of solvent presents a number of difficulties. The solvent must be separated from the polymer and then recycled for reuse or otherwise disposed of as waste. The cost of recovering and recycling the solvent adds greatly to the cost of the polymer being produced, and there is always the risk that the recycled solvent after purification may still retain some impurities that will poison the polymerization catalyst. In addition, some solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons can raise environmental concerns. Further, the purity of the polymer product may be affected if there are difficulties in removing the solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polydienes may also be produced by bulk polymerization (also called mass polymerization), wherein conjugated diene monomer is polymerized in the absence or substantial absence of any solvent, and, in effect, the monomer itself acts as a diluent. Since bulk polymerization is essentially solventless, there is less contamination risk, and the product separation is simplified. Bulk polymerization offers a number of economic advantages including lower capital cost for new plant capacity, lower energy cost to operate, and fewer people to operate. The solventless feature also provides environmental advantages, with emissions and waste water pollution being reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite its many advantages, bulk polymerization requires very careful temperature control, and there is also the need for strong and elaborate stirring equipment since the viscosity of the polymerization mixture can become very high. In the absence of added diluent, the high cement viscosity and exotherm effects can make temperature control very difficult. Consequently, local hot spots may occur, resulting in degradation, gelation, and/or discoloration of the polymer product. In the extreme case, uncontrolled acceleration of the polymerization rate can lead to disastrous &#x201c;runaway&#x201d; reactions. To facilitate the temperature control during bulk polymerization, it is desirable that a catalyst gives a reaction rate that is sufficiently fast for economical reasons but is slow enough to allow for the removal of the heat from the polymerization exotherm in order to ensure the process safety.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lanthanide-based catalyst systems that comprise a lanthanide compound, an alkylating agent, and a halogen source are known to be useful for producing conjugated diene polymers having high cis-1,4-linkage contents. The resulting cis-1,4-polydienes typically have a cis-1,4-linkage of less than 99%. Molecular weight distributions vary, but are typically above 2. It is known that cis-1,4-polydienes having higher cis contents, and narrower molecular weight distributions, give a greater ability to undergo strain-induced crystallization and lower hysteresis and thus, give superior physical properties such as higher tensile strength and higher abrasion resistance. Therefore, there is a need to develop a process for producing cis-1,4-polydienes having a combination of ultra-high cis contents (greater than 99% cis) and narrow molecular weight distributions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Unfortunately, most catalyst systems can not consistently achieve all of these properties. For example, catalysts have been developed to produce polymers with cis-1,4-linkage contents above 99%, but have broad molecular weight distributions. Furthermore, many of these catalysts use highly active, Lewis acidic chlorides, bromides, and iodides to achieve these properties, which results in excessively fast polymerization rates. This makes it very difficult to control the temperature and compromises the process safety. Fast polymerization rates and uncontrollable temperatures often lead to gel formation inside the polymerization reactor due to excess polymer formation on the walls of the reactor. In turn, the reactor must be cleaned before another polymerization can be conducted resulting in expensive delays in production.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, it is desirable to develop a bulk polymerization method for producing cis-1,4-polydienes having higher cis-1,4-linkage content and lower molecular weight distribution.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, polydienes are produced by bulk polymerization of conjugated diene monomer with a lanthanide-based catalyst system that is the combination of or reaction product of (a) a lanthanide compound, (b) an aluminoxane, (c) an organoaluminum compound other than an aluminoxane, (d) a bromine-containing compound selected from the group consisting of elemental bromine, bromine-containing mixed halogens, and organic bromides, and (e) a dihydrocarbyl ether. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that these catalyst ingredients synergistically yield a polydiene product with advantageous cis-1,4 content and an overall balance of advantageous properties. Further, it has been unexpectedly discovered that by including an iodine-containing compound as an additional catalyst ingredient, the molecular weight distribution can advantageously be improved without a deleterious impact on the other properties.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The catalyst composition of this invention may be formed by combining or mixing the foregoing catalyst ingredients. Although one or more active catalyst species are believed to result from the combination of the catalyst ingredients, the degree of interaction or reaction between the various catalyst ingredients or components is not known with any great degree of certainty. The combination or reaction product of the lanthanide compound, the aluminoxane, the organoaluminum compound other than an aluminoxane, and the bromine-containing compound is conventionally referred to as a catalyst system or catalyst composition. The dihydrocarbyl ether, as used herein, may be referred to as a component of that system or as a modifier to that system. In this respect, reference to catalyst ingredients refers to the lanthanide compound, the aluminoxane, the organoaluminum compound other than an aluminoxane, the bromine-containing compound, and the dihydrocarbyl ether. The term modified catalyst composition or modified catalyst system may be employed to encompass a simple mixture of the ingredients, a complex of the various ingredients that is caused by physical or chemical forces of attraction, a chemical reaction product of the ingredients, or a combination of the foregoing.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The catalyst composition of this invention advantageously has a technologically useful catalytic activity for polymerizing conjugated dienes into polydienes over a wide range of catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. Several factors may impact the optimum concentration of any one of the catalyst ingredients. For example, because the catalyst ingredients may interact to form an active species, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst ingredient may be dependent upon the concentrations of the other catalyst ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one or more embodiments, the molar ratio of the aluminoxane to the lanthanide compound (aluminoxane/Ln) can be varied from 5:1 to about 1,000:1, in other embodiments from about 10:1 to about 700:1, and in other embodiments from about 20:1 to about 500:1.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one or more embodiments, the molar ratio of the organoaluminum compound other than an aluminoxane to the lanthanide compound (Al/Ln) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 200:1, in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 150:1, and in other embodiments from about 5:1 to about 100:1.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The molar ratio of the bromine-containing compound to the lanthanide compound is best described in terms of the ratio of the moles of bromine atoms in the bromine-containing compound to the moles of lanthanide atoms in the lanthanide compound (Br/Ln). In one or more embodiments, the bromine/Ln molar ratio can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 20:1, in other embodiments from about 1:1 to about 10:1, and in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 6:1.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In these or other embodiments, the molar ratio of the iodine atoms in the iodine-containing compounds to the bromine atoms in the bromine-containing compounds (I/Br) may be varied from about 0.1:1 to about 10:1, in other embodiments from about 0.5:1 to about 5:1, and in other embodiments from about 0.8:1 to about 2:1.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The lanthanide-based catalyst can be formed by employing several techniques. For example, the catalyst may be formed by adding the catalyst components directly to the monomer to be polymerized. In this respect, the catalyst components including the dihydrocarbyl ether may be added either in a stepwise or simultaneous manner. In one embodiment, when the catalyst ingredients are added in a stepwise manner, the dihydrocarbyl ether can be added first, followed by the aluminoxane, followed by the lanthanide compound, followed by the organoaluminum compound other than aluminoxane, and ultimately followed by the bromine-containing compound optionally with the iodine-containing compound. Where both a bromine-containing compound and an iodine-containing compound are employed, they may be pre-mixed with one another or added individually. The addition of the catalyst components directly and individually to the monomer to be polymerized may be referred to as an in situ formation of the catalyst system.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In other embodiments, the catalyst may be preformed. That is, the catalyst ingredients including the dihydrocarbyl ether may be introduced and pre-mixed outside of the monomer to be polymerized. In particular embodiments, the preformation of the catalyst may occur either in the absence of any monomer or in the presence of a small amount of at least one conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to about 80&#xb0; C. Mixtures of conjugated diene monomers may also be used. The amount of conjugated diene monomer that may be used for preforming the catalyst can range from about 1 to about 500 moles, in other embodiments from about 5 to about 250 moles, and in other embodiments from about 10 to about 100 moles per mole of the lanthanide compound. The resulting preformed catalyst composition can be aged, if desired, prior to being added to the monomer that is to be polymerized.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In other embodiments, the catalyst may be formed by using a two-stage procedure. The first stage can involve combining the lanthanide compound with the aluminoxane and the organoaluminum compound other than an aluminoxane either in the absence of any monomer or in the presence of a small amount of at least one conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature (e.g., &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to about 80&#xb0; C.). The amount of monomer employed in preparing this first-stage mixture may be similar to that set forth above for preforming the catalyst. In the second stage, the mixture prepared in the first stage, the dihydrocarbyl ether, and the bromine-containing compound optionally together with the iodine-containing compound can be added in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner to the monomer that is to be polymerized. In one embodiment, the dihydrocarbyl ether can be added first, followed by the mixture prepared in the first stage, and then followed by the bromine-containing compound optionally together with the iodine-containing compound.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one or more embodiments, a solvent may be employed as a carrier to either dissolve or suspend the catalyst or catalyst ingredients in order to facilitate the delivery of the catalyst or catalyst ingredients to the polymerization system. In other embodiments, conjugated diene monomer can be used as the catalyst carrier. In yet other embodiments, the catalyst ingredients can be used in their neat state without any solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one or more embodiments, suitable solvents include those organic compounds that will not undergo polymerization or incorporation into propagating polymer chains during the polymerization of monomer in the presence of catalyst. In one or more embodiments, these organic species are liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. In one or more embodiments, these organic solvents are inert to the catalyst. Exemplary organic solvents include hydrocarbons with a low or relatively low boiling point such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Non-limiting examples of aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, and mesitylene. Non-limiting examples of aliphatic hydrocarbons include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isopentanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, and petroleum spirits. And, non-limiting examples of cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, and methylcyclohexane. Mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. As is known in the art, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons may be desirably employed for environmental reasons. The low-boiling hydrocarbon solvents are typically separated from the polymer upon completion of the polymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Other examples of organic solvents include high-boiling hydrocarbons of high molecular weights, such as paraffinic oil, aromatic oil, or other hydrocarbon oils that are commonly used to oil-extend polymers. Since these hydrocarbons are non-volatile, they typically do not require separation and remain incorporated in the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The production of polydienes according to this invention can be accomplished by polymerizing conjugated diene monomer in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of the foregoing catalyst composition. The introduction of the catalyst composition, the conjugated diene monomer, and any solvent if employed forms a polymerization mixture in which the polymer product is formed. The total catalyst concentration to be employed in the polymerization mixture may depend on the interplay of various factors such as the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, the molecular weight desired, and many other factors. Accordingly, a specific total catalyst concentration cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst ingredients can be used. In one or more embodiments, the amount of the lanthanide compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol, in other embodiments from about 0.02 to about 1 mmol, and in other embodiments from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of conjugated diene monomer.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In one or more embodiments, the polymerization system employed may be generally considered a bulk polymerization system that includes substantially no solvent or a minimal amount of solvent. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the benefits of bulk polymerization processes (i.e., processes where monomer acts as the solvent), and therefore the polymerization system includes less solvent than will deleteriously impact the benefits sought by conducting bulk polymerization. In one or more embodiments, the solvent content of the polymerization mixture may be less than about 20% by weight, in other embodiments less than about 10% by weight, and in still other embodiments less than about 5% by weight based on the total weight of the polymerization mixture. In still another embodiment, the polymerization mixture is substantially devoid of solvent, which refers to the absence of that amount of solvent that would otherwise have an appreciable impact on the polymerization process. Polymerization systems that are substantially devoid of solvent may be referred to as including substantially no solvent. In particular embodiments, the polymerization mixture is devoid of solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The polymerization may be conducted in any conventional polymerization vessels known in the art. In one or more embodiments, solution polymerization can be conducted in a conventional stirred-tank reactor. In other embodiments, bulk polymerization can be conducted in a conventional stirred-tank reactor, especially if the monomer conversion is less than about 60%. In still other embodiments, especially where the monomer conversion in a bulk polymerization process is higher than about 60%, which typically results in a highly viscous cement, the bulk polymerization may be conducted in an elongated reactor in which the viscous cement under polymerization is driven to move by piston, or substantially by piston. For example, extruders in which the cement is pushed along by a self-cleaning single-screw or double-screw agitator are suitable for this purpose. Examples of useful bulk polymerization processes are disclosed in U.S. Publication No. 2005/0197474 A1, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one or more embodiments, all of the ingredients used for the polymerization can be combined within a single vessel (e.g., a conventional stirred-tank reactor), and all steps of the polymerization process can be conducted within this vessel. In other embodiments, two or more of the ingredients can be pre-combined in one vessel and then transferred to another vessel where the polymerization of monomer (or at least a major portion thereof) may be conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The polymerization can be carried out as a batch process, a continuous process, or a semi-continuous process. In the semi-continuous process, the monomer is intermittently charged as needed to replace that monomer already polymerized. In one or more embodiments, the conditions under which the polymerization proceeds may be controlled to maintain the temperature of the polymerization mixture within a range from about &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C., in other embodiments from about 0&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C., and in other embodiments from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. In one or more embodiments, the heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling by a thermally controlled reactor jacket, internal cooling by evaporation and condensation of the monomer through the use of a reflux condenser connected to the reactor, or a combination of the two methods. Also, conditions may be controlled to conduct the polymerization under a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 50 atmospheres, in other embodiments from about 0.5 atmosphere to about 20 atmospheres, and in other embodiments from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. In one or more embodiments, the pressures at which the polymerization may be carried out include those that ensure that the majority of the monomer is in the liquid phase. In these or other embodiments, the polymerization mixture may be maintained under anaerobic conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The polydienes produced by the polymerization process of this invention may possess pseudo-living characteristics, such that some of polymer chains in these polymers have reactive chain ends. Once a desired monomer conversion is achieved, a functionalizing agent may optionally be introduced into the polymerization mixture to react with any reactive polymer chains so as to give a functionalized polymer. In one or more embodiments, the functionalizing agent is introduced prior to contacting the polymerization mixture with a quenching agent. In other embodiments, the functionalizing agent may be introduced after the polymerization mixture has been partially quenched with a quenching agent.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one or more embodiments, functionalizing agents include compounds or reagents that can react with a reactive polymer produced by this invention and thereby provide the polymer with a functional group that is distinct from a propagating chain that has not been reacted with the functionalizing agent. The functional group may be reactive or interactive with other polymer chains (propagating and/or non-propagating) or with other constituents such as reinforcing fillers (e.g. carbon black) that may be combined with the polymer. In one or more embodiments, the reaction between the functionalizing agent and the reactive polymer proceeds via an addition or substitution reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Useful functionalizing agents may include compounds that simply provide a functional group at the end of a polymer chain without joining two or more polymer chains together, as well as compounds that can couple or join two or more polymer chains together via a functional linkage to form a single macromolecule. The latter type of functionalizing agents may also be referred to as coupling agents.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one or more embodiments, functionalizing agents include compounds that will add or impart a heteroatom to the polymer chain. In particular embodiments, functionalizing agents include those compounds that will impart a functional group to the polymer chain to form a functionalized polymer that reduces the 50&#xb0; C. hysteresis loss of a carbon-black filled vulcanizates prepared from the functionalized polymer as compared to similar carbon-black filled vulcanizates prepared from non-functionalized polymer. In one or more embodiments, this reduction in hysteresis loss is at least 5%, in other embodiments at least 10%, and in other embodiments at least 15%.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one or more embodiments, suitable functionalizing agents include those compounds that contain groups that may react with pseudo-living polymers (e.g., those produced in accordance with this invention). Exemplary functionalizing agents include ketones, quinones, aldehydes, amides, esters, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, epoxides, imines, aminoketones, aminothioketones, and acid anhydrides. Examples of these compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,906,706, 4,990,573, 5,064,910, 5,567,784, 5,844,050, 6,838,526, 6,977,281, and 6,992,147; U.S. Pat. Publication Nos. 2006/0004131 A1, 2006/0025539 A1, 2006/0030677 A1, and 2004/0147694 A1; Japanese Patent Application Nos. 05-051406A, 05-059103A, 10-306113A, and 11-035633A; which are incorporated herein by reference. Other examples of functionalizing agents include azine compounds as described in U.S. Ser. No. 11/640,711, hydrobenzamide compounds as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 11/710,713, nitro compounds as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 11/710,845, and protected oxime compounds as disclosed in U.S. Publication No. 2008-0146745 A1, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In particular embodiments, the functionalizing agents employed may be coupling agents which include, but are not limited to, metal halides such as tin tetrachloride, metalloid halides such as silicon tetrachloride, metal ester-carboxylate complexes such as dioctyltin bis(octylmaleate), alkoxysilanes such as tetraethyl orthosilicate, and alkoxystannanes such as tetraethoxytin. Coupling agents can be employed either alone or in combination with other functionalizing agents. The combination of functionalizing agents may be used in any molar ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The amount of functionalizing agent introduced to the polymerization mixture may depend upon various factors including the type and amount of catalyst used to initiate the polymerization, the type of functionalizing agent, the desired level of functionality and many other factors. In one or more embodiments, the amount of functionalizing agent may be in a range of from about 1 to about 200 moles, in other embodiments from about 5 to about 150 moles, and in other embodiments from about 10 to about 100 moles per mole of the lanthanide compound.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Because reactive polymer chains may slowly self-terminate at high temperatures, in one embodiment the functionalizing agent may be added to the polymerization mixture once a peak polymerization temperature is observed. In other embodiments, the functionalizing agent may be added within about 25 to 35 minutes after the peak polymerization temperature is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one or more embodiments, the functionalizing agent may be introduced to the polymerization mixture after a desired monomer conversion is achieved but before a quenching agent containing a protic hydrogen atom is added. In one or more embodiments, the functionalizing agent is added to the polymerization mixture after a monomer conversion of at least 5%, in other embodiments at least 10%, in other embodiments at least 20%, in other embodiments at least 50%, and in other embodiments at least 80%. In these or other embodiments, the functionalizing agent is added to the polymerization mixture prior to a monomer conversion of 90%, in other embodiments prior to 70% monomer conversion, in other embodiments prior to 50% monomer conversion, in other embodiments prior to 20% monomer conversion, and in other embodiments prior to 15% monomer conversion. In one or more embodiments, the functionalizing agent is added after complete, or substantially complete monomer conversion. In particular embodiments, a functionalizing agent may be introduced to the polymerization mixture immediately prior to, together with, or after the introduction of a Lewis base as disclosed in co-pending U.S. Publication No. 2009-0043046 A1, filed on Aug. 7, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one or more embodiments, the functionalizing agent may be introduced to the polymerization mixture at a location (e.g., within a vessel) where the polymerization (or at least a portion thereof) has been conducted. In other embodiments, the functionalizing agent may be introduced to the polymerization mixture at a location that is distinct from where the polymerization (or at least a portion thereof) has taken place. For example, the functionalizing agent may be introduced to the polymerization mixture in downstream vessels including downstream reactors or tanks, in-line reactors or mixers, extruders, or devolatilizers.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Once a functionalizing agent has optionally been introduced to the polymerization mixture and/or a desired reaction time has been provided, a quenching agent can be added to the polymerization mixture in order to inactivate any residual reactive polymer chains and the catalyst or catalyst components. The quenching agent may be a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, water, or a mixture thereof. In particular embodiments, the quenching agent includes a polyhydroxy compound as disclosed in copending U.S. Ser. No. 11/890,591, filed on Aug. 7, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before, or after the addition of the quenching agent. The amount of the antioxidant employed may be in the range of about 0.2% to about 1% by weight of the polymer product. The quenching agent and the antioxidant may be added as neat materials or, if necessary, dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent or conjugated diene monomer prior to being added to the polymerization mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one or more embodiments, the quenching agent is added to the polymerization mixture after a monomer conversion of at least 5%, in other embodiments at least 10%, in other embodiments at least 20%, in other embodiments at least 50%, and in other embodiments at least 80%. In these or other embodiments, the quenching agent is added to the polymerization mixture prior to a monomer conversion of 90%, in other embodiments prior to 70% monomer conversion, in other embodiments prior to 50% monomer conversion, in other embodiments prior to 20% monomer conversion, and in other embodiments prior to 15% monomer conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Once the polymerization mixture has been quenched, the various constituents of the polymerization mixture may be recovered. In one or more embodiments, the unreacted monomer can be recovered from the polymerization mixture. For example, the monomer can be distilled from the polymerization mixture by using techniques known in the art. In one or more embodiments, a devolatilizer may be employed to remove the monomer from the polymerization mixture. Once the monomer has been removed from the polymerization mixture, the monomer may be purified, stored, and/or recycled back to the polymerization process.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The polymer product may be recovered from the polymerization mixture by using techniques known in the art. In one or more embodiments, desolventization and drying techniques may be used. For instance, the polymer can be recovered by passing the polymerization mixture through a heated screw apparatus, such as a desolventizing extruder, in which the volatile substances are removed by evaporation at appropriate temperatures (e.g., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 170&#xb0; C.) and under atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressure. This treatment serves to remove unreacted monomer as well as any low-boiling solvent. Alternatively, the polymer can also be recovered by subjecting the polymerization mixture to steam desolventization, followed by drying the resulting polymer crumbs in a hot air tunnel. The polymer can also be recovered by directly drying the polymerization mixture on a drum dryer.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Where cis-1,4-polydienes (e.g., cis-1,4-polybutadiene) are produced by one or more embodiments of the process of this invention, the cis-1,4-polydienes may advantageously have a cis-1,4 linkage content in excess of 96%, in other embodiments in excess of 97%, in other embodiments in excess of 98%, in other embodiments in excess of 99.0%, in other embodiments in excess of 99.1%, in other embodiments in excess of 99.2%, and in other embodiments in excess of 99.3%. In these or other embodiments, the polydienes (e.g., cis-1,4-polybutadiene) have a molecular weight distribution of less than 2.5, in other embodiments less than 2.2, in other embodiments less than 2.0, in other embodiments less than 1.8, and in other embodiments less than 1.6.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Advantageously, these polymers exhibit excellent viscoelastic properties and are particularly useful in the manufacture of various tire components including, but not limited to, tire treads, sidewalls, subtreads, and bead fillers. The cis-1,4-polydienes can be used as all or part of the elastomeric component of a tire stock. When the cis-1,4-polydienes are used in conjunction with other rubbers to form the elastomeric component of a tire stock, these other rubbers may be natural rubber, synthetic rubbers, and mixtures thereof. Examples of synthetic rubber include polyisoprene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene), polybutadiene with low cis-1,4-linkage content, poly(styrene-co-butadiene-co-isoprene), and mixtures thereof. The cis-1,4-polydienes can also be used in the manufacture of hoses, belts, shoe soles, window seals, other seals, vibration damping rubber, and other industrial products.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not, however, be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The polymerization reactor consisted of a one-gallon stainless cylinder equipped with a mechanical agitator (shaft and blades) capable of mixing high viscosity polymer cement. The top of the reactor was connected to a reflux condenser system for conveying, condensing, and recycling the 1,3-butadiene vapor developed inside the reactor throughout the duration of the polymerization. The reactor was also equipped with a cooling jacket chilled by cold water. The heat of polymerization was dissipated partly by internal cooling through the use of the reflux condenser system, and partly by external cooling through heat transfer to the cooling jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The reactor was thoroughly purged with a stream of dry nitrogen, which was then replaced with 1,3-butadiene vapor by charging 100 g of dry 1,3-butadiene monomer to the reactor, heating the reactor to 65&#xb0; C., and then venting the 1,3-butadiene vapor from the top of the reflux condenser system until no liquid 1,3-butadiene remained in the reactor. Cooling water was applied to the reflux condenser and the reactor jacket, and 1302 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer and 7.8 mL of dibutyl ether (n-Bu<sub>2</sub>O) in hexane was charged into the reactor. After the monomer was thermostated at 32&#xb0; C., the polymerization was initiated by charging into the reactor a preformed catalyst that had been prepared by mixing 6.5 g of 19.2 wt % 1,3-butadiene in hexane, 1.44 ml of 0.054 M neodymium versatate in hexane, 5.20 ml of 1.5 M methylaluminoxane (MAO) in toluene, 2.81 ml of 1.0 M diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAH) in hexane, and 3.12 ml of 0.05 M tetrabromomethane (CBr<sub>4</sub>) in hexane and allowing the mixture to age for 15 minutes. After 3.5 minutes from its commencement, the polymerization was terminated by diluting the polymerization mixture with 1360 g of hexane and dropping the batch to 3 gallons of isopropanol containing 5 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The coagulated polymer was drum-dried. The yield of the polymer was 143.2 g (11.0% conversion). The Mooney viscosity (ML<sub>1+4</sub>) of the polymer was determined to be 21.3 at 100&#xb0; C. by using a Monsanto Mooney viscometer with a large rotor, a one-minute warm-up time, and a four minute running time. As determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the polymer had a number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of 110,000, a weight average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) of 262,000, and a molecular weight distribution (M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>) of 2.4. The infrared spectroscopic analysis of the polymer indicated a cis 1,4-linkage content of 99.2%, a trans 1,4-linkage content of 0.6%, and a 1,2-linkage content of 0.2%.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Comparative Example</heading>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The same procedure as used in Example 1 was used except that 2.50 ml of 1.0 M DIBAH in hexane was added, and tetrabromosilane (SiBr<sub>4</sub>) was used instead of CBr<sub>4</sub>. After 20.0 minutes from its commencement, the polymerization was terminated by diluting the polymerization mixture with 1360 g of hexane and dropping the batch to 3 gallons of isopropanol containing 5 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The coagulated polymer was drum-dried. The yield of the polymer was 36.9 g (2.8% conversion). The resulting polymer had the following properties: ML<sub>1+4</sub>=appeared to be very low and was not measured, M<sub>n</sub>=59,000, M<sub>w</sub>=164,000, M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>=2.8, ds 1,4-linkage content=92.3%, trans 1,4-linkage content=5.5%, and 1,2-linkage content=2.2%.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Comparative Example</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The same procedure as used in Example 1 was used except that tin (IV) bromide (SnBr<sub>4</sub>) was used instead of CBr<sub>4</sub>. After 4.3 minutes from its commencement, the polymerization formed polymer gel on the agitator of the reactor. Upon gel formation, the polymerization was immediately terminated by diluting the polymerization mixture with 1360 g of hexane and dropping the batch to 3 gallons of isopropanol containing 5 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The coagulated polymer was drum-dried. The yield of the polymer was 51.4 g (3.9% conversion). The resulting polymer had the following properties: ML<sub>1+4</sub>=35.7, M<sub>n</sub>=85,000, M<sub>w</sub>=530,000, M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>=6.2, cis 1,4-linkage content=99.3%, trans 1,4-linkage content=0.5%, and 1,2-linkage content=0.2%.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A comparison of the results (Table 1) obtained in Example 1 with those obtained in Comparative Example 2 indicates that the use of CBr<sub>4 </sub>instead of SiBr<sub>4 </sub>yields a polymer with a high cis-1,4-linkage content and a narrow molecular weight distribution at a desired Mooney viscosity. The addition of SiBr<sub>4 </sub>provided a less active catalyst. Comparing Example 1 to Comparative Example 3, although SnBr<sub>4 </sub>resulted in the formation of cis-1,4-polybutadiene having a high cis-1,4-linkage content, the catalyst was too active resulting in the formation of polymer gel during the polymerization which led to a broad molecular weight distribution.</p>
