<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/433,644, entitled &#x201c;Selecting An Access Point In A Wireless Network Using A Data Flow Metric&#x201d;, by Sung-Ju Lee and JeongKeun Lee, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In typical wireless networks such as cellular networks or infrastructure-based Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), wireless routing is simple because only the last hop is wireless. However, in multi-hop wireless networks, routing has a much important role for data communications because data is sent via multiple wireless hops instead of a single hop. Thus, routing in a multi-hop wireless network versus a last-hop wireless transmission has a much greater chance of affecting the data communications. A data flow includes information, which may be for one application or service. The source and destination can send or receive data flows via the route and the data flows may pass through the route to the Internet or another network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, all the data flows in a multi-hop wireless network are provided via a single route to the source or the destination. A data flow includes information, which may be for one application or service. When the route from a specific source to a specific destination degrades, such as due to mobility or interference, all the data flows using that route may use another route if the multi-hop wireless network supports another route. The new route selection may be performed using a single metric, and all the data flows have to use the new route. However, different data flows may benefit from different routes because different routes may provide different performance for different metrics. For example, a route may be selected that has the greatest bandwidth, but that route may not be the best route for a data flow that benefits from a route that has the smallest latency. Thus, a single route in the multi-hop wireless network may not provide the best performance for different types of data flows. At least one data flow may suffer performance degradation even though another data flow may benefit from the new route.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the present invention is described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, well known methods and structures have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the present invention, different routes are used for different type of data flows simultaneously based on metrics that provide the best performance for each type of data flow and the condition of the routes. Different route metrics are used for a source or a destination to select different routes for different data flows. A route metric is a metric representing a condition of a route. Examples include received signal strength, bandwidth (throughput), latency, loss rate, etc. A route is multi-hop route from a source to a destination in the multi-hop wireless network. Multi-hop means that a signal can move from node-to-node and then finally to the source or the destination. Multi-hop wireless network allows for continuous connections and reconfiguration by &#x201c;hopping&#x201d; from one node to another node until the destination is reached. When nodes are all connected to each other in a multi-hop wireless network, it is a fully connected network. Here, examples of nodes are a router and a mesh node. Also, a source or a destination is a node. The nodes can all connect to each other via multiple hops. Thus, the nodes are operable to be used as hops.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The source or the destination selects the best route for each data flow based on a data flow metric for the data flow. The data flow metric is a metric that is determined to have a greatest or one of the greatest impacts on the data flow. When the source or the destination needs to find a route to send or receive a data flow via the route, it searches the nodes in the multi-hop wireless network to obtain information about the route metrics in the multi-hop wireless network. The route metrics may be measured between two different nodes in the network. A node is a network device, such as a router, hub, a laptop, a mobile phone, and a personal digital assistant (PDA). The information of route metrics may include values (e.g., measurements) for the route metrics. The source or the destination obtains the values for each route metric.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the route metrics are gathered, the source or the destination store this information, and when a new data flow arrives, the source or the destination selects a route that provides the best performance for a data flow using the information of the route metrics. Each type of data flow is associated with a data flow metric that identifies which data flow metric is most important for quality of service (QoS) for that type of data flow. Then, a route is selected that provides the best performance for the data flow metric. For instance, for data flows such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or interactive network games, the source or the destination selects a route that provides the minimum delay, as those flows are delay sensitive. For flows that require high bandwidth, such as a file download, it will be best to select the route that provides the largest bandwidth (i.e., bandwidth is the data flow metric for the file download data flow). If reliability is the most important metric for a data flow (e.g., I-frames of MPEG video), the source or the destination selects a route with the lowest loss rate. What has been described above is proactive routing because routes can be selected for different data flow metrics prior to receiving a data flow, according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, when a new data flow arrives, this new data flow is routed along the route that provides the best quality in terms of the metric that is the most important to the data flow.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, data-flow-based, on-demand routing is implemented. For on-demand routing, the route is built when it is needed. The source finds a route when there is a data flow to send by sending a route request packet to the destination via all possible routes in the network. The intermediate nodes, which are not the destination, forward this packet with the route metric information attached. When the destination receives multiple copies of this packet that took different routes, it selects the best route for a specific data flow, and notifies the source of its selection. The intermediate nodes may include multiple route metrics. The destination selects the best route for the data flow metric, and notifies the source of the route. Here, multiple notification packets may need to be sent when different routes are selected for different data flow metrics. When a new data flow arrives with the same data flow metric, the source will have a route available to use. In another embodiment, a route request packet is sent to the destination via all possible routes in the network whenever a new data flow with a different data flow metric arrives at the source. Then the intermediate nodes will only need to include the information route metrics of interest, which are the route metrics that include measurements for the data flow metric for that particular data flow.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the source or the destination may obtain the route information whenever it needs to re-send or receive a data flow as the associated route no longer provides the required performance. Associating or re-associating a source or the destination with a route includes the source or the destination selecting a new route to send or receive a data flow. The source or the destination can use a route list as potential routes to associate with the data flow. As the source or the destination associate with different routes for different data flows, instead of associating with only one route for all data flows, the quality of service for each data flow improves. The methods described herein are not limited to be applied only to a multi-hop WLAN. The methods can also be applied to other wireless networks, such as Worldwide Inter-operability for Microwave Access (WiMax) networks or other types of wireless networks.</p>

The system <b>100</b> includes the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b>. The multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b> may be connected to an access network or any wide area network (WAN) or other network.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b> includes a source <b>102</b> (S), multiple wireless routers as nodes, shown as wireless routers <b>103</b><i>a </i>(I), <b>103</b><i>b </i>(J), <b>103</b><i>c </i>(K) and <b>103</b><i>d </i>(L), and a destination <b>104</b> (D). The source <b>102</b> and the destination <b>104</b> are also nodes, as they could be intermediate nodes forwarding data flows for other source or destination in the network. More or less than four wireless routers, more sources and more destinations may exist in the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b>. However, only the limited numbers of network devices are shown for illustration purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The source <b>102</b> receives a data flow from another network or just originates a data flow, such as a VoIP call. The source <b>102</b> also sends a data flow to the destination <b>104</b> via different routers, such as the routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. The wireless routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be equipped for interfacing with the source <b>102</b>, the destination <b>104</b>, and another network outside the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b>. The wireless routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are also nodes of the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b> that route data flows within the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b>. The destination <b>104</b> may be a device and may include an end user device, such as a laptop, cell phone, etc. The destination <b>104</b> receives a data flow from the source <b>102</b> via the routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the source <b>102</b> and the destination <b>104</b> are wirelessly connected to the wireless routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<b>103</b><i>d</i>. The source <b>102</b> or the destination <b>104</b> may be connected to each other via one or more of the wireless routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<b>103</b><i>d </i>to send and receive data flows.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the source <b>102</b> or the destination <b>104</b> may send and receive different types of data flows via different wireless routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. A sequence of different wireless routers makes a route. For example, from the source <b>102</b> to the destination <b>104</b>, there are several different routes that a data flow can take. First, a data flow can travel via the wireless router <b>103</b><i>a </i>(I) and the wireless router <b>103</b><i>b </i>(J) to the destination <b>104</b> from the source <b>102</b> (Route <b>1</b>). Second, a data flow can travel via the wireless router <b>103</b><i>a </i>(I) and the wireless router <b>103</b><i>d </i>(L) to the destination <b>104</b> from the source <b>102</b> (Route <b>2</b>). Third, a data flow can travel via the wireless router <b>103</b><i>c </i>(K) and the wireless router <b>103</b><i>d </i>(L) to the destination <b>104</b> from the source <b>102</b> (Route <b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Examples of types of data flows are VoIP, multiplayer game data, streaming video or audio, or bulk transfer of data. Each type of data flow is associated with a particular data flow metric, such as signal strength, latency, bandwidth, loss rate, etc. Each wireless router of the wireless routers <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>measures or otherwise determines route metrics between two different routers. For example, routers <b>103</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>b </i>measure route metrics between each other. Similarly, routers <b>103</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>d </i>measure route metrics between each other. Each pair of nodes that may form a hop in a route determines route metrics between each other.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The route metrics may be the same as the data flow metrics, so the route metric values can be used to select a route for different data flows based on their data flow metrics of the data flows. For example, if the data flow metric is latency, measured latency values for a latency route metric are used to identify the best routers for a route for the data flow.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Table 1 shows examples of route metric values for the routes, route <b>1</b> (S&#x2192;I&#x2192;J&#x2192;D), route <b>2</b> (S&#x2192;I&#x2192;L&#x2192;D), and route <b>3</b> (S&#x2192;K&#x2192;L&#x2192;D).</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Here, route <b>1</b> has the shortest delay, route <b>2</b> has the least loss rate, and route <b>3</b> has the highest bandwidth. Thus, it is advantageous for the destination <b>104</b> to select route <b>1</b> for receiving a data flow that has delay as its data flow metric, such as a VoIP data flow. Route <b>2</b> may be selected for a loss rate data flow metric (e.g., mpeg i-frames), and route <b>3</b> may be selected for a bandwidth data flow metric (e.g., such as a large file download dataflow).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The source <b>102</b> or the destination <b>104</b> may have interfaces for receiving one or more data flows. The interfaces may include radios for sending and receiving data for the data flows. The source <b>102</b> or the destination <b>104</b> uses its interfaces to communicate via each route. In this example, there is at least one route within range of the source or the destination and each route includes information including route metrics or the values of the route metrics of each route. As shown in table 1, examples of the values of the route metrics of each route are 90 ms delay, 45 Mbps bandwidth, and 15% of a loss rate for route <b>1</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a diagram of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> using data flow based routing from a source to a destination in a multi-hop wireless network, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this example, there are three data flows including MPEG I-frames, VoIP, and downloading a movie file between the source <b>102</b> and the destination <b>104</b>. The source <b>102</b> and the destination <b>104</b> are operable to send/receive multiple data flows via different routes simultaneously. In that case, different routes may be selected that different route has the best route metric for the different data flows.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, routes to all other nodes in the multi-hop wireless network is maintained by measuring multiple route metrics and including the measured multiple route metrics in the periodic routing messages. Each node searches for neighboring nodes and may store route metrics information of the other nodes. The route metrics for different pairs of nodes, such as for &#x2018;node <b>103</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>b</i>&#x2019; or for &#x2018;node <b>103</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>d</i>&#x2019; are measured and used to decide a route metric for the different routes between the source and the destination, such as routes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> in this example. Here, the information of the route metrics between two different nodes is received and stored periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For different data flows, the route metrics for different hops and the data flow metrics of different data flows are compared to identify the route that should provide the best performance or quality of service for a particular data flow. The nodes including the nodes <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, the source <b>102</b>, and the destination <b>104</b> may store a data flow metric for different type of data flows.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the data flow metrics for the MPEG I-frames, VoIP, and movie file download data flows are loss rate, delay and bandwidth, respectively. The source <b>102</b> seeks a route that has a least loss rate, a route that has a least delay, and a route that has a highest bandwidth. When the source <b>102</b> receives the information including the values of different route metrics of different routes, the source <b>102</b> finds that route <b>1</b> has the best route metric value for the delay, route <b>2</b> has the best route metric value for the loss rate, and route <b>3</b> has the best route metric value for the bandwidth. Thus, the source <b>102</b> selects route <b>1</b> for the VoIP, route <b>2</b> for the MPEG I-frames, and route <b>3</b> for the movie download.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, a route that provides the best route metric for a data flow is selected only when it is needed to receive the data flow. The source <b>102</b> finds a route when there is a data flow to send, by flooding the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b> with a route request packet (not shown). The flooding may be performed by sending a plurality of route request packets to the destination <b>104</b> via different routes, such as routes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> in this example in the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b>. The plurality of route request packets may have the plurality of the same route request packets, but just multiple copies of the same route request packet with same ID.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The destination <b>104</b> receives the plurality of route requests packets that took different routes, and determines route metrics for different routes. Here, the intermediate nodes, such as the node <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may include different route metric information. The destination <b>104</b> selects a route that has the most optimal performance for the data flow metric for a specific data flow. Then, the source <b>102</b> receives the selected route from the destination <b>104</b>. The source <b>102</b> may receive the selected route by receiving notification packets from the destination <b>104</b>. The source <b>102</b> then sends the specific data flow to the destination <b>104</b> via the route of the destination's choice. Here, multiple notification packets might need to be sent to the source <b>102</b> when different routes are selected for different data flows. In another embodiment, the route request packet flooding may be performed whenever a new data flow with different data flow metric arrives at the source <b>102</b>. The intermediate nodes, such as the node <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>will only need to include the information of route metric of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flow chart of a method <b>300</b> for proactive routing in a multi-hop wireless network, according to an embodiment. The method <b>300</b> and other methods described herein are described with respect to the system <b>100</b> by way of example, and the methods may be practiced in other systems. Also, it should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the method <b>300</b> and for other methods described herein that other steps may be added or existing steps may be removed, modified or rearranged.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At step <b>310</b>, the nodes in the multi-hop wireless network <b>110</b> are searched. This can be done by periodically sending route update information of the link to only its neighbor nodes by each node in the entire network. This can also be done by periodically sending information of the routes to all other nodes in the network by each node in the network.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At step <b>320</b>, information of one or more route metrics is received. For example, each node sends its node ID and route metrics measured between itself and an adjacent node. Thus, each of the nodes <b>103</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>receives route metrics for hops that are operable to be used for a route between the source <b>102</b> and the destination <b>104</b>. Note that the destination <b>104</b> has at least one interface that is used for communicating with each router.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At step <b>330</b>, a first route that has a most optimal route metric for a first data flow is determined based on the route metrics received from the nodes and a first data flow metric of the first data flow. Here the type of the route metric from the first route should match the type of the first data flow metric. For example, if the route metrics received for route <b>2</b> include bandwidth, delay and loss rate, the nodes use the loss rate route metric values to determine whether route <b>2</b> should be selected to receive a multimedia streaming data flow because the data flow metric for this data flow is loss rate.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>340</b>, the destination <b>104</b> receives the first data flow from the source via the first route in the multi-hop wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>350</b>, a second route that has a most optimal route metric for a second data flow is determined based on one or more route metric and a second data flow metric of the second data flow. Again, the type of the route metric from the second route should match the type of the second data flow metric.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Finally, at step <b>360</b>, the destination <b>104</b> receives the second data flow from the source via the second route in the multi-hop wireless network. Here, the type of the second data flow metric may be different from the type of the first data flow metric. The data flows may be received simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The steps <b>330</b> and <b>350</b> describe using one data flow metric per data flow to select a route for a data flow. However, in other embodiments, a type of data flow may have multiple data flow metrics that are used to select a route to receive a data flow.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>400</b> for on-demand routing a data flow in a multi-hop wireless network, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step <b>410</b>, the source <b>102</b> identifies a data flow and a corresponding data flow metric for the data flow. For example, a data flow is received at the source <b>102</b> and needs to be sent to the destination a source</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At step <b>420</b>, the source <b>102</b> sends a plurality of route request packets to the destination <b>104</b> via different routes in the multi-hop wireless network. In one example, the source <b>102</b> floods the route request packets.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>430</b>, the destination <b>104</b> receives the route requests packets, and determines route metrics for each route. For example, as a request packet is routed to the destination <b>104</b>, at each hop a node includes route metrics for the hop and sends the packet towards the destination <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At step <b>440</b>, the destination <b>104</b> selects a route that has the most optimal performance for the data flow metric for the data flow. The route metrics from step <b>430</b> are used to select the route. For example, the route that has the shortest delay is selected for a VoIP data flow.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>450</b>, the source <b>102</b> receives the selected route from the destination <b>104</b> to send the data flow via the route. The received route may identify the nodes in the route.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>460</b>, the source <b>102</b> sends the data flow to the destination <b>104</b> via the route in the multi-hop wireless network.</p>
