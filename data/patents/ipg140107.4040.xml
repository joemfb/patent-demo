<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2010-14430, filed on Feb. 18, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to an apparatus and a method for determining an overlap distance of an optical head. More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a digital exposure device and a method for determining an overlap distance of an optical head used for a digital exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, in order to form a metal pattern of a thin-film transistor (&#x201c;TFT&#x201d;) by using a metal layer and a photoresist layer which may be sequentially formed in a substrate, the metal pattern may be formed using a mask having a design of a metal pattern which may be disposed on the photoresist layer. For example, the photoresist layer can be exposed and developed by providing light to an upper portion of the mask to form a photoresist pattern in which the design of the mask may be reflected. The metal layer can be etched by using the photoresist pattern serving as an etch stop layer so that the metal pattern may be formed. However, when a display substrate includes a plurality of metal patterns, a plurality of masks by the number of the metal patterns may be required due to different patterns. Moreover, when the designs of the metal patterns are changed, the design of the mask may also be required to be changed so that a mask may be re-produced. Since a reproduction cost of the mask is relatively high, reproducing the mask may increase the manufacturing cost of a display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to overcome the problem, an approach has been introduced to an exposure device capable of providing a substrate with beams without using a mask. In the exposure device, the beams may be activated or inactivated to selectively be provided to the substrate so that photoresist patterns dependent on a shape can be defined by the activation or inactivation of the beams. Since an area covered by light provided from the exposure device is limited, the exposure device or the substrate is moved to scan in several times when a photoresist pattern is formed on a large-sized substrate by using the exposure device. In this way, the substrate may fully be exposed by the exposure device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the substrate is scanned by the exposure device, an overlapped area may be generated. In this approach, the overlapped area of the substrate can be exposed by the exposure device at least more than two times so that unnecessary exposures in terms of generating patterns can not only be a burden to manufacturing a display substrate but adversely affect a manufacturing yield since a uniformity of the photoresist pattern may be decreased.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus and a method for determining an overlap distance of an optical head capable of uniformizing an overlapped area.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a digital exposure device to determine an overlap distance of an optical head.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention disclose a method for determining an overlap distance for direct patterning using an optical lithography. The method includes detecting light amount distributions and positions of each light spot generated from an optical head to a substrate, the substrate comprising a first area and a second area. The method also includes generating a compensation model of each of the light spots by applying a Gaussian distribution function to the respective positions of the light spots and light amount distributions of the light spots. The method includes calculating a first accumulated light amount corresponding to each light spot of the first area of the substrate, the optical head being first scanned along a first direction of the substrate using the compensation model. The method also includes calculating a second accumulated light amount corresponding to each light spot of the second area overlapped with the first area, the overlap area being occurred when the optical head second scanned along the first direction after being moved in a second direction by a first distance using the compensation model. The method includes determining an overlap distance according to a uniformity of the summation of the first accumulated light amount and the second accumulated light amount.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention disclose an optical device. The optical device includes an optical head comprising a light modulation element to convert light into light comprising plural light paths, the optical head to generate a plurality of laser beams to a substrate by using the light modulation element. The optical device also includes a measuring part to detect positions and light amount distribution of each of light spots incident on a substrate. The optical device includes a calculating part to calculate a compensation model of each of the light spots by applying Gaussian distribution to the detected positions and the light amount distributions. The calculating part is configured to calculate a first accumulated light amount corresponding to the respective positions of the first area of the substrate when the optical head is scanned along a first direction of the substrate using the compensation model. The calculating part is also configured to calculate a second accumulated light amount corresponding to the respective positions of the second area overlapped with positions of the first area. The overlapped area is occurred when the optical head is second scanned along the first direction after being moved in a second direction by a first distance using the compensation model. An overlap distance is determined according to a uniformity of summations of the first accumulated light amounts and the second accumulated light amounts.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention disclose an apparatus. The apparatus includes a compensation part configured to detect an overlap area in a direct patterning using an optical lithography to compensate errors associated with the overlap area. The overlap area is determined by measuring positions and light amount of each light spot distributed on a substrate and the distribution is calculated by applying a Gaussian distribution to the measured positions and light amount distribution. The substrate comprises a first area comprising a plurality of sectors and a second area comprising a plurality of sectors, and a first accumulated amount is measured corresponding to the respective sectors of the first area in response to detection of a optical head scanning in a first direction and a second accumulated amount is measured corresponding to the respective sectors of the second area overlapped with the sectors of the first area in response to detection of a optical head is second scanned in the first direction after being moved in a second direction by a first distance. A control part is configured to control of a mirror arranged in matrix, the control being associated with selectively activating and inactivating light incidence on the substrate. The mirror is controlled by the overlap area and the overlap area is determined according to a uniformity of the summation of the first accumulated light amount and the second accumulated light amount.</p>

The method also includes determining, using the compensation model, a second accumulated light amount corresponding to each light spot of the second area overlapped with the first area the overlap area being occurred if the optical head is second scanned along the first direction after being moved in a second direction by a first distance. The method also includes controlling a stepping distance of the optical head to generate uniform light incidence with respect to the overlap area based on the determination of the first and second accumulated light amount.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Advantages and features of the present invention can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments and the accompanying drawings. The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the sizes and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numerals refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is understood that although numerical terms such as a first, a second, and a third may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these numerical terms. These terms may only be used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, an element, a component, a region, a layer or a section designated as &#x201c;first&#x201d; discussed below may be construed an element, a component, a region, a layer or a section designated as &#x201c;second&#x201d; without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is understood that terms related to spatially relative terms such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; may be used herein for easy understanding of illustration of one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It is understood that the spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features may be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; may encompass both an orientation of above and below. According to an exemplary configuration, a device may be otherwise oriented to a direction (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative terms used herein associated with other elements and/or features may be interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing exemplary embodiments only and may not be intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized exemplary embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the present invention. As such, various exemplary embodiments are illustrated by way of examples, and not by way of limitation, for example, variations due to manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances may be expected. Thus, illustrated exemplary embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but may be construed to include deviations in shapes that may be resulted from manufacturing configurations. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangular shape may, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are illustrative in nature and their shapes are not intended to restrict the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of a digital exposure device capable of determining an overlap distance of an optical head according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the digital exposure device may include an optical head <b>100</b>, a light source <b>200</b>, a mirror control part <b>310</b>, a stepping control part <b>320</b> and an overlap distance obtaining part <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The optical head <b>100</b> may include a light modulating element <b>110</b>, a splitter <b>120</b> and an optical system <b>130</b>. The optical head <b>100</b> may be connected to the light source <b>200</b>, the mirror control part <b>310</b> and the stepping control part <b>320</b>. In this example, the light modulating element may include a digital micro-mirror device (&#x201c;DMD&#x201d;) <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The light source <b>200</b> may be connected to the splitter <b>120</b> to provide the splitter <b>120</b> with a first light L<b>1</b> emitted from the light source <b>200</b>. The splitter <b>120</b> can receive the first light L<b>1</b> to provide a second light L<b>2</b> to the DMD <b>110</b> by converting a path of the first light L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The DMD <b>110</b> may reflect the second light L<b>2</b> to emit a plurality of third lights L<b>3</b> onto the optical system <b>130</b>. For example, the DMD <b>110</b> may include a plurality of micro-mirrors M. The micro-mirrors M may be arranged in an &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; matrix. Each of the &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; micro-mirrors M may reflect the second light L<b>2</b> to provide the optical system <b>130</b> with &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; third lights L<b>3</b>. The DMD <b>110</b> may selectively reflect the second light L<b>2</b> onto a substrate SU which may be disposed on a stage <b>400</b> based on an image data which can be transferred thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The mirror control part <b>310</b> may activate or inactivate each of the micro-mirrors M based on the image data. The mirror control part <b>310</b> can output a signal controlling an activation or inactivation of the micro-mirrors M to each of the micro-mirrors M. When the micro-mirrors M receive an activation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>, each of the micro-mirrors M may reflect the second light L<b>2</b> onto the optical system <b>130</b>. When portions of the micro-mirrors M receive an activation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>, corresponding micro-mirrors reflect the second light L<b>2</b> onto the optical system <b>130</b>. When the remaining micro-mirrors M receive an inactivation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>, the remaining micro-mirrors M do not reflect the second light L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, the optical system <b>130</b> may include a plurality of lenses. The optical system <b>130</b> may condense the third lights L<b>3</b> provided from the DMD <b>110</b>, and may emit a fourth light L<b>4</b> onto the stage <b>400</b> by adjusting a resolution of the condensed lights. The fourth lights L<b>4</b> may correspond to a plurality of laser beams which is provided to the stage <b>400</b> by the optical head <b>100</b>. When the &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; micro-mirrors M receive an activation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>, the number of laser beams can be &#x2018;m&#xd7;n.&#x2019; When portions of the &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; micro-mirrors M receive an activation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b> and the remaining of the &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; micro-mirrors M receives an inactivation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>, the number of laser beams may substantially be equal to the number of activated micro-mirrors M.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the laser beams may be provided on the substrate SU disposed on the stage <b>400</b> as a plurality of light spots <b>500</b>. In this example, the light spots <b>500</b> may be defined as an exposure area on which the laser beams are actually irradiated. When all of the micro-mirrors M receive an activation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>, the substrate SU receives &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; light spots <b>500</b> being substantially equal to the number of micro-mirrors M.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Since the DMD <b>110</b> is arranged in an &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; matrix, the optical head <b>100</b> may provide the substrate SU with the light spots <b>500</b> of an &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; matrix at a state that the optical head <b>100</b> and the stage <b>400</b> are stopped. In this example, at a state that the optical head <b>100</b> and the stage <b>400</b> are stopped, an area of the substrate SU between the light spots <b>500</b> adjacent to each other may be a non-exposure area where the laser beam may not be provided thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing an exposure of a substrate by using an optical head of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, portions of the micro-mirrors M may receive an activation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>, and the remaining of the micro-mirrors M may receive an inactivation data from the mirror control part <b>310</b>. Thus, the substrate SU can receive the light spots as many as the number of micro-mirrors M corresponding to the activation data. Therefore, a predetermined area of the substrate SU may selectively be exposed without a mask having a design of the image data between the optical head <b>100</b> and the substrate SU.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, the micro-mirrors M receiving the inactivation data may not provide the substrate SU with light. However, in order to show a relationship between the micro-mirrors M receiving the activation data and the micro-mirrors M receiving the inactivation data, and a position of the micro-mirrors M receiving the inactivation data, the micro-mirrors M receiving the inactivation data are denoted as &#x201c;a virtual spot,&#x201d; and a &#x201c;virtual spot&#x201d; represented by a reference numeral &#x201c;<b>520</b>.&#x201d; Moreover, exposing the substrate SU using the optical head <b>100</b> is for exposing a photoresist payer PR formed on the substrate SU. Hereinafter, the term &#x201c;an exposure of a substrate&#x201d; may include the term &#x201c;an exposure of a photoresist layer.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As the stage <b>400</b> is moved in a first direction D<b>1</b>, the substrate SU disposed on the stage <b>400</b> may be scanned by the optical head <b>100</b>. The angle of incline of optical head <b>100</b> disposed on the stage <b>400</b> may be at a predetermined angle &#x2018;&#x3b8;&#x2019; with respect to the substrate SU. As the stage <b>400</b> is moved in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the substrate SU may be exposed by the optical head <b>100</b>. For example, if all of the &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; micro-mirrors M receive an activation data to provide the substrate SU with a plurality of light spots <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the stage <b>400</b> may be moved in the first direction D<b>1</b> at a state that the stage <b>400</b> may be inclined with respect to the optical head <b>100</b> so that the substrate SU may be exposed by the optical head <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, as the stage <b>400</b> is moved in the first direction D<b>1</b> with respect to a straight line area along a straight line extended in the second direction D<b>2</b> of the substrate SU, the straight line area may sequentially receive light spots <b>500</b> provided by the micro-mirrors M of a first row, light spots <b>500</b> provided by the micro-mirrors M of a second row, and light spots <b>500</b> provided by the micro-mirrors M of a third row. Lastly, the &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; light spots <b>500</b> overlapped along the second direction D<b>2</b> may be irradiated into the straight line area. Thus, if an entire area of the substrate SU is divided into a plurality of straight line areas, the &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; light spots <b>500</b> may be irradiated onto each of the straight line areas. The &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; micro-mirrors M can provide light spots <b>500</b> spaced apart from each other to the substrate SU. However, since the stage <b>400</b> is moved in an inclined state in which the optical head <b>100</b> is inclined with respect to the stage <b>400</b> by a predetermined angle, the substrate SU corresponding to a scanned area of the optical head <b>100</b> may be exposed by the optical head <b>100</b> without an area where the substrate may not be exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the optical head <b>100</b> irradiates lights onto the substrate SU in a state that the optical head <b>100</b> is not inclined with respect to the stage <b>400</b>, for example, the optical head <b>100</b> is inclined by a predetermined angle &#x201c;&#x3b8;&#x201d; less than about 0.1 with respect to the stage <b>400</b>, lights may be not irradiated to areas of the substrate SU corresponding to an area between the light spots <b>500</b> adjacent to each other even though the optical head <b>100</b> is moved in the first direction D<b>1</b>. In this example, a continuous line pattern or a continuous area may not be exposed. In some examples, if a predetermined angle &#x201c;&#x3b8;&#x201d; is more than about 0.5, a distance between the light spots <b>500</b> provided by the micro-mirrors M of the first row and the light spots <b>500</b> provided by the micro-mirrors M of the second row may be increased at a straight line area of the stage <b>400</b>. Thus, pattern quality such as a line edge roughness (&#x201c;LER&#x201d;) may be deteriorated. Therefore, in order to provide a light amount of an optimum level to the whole substrate SU by using the optical head <b>100</b>, the predetermined angle &#x201c;&#x3b8;&#x201d; may be, for example, no less than about 0.1 to no more than about 0.5. (e.g., 0.1&#x3c;&#x3b8;&#x3c;0.5)</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The image data may determine a coordinate of an area which may be exposed on the substrate SU. The image data may be reflected to active or inactive data of the micro-mirrors M. Thus, if the micro-mirrors M corresponding to a coordinate of the substrate SU are matched to the coordinate while the substrate SU is moved in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the micro-mirrors M may receive an activation data to provide the light spot <b>500</b> to the substrate SU. Since the micro-mirror M which does not correspond to the coordinate receives an inactivation data, the substrate SU can only receive the virtual spot <b>520</b>. Thus, the substrate SU corresponding to an area on which the micro-mirrors M receiving the inactivation data is scanned may not be exposed. For example, a predetermined area of the substrate SU may selectively be exposed without a mask having a design in which the image data may be reflected between the optical head <b>100</b> and the substrate SU.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the stepping control part <b>320</b> may be connected to the optical head <b>100</b> to move the optical head <b>100</b> in one direction. Since a width of the optical head <b>100</b> is limited, lights may be not provided to an entire surface of the substrate SU by using one optical head <b>100</b>. Thus, the substrate SU may be divided into a plurality of unit areas which are extended in the first direction D<b>1</b> and are arranged in the second direction D<b>2</b>, and the substrate SU is scanned for plural times by using the optical head <b>100</b>. For example, the optical head <b>100</b> may firstly scan a first unit area A<b>1</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) of the substrate SU, and then secondly scan a second unit area A<b>2</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) adjacent to the first unit area A<b>1</b> after the optical head <b>100</b> is moved in the second direction D<b>2</b>. In this example, the stepping control part <b>320</b> may control that the optical head <b>100</b> is moved by a predetermined interval in the second direction D<b>2</b>. A movement of the optical head <b>100</b> in the second direction D<b>2</b> with respect to the substrate SU can be defined as &#x201c;a stepping,&#x201d; and a predetermined interval by which the optical head <b>100</b> is moved can be defined as &#x201c;a stepping distance.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The overlap distance obtaining part <b>330</b> may determine an overlapped area A<b>3</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) of the substrate SU and an overlap distance that is a width of the overlapped area A<b>3</b>. Since the optical head <b>100</b> firstly and secondly scans the substrate SU in a state in which the substrate SU is inclined with the optical head <b>100</b> by a predetermined angle, a boundary area between the first unit area A<b>1</b> and the second unit area A<b>2</b> is an area that can be formed to be exposed without a non-exposed area. The stepping distance may be determined based on the overlapped area A<b>3</b> and the overlap distance. The overlap distance obtaining part <b>330</b>, the overlapped area A<b>2</b> and the overlap distance will be described below in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of a process for determining an overlap distance obtaining part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the overlap distance obtaining part <b>330</b> may include a measuring part <b>331</b>, a first calculating part <b>333</b>, a second calculating part <b>334</b><i>a</i>, a third calculating part <b>334</b><i>b </i>and a determining part <b>337</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The measuring part <b>331</b> may measure a position and a light amount distribution of each of the light spots <b>500</b> provided to substrate SU from the optical head <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, the micro-mirrors M of the optical head <b>100</b> are theoretically designed to have an &#x2018;m&#xd7;n&#x2019; square matrix, but alternative exemplary embodiments may be implemented. For example, a matrix forming the micro-mirrors M may not be a perfect square shape. Moreover, the substrate SU may not receive a light spot having a shape identical to the laser beam. A refraction of a light spot can be generated due to air generated in a process that the laser beam irradiated from the optical head <b>100</b> is reached to the substrate SU so that the positions and light amount distributions of ideal light spots and the positions and light amount distributions of the light spots <b>500</b> actually being measured may be different from each other. The measuring part <b>331</b> may measure the position and light amount distribution of the light spots <b>500</b> so that the overlap distance obtaining part <b>330</b> may reflect the position and light amount distribution of the light spots <b>500</b> to determine the overlap distance. For example, the measuring part <b>331</b> may include an optical sensor disposed on the substrate SU.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The first calculating part <b>333</b> may use Gaussian distribution function to the position and light amount distribution of the light spots <b>500</b> measured by the measuring part <b>331</b> to calculate compensation models of each of the light spots <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The second calculating part <b>334</b><i>a </i>may calculate a first accumulated light amount corresponding to each of first sub-areas of the substrate SU if the optical head <b>100</b> is scanned in the first direction D<b>1</b> by using the compensation model.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an ideal light spot may be disposed at a first position <b>112</b> on the substrate SU. However, actual light spots <b>500</b> may be positioned at a second position <b>114</b> which is not matched to the first position <b>112</b> on the substrate SU. Thus, the overlap distance obtaining part <b>330</b> can measure the second position <b>114</b> that is an actual position of the light spots <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a light amount distribution of one of the light spots <b>500</b> is described. Since the light spots <b>500</b> have the different light amounts by areas of the light spots <b>500</b>, the light amount distribution may not be uniform in a single light spot <b>500</b>. For example, the light spot <b>500</b> may be classified into a high area HA in which an energy is condensed to have a high energy and a low area &#x2018;LA&#x2019; which has a lower energy than the high area &#x2018;HA.&#x2019; As described above, in one light spot <b>500</b>, light amount distributions may be different from one another in accordance with areas, and light amount distributions of the different light spots <b>500</b> may be different from one another.

An energy may be the highest in a center portion of the light spots <b>500</b>, and the energy may gradually be decreased as it goes further away from the center portion thereof to be closer toward an edge portion thereof. At an area which is scanned for once by the optical head <b>100</b>, the light spots <b>500</b> may be overlapped through the scanning process so that total summations of the light amounts corresponding to the scanned area may be determined. The Gaussian distribution function may be applied to a position and a light amount distribution of the light spots <b>500</b> so that each compensation model of the light spots <b>500</b> may be calculated.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step S<b>20</b>, Gaussian distribution function is applied to the position and the light amount distribution to calculate compensation models of each of the light spots <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A first accumulated light amount respectively corresponding to each first area of the substrate may be calculated in a case where the optical head is scanned along a first direction of the substrate SU using the compensation model, per step S<b>30</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the second calculating part <b>334</b><i>a </i>may calculate a first accumulated light amount at the first unit area A<b>1</b> if the optical head <b>100</b> is moved along the first direction D<b>1</b> of the substrate SU to expose the first unit area A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, the third calculating part <b>334</b><i>b </i>may calculate a second accumulated light amount at the second unit area A<b>2</b> if the optical head <b>100</b> is moved along the second direction D<b>2</b> of the substrate SU to expose the second unit area A<b>2</b>. The optical head <b>100</b> of the step for calculating the second accumulated light amount is defined as the optical head <b>100</b> is moved by the first distance along the second distance D<b>1</b> in comparison with the step for calculating the first accumulated light amount.

An area in which the first and second unit areas A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> are overlapped with each other may be defined as the overlapped area A<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, if the first unit area A<b>1</b> and the second unit area A<b>2</b> are divided into a plurality of first areas and a plurality of second areas, respectively, the overlapped area A<b>3</b> may also be divided into a plurality of third areas OV<b>1</b>, OV<b>2</b> and OV<b>3</b>. The third areas OV<b>1</b>, OV<b>2</b> and OV<b>3</b> are areas simultaneously corresponding to the firstly exposed area if the first unit area A<b>1</b> is exposed and the secondly exposed area if the second unit area A<b>2</b> is exposed.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the firstly exposed areas at the overlapped area A<b>3</b> may be defined as first sub-areas D<b>11</b>, D<b>12</b> and D<b>13</b>, and the secondly exposed areas at the overlapped area A<b>3</b> are defined as second sub-areas D<b>21</b>, D<b>22</b> and D<b>23</b>.

Moreover, if the compensation model is used, the second accumulated light amounts of the second sub-areas D<b>21</b>, D<b>22</b> and D<b>23</b> may respectively be calculated. The second accumulated light amounts of the second sub-areas D<b>21</b>, D<b>22</b> and D<b>23</b> may be lower than the second accumulated light amounts of the second areas except the second sub-areas D<b>21</b>, D<b>22</b> and D<b>23</b>. The overlapped area A<b>3</b> is exposed twice through a first scanning process and a second scanning process of the optical head <b>100</b>. Moreover, a portion of the overlapped area A<b>3</b> which is passed by the optical head <b>100</b>, if the optical head <b>100</b> firstly scans the substrate SU, and a portion of the overlapped area A<b>3</b> which is passed by the optical head <b>100</b>, if the optical head <b>100</b> secondly scans the substrate SU, are in a symmetrical relationship such as a point-to-point correspondence.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the total summation is determined as non-uniform, the determining part <b>337</b> may calculate the first and second accumulated light amounts by assuming that the optical head <b>100</b> is moved by a second distance different from the first distance, and may determine whether the total summation of the first and second accumulated light amounts is uniform or non-uniform at each portion of overlapped areas. By repeatedly performing the above steps, when the total summation is determined as uniform, the determining part <b>337</b> may determine the overlapped area and the overlap distance, and an operation of the determining part <b>337</b> may be ended.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some examples, the overlapped area and the overlap distance may be determined by reflecting information on light spots <b>500</b> which is actually provided to the substrate SU by the optical head <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is observed that the overlap distance obtaining part <b>330</b> is divided into the second calculating part <b>334</b><i>a </i>and the third calculating part <b>334</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, the second calculating part <b>334</b><i>a </i>and the third calculating part <b>334</b><i>b </i>may be integrated with each other to realize an integrated calculating part (not shown) which calculates the first and second accumulated light amounts.

Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.</p>
