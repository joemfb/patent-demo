<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(b) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional gaming machine includes a display arranged with a plurality of symbols. The gaming machine rearranges the symbols in a unit game, and awards a payout to a player according to the combination of rearranged symbols (for example, United State Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0058067 and United State Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0058072). The player can start another unit game after one unit game ends.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the conventional gaming machine, although the unit games are repeatedly executed, there is continuity of the unit games. Since the conventional gaming machine does not provide the continuity of the unit games, it is difficult to attract a player's interest in a game.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A gaming machine according to an embodiment includes: a symbol display configured to display an arrangement and a rendering movement of a plurality of symbols for a game, the plurality of symbols including a first symbol and a second symbol different from the first symbol; and a controller configured to control the symbol display, to determine the arrangement and the rendering movement of the symbols in a round of the game, to determine whether the rendering movement satisfies a first condition, to receive an input from a player, to determine whether a time of the input from the player is within a predetermined time duration during the rendering movement when the rendering movement satisfies the first condition, the predetermined time duration starting at a predetermined frame before the first symbol reaches at a predetermined position, and to stop a group of the symbols including the first symbol in response to the input from the player when the time of the input is within the predetermined time duration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The controller may be further configured maintain the rendering movement of the symbols when the time of input from the player is out of the predetermined time duration.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the following detailed description, only certain embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, simply by way of illustration. As those skilled in the art would realize, the described embodiments may be modified in various different ways, all without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the specification.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">(Outline of Gaming Machine and Gaming Method)</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A gaming machine according to an embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of a gaming machine according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic front view of an exemplary symbol display of a gaming machine according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a gaming machine <b>1</b> according to an embodiment includes a symbol display SD, an input unit IN, and a controller CN connected to the symbol display SD and the input unit IN. The gaming machine <b>1</b> may execute a base game and a bonus game different from the base game.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The symbol display SD displays a plurality of symbols SB used for the base game, in a moving state or in a stop state. The symbols SB in the stop state form an arrangement, and a player may win a prize when the arrangement of the symbols SB satisfies a predetermined condition. The symbols SB start to move, perform a rendering movement, and then stop the movement in an execution of the base game.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The symbols SB include ordinary symbols <b>51</b> and at least one scatter symbol S<b>2</b>. Although the ordinary symbols S<b>2</b> may win the base game only in a form of combination, the scatter symbol S<b>2</b>, even only one scattering symbol S<b>2</b>, may award a prize to a player regardless of its position on the symbol display SD. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the scattering symbol S<b>2</b> is denoted by a word &#x201c;BONUS,&#x201d; and thus the scattering symbol S<b>2</b> will be often referred to as a &#x201c;bonus symbol&#x201d; hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the symbol display SD may include a plurality of display blocks DB that show respective symbols SB in a stop state. The display blocks DB may be arranged in a matrix, i.e., rows and columns, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows 3&#xd7;5 display blocks DB. The symbols SB that can occupy each column of the display blocks DB may be disposed on a reel RL that may be an actual/mechanical reel or a virtual/video reel. Each reel RL includes a series of the symbols SB arranged in sequence, and three consecutive symbols of each reel RL can be displayed on the symbol display SD in a stop state. Each reel RL may include one or two scatter symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows an exemplary payline PL that passes through a display block DB in each column When a combination of the symbols SB on the payline PL in the base game satisfies a predetermined condition, a player wins the game. For example, if all the symbols SB in a combination are the same, the gaming machine <b>1</b> awards a prize to the player. Such a combination of the symbols SB that provides a win is referred to as a &#x201c;winning combination.&#x201d; The payline PL shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is merely an example, and various paylines may be drawn and two or more paylines may be selected by a player.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition to a win with the payline PL (referred to as a &#x201c;line win&#x201d;), there is another type of win referred to as &#x201c;scatter win&#x201d; that is given when the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> is shown on the symbol display SD.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The input unit IN includes a plurality of buttons BT, for example, a bet button B<b>1</b> and a spin button <b>51</b> that are operable by a player. The bet button B<b>1</b> is used for betting on a game, and the spin button B<b>2</b> is used for starting the rearrangement of the symbols SB (or for starting the game) and for stopping the symbols SB in a predetermined condition.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The controller CN receives inputs from the input unit IN, and executes the base game and the bonus game, and controls the symbol display SD with the symbols SB in response to inputs from the input unit IN.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Now, a gaming method according to an embodiment is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic flow chart illustrating a gaming method according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are schematic front views of an exemplary symbol display, illustrating a gaming method according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The controller CN of the gaming machine <b>1</b> make the symbol display SD display a plurality of symbols SB before starting a game.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the controller CN executes a normal round of the base game according to inputs from a player (S<b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The inputs from the player include an input from the bet button B<b>1</b> and another input from the spin button B<b>2</b>. The player determines a bet amount by pressing the bet button B<b>1</b>, and starts the normal round of the base game by pressing the spin button B<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Upon Receipt of the input from the spin button B<b>2</b>, the controller CN determines the arrangement of the symbols SB, for example, by using a random number generator (not shown), and determines whether one or more winning combinations occur. Based on the determined symbol arrangement and the available winning combinations, the controller CN determines a rendering movement mode of the symbols SB that may determine for example, moving speeds and directions of the symbols SB, and may further determine sound and/or lighting effect rendering to be supplied by a separately equipped rendering unit (not shown), and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thereafter, the controller CN makes the symbol display SD display the rendering movements of the symbols SB according to the determined rendering movement mode.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, the controller CN executes a skill stop process (S<b>320</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the controller CN determines whether the determined rendering movement mode satisfies a predetermined condition (S<b>410</b>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, there may be some rendering movement modes called slow spinning modes that make the reels RL spin slowly in common or in sequence for a predetermined time. In detail, the reels RL start spinning, increase their speed to spin fast, decrease their speed, and then maintain their slow speed for the predetermined time before stopping their spin in the slow spinning modes. If the determined rendering movement mode is one of the slow spinning modes, the controller CN determines that the determined rendering movement mode satisfies the predetermined condition.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the determined rendering movement mode satisfies a predetermined condition, the controller CN allows the player to perform skill stop on a predetermined symbol, for example, the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> for a predetermined time duration. In detail, the controller CN may be configured to receive a player's input for the skill stop within the predetermined time duration during the rendering movement and not to not to receive the player's input before and after the predetermined time duration. The player's input may be a push of a stop button, for example, the spin button S<b>2</b> or a separately provided stop button.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The predetermined time duration may depend on a position of the scatter symbol S<b>2</b>. For example, the beginning and the end the predetermined time duration may be determined by a time when the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> arrives at a predetermined position, and the predetermined position may be, for example, a position on the symbol display SD. For example, the predetermined time duration begins a predetermined frame before the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> arrives at a predetermined position, and ends when the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> passes through the predetermined position. A frame denotes a time duration for one period of periodic motion of the scatter symbol S<b>2</b>, and the predetermined frame may be a half frame, a quarter frame, or another. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a frame may denote one rotation (or one spin) of a reel RL.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once a skill stop chance is given to the player, the player may observe the movement of the symbols SB and try to stop the predetermined symbol (for example, the scatter symbol S<b>2</b>) on the symbol display SD by pressing the stop button (for example, the spin button S<b>2</b>) at an exact time within the predetermined time duration for obtaining a win. If the player presses the stop button at a time other than the predetermined time duration, there is no response from the gaming machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is noted that the symbol for the skill stop is predetermined by the controller CN, and thus the player may not select a symbol for the skill stop. Although the predetermined symbol is the scatter symbol S<b>2</b>, it may be another symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Therefore, the controller CN determines whether there is an input from the player when the determined rendering movement mode satisfies a predetermined condition (S<b>420</b>). When an input from the player is received, the controller CN determines whether a time of the input from the player is within the predetermined time duration (S<b>430</b>). When the input from the player is within the predetermined time duration (S<b>430</b>: YES), the controller CN stops the movement of at least a group of the symbols SB that move coincidentally with the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> (S<b>440</b>). For example, the group of the symbols SB may be the symbols SB on the same reel RL in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Whether the player win or not may depend on the exact timing of the button pressing. If the player presses the spin button S<b>2</b> at an exact time within the predetermined time duration, the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> may stop at a position on the symbol display SD to cause the player win the game. Otherwise, the player fails to win.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a situation where the player succeeded in stopping the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> of the fourth reel RL<b>4</b> at the first row using the skill stop.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Since the skill stop can be allowed for two or more scatter symbols S<b>2</b>, the controller CN repeats <b>5420</b> to <b>5440</b> until the last skill stop finishes (S<b>450</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the skill stop for the scatter symbol S<b>2</b> may be performed reel by reel. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the controller CN may allow the skill stop for two right reels RL<b>4</b> and RL<b>5</b>. In this case, after left three reels RL<b>1</b>-RL<b>3</b> stop, the controller CN may allow the skill stop for the left of the two reels RL<b>4</b> and RL<b>5</b>, and, after the action of the skill stop finishes, the controller CN may allow the skill stop for the right of the two reels RL<b>4</b> and RL<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The skill stop of the player may change the previously-determined arrangement of the symbols SB as well as the win status of the normal round. Therefore, the controller CN updates the result (S<b>460</b>), and then finishes the skill stop process.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the player fails to press the stop button within the predetermined time or if the determined rendering movement mode does not give a chance to perform a skill stop, the controller CN may have the symbols SB maintain the rendering movement.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> again, when the result of the execution of the game and the skill stop process in the normal round, i.e., when the finalized arrangement of the symbols SB satisfies a predetermined condition (S<b>330</b>: YES), the controller CN triggers and executes the bonus game (S<b>340</b>). The predetermined condition may be a condition where five or more scatter symbols SB are shown in the symbol display SD. The bonus game may be visible on the symbol display SD, but may be visible on another display (not shown) especially when the symbol display SD includes actual reels. Examples of the bonus game may include a spinning wheel or a dice wheel, and the player may use the buttons BT for the start of the bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The bonus game may be repeated by a number determined by the arrangement of the symbols SB that triggers the bonus game. For example, the number of repetition of the bonus game may depend on the number of the scatter symbols S<b>2</b> in the symbol arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After finishing the bonus game, the controller CN executes a free round of the base game (S<b>350</b>). The free round may be executed without actual betting of the player, and the betting amount used for determining the win prize of the free round may be that of the normal round executed just before the bonus game. The free round may be repeated by a determined number, for example, seven.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The controller CN performs the skill stop process for the free round like the normal round (S<b>360</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the result of the execution and the skill stop process in the free round, i.e., the arrangement of the symbols SB satisfies the predetermined condition (S<b>370</b>: YES), the controller CN retriggers the bonus game (S<b>340</b>). In addition, the controller CN may increase the number of the repetition of the free round. The increased number of the repetition of the free round may be also predetermined, for example, by five that is smaller than that given when triggered from the normal node.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the last execution of the free game is finished (S<b>380</b>: YES), the controller CN executes a normal round again (S<b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The player may win an additional prize after finishing the free round. The additional prize is determined based on the number of the scatter symbols SB appeared in the free round and the prize amount determined in the bonus game. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the additional prize may be the product of the number of the scatter symbols SB and the prize amount determined in the bonus game.</p>
