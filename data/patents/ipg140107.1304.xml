<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An inner peripheral end portion of an annular back peripheral portion forming a front flange portion, an opening end portion of a front bead seat portion and a back surface portion of a wheel disc are joined to each other by a first welded portion and a second welded portion. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the front flange portion from being repeatedly elastically deformed by loads generated while the automobile is running. In addition, it is possible to mitigate a stress concentration generated on the front flange portion and the first welded portion and the second welded portion. Thus, an automobile wheel can exhibit high durability.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO PRIOR APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Priority is claimed to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-291653, filed on Dec. 24, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an automobile wheel in which a wheel rim on which a tire is to be mounted and a wheel disc to which an axle is to be coupled are welded to each other for integration.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are so-called two-piece automobile wheels in which a generally cylindrical wheel rim and a generally disc-like wheel disc are welded to each other. As such two-piece automobile wheels, there are known full-face automobile wheels in which a front flange portion is formed at an outer peripheral edge portion of the wheel disc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of the full-face automobile wheels is proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. JP-A-Hei 11-42901, for example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a wheel rim &#x201c;f&#x201d; includes a front bead seat portion &#x201c;g&#x201d; provided at one opening edge portion and a back flange portion &#x201c;j&#x201d; provided at the other opening edge portion. A wheel disc &#x201c;p&#x201d; includes a front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; provided at an outer peripheral edge portion and folded backward in a curved shape. An opening end portion &#x201c;h&#x201d; of the front bead seat portion &#x201c;g&#x201d; of the wheel rim &#x201c;f&#x201d; and an inner peripheral end portion &#x201c;v&#x201d; of the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; of the wheel disc &#x201c;p&#x201d; are welded to each other over the entire circumference of the wheel to form a full-face automobile wheel &#x201c;m&#x201d;. The thus configured full-face automobile wheel &#x201c;m&#x201d; can secure a large design surface on the wheel disc &#x201c;p&#x201d;, advantageously providing high design quality.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the configuration disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. JP-A-Hei 11-42901, the opening end portion &#x201c;h&#x201d; of the front bead seat portion &#x201c;g&#x201d; of the wheel rim &#x201c;f&#x201d; and the inner peripheral end portion &#x201c;v&#x201d; of the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; of the wheel disc &#x201c;p&#x201d; are welded to each other so that a welded portion &#x201c;i&#x201d; joins the wheel rim &#x201c;f&#x201d; and the wheel disc &#x201c;p&#x201d; to each other. When an automobile equipped with the automobile wheel &#x201c;m&#x201d; is running, a load acts on the wheel rim &#x201c;f&#x201d; via a tire, and a load acts on the wheel disc &#x201c;p&#x201d; via an axle. The front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; of the automobile wheel &#x201c;m&#x201d; includes an annular front peripheral portion &#x201c;s&#x201d; provided on the design surface side, and an annular back peripheral portion &#x201c;t&#x201d; formed continuously from the annular front peripheral portion &#x201c;s&#x201d; and folded backward in a curved shape. A hollow area is formed between the annular front peripheral portion and the annular back peripheral portion &#x201c;t&#x201d; Due to the shape of the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; described above, the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; tends to be repeatedly elastically deformed by the load acting on the wheel rim &#x201c;f&#x201d; and the load acting on the wheel disc &#x201c;p&#x201d;, and tends to be subjected to a stress concentration. Further, because the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; is folded backward through a pressing process or the like, a residual stress may be caused at a curved outer peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d;. The durability of the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; is limited by the residual stress and the stress concentration due to the loads described above.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The welded portion &#x201c;i&#x201d; described above at which the opening end portion &#x201c;h&#x201d; of the front bead seat portion &#x201c;g&#x201d; and the inner peripheral end portion &#x201c;v&#x201d; of the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; are welded to each other also tends to be subjected to a stress concentration caused by the above loads acting while the vehicle is running. If the welded portion &#x201c;i&#x201d; should be cracked (broken), air in the tire may leak. Thus, it is desired to improve the durability of the welded portion &#x201c;i&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention proposes an automobile wheel that includes a wheel disc with a front flange portion folded backward and a wheel disc and that can exhibit high durability.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the present invention provides an automobile wheel including a wheel rim in which a back flange portion is formed at one opening edge portion and a front bead seat portion is formed at the other opening edge portion, and a wheel disc in which a front flange portion is formed at an outer peripheral edge portion, in which the front flange portion of the wheel disc includes an annular front peripheral portion provided on a design surface side and an annular back peripheral portion folded backward from the annular front peripheral portion and formed continuously from the annular front peripheral portion to extend radially inward, the automobile wheel includes: a first welded portion in which an inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion forming the front flange portion of the wheel disc and an opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim are welded to each other; and a second welded portion in which the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim and a back surface portion of the wheel disc are welded to each other, and one of the first welded portion and the second welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel, and the other of the first welded portion and the second welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel or intermittently at a plurality of points along the circumference of the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second aspect of the present invention provides an automobile wheel including a wheel rim in which a back flange portion is formed at one opening edge portion and a front bead seat portion is formed at the other opening edge portion, and a wheel disc in which a front flange portion is formed at an outer peripheral edge portion, in which the front flange portion of the wheel disc includes an annular front peripheral portion provided on a design surface side and an annular back peripheral portion folded backward from the annular front peripheral portion and formed continuously from the annular front peripheral portion to extend radially inward, the automobile wheel includes: a first welded portion in which an inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion forming the front flange portion of the wheel disc and an opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim are welded to each other; and a second welded portion in which the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc and a back surface portion of the wheel disc are welded to each other, and the first welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel, and the second welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel or intermittently at a plurality of points along the circumference of the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The front flange portion supports a bead of a tire, which is mounted on the wheel, from a side. Therefore, with the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion formed at the outer peripheral edge portion of the wheel disc and the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim joined to each other through the first welded portion, it is possible to obtain strength and rigidity necessary and sufficient to support the bead of the tire from a side. According to the configuration of this example, in which at least one of the first welded portion and the second welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel, leakage of air in the tire can be prevented. In the configuration according to this aspect, preferably, the first welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel. This further improves the strength and rigidity of the front flange portion to support the bead of the tire from a side. According to the configuration of another aspect, in which the first welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel, leakage of air in the tire can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the configurations according to the above aspects, the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim, the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc, and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are directly or indirectly joined to each other by the first welded portion and the second welded portion. In the case of the first aspect, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim are directly joined to each other by the first welded portion. Further, the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are directly joined to each other by the second welded portion. That is, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are joined to each other via the first welded portion and the second welded portion. In the case of the second aspect, meanwhile, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim are directly joined to each other by the first welded portion. Further, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are directly joined to each other by the second welded portion. That is, the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are directly joined to each other via the first welded portion and the second welded portion. According to the configurations of the above aspects, it is possible to prevent the loads generated while the automobile is running discussed above from acting on the front flange portion of the wheel disc. Therefore, it is possible to prevent an outer peripheral edge portion (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;folded peripheral edge portion&#x201d;) of the front flange portion of the wheel disc from being repeatedly elastically deformed, and to mitigate a stress concentration generated on the folded peripheral edge portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, with the wheel rim and the wheel disc joined to each other by the first welded portion and the second welded portion described above, the strength and rigidity of the joint between the wheel rim and the wheel disc can be improved compared to the configuration according to the related art discussed above. In addition, it is possible to mitigate a stress concentration generated on the first welded portion and the second welded portion by the loads generated while the automobile is running as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the configurations of the above aspects, the folded peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion and the first welded portion and the second welded portion can have a sufficient stress allowance before their respective durability limits are reached since it is possible to mitigate a stress concentration generated on the folded peripheral edge portion and the first and second welded portions. Thus, the durability of the wheel against loads acting while the automobile is running is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first welded portion and the second welded portion may be formed by welding from the radially outer side of the wheel rim, or may be formed by welding from the radially inner side of the wheel rim. Further, one of the first welded portion and the second welded portion may be formed by welding from the radially outer side of the wheel rim, and the other of the first welded portion and the second welded portion may be formed by welding from the radially inner side of the wheel rim.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the automobile wheel according to one of the aspects discussed above, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion forming the front flange portion of the wheel disc, the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim, and the back surface portion of the wheel disc may be integrally joined to each other by a continuous welded portion in which the first welded portion and the second welded portion are formed continuously with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In such a configuration, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are directly joined to each other by the continuous welded portion, and the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are directly joined to each other by the continuous welded portion. Accordingly, it is possible to further prevent the folded peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc from being repeatedly elastically deformed by loads generated while the automobile is running, and to further improve the effect of mitigating a stress concentration generated on the folded peripheral edge portion. Furthermore, it is possible to improve the strength and rigidity of the continuous welded portion, and to further improve the effect of mitigating a stress concentration generated on the continuous welded portion by loads generated while the automobile is running. Thus, the effect of the present invention discussed above to improve the durability of the wheel against loads generated while the automobile is running is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The continuous welded portion may be formed as a result of separately preparing the first welded portion and the second welded portion so as to be continuous with each other, or may be prepared such that the first welded portion and the second welded portion are formed continuously with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the case where one of the first welded portion and the second welded portion is formed intermittently at a plurality of points along the circumference of the wheel in the first aspect discussed above, and in the case where the second welded portion is formed intermittently at a plurality of points along the circumference of the wheel in the second aspect discussed above, the continuous welded portion may be formed intermittently at a plurality of points along the circumference of the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the automobile wheel according to one of the aspects discussed above, an annular joint groove, in which the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim is to be seated, may be formed circumferentially in the back surface portion of the wheel disc, and the annular joint groove, the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion seated in the annular joint groove, and the inner peripheral end portion of the front flange portion may be integrally joined to each other by the continuous welded portion in which the first welded portion and the second welded portion are formed continuously with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The continuous welded portion is formed with the first welded portion and the second welded portion continuous with each other, and thus tends to be relatively large. In this configuration, a part of the continuous welded portion can be formed in the annular joint groove by seating the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim in the annular joint groove formed in the back surface portion of the wheel disc and welding the opening end portion in the annular joint groove. Therefore, the continuous welded portion can be prevented from swelling out. Since the continuous welded portion is not swelled in the case where the continuous welded portion is formed from the outer side of the wheel rim, interference between a bead of a tire, which is mounted on the automobile wheel, and the continuous welded portion can be suppressed. Accordingly, the bead of the tire can be securely brought into tight contact with the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim and the front flange portion of the wheel disc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the automobile wheel according to one of the aspects discussed above, the front flange portion of the wheel disc may be formed such that a back surface of the annular front peripheral portion and a front surface of the annular back peripheral portion contact each other.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to such a configuration, the integrity between the annular front peripheral portion and the annular back peripheral portion forming the front flange portion is improved. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the folded peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion from being repeatedly locally elastically deformed as much as possible. Accordingly, the effect of mitigating a stress concentration generated on the folded peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc while the vehicle is running is further improved. Furthermore, the front flange portion can exhibit high strength and rigidity. Thus, the effect of the present invention discussed above to improve the durability of the wheel against loads acting while the automobile is running is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the automobile wheel according to an example of the present invention, as discussed above, one of the first welded portion, in which the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion forming the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim are welded to each other, and the second welded portion, in which the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are welded to each other, is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel, and the other of the first welded portion and the second welded portion is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel or intermittently at a plurality of points along the circumference of the wheel. Meanwhile, in the automobile wheel according to another example, as discussed above, the first welded portion in which the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion forming the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim are welded to each other is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel, and the second welded portion in which the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc and the back surface portion of the wheel disc are welded to each other is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel or intermittently at a plurality of points along the circumference of the wheel. According to either of the automobile wheels, it is possible to mitigate a stress concentration generated on the folded peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion and the first welded portion and the second welded portion by loads generated while the automobile is running, generally improving the durability of the wheel against the loads generated while the automobile is running. Thus, the automobile wheel according to the present invention exhibits high durability.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the automobile wheel discussed above, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion of the wheel disc, the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim, and the back surface portion of the wheel disc may be integrally joined to each other by the continuous welded portion in which the first welded portion and the second welded portion are formed continuously with each other. In such a case, the inner peripheral end portion of the annular back peripheral portion of the front flange portion and the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion are directly joined to the back surface portion of the wheel disc, and thus the effect of mitigating a stress concentration generated on the folded peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion is further improved. Further, the continuous welded portion exhibits high strength and rigidity, and the effect of mitigating a stress concentration generated on the continuous welded portion is further improved. Thus, the effect of the present invention discussed above to improve the durability of the wheel against loads generated while the automobile is running is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the automobile wheel discussed above, the opening end portion of the front bead seat portion of the wheel rim may be seated in the annular joint groove formed, circumferentially in the back surface portion of the wheel disc, and welded in the annular joint groove by the continuous welded portion. In such a case, a part of the continuous welded portion can be formed in the annular joint groove, and thus the continuous welded portion can be prevented from swelling out. Therefore, a bead of a tire, which is mounted on the automobile wheel, can be securely brought into tight contact with the front bead seat portion and the front flange portion preventing occurrence of a failure such as leakage of air.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the automobile wheel discussed above, the front flange portion of the wheel disc may be formed such that the back surface of the annular front peripheral portion and the front surface of the annular back peripheral portion contact each other. In such a case, the strength and rigidity of the front flange portion can be improved, and it is possible to prevent the folded peripheral edge portion of the front flange portion from being repeatedly locally elastically deformed as much as possible. Thus, the effect is to improve the durability of the wheel against loads generated while the automobile is running.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An automobile wheel <b>1</b> according to an example of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of the automobile wheel <b>1</b> according to an example. The automobile wheel <b>1</b> is a so-called two-piece steel wheel formed by joining a wheel rim <b>2</b> and a wheel disc <b>3</b> each formed from a flat steel plate to each other. The automobile wheel <b>1</b> has a full-face configuration in which a front flange portion <b>31</b> is provided at an outer peripheral edge portion of the wheel disc <b>3</b>. In this example, the direction from the back surface side of the wheel disc <b>3</b> toward the design surface side is defined to as a &#x201c;forward direction&#x201d;, and the opposite direction is defined to as a &#x201c;backward direction&#x201d;. Also, the direction toward the center axis L of the automobile wheel <b>1</b> along the radial direction of the wheel is defined to as a &#x201c;radially inward direction&#x201d;, and the opposite direction is defined to as a &#x201c;radially outward direction&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The wheel rim <b>2</b> mentioned above is generally in the shape of a cylinder, and includes a back flange portion <b>12</b> provided at one (a rear) opening edge portion to support a back bead of a tire, and a back bead seat portion <b>14</b> which is formed continuously with the back flange portion <b>12</b> and on which the back bead of the tire is to be seated for support and fixation. The wheel rim <b>2</b> further includes a front bead seat portion <b>13</b> which is provided at the other (a front) opening edge portion and on which a front bead of the tire is to be seated for support and fixation. That is, no front flange portion <b>31</b> is formed at the other (front) opening edge portion of the wheel rim <b>2</b>, and a front opening edge portion of the wheel rim <b>2</b> is formed by the annular front bead seat portion <b>13</b> extending along the front-back direction. The wheel rim <b>2</b> additionally includes a well portion <b>15</b> which is provided between the front and back bead seat portions <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> and into which the front and back beads of the tire are to be dropped to mount the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The thus configured wheel rim <b>2</b> may be formed by abutting the short sides of a generally rectangular flat steel plate against each other and welding the short sides to each other to form a cylindrical member with a straight body, and then performing a so-called rolling process in which the cylindrical member is pressed by predetermined dies from both the inner and outer sides of the cylindrical member while it is rotated in the circumferential direction. The formation of the wheel rim <b>2</b> may be performed using a conventional formation method, and therefore is not described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Meanwhile, the wheel disc <b>3</b> mentioned above is generally in the shape of a disc, and includes a hub mounting portion <b>21</b> provided at the center to be coupled to a hub of an axle, and a front flange portion <b>31</b> provided circumferentially at an outer peripheral edge portion. The wheel disc <b>3</b> additionally includes a plurality of spoke portions <b>22</b> provided between and formed continuously with the hub mounting portion <b>21</b> and the front flange portion <b>31</b> and arranged, at equal intervals in the circumferential direction to extend radially. Further, ornamental holes <b>25</b> are respectively formed between adjacent ones of the spoke portions <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A hub hole <b>27</b> is formed in the center of the hub mounting portion <b>21</b>. A plurality of bolt holes <b>28</b> are formed radially outwardly of the hub hole <b>27</b> and arranged at equal intervals in the circumferential direction. The components of the wheel disc <b>3</b> are arranged concentrically around the center axis L of the wheel disc <b>3</b>. The spoke portions <b>22</b> are formed to swell forward from the peripheral edge of the hub mounting portion <b>21</b>. The front flange portion <b>31</b> is formed to be smoothly continuous from the outer end of each of the spoke portions <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The front flange portion <b>31</b> is folded backward to extend radially inward, and includes an annular front peripheral portion <b>32</b> provided on the design surface side and formed continuously from an outer end of each of the spoke portions <b>22</b>, and an annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> formed continuously from the annular front peripheral portion <b>32</b> to extend backward and inward. A folded peripheral edge portion <b>34</b> provided at the boundary between the annular front peripheral portion <b>32</b> and the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> in the front flange portion <b>31</b> forms the outermost peripheral edge of the wheel disc <b>3</b>. The front flange portion <b>31</b> is discussed in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The thus configured wheel disc <b>3</b> may be formed by performing a pressing process on a generally circular flat steel plate. The formation of the wheel disc <b>3</b> may be performed using a conventional formation method, and therefore is not described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The automobile wheel <b>1</b> according to an example is formed by welding the wheel rim <b>2</b> and the wheel disc <b>3</b> discussed above to each other. The formation of the automobile wheel <b>1</b> is discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the front flange portion <b>31</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> described above is formed with a back surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the annular front peripheral portion <b>32</b> and a front surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> entirely contact each other. That is, the back surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the annular front peripheral portion <b>32</b> and the front surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> are in surface contact with each other, and the front flange portion <b>31</b> is formed as if both the rear and front surfaces <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>a </i>were integral with each other. Therefore, unlike the configuration according to the related art discussed above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), no space is provided between the annular front peripheral portion <b>32</b> and the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the first example, the inside diameter of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> is set to be slightly larger than the outside diameter of an opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> described above. Accordingly, as discussed later, an inner peripheral end portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> is positioned radially outwardly of the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> with the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> abutted against a back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, an annular joint groove <b>35</b> dented forward is formed circumferentially around the center axis L in the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>. The annular joint groove <b>35</b> is formed adjacently on the inner side of the inner peripheral end portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> so that the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> is to be seated in the annular joint groove <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The wheel disc <b>3</b> and the wheel rim <b>2</b> are joined to each other by positioning the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> in the annular joint groove <b>35</b> formed in the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> with the respective center axes L of the wheel disc <b>3</b> and the wheel rim <b>2</b> aligned with each other, and then welding the wheel disc <b>3</b> and the wheel rim <b>2</b> to each other. In the welding, the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>, the inner peripheral end portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>, and the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> are arc-welded to each other over the entire circumference of the wheel to be integrally joined to each other from the outer side of the wheel rim <b>2</b>. As a result of the welding, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a single continuous welded portion <b>41</b> in which the wheel rim <b>2</b> and the wheel disc <b>3</b> are joined to each other is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the single continuous welded portion <b>41</b> is formed by performing three-point welding on the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>, the inner peripheral end portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>, and the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b>. That is, the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> includes a first welded portion <b>42</b>, according to the present invention (the first aspect and the second aspect), in which the inner peripheral end portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> and the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> are welded to each other. The continuous welded portion <b>41</b> also includes a second welded portion <b>43</b>, according to the first aspect, in which the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> and the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> are welded to each other. Alternatively, the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> includes a second welded portion <b>44</b>, according to the second aspect, in which the inner peripheral end portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> and the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> are welded to each other. Thus, it can be said that the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> is integrally formed with the first welded portion <b>42</b> and the second welded portion <b>43</b> (or the second welded portion <b>44</b>) formed continuously with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this example, further, the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> is formed to fill the annular joint groove <b>35</b> formed in the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>. Therefore, the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> is prevented from swelling out from the wheel rim <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the automobile wheel <b>1</b> as discussed above, the wheel rim <b>2</b> and the wheel disc <b>3</b> are joined to each other by the single continuous welded portion <b>41</b>, at which the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>, the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>, and the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> are joined to each other. The front flange portion <b>31</b> is formed be integral with the inner peripheral end portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> and the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> joined to each other by the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> and with the annular back peripheral portion <b>33</b> and the annular front peripheral portion <b>32</b> contacting each other in the front-back direction. Further, the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> and the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> are joined to each other by the continuous welded portion <b>41</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the load imposed on the wheel disc <b>3</b> via the axle and the load imposed on the wheel rim <b>2</b> via the tire while the vehicle is running from acting on the folded peripheral edge portion <b>34</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> as much as possible. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the folded peripheral edge portion <b>34</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> from being repeatedly elastically deformed, and to mitigate a stress concentration generated on the front flange portion <b>31</b>. Therefore, the folded peripheral edge portion <b>34</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> can have a sufficient stress allowance before a fatigue breakage occurs even in the case where a residual stress generated in the folded peripheral edge portion <b>34</b> of the front flange portion <b>31</b> during formation is left in the folded peripheral edge portion <b>34</b>, improving the durability of the front flange portion <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, the single continuous welded portion <b>41</b> is formed by three-point welding. Thus, it is possible for the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> to exhibit high strength and rigidity, and to mitigate a stress concentration on the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> due to the loads generated while the automobile is running described above. Therefore, the durability of the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> can be improved. In the configuration according to the first embodiment, in particular, the single continuous welded portion <b>41</b> is formed over the entire circumference of the wheel. Thus, the durability of the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> and the front flange portion <b>31</b> can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The thus configured automobile wheel <b>1</b> according to this example can exhibit high durability compared to the automobile wheel &#x201c;m&#x201d; according to the related art discussed above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). In the automobile wheel &#x201c;m&#x201d; according to the related art, the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; is folded into a curved shape, and the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; and the front bead seat portion &#x201c;g&#x201d; of the wheel rim &#x201c;f&#x201d; are welded to each other. Thus, the front flange portion &#x201c;r&#x201d; and the welded portion &#x201c;i&#x201d; tend to be subjected to a stress concentration due to loads generated while the automobile is running. According to the automobile wheel <b>1</b> of this example, in contrast, it is possible to mitigate a stress concentration generated on the front flange portion <b>31</b> and the continuous welded portion <b>41</b>, improving the durability of the automobile wheel <b>1</b> compared to the automobile wheel &#x201c;m&#x201d; according to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the automobile wheel <b>1</b>, the annular joint groove <b>35</b> is formed in the back surface portion <b>6</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b>, and the opening end portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> is seated in the annular joint groove <b>35</b> to be welded in the annular joint groove <b>35</b>. The continuous welded portion <b>41</b> is partly formed in the annular joint groove <b>35</b>. Accordingly, the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> can be prevented from swelling out from the wheel rim <b>2</b>. According to the configuration, interference between a bead of a tire, which is mounted on the automobile wheel <b>1</b>, and the continuous welded portion <b>41</b> can be suppressed. Thus, the bead of the tire and the front bead seat portion <b>13</b> of the wheel rim <b>2</b> and the front flange portion <b>31</b> of the wheel disc <b>3</b> can be securely brought into tight contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an automobile wheel <b>51</b> according to another example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a wheel disc <b>53</b> includes a front flange portion <b>56</b> provided at an outer peripheral edge portion and folded in a curved shape.

Therefore, also according to the configuration above in which the front flange portion <b>56</b> is formed in a curved shape, it is possible to mitigate a stress concentration generated on a folded peripheral edge portion <b>59</b> of the front flange portion <b>56</b> by loads generated while the automobile is running.
