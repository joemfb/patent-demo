<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of the filing date under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) of Provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61/098,632 filed Sep. 19, 2008; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mobile lifting crane that uses a boom hoist drum and rigging to change the angle of the boom. The invention provides a way to transport the boom hoist drum and rigging between job sites when the crane is disassembled for transport so that the boom hoist line does not have to be re-reeved when the crane is set up at the new job site.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mobile lift cranes typically include a carbody having moveable ground engaging members; a rotating bed rotatably connected to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; a boom pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed, with a load hoist line extending there from, and counterweight to help balance the crane when the crane lifts a load. There are different ways of changing the angle of the boom with respect to the rotating bed during crane operation, including using hydraulic cylinders mounted between the boom and the rotating bed. However, more commonly a boom hoist drum and rigging are used to change the boom angle. Many cranes also use a mast mounted on the rotating bed to support the rigging, including the boom hoist rigging, so that it may transfer the forces from lifting a load to the rear of the carbody and the counterweight. The boom hoist rigging must carry large tension loads, supporting not only the boom, but counteracting the angled force applied by the boom as it supports the load. The boom hoist rigging includes the boom hoist line extending from the boom hoist drum and reeved through a lower equalizer (which may be attached to the top of the mast), and an upper equalizer with multiple parts of line so that the large tension loads on the rigging are distributed over the multiple parts of line. The upper equalizer is usually connected to the boom top by fixed length pendants. The length of the pendants is chosen to correspond with the length of the boom.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the crane will be used in various locations, it needs to be designed so that it can be transported from one job site to the next. This usually requires that the crane be dismantled into components that are of a size and weight that they can be transported by truck within highway transportation limits. The ease with which the crane can be dismantled and set up has an impact on the total cost of using the crane. Thus, to the extent that fewer man-hours are needed to set up the crane, there is a direct advantage to the crane owner. If the boom hoist line can remain reeved through the lower and upper equalizers during the transportation operation, the line will not have to be re-reeved though the sheaves on the equalizers when the crane is set up again.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several models of cranes have been designed to accomplish transporting the crane without unreeveing the boom hoist line. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,069 discloses a crane where the upper equalizer is disconnected from the boom top and connected to the mast (in this case the mast is part of a gantry) for transport. Since the gantry has the lower equalizer attached to it, and since the gantry does not need to be disconnected from the rotating bed, to which the boom hoist drum is attached, the boom hoist line does not need to be pulled out from the lower equalizer (mast top sheave assembly) and the upper equalizer during the disassembly process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For some very large cranes, the size of the mast and the boom hoist drum are so large that they cannot both be transported on one truck. In that situation, the prior art practice has been to pull all of the boom hoist line onto the boom hoist drum so that it does not run through the sheaves on the mast top. The mast can then be disconnected from the rotating bed and transported separately. Unfortunately, this requires the boom hoist line to be reeved through the sheave assemblies in the lower and upper equalizers when the crane is set up again, a time consuming process. Thus it would be a great advantage if a system could be developed that allowed such very large cranes to be transported without having to pull the boom hoist line from the equalizers for transport.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention includes a crane that has a boom hoist drum and rigging for changing the boom angle, and a system that allows the boom hoist line to remain reeved through the equalizers, even though the boom hoist drum is transported between job sites on a separate transport trailer from the mast and from the rotating bed. The invention also involves a method of disassembling and transporting a crane, and setting up a crane, utilizing the boom hoist transportation system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect, the invention is a mobile lift crane comprising a carbody having moveable ground engaging members; a rotating bed rotatably connected to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; a boom pivotally mounted on the rotating bed; a load hoist line trained over a pulley on the boom and wound on a load hoist drum connected to the rotating bed; a boom hoist drum mounted in a frame, the frame being connected to the rotating bed; and a boom hoist line wound on the boom hoist drum and connected to an upper equalizer and a lower equalizer, with the upper equalizer connected to the top of the boom by fixed length pendants, such that rotation of the boom hoist drum changes the amount of boom hoist line between the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer, thereby changing the angle between the rotating bed and the boom; the boom hoist drum frame, the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer each including cooperating attachment structures whereby the lower and upper equalizers can be detachably connected to the frame so that the boom hoist drum, the lower equalizer, the upper equalizer and the boom hoist line can be transported as a combined assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a second aspect, the invention is a method of disassembling and transporting a mobile lift crane, the lift crane comprising, prior to disassembly, i) a rotating bed, ii) a boom pivotally mounted on the rotating bed, iii) a boom hoist drum mounted in a frame, the frame being connected to the rotating bed, iv) a lower equalizer connected to the rotating bed, v) an upper equalizer, vi) fixed length pendants connected between the upper equalizer and the boom top, and vii) a boom hoist line wound on the boom hoist drum and reeved through the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer such that rotation of the boom hoist drum changes the amount of boom hoist line between the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer, thereby changing the angle between the rotating bed and the boom; the method comprising: a) disconnecting the fixed length pendants from between the boom top and the upper equalizer; b) disconnecting the lower equalizer from the rotating bed; c) disconnecting the boom hoist drum frame from the rotating bed; d) leaving the boom hoist line reeved between the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer and wound on the boom hoist drum; e) connecting the lower equalizer, and preferably the upper equalizer as well to the boom hoist drum frame; and f) transporting the boom hoist drum, boom hoist drum frame, lower equalizer, upper equalizer and boom hoist line together on a single transport trailer between one job site and another.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a third aspect, the invention is a method of disassembling a mobile lift crane, the lift crane comprising, prior to disassembly, i) a rotating bed, ii) a boom pivotally mounted on the rotating bed, iii) a boom hoist drum mounted in a frame, the frame being connected to the rotating bed, iv) a lower equalizer connected to the rotating bed, v) an upper equalizer, vi) fixed length pendants connected between the upper equalizer and the boom top, and vii) a boom hoist line wound on the boom hoist drum and reeved through the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer such that rotation of the boom hoist drum changes the amount of boom hoist line between the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer, thereby changing the angle between the rotating bed and the boom; the method comprising: a) disconnecting the fixed length pendants from between the boom top and the upper equalizer; b) disconnecting the lower equalizer from the rotating bed; c) disconnecting the boom hoist drum frame from the rotating bed; d) leaving the boom hoist line reeved between the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer and wound on the boom hoist drum; and e) connecting the lower equalizer and upper equalizer to the boom hoist drum frame to form a combined transport assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a fourth aspect, the invention is method of setting up a mobile lift crane, comprising providing a carbody having moveable ground engaging members, and a rotating bed rotatably connected to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; providing a combination of a boom hoist drum secured to a frame, a first equalizer having a plurality of sheaves, a second equalizer having a plurality of sheaves, and a boom hoist line, wherein the first equalizer is detachably connected to the boom hoist drum frame, the second equalizer is also detachably connected to the boom hoist drum frame, and the boom hoist line is wound on the boom hoist drum and reeved between the sheaves of the first and second equalizers; connecting the combined boom hoist drum, frame and equalizers to the rotating bed; disconnecting the first and second equalizers from the boom hoist drum frame while leaving the boom hoist line reeved between the pluralities of sheaves; connecting the first equalizer to the rotating bed; pivotally connecting a boom having a boom top to the rotating bed; and connecting the second equalizer to the boom top with fixed length pendants.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a fifth aspect, the invention is a combination of a boom hoist drum secured to a frame, a first equalizer having a plurality of sheaves, a second equalizer having a plurality of sheaves, and a boom hoist line, wherein the first equalizer is detachably connected to the boom hoist drum frame, the second equalizer is also detachably connected to the boom hoist drum frame, and the boom hoist line is wound on the boom hoist drum and reeved between the sheaves of the first and second equalizers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">By mounting the boom hoist drum in a frame to which the lower and upper equalizers can each be attached, and using a lower equalizer that can be disconnected from the mast, the boom hoist line can remain reeved though the sheaves of the equalizers and wound on the boom hoist drum, and the entire combination can be transported as a single unit. With the proper set-up steps, this package can then be installed on the rotating bed as the crane is being reassembled, and the equalizers disconnected from the boom hoist frame and connected at the appropriate time and places to the other crane components. Not only does the boom hoist line not need to be re-reeved upon set up, but the boom hoist rigging is transported in a neat package that prevents the boom hoist line from tangling with itself or other crane components during the disassemble, transport and reassembly procedure. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as the invention itself, will be more easily understood in view of the attached drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Several terms used in the specification and claims have a meaning defined as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;equalizer&#x201d; designates an arrangement of sheaves secured together so as to act in concert in spreading tensional force between multiple parts of line. Equalizers are used in pairs. The term &#x201c;upper equalizer&#x201d; in a boom hoist rigging arrangement is used to refer to the equalizer closest to the boom top. The term &#x201c;lower equalizer&#x201d; is used to refer to the equalizer paired with the upper equalizer but furthest from the boom top. The &#x201c;lower equalizer&#x201d; is typically secured to a mast or gantry, and may be built into the mast or gantry top. This type of lower equalizer is often referred to as a mast top sheave assembly. Some cranes use a live mast, where a fixed length pendant is secured between the boom top and the live mast, and changes in the amount of boom hoist line directly change the angle of the live mast with respect to the rotating bed, which secondarily then changes the angle of the boom with respect to the rotating bed. In that instance the upper equalizer is secured to the top of the mast, and the lower equalizer is secured to the rotating bed at a lower point, such as on a gantry. See, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0256999. In that document, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a guy line <b>44</b> between the boom top and the mast. In the context of the present definition, the mast side spreader <b>45</b> would be considered the upper equalizer, and the gantry side spreader <b>46</b> would be the lower equalizer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The term &#x201c;boom hoist drum&#x201d; designates a winch used to take up and pay out line that is used to control the angle of the boom. The boom hoist drum includes a generally cylindrical body on which the boom hoist line is wound, as well as the mechanical and hydraulic controls for controlling rotation of the cylindrical body. Again, by way of example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0256999, the hoisting winch <b>7</b>, with its drum <b>7</b><i>a</i>, constitutes an example of a boom hoist drum.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The term &#x201c;boom hoist drum frame&#x201d; designates the structure that is used to hold the boom hoist drum components together, and to mount them to other crane components. Also, as in the present invention, other components may be mounted to the frame. However, the term &#x201c;frame&#x201d; is meant to designate structure that is reasonably close in size to the drum and used for the above enumerated purposes. Thus structure that is used as another major component of a crane, or that is more than twice as long as the cylindrical part of the drum, or more than twice the diameter of the drum, would not be considered part of a frame of the drum. Again, by way of example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0256999, the brackets holding the shaft <b>7</b><i>b </i>constitute part of the frame. However, when the winch <b>7</b> is connected to the compressing member <b>42</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or attached to the frames that constitute mast <b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref>, the compressing member <b>42</b> and the mast <b>8</b> are not part of the boom hoist drum frame.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the invention will have applicability to boom hoist systems used on other types of cranes, it will be described in connection with mobile lift crane <b>10</b>, shown in an operational configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The mobile lift crane <b>10</b> includes lower works, also referred to as a carbody <b>12</b>, and moveable ground engaging members in the form of crawlers <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. There are of course two front crawlers <b>14</b> and two rear crawlers <b>16</b>, only one each of which can be seen from the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In the crane <b>10</b>, the ground engaging members could be just one set of crawlers, one crawler on each side. Of course additional crawlers than those shown can be used, as well as other types of ground engaging members, such as tires.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A rotating bed <b>20</b> is rotatably connected to the carbody <b>12</b> such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members. The rotating bed is mounted to the carbody <b>12</b> with a slewing ring, such that the rotating bed <b>20</b> can swing about an axis with respect to the ground engaging members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The rotating bed supports a boom <b>22</b> pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed; a mast <b>28</b> mounted at its first end on the rotating bed, with a lower equalizer <b>70</b> connected to the mast adjacent the second end of the mast; a backhitch <b>30</b> connected between the mast and a rear portion of the rotating bed; and a moveable counterweight unit <b>34</b>. The counterweight may be in the form of multiple stacks of individual counterweight members <b>44</b> on a support member.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Boom hoist rigging (described in more detail below) between the top of mast <b>28</b> and boom <b>22</b> is used to control the boom angle and transfer load so that the counterweight can be used to balance a load lifted by the crane. A load hoist line <b>24</b> is trained over a pulley on the boom <b>22</b>, supporting a hook <b>26</b>. At the other end, the load hoist line is wound on a load hoist drum connected to the rotating bed. The rotating bed <b>20</b> includes other elements commonly found on a mobile lift crane, such as an operator's cab and hoist drums for the boom hoist rigging and other hoist and whip lines. If desired, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the boom <b>22</b> may comprise a luffing jib <b>23</b> pivotally mounted to the top of the main boom, or other boom configurations. When a luffing jib <b>23</b> is included, the crane may include first and second jib struts <b>27</b> and <b>29</b>, as well as associated luffing jib rigging.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The backhitch <b>30</b> is connected adjacent the top of the mast <b>28</b>, but down the mast far enough that it does not interfere with other items connected to the mast. The backhitch <b>30</b> may comprise a lattice member, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, designed to carry both compression and tension loads. In the crane <b>10</b>, the mast is held at a fixed angle with respect to the rotating bed during crane operations, such as a pick, move and set operation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The counterweight unit <b>34</b> is moveable with respect to the rest of the rotating bed <b>20</b>. A tension member <b>32</b> connected adjacent the top of the mast supports the counterweight unit in a suspended mode. A counterweight movement structure is connected between the rotating bed and the counterweight unit such that the counterweight unit may be moved to and held at a first position in front of the top of the mast, and moved to and held at a second position rearward of the top of the mast.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At least one linear actuation device <b>36</b>, such as a hydraulic cylinder, or alternatively a rack and pinion assembly, and at least one arm pivotally connected at a first end to the rotating bed and at a second end to the a linear actuation device <b>36</b>, are used in the counterweight movement structure of crane <b>10</b> to change the position of the counterweight. The arm and linear actuation device <b>36</b> are connected between the rotating bed and the counterweight unit such that extension and retraction of the linear actuation device <b>36</b> changes the position of the counterweight unit compared to the rotating bed. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the counterweight unit in its most forward position, the linear actuation device <b>36</b> can be partially or fully extended, which moves the counterweight unit to mid and aft positions, or any intermediate position, such as when a load is suspended from the hook <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the preferred embodiment of the counterweight movement structure, a pivot frame <b>40</b>, which may be a solid welded plate structure, is connected between the rotating bed <b>20</b> and the second end of the linear actuation device <b>36</b>. The rear arm <b>38</b> is connected between the pivot frame <b>40</b> and the counterweight unit. The rear arm <b>38</b> is also a welded plate structure with an angled portion <b>39</b> at the end that connects to the pivot frame <b>40</b>. This allows the arm <b>38</b> to connect directly in line with the pivot frame <b>40</b>. The backhitch <b>30</b> has an A-shape configuration, with spread apart lower legs, which allows the counterweight movement structure to pass between the legs when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The crane <b>10</b> may be equipped with a counterweight support system (not shown), which may be required to comply with crane regulations in some countries. The counterweight movement structure and counterweight support structure are more fully disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/023,902, entitled &#x201c;Mobile Lift Crane With Variable Position Counterweight,&#x201d; incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The boom hoist rigging includes a boom hoist line in the form of wire rope <b>25</b> wound on a boom hoist drum <b>50</b>, and reeved through sheaves on a lower equalizer <b>70</b> and an upper equalizer <b>80</b>. The boom hoist drum is mounted in a frame <b>60</b> connected to the rotating bed. The rigging also includes fixed length pendants <b>21</b> connected between the boom top and the upper equalizer <b>80</b>. The lower equalizer <b>70</b> is connected to the rotating bed <b>20</b> though the mast <b>28</b>. This arrangement allows rotation of the boom hoist drum <b>50</b> to change the amount of boom hoist line <b>25</b> between the lower equalizer <b>70</b> and the upper equalizer <b>80</b>, thereby changing the angle between the rotating bed <b>20</b> and the boom <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The boom hoist drum frame <b>60</b>, the lower equalizer <b>70</b> and the upper equalizer <b>80</b> each include cooperating attachment structures whereby the lower and upper equalizers can be detachably connected to the frame so that the boom hoist drum, the lower equalizer, the upper equalizer and the boom hoist line can be transported as a combined assembly. The combined boom hoist drum <b>50</b>, frame <b>60</b>, lower equalizer <b>70</b> and upper equalizer <b>80</b>, arranged as they would be for transportation between job sites, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This is a novel combination of a boom hoist drum secured to a frame, a first equalizer, a second equalizer, and a boom hoist line, wherein the first equalizer is detachably connected to the boom hoist drum frame, the second equalizer is also detachably connected to the boom hoist drum frame, and the line is wound on the boom hoist drum and reeved between the sheaves of the first and second equalizers.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The boom hoist drum <b>50</b> and frame <b>60</b> are best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The upper equalizer <b>80</b> is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The lower equalizer <b>70</b> is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The combined boom hoist drum, frame and equalizers as they are first mounted to the rotating bed during crane set-up are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the boom hoist drum frame is connected to the rotating bed by being connected to a frame of another drum that is in turn connected to the rotating bed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref> the frame <b>60</b> is shown secured on top of the frame of a lower load hoist drum <b>46</b>, which in turn is secured to the rotating bed <b>22</b>. The wire rope <b>25</b> normally found wrapped on the drum <b>50</b> and reeved through the equalizers <b>70</b>, <b>80</b> is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, and is shown only in part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, for sake of clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The boom hoist line <b>25</b> is preferably continuously reeved, with both ends of the line being tied off on the boom hoist drum <b>50</b>. As with conventional boom hoist drums using continuous reeving, the drum <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) includes a main cylinder on which the rope <b>25</b> is wrapped, with ends <b>53</b> and <b>54</b>, and a separator <b>55</b> in the center that separates the two ends of the line as they are wound on the drum. A ratchet and pawl <b>56</b> are included to lock the drum when needed. A drive assembly <b>58</b> on each end of the drum includes dual variable displacement hydraulic motors, and a spring-set, hydraulic-release brake (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The boom hoist drum frame <b>60</b> includes end plates <b>61</b>, and a number of mounting plates <b>62</b> of various shapes spaced inwardly from the end plates <b>61</b>. The frame is tied together with cross bars <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> and <b>66</b>. The shapes and placement of the mounting plates <b>62</b> are dependent on the drive mechanism, brake and other components that are attached to them. These, and other features of the drum, will vary depending on the components used to make up the boom hoist drum, and are not crucial to the invention. However, to mount the equalizers on the frame <b>60</b> according to the present invention, the frame is provided with some additional mounting brackets. The cooperating attachment structures allowing the equalizers to be detachably connected to the frame <b>60</b> include holes on the frame and equalizers that are positioned such that they can be aligned with one another, and pins may be placed through the holes to pin the equalizers to the frame. The top rear cross bar <b>64</b> includes two sets of brackets <b>67</b> used to mount the lower equalizer <b>70</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-19</figref> will now be described in conjunction with a method of setting up mobile lift crane <b>10</b> using the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, first the carbody <b>12</b> is provided with moveable ground engaging members, in this case crawlers <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. Next a rotating bed <b>20</b> is rotatably connected to the carbody <b>12</b> such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. This combined carbody and rotating bed will typically require several transport trailers to convey the parts to the job site. Application Ser. No. 61/099,098 (filed Sep. 22, 2008) shows one preferred method of transporting and connecting the parts used to make the carbody and crawler combination. Other parts may be installed on the rotating bed, such as the lower load hoist drum <b>46</b> and a whip hoist drum <b>47</b>, and a power unit <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next the combination of the boom hoist drum <b>50</b> secured to frame <b>60</b>, with lower equalizer <b>70</b> and upper equalizer <b>80</b> pinned to the frame <b>60</b>, and boom hoist line <b>25</b> wound on the drum <b>50</b> and reeved through the sheaves <b>74</b> and <b>84</b> on the equalizers, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is hoisted into place. The combined boom hoist drum, frame and equalizers are attached to the rotating bed <b>20</b> by securing frame <b>60</b> to the frame on the lower load hoist drum <b>46</b>. Hydraulic lines from the power unit are connected to the drive assembly <b>58</b> on each end of the drum <b>50</b>, as well as to the other drums on the rotating bed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Leading up to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, several steps take place. First, the variable position counterweight movement structure, including liner actuation device <b>36</b>, arm <b>38</b> and pivot frame <b>40</b>, are installed on the rotating bed. Next the upper and lower equalizers are disconnected from the boom hoist drum frame <b>60</b> while leaving the boom hoist line reeved between the pluralities of sheaves <b>74</b> and <b>84</b>. The pins <b>78</b> and <b>97</b> may be left in place to leave the equalizers connected to one another. As an assist crane lifts the equalizers, boom hoist wire rope <b>25</b> is paid out. The equalizers are placed at a convenient point on the ground adjacent to the crane. The upper load hoist drum <b>49</b> is then hoisted into place and connected to the rotating bed through the frame of the whip hoist drum <b>47</b>. The mast <b>28</b> is assembled on the ground and lifted into position with the assist crane, and its lower end is pinned to the rotating bed by connected to the frame of the upper load hoist drum <b>49</b>. A hydraulic cylinder (not shown) raises the linear actuation device <b>36</b> until it engages the mast to hold it up. The assist crane then positions the upper and lower equalizers at the mast top, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Boom hoist rope <b>25</b> is paid off the boom hoist drum as necessary. The installation of the lower equalizer on the mast top effectively connects the lower equalizer <b>70</b> to the rotating bed <b>20</b>. Next the upper equalizer <b>80</b> is separated and the assist crane pulls the upper equalizer to the mast butt. It is then pinned into a temporary position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>; again paying out boom hoist line <b>25</b> as necessary. This leaves the crane in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next the backhitch <b>30</b> is assembled and raised into position, and pinned adjacent the mast top, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The tension member <b>32</b> is connected adjacent the top of the mast. A roll up wheel may be used on the end of the backhitch while it is then moved into the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> by retracting the linear actuation device <b>36</b>, which raises the mast. The counterweight tray used in counterweight unit <b>34</b> is then attached to the tension member <b>32</b>. A tugger winch rope <b>37</b> is temporarily attached to the free end of the backhitch <b>30</b> so that it can be pulled into position and connected to the rotating bed <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. After the backhitch is in position, the linear actuation device <b>36</b> can be disconnected from the mast so that the arm <b>38</b> can be extend out to connect to the counterweight tray.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The counterweight unit can then be pulled back toward the rotating bed <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and the counterweight boxes <b>44</b> stacked on the tray. Next the boom <b>22</b> is pivotally connected to the rotating bed. This begins with off-loading and staging the boom butt and the first boom segment and pinning them together. They are lifted over the luffing jib drum <b>41</b>, which is pinned onto the boom segment. This entire arrangement is then assembled into the boom hinge on the rotating bed and pinned, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. (In an alternate embodiment (not shown), the luffing jib drum <b>41</b> is placed on the front roller carrier portion of the rotating bed, rather than near the bottom of the boom.)</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additional boom segments and the boom top are added to reach the desired boom length. The luffing jib backstay straps and the fixed length pendants <b>21</b> are connected to the boom top. With the upper equalizer <b>80</b> pinned to the mast butt (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), a rigging winch line is pulled out, placed around the boom top, and attached to the upper equalizer <b>80</b>. The assist crane is also attached to the upper equalizer. The upper equalizer is unpinned from the mast butt and supported by the assist crane. Boom hoist rope <b>25</b> is paid out as the rigging winch line is paid in. The assist crane follows along, providing vertical support of the upper equalizer. The upper equalizer is brought into place and pinned temporarily to the boom, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. The fixed length pendants <b>21</b> can then be connected to the upper equalizer, thus connecting the upper equalizer to the boom top.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first and second jib struts <b>27</b> and <b>29</b>, as well as associated luffing jib rigging, are installed next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The whip line from the whip line hoist <b>47</b> may be used pull the first jib strut over center while it is raised with the assist crane to the point that the backstay suspension can be pinned. The upper equalizer is unpinned from the boom, and the boom hoist rigging and the luffing jib rigging are then used to raise the boom and the first and second struts to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The luffing jib <b>23</b> is next assembled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The load hoist line <b>24</b> and second load hoist line are pulled out. The whip line is pulled out as needed as well. The second jib strut is lowered so that the second strut can be pinned with a fixed length pendant to the top of the luffing jib. The boom hoist rope is pulled in, raising the boom <b>22</b> and jack knifing the luffing jib <b>23</b>, to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The hook block <b>26</b> can then be reeved, along with the sheave set at the top of the luffing jib with the load hoist lines. In a preferred embodiment both load hoist lines are connected to an equalizing mechanism in the hook block so that both drums <b>46</b> and <b>49</b> can be used together to hoist a load. The boom hoist drum <b>50</b> is used to pull in more wire rope <b>25</b>, the luffing jib rigging is also pulled in, and the crane <b>10</b> is boomed up into a working position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The invention also involves a method of disassembling and transporting a mobile lift crane. The invention is used when taking the crane down after working at a job site, so that it can be transported to a second job site. The reverse of the steps used above and explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-20</figref> may be used. In that case, some of the essential steps are: disconnecting the fixed length pendants from between the boom top and the upper equalizer; b) disconnecting the lower equalizer from the rotating bed; c) disconnecting the boom hoist drum frame from the rotating bed; d) leaving the boom hoist line reeved between the lower equalizer and the upper equalizer and wound on the boom hoist drum; e) connecting the upper equalizer to the boom hoist drum frame or connecting the lower equalizer to the boom hoist drum frame, and preferably connecting both the lower equalizer and upper equalizer to the boom hoist drum frame, to form a combined transport assembly, and f) transporting the boom hoist drum, boom hoist drum frame, lower equalizer, upper equalizer and boom hoist line together on a single transport trailer between job sites. The step of disconnecting the lower equalizer from the rotating bed will, in the preferred embodiment, involve disconnecting the lower equalizer from the mast. In the preferred embodiment, the fixed length pendants <b>21</b> comprise multiple straps, each the same length as a boom segment used in the boom <b>22</b>, and the step of disconnecting the fixed length pendants comprises disconnecting the straps from both the boom and the upper equalizer. When the straps are being disconnected from the boom, the section of strap connected to the boom top is often left attached to the boom top.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Preferably the step of connecting the lower equalizer to the boom hoist drum frame takes place before the step of disconnecting the boom hoist drum frame from the rotating bed. As with the set up operation, in a preferred embodiment, the upper equalizer is temporarily connected adjacent the second end of the mast between the step of disconnecting the fixed length pendants from between the boom top and the upper equalizer, and the step of connecting the lower equalizer to the boom hoist drum frame. Also, preferably the step of connecting the lower equalizer and upper equalizer to the boom hoist drum frame to form a combined transport assembly comprises pinning the lower equalizer and upper equalizer to the frame, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the upper equalizer may not need to be pinned to the boom when it is disconnected from the mast butt and moved over to the boom. Instead, the straps may be connected, and provide enough force to keep the upper equalizer and the boom hoist rigging pulled taught. Also, the crane may use a live mast, with the upper equalizer being connected to the mast and the lower equalizer being connected to the rotating bed or a gantry on the rotating bed. Some of the steps described above in setting up the crane may be carried out in different orders. For example, the boom may be attached to the rotating bed before the first and second equalizers are taken off from the boom hoist drum frame. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p>
