<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates generally to viewing map and visual data, and more specifically to method and apparatus for simultaneously viewing navigable panoramic images and corresponding navigable map images and information.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Using overhead, 2-D map images or bird's-eye-view map images in computer based applications has become commonplace. Typically these maps are navigable by the user and can be panned in selected directions by use of a mouse, keyboard or other input device. Usually these maps can be selectively zoomed in or out to show a larger or smaller geographical area. Often, as the image is zoomed in, more detailed information will appear on the map, such as street names, points of interest, elevations, etc. Further, these mapping images are often linked to a text panel in which the user can input textual search information, such as an address, zip code, street intersections, a business name or type, etc. Upon activating the search, by hitting &#x201c;enter&#x201d; for example, the application will conduct a search of a text database and either display a map corresponding to matching textual information, provide a list of matching data from which the user can select or indicates that no matches were found. One such map application is available on Yahoo! (trademark) Maps, such as at http://www.maps.yahoo.com. However, these map applications have shortcomings in that they do not provide a picture or movie image of the indicated location. As such, the user is not able to see what the location looks like without visiting the location in person.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Using picture or movie images in computer-based applications enables a user to see how a location appears. However, typical images present only a limited view of a location in that the image does not supply a rotatable 360 degree image. Certain applications provide links between a map image and a photo or movie image corresponding to selected locations on the map. However, these photo images are not panoramic and navigable and so present only a limited, static view of the location. Using panoramic images to present virtual, computer-simulated &#x201c;tours&#x201d; of real physical environments is becoming commonplace. Some applications provide links from a map image to corresponding navigable, panoramic images. These navigable images present a 360 degree image of a location and the user can rotate the image to select a view from the location. The viewer displays a portion of the panoramic image and provides a method for panning throughout the image and often for zooming in and out on the image. Typically, these functions are accomplished through a mouse, keyboard or other input device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A common viewer used to create these tours is sold by Apple Computer Corp. of Cupertino, Calif., under the trademark Quicktime VR. It provides a way to view panoramic images from a web site by using a web browser. Other companies provide services and software to create virtual tours, such as software sold under the trademark BAMBOO at internet site www.bamboo.com and under the trademark iPix at www.ipix.com. While these systems provide for 360 degree panoramic views and navigation of the views by the user, they do not provide for a corresponding link to a map image.</p>

The product is intended to replace or enhance 2-D maps with actual imagery in place of, or in conjunction with, overhead and/or panoramic views of locations. The product can be scaled, for example, from an individual home location to a city area. Preferably, it is intended that images be taken at least every 50 feet within a particular location of interest, although the invention is not limited to such intervals of images.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The product has applications in the real estate business, the travel and tourism industry, personal or commercial auto navigation, and other industries.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> presents a screen <b>10</b> having a map image <b>12</b>, a panoramic image <b>14</b> and a text panel <b>16</b>. Each of these images and panels is simultaneously visible on the screen <b>10</b> to the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> presents a sample screen display embodying aspects of the invention. The screen display is only a sample and could vary greatly in appearance. For example, the relative sizes and positioning of the images is not important to the practice of the invention. The screen <b>10</b> can be any visual display, but is preferably a computer screen. The screen <b>10</b> can be part of a personal computer system, a network, operated from data received locally, by network or on the internet.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The map image <b>12</b> presents an overhead representational map image. The image could alternately incorporate actual overhead photographs, such as are available through the United States Geological Survey (USGS) at its EROS data center, or through the USGS NAPP web site. Information can be superimposed onto such photo images, if desired. The map can include information such as street names, zip codes, landmarks, points of interest, parks, reserves, state and country borders, bodies of water and other information, whether in test or graphic form. The map image <b>12</b> is navigable by the user. Typically, the user can employ a mouse input device to point-and-click to a location on the map image and the map image will &#x201c;shift&#x201d; or change to place the indicated location in the center of the map image. Alternately, the user can employ directional indicators, such as indicators <b>22</b>, or other input devices such as a keyboard. Similarly, the user can preferably zoom in and out on the map image <b>14</b> by using an input device, indicators, etc. The particular location on which the map is centered can be indicated by a location icon <b>20</b>, such as a colored dot or pin icon.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, embedded within the map image are a plurality of &#x201c;hotspots&#x201d; or links <b>24</b>, which are linked to panoramic images, as will be explained further herein. The hotspots <b>24</b> can be programmed to appear at all times, to appear only when the map is zoomed in to a selected degree, to never appear or to appear only when the user scrolls-over the hotspot <b>24</b> with a mouse or other input device. The appearance criteria for the hotspots <b>24</b> can also be controlled by the user, if desired. Alternately, the scrolling icon representing the location of the user's mouse or other device on the screen can change to a different icon indicating the presence at that location on the map of a hotspot. A combination of these features may be preferable, such as having the hotspots appear as small white dots, the location in current use appear as a larger red dot, and the mouse indicator appear as an arrow unless it is scrolled-over a hotspot, in which case it changes to appear as a hand, for example. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the user has zoomed in on the map and activated a hotspot or entered an address in the text panel <b>16</b>, as will be explained herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example only and the map image will preferably have a much larger number of hotspots.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The map image <b>12</b> may have other functionalities as well. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, other information <b>27</b>, such as an address, intersection streets, point of interest names, etc., may be employed. The information <b>27</b> can indicate information about the location upon which the map is centered, as shown, or can indicate information about other hotspots. Such information <b>27</b> can appear when desired, such as always appear, appear upon scroll-over or when indicated by the user, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The panoramic image <b>14</b> is simultaneously displayed on the screen <b>10</b>. The panoramic image <b>14</b> displayed corresponds to the location <b>20</b> indicated on the map image <b>12</b>. The panoramic image <b>14</b> presents, preferably, a street-level view. The panoramic image <b>14</b> is a 360 degree image which can be panned, or &#x201c;rotated,&#x201d; by the user such that the user sees an image looking out from the point of the panoramic image. (It is not intended that potential infringement could be avoided by allowing somewhat less than full rotation.) The image can be panned by the user using a mouse or other input device, as is known in the art. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the image from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has been panned to face another direction. Similarly, the image can preferably be zoomed in and out by the user. Further, the image may be tilted, that is, panned up and down. It is possible to use panoramic imaging technology to supply a spherical viewing of an image, that is, having a &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; as well as the cylindrical side. The panoramic image can be a photo or movie image, as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The panoramic image allows the user to virtually see what he would actually see were he present at the location physically. This provides a visual correlation between the map image and the panoramic image. This is particularly useful where the user is searching for real estate and wants a &#x201c;feel&#x201d; for the neighborhood, or is searching for a store or other location and wants to find a &#x201c;landmark&#x201d; to search for in person, wants to tour an area or building, see storefronts, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Embedded within the panoramic image <b>14</b> are hotspots or links <b>24</b>. These hotspots <b>24</b> correspond to the hotspots <b>24</b> in the map image <b>12</b>. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, hotspot <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the panoramic image corresponds to hotspot <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the map image. Similarly, hotspots <b>24</b><i>b </i>correspond. If the panoramic image <b>12</b> was rotated around, such that the view was facing east, a hotspot <b>24</b><i>c </i>would appear corresponding to the hotspot <b>24</b><i>c </i>in the map image. The panoramic image <b>12</b> can have one or several hotspots. Typically, the panoramic image <b>12</b> would not have both hotspots <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>, since they are both in the same direction, however, it is possible to have multiple hotspots linking as shown. For use of the invention in a town map, as shown, a panoramic image <b>12</b> at an intersection, such as at hotspot <b>24</b><i>b</i>, would typically have four hotspots, one in each direction of the intersection. Similarly, a panoramic image in the middle of a street, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, might only have two hotspots. As shown, multiple hotspots in the same general direction would allow a user to &#x201c;walk&#x201d; down the street, image by image, or &#x201c;skip&#x201d; images, such as to the next intersection.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that the invention has other applications than just street maps and can be employed for navigation within buildings, at parks and monuments and other points of interest, or for other uses.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The hotspots <b>24</b> in the panoramic image <b>12</b> are indicated by square icons for reference, but, just as described above regarding hotspots within the map image, the hotspots can appear, be invisible, appear upon scroll-over or by selection of the user, such as by indicator <b>27</b> which will reveal all hotspots. The hotspots can appear as a separate icon or can be indicated by a mouse location icon changing shape or color.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the panoramic images <b>12</b> &#x201c;overlap&#x201d; or provide a continuous photographic coverage of the geographical location. For example, in use with street touring or navigation, a panoramic image can be taken every fifty feet to provide a view of the entire street. This may not be possible, or necessary, obviously, where buildings, private property or other obstacles will not allow for an overlapping images.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Where the user indicates, on the map image <b>12</b>, a location which does not have a corresponding panoramic image <b>14</b>, the program can either center the map image at that location, in which case no hotspot will appear at the center of the map image, or, preferably, can automatically center the map image on the closest hotspot. The user can indicate, such as by pointing and clicking, any of the hotspots on the map image or panoramic image. Activating the hotspot automatically updates, or changes the map image <b>12</b> and the panoramic image <b>14</b> seen on the screen to the map and panoramic images corresponding to the activated hotspot. Further, it is possible to have the corresponding map image hotspot <b>24</b><i>a </i>become high-lighted, such as by appearing, changing colors, etc., when the user scrolls-over or otherwise indicates the corresponding hotspot <b>24</b><i>a </i>on the panoramic image <b>14</b>, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a screen <b>10</b> indicating the user has either linked to a hotspot <b>24</b><i>b </i>on the panoramic image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or on the map image link <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Alternately, the user may have entered the intersection street information in the search fields <b>30</b> of the text panel <b>16</b>, as explained below. Regardless of the method the user utilized to reach this location, the map image, the panoramic image and the text panel all are updated to display information corresponding to the chosen location.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Text panel <b>16</b> is also visible on the screen <b>10</b> simultaneously with map image <b>12</b> and panoramic image <b>14</b>. The text panel <b>16</b> conveys textual information corresponding to the panoramic image, such as the address or intersection at the location of the panoramic image. Other information can be supplied, depending on the application, such as the name of a building, room or other location, pertinent historical or other information, etc. The text panel <b>16</b> can include information such as directional or linking information <b>28</b>. That is, the directional information <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> reads &#x201c;West on Caruth to Airline&#x201d; which may indicate the direction (west) the user is facing on Caruth Blvd., and that he is facing towards Airline Road at the next intersection. Alternately, the information <b>28</b> could read &#x201c;3129 Caruth&#x201d; to indicate the location of the shown panoramic image (and map image location). In another embodiment, the information <b>28</b> can be information regarding the hotspot link the user has indicated, by scrolling-over, for example. In that case, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as the user scrolled-over hotspot <b>24</b><i>b </i>in the panoramic image, the information <b>28</b> would read &#x201c;West to the Caruth and Airline intersection,&#x201d; for example. If the user scrolled-over the hotspot <b>24</b><i>a</i>, the text would read &#x201c;West to 3145 Caruth,&#x201d; for example. Similarly, if the hotspot linked to a building or other point of interest the information <b>28</b> would indicate the name or other information regarding that hotspot image. The image itself can have ordinate directions (N, S, E, W) on the panoramic image itself, preferably located at the bottom of the image so that it is more obvious which direction the user is facing in the panoramic image. Note that although the text panel as shown is located in one part of the screen <b>10</b>, in another embodiment the text could be located in multiple locations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The text panel <b>16</b> also includes search text input fields <b>30</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, for example. The user can input textual information in the fields <b>30</b> and initiate or activate a search based on those terms. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the user may have entered the Street Number &#x201c;3113&#x201d; and the Street Name &#x201c;Caruth.&#x201d; In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the text fields are streets which intersect. Upon activation of the search, such as by activating indicator <b>32</b>, the program would initiate a search of a text database <b>34</b> stored on a computer readable medium. If matching information is found, the program automatically updates the map image, such as by shifting or centering the map, and panoramic image, by displaying the image corresponding to the entered criteria and map location. If more than one match is returned based on the search criteria, such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a pop-up box <b>36</b> can appear on the screen <b>10</b> listing the available matches <b>38</b>. The matches <b>38</b> are also embedded links or hotspots that, when activated, will update the map and panoramic images to correspond to the selected hotspot or link. The pop-up box <b>36</b> would then disappear. The pop-up box <b>36</b> is only one embodiment of such a feature. The information regarding multiple search results could appear within the text panel, elsewhere on the screen or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The search feature of the text panel can include other search mechanisms, such as searching by keyword, address, street intersections, zip code, GPS coordinates, etc. For example, keywords might include such points of interest as parks, churches, schools, pizza parlors, etc. The keywords will obviously depend on the application. The text panel <b>16</b> can include tabs <b>39</b>, if desired, to switch from one type of search criteria to another. If a search keyword is employed, in one preferred embodiment, the text panel or a pop-up panel would list all of the locations matching the keyword which appear on the map image. Alternately, the closest locations matching the keyword can be shown. The search feature can employ other techniques known in the art, such as searching for alternate spellings, locating the closest address, suggesting alternate search terms, indicating a successful or unsuccessful search, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The text panel can include other information, such as advertising or provider information, such as a logo <b>40</b>. The text panel can also indicate GPS coordinates corresponding to the panoramic image or hotspot. Similarly, the text search fields can allow searching by such criteria. The text database includes all textual information corresponding to a panoramic image.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In use, the application provides a method and apparatus for simultaneously viewing navigable panoramic images, corresponding navigable map images and textual data and allows input to searchable text fields. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> presents a logic chart of one embodiment of the invention. At start-up, the screen displays a set of default information, as indicated: default map image, default panoramic image, default textual information, default GPS coordinates, default logo and other default data as desired. The system can eliminate some or all of the default data. For example, the screen can show only nominal information, such as search fields in the text panel, and not display any map or panoramic images until the user indicates a desired field of search.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The user enters search field criteria, such as an address, zip code, GPS coordinates, a keyword, etc., or the user can activate a hotspot in either the map or panoramic images. Depending on the action of the user, the program will undertake different actions. Data for searching and cross-referencing is stored in computer-readable media in databases. A panoramic image database <b>52</b> stores the plurality of panoramic images. A map database <b>50</b> stores the map image or images. A text database <b>34</b> stores the text data corresponding to the panoramic images. The text data can include multiple data for a single panoramic image, such as the data types discussed herein. The data in storage in the databases is cross-referenced to gather corresponding information and data. The cross-correlation can be accomplished by various means known in the art, including by creating cross-reference databases in Access (trademark) software commercially available from Microsoft Corp. Selected images and data are then displayed on the screen. The process is repeated based on the actions of the user and the screen is updated or changed to display the panoramic image, map image and text data corresponding to the user's action.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, if a hotspot was activated from within the map image or panoramic image, the program will cross-reference all data associated with that hotspot, such as the corresponding map image location, the corresponding panoramic image and any corresponding textual data, whether the data is to be displayed or not. For example, the GPS coordinates associated with a panoramic image may be accessed and used to cross-reference to a location on the map image, but those coordinates may not be displayed on the screen. Some data corresponding to the hotspot may not be displayed because the user has indicated to hide the information or has not clicked on the text tab which would display that information. The information to be displayed will include a panoramic image corresponding to the hotspot, a map image corresponding to the panoramic image and text information to be displayed in the text panel. Other information may be displayed as well, as desired or as indicated by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Similarly, if the user entered search criteria in the text panel search fields <b>30</b>, the program would initiate a search based on that criteria. If a single search result is returned, or if the user selects one of a series of search results, the panoramic image, map image and possibly text data are updated or changed to display the information corresponding to the search result or selection.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The process can be repeated as desired. The invention provides corresponding panoramic images, map images and text information, including search fields, for a selected geographic area. The user has simultaneous access to the map and panoramic images and the textual panel.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">GPS coordinates can be used to &#x201c;place&#x201d; location points on the map image automatically. This can be accomplished by using Pepperwhite Street Map (trademark) from Pepperwhite Corp. available at www.pepperwhite.com. Similarly, equipment and software, such as GPS-Photo Link is commercially available from GeoSpatial Experts (trademark) and links photographs with GPS coordinates.</p>
