<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to providing a telematics system in a vehicle that has not previously been set up for such a system. More specifically, the present invention relates to a simplified telematics system for use in a new vehicle at a manufacturing site, or as a retrofitted telematics system to an existing vehicle, and methods for providing such telematics to a vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As consumer vehicles, such as cars and trucks, become more technologically complicated, operation of that vehicle becomes even more difficult. Today there is such an array of devices in trucks and cars that driver distraction is a major problem. To ease the driver's burden, mobile telematics systems and services have evolved that integrate wireless communications and (usually) location determining devices into vehicles to perform a number of tasks including, for example, carrying out remote engine diagnostics, locating stolen vehicles, and providing roadside assistance. Integration of such telematics systems requires significant design and implementation costs, not to mention the costly hardware that needs to be installed in the vehicle. Even though some manufacturers have started to include telematics systems with new vehicles, most new vehicles on the road today do not have such systems. More importantly, most manufacturers do not design vehicles to house such complex technology. When the manufacturers do incorporate this technology, it requires extra wiring and complexity. Thus, a need exists to make simpler systems both for installation at the site of manufacturing and retrofitting into existing vehicles without having to modify the vehicle in any substantial way (whether in terms of cost or labor).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While most vehicles do not have telematics systems pre-installed, many vehicles do have other kinds of integrated electronic communication devices. One kind of communications device that can be found in some vehicles is a Bluetooth transceiver. Bluetooth is an industrial specification for wireless personal area networks (PANs). A Bluetooth gateway provides measures for connection and exchanging information between devices such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers, digital cameras, and video game consoles over a secure, globally unlicensed short-range radio frequency. Equipping vehicles with a Bluetooth transceiver (also referred to as a Bluetooth gateway) makes it possible to link the vehicle with other Bluetooth-compatible devices brought into or near the car, the most common of which is a Bluetooth-compatible cell phone.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a Bluetooth-compatible cell phone is brought into a vehicle equipped with a Bluetooth transceiver, a data link is created between the phone and the transceiver. The most common feature made available to owners of vehicles so equipped is the ability to talk on the cell phone in a hands-free manner. In this embodiment, the vehicle is provided with a microphone (at least one near or directed at the head of the driver) for receiving audio from at least the driver (and, possibly, any passenger within the vehicle). A speaker system commonly associated with a vehicle's radio is temporarily connected to the transceiver and is, thereby, used to present any received audio signals to the user. Of course, dedicated speakers can be provided in the vehicle for this function or even a combination of these exemplary configurations. With such a configuration, bi-directional audio communication is made available to occupants of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another common Bluetooth feature is the ability to display and/or use the phone list stored in the cell phone for making calls without having to touch the cell phone. Either the vehicle is provided with a voice-recognition system to select a particular number in the cell phone's phone number list or has mechanical controls for doing so, or both. Such systems, however, do not have the ability to expand beyond these limited functions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There exists a need to be able to provide a simplified, cost-effective telematics system to be used both by original equipment manufacturers for new vehicle installations and by owners of existing vehicles for retrofitting into vehicles only having a Bluetooth transceiver without having to modify the vehicle in any substantial way (whether in terms of cost or labor). Even with the advent of telematics systems in vehicles today, there is not currently a service that is deployed to solve the above-described problems. Thus, it would be a significant advancement in the art to provide a telematics system in a vehicle where one did not exist before and where the vehicle was not pre-configured to provide such features.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Briefly, in accordance with the present invention, disclosed is a device and method for simplifying manufacturer-fitted telematics systems and retrofitting a telematics communication and control unit in a vehicle configured with a Bluetooth transceiver. This system and its process makes use of existing, in-vehicle Bluetooth gateways (in one embodiment, referred to as a &#x201c;Sync Box&#x201d;) by adding a component that contains all needed additional hardware for carrying out the desired telematics functions, for example, a positioning module (e.g., GPS) and a data module. The data module can be a phone with voice capability, but it can also be merely a data modem. Software is also added. Each vehicle equipped with Bluetooth communications capabilities has a Bluetooth gateway with particular characteristics, which can be obtained from the vehicle's manufacturer. A vehicle-specific software application is added to the Bluetooth gateway. In this way, the inventive telematics component (also referred to as a telematics gateway) can be linked to user interfaces of the vehicle through the Bluetooth gateway. This link is achieved through the standard Bluetooth PAN. This software application contains appropriate logic for activation of the telematics component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While it is known to use vehicle interfaces to receive and transmit audio phone calls through a vehicle's Bluetooth gateway, this gateway has not been used with data-oriented telematics functions. Where, for example, the phone does not have service available for communicating audio phone calls, the present invention still allows telematics functionality in a vehicle through use of the inventive data-oriented communication system. Moreover, the present invention provides this functionality as a retro-fitting system. Thus, the present invention permits, for the first time, telematics functionality in a vehicle without requiring the vehicle manufacturer to pre-design and pre-install such functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In prior-art vehicle telematics components, a dedicated bi-directional voice communications link was required. This link was provided by including an integrated device containing the same functionality as a standard cellular phone. Concomitantly, charges for this link were incurred and were at a level comparable to a consumer's pre-existing portable cell phone. Such systems, therefore, caused the consumer to pay approximately double fees for these two cellular devices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In contrast, the present invention entirely eliminates the need for a bi-directional, voice-supporting cellular device to be included in the telematics component. Instead, the telematics component of the present invention needs only to have a data transceiver, also referred to as a data pump. The telematics component can carry out all external data communication through this data pump. More specifically, when a user enters a vehicle with a Bluetooth-compatible device, the Bluetooth system sets up a communications link between the system and the device. This device can be already recognized (where it has been coupled with this system in the past) or it can be new to the system (in which case, a recognition protocol between the system and the device is carried out). The Bluetooth system stores information about each such device in a client stack, in which each such device is uniquely identified and recorded. The Bluetooth system is, then, able to direct data to, from, and through each such device in parallel or by multiplexing. The telematics component of the present invention utilizes this information and connection to communicate outside the vehicle for voice. For example, if a request for information is transmitted out from the telematics component, the path for such a communication will be between the data pump and the Bluetooth system, which data pump is capable of sending out the query data and receiving back the answer data. By knowing which devices are paired, the telematics component can embed the unique calling identifier (e.g., the cellular phone number) within the transmitted data. Then, when the off-site telematics information provider responds to the query, the response is channeled automatically through the paired device. The transaction can be entirely non-voice, in which the user is entirely unaware that their data pump was used for this telematics request, or can include (partially or wholly) voice data. In the latter case, the user's phone will ring, just as receiving a phone call, and the voice response from the telematics operator (whether automated, recorded or live) is conveyed to the vehicle user. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the telematics component does not embed the unique calling identifier and calls a particular pre-programmed cell phone that is set by the system or the user to receive a call when a given event occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">If there is a reason to originate data from a telematics operator to the vehicle or an occupant of the vehicle, the data is sent through the data pump. Then, when a mobile terminated communication occurs (i.e., to the vehicle), each of these paired devices is polled to determine if they are currently paired with the telematics component. When such a query returns a positive result, the data can be communicated (e.g., displayed) to the current user through one of the currently paired devices.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the present invention entirely eliminates the need for a voice-capable cellular device to be included with the telematics component. By utilizing the vehicle's Bluetooth gateway, the present invention can take hold, temporarily, of the consumer's portable cell phone to carry out the needed telematics voice communication, resulting in a significant cost savings.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention provides a simplified manufacturer's install or retrofitting telematics system and method for providing telematics to a vehicle that overcome the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and that provides a telematics system in a vehicle that has not previously been set up for such a system.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Herein various embodiment of the present invention are described. In many of the different embodiments, features are similar. Therefore, to avoid redundancy, repetitive description of these similar features may not be made in some circumstances. It shall be understood, however, that description of a first-appearing feature applies to the later described similar feature and each respective description, therefore, is to be incorporated therein without such repetition.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a diagrammatic illustration of an exemplary telematics component <b>10</b> according to the invention. In this embodiment, the telematics component <b>10</b> includes a Global Positioning System (GPS) device <b>11</b>, a data pump <b>12</b>, and a Bluetooth transceiver <b>13</b>. Each of these sub-systems is connected to a central controller <b>14</b>, which can be a central processing unit (CPU), such as a microprocessor. Other telematics sub-systems can also be included in the telematics component <b>10</b> as desired. The telematics component <b>10</b> is installed (arrow A) in a vehicle <b>20</b> having a gateway <b>21</b> containing a Bluetooth transceiver <b>22</b>. Power can be supplied to the component <b>10</b> either through a self-contained battery pack or a hard-wired connection to a power supply of the vehicle (e.g., the battery).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The GPS device <b>11</b> is self-contained and, with the CPU <b>14</b> and appropriate internal software, is able to output any desired GPS data (e.g., time or position in various units or formats). The data pump <b>12</b> is configured to receive and supply data to the Bluetooth transceiver <b>13</b> for processing by the gateway <b>21</b> or CPU <b>14</b>. Such data will be addressed in further detail below. The Bluetooth transceiver <b>13</b> is configured as a standard Bluetooth interface so that the telematics component <b>10</b> is recognized and paired just like any other device after the appropriate acknowledgement routine is carried out. Alternatively, the telematics component <b>10</b> can be hardwired into the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is noted that each vehicle <b>20</b> can have its own kind of gateway <b>21</b>. Thus, display, control, and all other functions capable of being carried out by the gateway <b>21</b> will most likely be device-specific. Accordingly, the telematics component <b>10</b> is configured with appropriate software <b>15</b> for interfacing with each of the different gateways <b>21</b> presented for connection. In one embodiment, the telematics component <b>10</b> can be configured to operate with a single, specific gateway <b>21</b>. Thus, different telematics components <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are created, one for each of the possible gateways <b>21</b>. In such a case, the vehicle <b>20</b> in which the component <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is to be installed is identified and the appropriate component <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is used. Alternatively, the component <b>10</b> can be configured with all possible gateway interface operating configurations and, upon installation can be programmed to execute the appropriate configuration for that specific gateway <b>21</b>. This execution can be manual (based upon user input of the corresponding vehicle identification) or can be automatic (through a sequence of question and answer transmissions to the gateway <b>21</b>). Specifications of each gateway <b>21</b> may be provided by the vehicle manufacture so that the software <b>15</b> can be developed accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The customized software <b>15</b> enables a single GPS system <b>11</b>, a single data system <b>12</b>, and a single Bluetooth system <b>13</b> to be customized for interfacing with any functionality operable by or through the vehicle's gateway <b>21</b>. Thus, even if the vehicle was not designed to provide GPS functionality, as long as the gateway <b>21</b> has a display (or is connected to a display) and as long as that display's specifications have been provided beforehand, the software <b>15</b> can format the call status/progress updates into a form suitable for projection by the existing display to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As set forth above, standard gateways <b>21</b> have the ability to interface with cell phones <b>30</b> that are present in or near the vehicle <b>20</b>. Communication can occur from the vehicle <b>20</b> through the cell phone <b>30</b> to a third party or from a third party to the cell phone <b>30</b> (e.g., SMS text) or through the cell phone <b>30</b> to the occupant in the vehicle <b>20</b> (e.g., voice call). The telematics component <b>10</b> is able to expand upon this ability to bi-directionally communicate outside the vehicle <b>20</b> by linking to the cell phone <b>30</b> through the gateway <b>21</b>. Because the telematics component <b>10</b> has the ability to communicate any data it desires over the Bluetooth transmission channel <b>40</b> (i.e., the Bluetooth gateway), it can, for example, obtain the current paired client list of the Bluetooth <b>22</b> device in the gateway <b>21</b>, and use one (or more) of the paired devices remotely through the secondary Bluetooth transmission channel <b>50</b>. More specifically, if the telematics component <b>10</b> needed to send a message to a base station <b>60</b>, then the data pump <b>12</b> would configure the appropriate data to be transmitted along with relevant control logic. Once the data pump <b>12</b> acknowledged that the communications channel <b>71</b> to the base station <b>60</b> was open (which state the telematics component <b>10</b> could detect), the control logic would then cause the appropriate data to be transmitted to the base station <b>60</b>. The present invention, therefore, entirely eliminates the need for a bi-directional, voice-supporting cellular device to be included in the telematics component <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">There are a number of exemplary uses for the telematics component <b>10</b> so configured. One exemplary use is the most commonly found use of a telematics device&#x2014;to summon roadside assistance. For the present example, the entity supplying the telematics component <b>10</b> has live operators at a remote facility, e.g., at the base station <b>60</b>, for providing roadside assistance through a voice communication. Further, the telematics component <b>10</b> has a user interface control (which is not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but could include software on gateway <b>21</b>) that calls the operator center upon a single actuation. For example, the telematics component <b>10</b> can have a red &#x201c;emergency&#x201d; button that, when pressed, opens a communications channel to the operator. Accordingly, when the vehicle occupant presses the button, the appropriate software <b>15</b> is called up to enable a &#x201c;live-operator-communication.&#x201d; The software <b>15</b> communicates via Bluetooth <b>13</b> to Bluetooth <b>22</b> to receive the active paired phones list. The active paired phones list is then passed to the data pump <b>12</b>. Whatever additional data is needed for this operation (e.g., the destination address for the data center at the base station <b>60</b>) is used by the data pump <b>12</b>. The data pump <b>12</b> then triggers the gateway <b>21</b>, which requires a first paired device (i.e., the cell phone <b>30</b>) to receive a phone call from the base station <b>60</b>, thus, carrying out the desired &#x201c;live-operator-communication&#x201d; function.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the telematics component <b>10</b> has an embedded GPS system <b>11</b>, the data sent to the base station <b>60</b> can include current GPS location coordinates. In this way, the operator could be provided with the information pinpointing the vehicle's location before voice communication occurs between the operator and the occupant.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Beneficial to the inventive system and process is the ability to utilize any Bluetooth communication device within range of the vehicle <b>20</b>. Whether or not the device has already been recognized (i.e., coupled with the gateway <b>21</b> in the past) or is new to the system (in which case, a recognition protocol between the system and the device may need to be carried out), if the Bluetooth system <b>22</b> has the device's identification information in its client stack, then the telematics component <b>10</b> has the possibility of directing calls to and through each such device as desired. In normal use, however, the telematics component <b>10</b> merely retrieves the identity of all currently paired devices from Bluetooth <b>22</b>. If desired, the component <b>10</b> can periodically communicate this information to the base station <b>60</b>, which keeps a vehicle-specific paired-device list.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Roadside assistance is only one of the possible telematics functions that could be provided with the inventive telematics component <b>10</b> of the present invention. Another function that could be provided with the component <b>10</b> is a door-unlock command. If the gateway <b>21</b> is communicatively coupled with the device that unlocks a locked door of the vehicle, then the telematics component <b>10</b> can interface with the door-unlocking device. As set forth above, the manufacturer provides the specifications for causing the gateway <b>21</b> to actuate the door-unlocking device. The telematics controller <b>10</b> stores this data internally. After appropriate authentication, the operator can transmit the pre-programmed authorization command to the telematics controller <b>10</b> via the data pump <b>12</b>. When the telematics controller <b>10</b> receives the authorization command, the appropriate control logic is sent to the gateway <b>21</b> to activate the door-opening device. If the gateway <b>21</b> is similarly connected to the vehicle starting assembly, then the telematics controller <b>10</b> can effect a remote engine start with little added difficulty. Likewise, if the gateway <b>21</b> has access to the vehicle's diagnostics bus, then any available diagnostic status can be made accessible not only to the driver, but also to an operator at the base station <b>60</b>. In an emergency, where the driver/passenger(s) is not available, the telematics controller <b>10</b> can be programmed to automatically send a diagnostics state(s) to the base station <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after an event occurs that requires the telematics software to take an action, referred to herein as an event call, the base station <b>60</b> can be provided automatically with both diagnostics data and GPS position data. Also sent to the base station <b>60</b> is the cell phone number for one or more currently paired cell phones <b>30</b> within the Bluetooth PAN of the vehicle <b>20</b>. Upon receiving the event call, an operator can be directed to call any or all of the currently paired cell phones <b>30</b> associated with that vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">More specifically, reference is made to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to describe this process. Beginning in Step <b>100</b>, the system waits for an event call. When an event call occurs, an event signal is sent to the gateway <b>21</b> in Step <b>200</b>. The telematics software on the gateway <b>21</b> recognizes receipt of the event call. In Step <b>300</b>, the telematics software notifies the telematics controller <b>10</b> and sends the appropriate data to the telematics controller <b>10</b> to list at least one cell phone <b>30</b> in the Bluetooth stack of the gateway <b>21</b>. In Step <b>400</b>, the telematics controller <b>10</b> sends an event call signal to the base station <b>60</b> and notifies the gateway <b>21</b> that the data was sent. The cell phone <b>30</b> receives a call from the base station <b>60</b> connecting the cell phone audio to the base station <b>60</b> in Step <b>500</b>. If desired, audio from the cell phone <b>30</b> can be routed to the vehicle's speakers to the occupant via Bluetooth <b>22</b>. In this way, by having the base station <b>60</b> call the vehicle directly, the inventive system avoids an issue that has plagued the telematics industry since its early days&#x2014;bad Caller-ID. Additionally, or alternatively, the base station <b>60</b> can have a fallback phone number for such an emergency and, simultaneously or thereafter, can require an operator to call that phone number.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Deployment of an airbag and the resulting communication with the invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. After an air bag is deployed, the base station <b>60</b> needs to be provided with both diagnostics data and GPS position data. More specifically, an airbag trigger signal is sent to the gateway <b>21</b>. The telematics software on the gateway <b>21</b> recognizes receipt by the gateway <b>21</b> of the airbag trigger. The telematics software notifies the telematics controller <b>10</b> and sends the appropriate data to the telematics controller <b>10</b> send notification to the base station and to list at least one cell phone <b>30</b> in the Bluetooth stack of the gateway <b>21</b>. The telematics controller <b>10</b> sends an airbag deployment signal to the base station <b>60</b> and notifies the gateway <b>21</b> that the data was sent. Also sent to the base station <b>60</b> is the cell phone number for one or more currently paired cell phones <b>30</b> within the Bluetooth PAN of the vehicle <b>20</b>. Upon receiving an accident indication, an operator can be directed to call any or all of the currently paired cell phones <b>30</b> associated with that vehicle <b>20</b>. The cell phone <b>30</b> receives a call from the base station <b>60</b> informing the user of the cell phone of the airbag deployment. If desired, audio from the cell phone <b>30</b> can be routed to the vehicle's speakers to the occupant via Bluetooth <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">There are instances where the driver/owner of the vehicle <b>20</b> should be notified about current conditions of the vehicle <b>20</b>. For example, if the vehicle's alarm system activates and the driver is not within range of the vehicle <b>20</b>, then the operator at the base station <b>60</b> can be silently informed of the alarm's activation and call a pre-programmed cell phone, such as the owner's phone, or can be asked to call the police with GPS position information of the vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Other telematics functions require information from the GPS module <b>11</b>. If position, direction, and speed are made available to the software <b>15</b> and base station <b>60</b> from the telematics controller <b>10</b>, then it is possible to carry out, for example, speed alerts, real-time remote vehicle location requests, geo-fencing, stolen vehicle recovery procedures, and updates for traffic, weather and/or parking. If the in-vehicle display controlled by the gateway <b>21</b> is sufficiently robust, then navigation, point-of-interest, and trip-planning features can be made available to the driver without installing a costly navigation system in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A device and method for simplifying manufacturer-fitted telematics systems and retrofitting a telematics communication and control unit in a vehicle configured with a Bluetooth transceiver has been disclosed that overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
