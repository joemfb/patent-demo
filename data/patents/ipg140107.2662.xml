<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims priority of Korean patent application number 10-2007-0088214, filed on Aug. 31, 2007, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method for fabricating a micropattern of a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the integration density of semiconductor devices increases, sub-40 nm line and space (LS) is required. However, due to the limitation of existing exposure apparatuses, it is difficult to form sub-60 nm LS.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to form sub-60 nm LS while using existing exposure apparatuses, a double patterning technology (DPT) and a spacer patterning technology (SPT) have been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a micropattern of a semiconductor device fabricated by an SPT process. The SPT process fabricates two lines (L) and two spacers (S) within 1 pitch, thus increasing the integration degree of a cell. Although the SPT process can provide two times the integration degree of the cell compared with the typical technology, a new fabrication process is required to further increase the integration degree of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, the semiconductor device includes an etch target layer (a lower structure) <b>100</b>, a hard mask <b>101</b>, spacers <b>102</b> serving as a pattern mask, and a sacrificial layer <b>103</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing a method for fabricating a micropattern of a semiconductor device, which is capable of increasing the integration degree of a cell compared with a typical a spacer patterning technology (SPT) process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for fabricating a micropattern of a semiconductor device. The method includes forming a first hard mask over an etch target layer, forming a first sacrificial layer over the first hard mask, and etching the first sacrificial layer to form a sacrificial pattern. The method further includes forming spacers on both sidewalls of the sacrificial pattern, forming a second sacrificial layer over the spacers and the first hard mask, forming a dummy mask in a bent portion of the second sacrificial layer between the adjacent spacers, and etching the sacrificial pattern and the second sacrificial layer using the dummy mask and the spacers as an etch barrier layer to form a dummy pattern between the adjacent spacers. The first hard mask is etched using the spacers and the dummy pattern as an etch barrier layer to form a first hard mask pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention can fabricate a high-integrated semiconductor device having three lines (L) and three spacers (S) within 1 pitch.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hereinafter, a method for fabricating a micropattern of a semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the thicknesses of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, a film, a pattern and a region is referred to as being &#x201c;on/under&#x201d; another element herein, it may be directly on/under the other element, and one or more intervening elements may also be present. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements throughout the drawings. In addition, changes to the English characters of the reference numerals of layers refer to a partial deformation of the layers by an etch process or a polishing process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2I</figref> illustrate a method for fabricating a micropattern of a semiconductor device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. It will be assumed that a cell gate is an etch target layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an etch target layer <b>200</b> is formed over a semiconductor substrate (not shown). The etch target layer <b>200</b> may include a conductive layer, a metal layer, a metal nitride layer, a metal silicide layer, or a stacked structure thereof. The conductive layer is formed of impurity-doped polysilicon and the metal layer is formed of transition metal or rare-earth metal. The metal nitride layer is formed of nitride of transition metal and the metal silicide layer is formed of a material produced by reacting transition metal with silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A hard mask <b>201</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a first hard mask) is formed over the etch target layer <b>200</b>. The first hard mask layer <b>201</b> may be formed of a material having a low etch selectivity to the etch target layer <b>200</b> in order to serve as an etch barrier layer in a process of etching the etch target layer <b>200</b>. For example, the etch target layer <b>200</b> is formed of nitride such as silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A sacrificial layer <b>202</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a first sacrificial layer) is formed over the first hard mask <b>201</b>. The first sacrificial layer <b>202</b> may be formed of a material having a high etch selectivity to the first hard mask <b>201</b>. For example, when the first hard mask <b>201</b> is formed of silicon nitride, the first sacrificial layer <b>202</b> is formed of silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). In addition, the first sacrificial layer <b>202</b> may be formed of polysilicon silicon or carbon-containing materials, for example amorphous carbon, which can be easily removed by a dry etch process.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A hard mask <b>203</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a second hard mask) may be formed over the first sacrificial layer <b>202</b>. The second hard mask <b>203</b> is formed for preventing deformation of immersion photoresist patterns and pattern failures caused by reduction of the etch selectivity. Thus, the second hard mask <b>203</b> may be formed of a material having a low etch selectivity to the first sacrificial layer <b>202</b>. For example, when the first sacrificial layer <b>202</b> is formed of silicon oxide, the second hard mask <b>203</b> is formed of carbon-containing material.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An anti-reflective coating (ARC) <b>204</b> may be formed over the second hard mask <b>203</b>. The ARC <b>204</b> may include a single layer of a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) or a stacked structure of a dielectric anti-reflective coating (DARC) and a BARC, where the DARC is formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The CVD-DARC is formed of a material having a refractive index of approximately 1.95 and an extinction coefficient of approximately 0.53, and the BARC is formed of an organic material. When the second hard mask <b>203</b> is formed of carbon-containing material, absorptive amorphous carbon, the ARC <b>204</b> may include a silicon oxynitride (SiON) layer that is an inorganic anti-reflective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a photoresist layer is coated over the ARC <b>204</b>. The coated photoresist layer is exposed using a photo mask and developed to form photoresist patterns <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the ARC <b>204</b> and the second hard mask <b>203</b> are etched using the photoresist patterns <b>205</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) to form ARC patterns <b>204</b>A and second hard mask patterns <b>203</b>A. In order to form one more LS within the same pitch compared with a typical SPT process (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the above etch process is performed such that a critical dimension (CD) of the second hard mask patterns <b>203</b>A is reduced. To this end, the etch process is performed by an ashing process using oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) plasma. In this case, the CD of the second hard mask patterns <b>203</b>A can be reduced by increasing a flow rate of oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the photoresist patterns <b>205</b> remain over the ARC patterns <b>204</b>A after etching the second hard mask patterns <b>203</b>A, they may be removed by a separate etch process.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the CD of the second hard mask patterns <b>203</b>A needs to be further reduced after removing the photoresist patterns <b>205</b>, an etch process using oxygen plasma may be further performed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the first sacrificial layer <b>202</b> is etched using the second hard mask patterns <b>203</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) to form first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A. The etch process may be performed by a dry etch process or a wet etch process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second hard mask patterns <b>203</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) are removed. The removing process may be performed using the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A and the first hard mask <b>201</b> as an etch barrier layer. The removing process may be performed by an ashing process using oxygen plasma in order to minimize the deformation of the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A. In this way, the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A are formed over the first hard mask <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a spacer material layer (not shown) is conformally formed over the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A and the first hard mask <b>201</b>. That is, the spacer material layer is formed in a uniform liner over the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A and the first hard mask layer <b>201</b> and is etched to have a vertical profile. In addition, the spacer material layer may be formed of a material having a low etch selectivity to the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A and the first had mask <b>201</b>. For example, when the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A are formed of silicon oxide and the first hard mask <b>201</b> is formed of silicon nitride, the spacer material layer may be formed of polysilicon.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The spacer material layer is etched to form spacers <b>206</b> on both sidewalls of the first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A. The etch process may be performed by an anisotropic dry etch process using a plasma etch apparatus, in particular, an etch-back process. For example, when the first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A is formed of silicon oxide and the spacer material layer is formed of polysilicon, the etch-back process is performed using Cl<sub>2</sub>, HBr, or a mixed gas thereof, which has an etch selectivity between the first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A and the spacer material layer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, a sacrificial layer <b>207</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a second sacrificial layer) is formed conformally over the spacers <b>206</b> and the hard mask <b>201</b>. In this case, the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> is removed together with the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A through a subsequent etch process and becomes a region for a spacer (S) of the LS. Thus, the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> is formed to a thickness equal to the CD of the first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A and is formed of the same material as the first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A, for example, silicon oxide. Meanwhile, the first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A becomes a region for a line (L) of the LS. In order to form the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> to the thickness equal to the CD of the first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A, the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> is formed in a liner along the top surface of the first hard mask <b>201</b>. In one embodiment, the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> is formed of tetra ethyl ortho silicate (TEOS) having a high coating rate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, a dummy mask <b>208</b> is formed in a bent portion of the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> between adjacent spacers among the spacers <b>206</b> formed on the sidewalls of the different first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A. At this point, a dummy mask material layer (not shown) is formed over the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> and etched by a dry etch process using a plasma etch apparatus. In this way, the dummy mask <b>208</b> is formed in the bent portion of the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> between the adjacent spacers. The dummy mask material layer can remain on the bent portion of the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> because the dummy mask material layer is formed thickest in the bent portion due to the step caused by the bent portion of the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b>. The dummy mask <b>208</b> is formed of the same material as the spacers <b>206</b>. For example, the dry etch process is performed by an etch-back process and uses Cl<sub>2</sub>, HBr, or a mixed gas thereof when the dummy mask is formed of polysilicon and the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> is formed of silicon oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> is etched using the spacers <b>206</b> and the dummy mask <b>208</b> as an etch barrier layer to form a second sacrificial pattern <b>207</b>A. Through this process, the first sacrificial patterns <b>202</b>A formed of the same material as the second sacrificial layer <b>207</b> are removed to expose the first hard mask <b>201</b>. In this way, spacer patterns <b>206</b> and a dummy pattern <b>209</b>, which includes the second sacrificial pattern <b>207</b>A and the dummy mask <b>208</b>, are formed over the first hard mask <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the etch process may be obtained by singly performing an anisotropic dry etch process using a plasma etch apparatus. In such an embodiment, the etch process is obtained by an etch-back process using a polymer rich gas, for example, carbon fluoride compound. The carbon fluoride compound may include a C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6 </sub>gas, a C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas, a C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas, or mixture of thereof. In some embodiments, the etch process may be obtained by sequentially performing a wet etch process and a dry etch process. In such embodiments, the etch process is obtained by etching the second sacrificial pattern <b>207</b>A to a predetermined thickness using diluted HF (DHF) solution, which is a mixed solution of HF and deionized water (DIW), or buffered oxide etchant (BOE), which is a mixed solution of NH<sub>4</sub>F and HF, and removing the remaining second sacrificial pattern <b>207</b>A and the remaining first sacrificial pattern <b>202</b>A through a dry etch process, for example an etch-back process. In those embodiments, the wet etch process is primarily performed in order to minimize the loss of the spacers <b>206</b> and the dummy mask <b>208</b> by reducing the load of the dry etch process.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, a first hard mask pattern <b>201</b>A is formed by etching the first hard mask <b>201</b> using the spacers <b>206</b>A and the dummy pattern <b>209</b>A as an etch barrier layer. The dummy pattern <b>209</b>A includes an etched dummy mask <b>208</b>A and the sacrificial patterns <b>207</b>A. The etch process may be performed by an anisotropic etch process, such as an etch-back process, using a plasma etch apparatus. In this way, a high-integrated semiconductor device having three lines (L) and three spacers (S) within 1 pitch can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although not shown, the etch target layer <b>200</b> is etched using the first hard mask pattern as an etch barrier layer.</p>
