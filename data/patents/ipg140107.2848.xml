<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of International Application PCT/EP2009/065195, filed Nov. 16, 2009, claiming priority to European Application 08171912.2 filed Dec. 17, 2008 and the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/204,662, filed Jan. 9, 2009; the disclosures of International Application PCT/EP2009/065195, European Application 08171912.2 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/204,662, each as filed, are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a foamed polyolefin composition having low density values, thus a high expansion degree and a substantive content of closed cells.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Foamed polyolefin compositions find use in many applications, like in particular packaging, thermal and acoustic insulation, wire and cable coatings and production of shock-absorbent elements (in car bumpers for example).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polyolefin foams can be molded into the final shape while produced, as in the case of foamed sheets or pipes obtained directly from extrusion/foaming processes, or they can undergo multiple processing steps, as in the production of foamed beads, followed by sintering to obtain the final article.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus there is a continuous effort in the relevant art to provide foamed polyolefin compositions with high quality, in particular with very low density, which can be easily produced and processed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, it has been found that a very good balance of mechanical properties and processability can be obtained by foaming polyolefin compositions comprising a propylene polymer with broad molecular weight distribution and an olefin copolymer with elastomeric properties.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to WO2007/003523, such kind of compositions require, in order to achieve good foamability, the presence of a polypropylene component with a very broad molecular weight distribution, namely with a Polydispersity Index higher than 15. In the examples a good foaming behavior is obtained by subjecting to foaming a composition containing a polypropylene component with a Polydispersity Index value of 30.3, and 18% by weight of an ethylene/propylene copolymer containing 66.6% by weight of ethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has now been found that particularly low values of density, in combination with attractive mechanical properties deriving from the presence of significant amounts of highly modified ethylene copolymers, can be achieved by foaming a polyolefin composition where a polypropylene component and an ethylene copolymer having a specific ethylene content are present in opportunely selected amounts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the present invention provides a foamed polyolefin composition comprising (all percent amounts being by weight):
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">A) 50%-90%, preferably 55-80%, more preferably 55-75% of a polypropylene component selected from the group consisting of a propylene homopolymer, a random copolymer of propylene containing up to 3% of ethylene, a random copolymer of propylene containing up to 6% of at least one C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>&#x3b1;-olefin and optionally up to 3% of ethylene, and any combination thereof; and</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">B) 10%-50%, preferably 20-45%, more preferably 25-45% of a copolymer component of ethylene and at least one C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>&#x3b1;-olefin, the copolymer containing from 15% to 50%, preferably from 20% to 48%, more preferably from 25% to 38% of ethylene, and optionally minor amounts of a diene;
<br/>
the said amounts of (A) and (B) being referred to the total weight of (A) and (B); said composition having at least one of the following features i) and ii), or both:
</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">i) a Polydispersity Index of component (A) of 4 or more;</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">ii) a value of viscosity [&#x3b7;] of the fraction soluble in xylene at room temperature (about 25&#xb0; C.) equal to or higher than 3.5 dl/g.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the component (A) of the foamed polyolefin composition comprises (all percent amounts being by weight):

    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0015">A<sup>I</sup>) from 25% to 75%, preferably from 30% to 70%, of a propylene polymer having a melt flow rate MFR<sup>I </sup>of from 0.1 to 10 g/10 min., preferably from 0.1 to 5 g/10 min., more preferably from 0.1 to 3 g/10 min.; and</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">A<sup>II</sup>) from 25% to 75%, preferably from 30% to 70%, of a propylene polymer having a melt flow rate value MFR<sup>II </sup>equal to or lower than 100 g/10 min., in particular from 5 to 100 g/10 min., preferably from 10 to 100 g/10 min., more preferably from 10 to 75 g/10 min.;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">wherein the ratio MFR<sup>II</sup>/MFR<sup>I </sup>(i.e. the value of the ratio of the MFR value of (A<sup>II</sup>) to the MFR value of (A<sup>I</sup>)) is from 5 to 60, preferably from 10 to 55, and the propylene polymers (A<sup>I</sup>) and (A<sup>II</sup>) are independently selected from the group consisting of a propylene homopolymer, a random copolymer of propylene containing up to 3% of ethylene, and a random copolymer of propylene containing up to 6% of at least one C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>&#x3b1;-olefin and optionally up to 3% of ethylene; the said amounts of (A<sup>I</sup>) and (A<sup>II</sup>) being referred to the total weight of (A<sup>I</sup>) and (A<sup>II</sup>). The term &#x201c;foamed&#x201d; means that the polyolefin composition of the invention is obtained by subjecting to a conventional foaming process a polyolefin composition, hereinafter called polyolefin composition (I), having the same constituents and features as the final foamed product, namely comprising the above described components (A) and (B) and preferably (A<sup>I</sup>) and (A<sup>II</sup>) in the above said amounts, and having at least one of the above said features i) and ii).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">As will be further explained, the foaming processes generally comprise a molten state treatment of polyolefin composition (I), like extrusion, in the presence of a foaming agent.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">The MFR values are measured according to ASTM-D 1238, condition L (230&#xb0; C., with 2.16 kg load).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">The MFR of the polyolefin composition (I) and of the foamed polyolefin composition of the present invention can preferably range from 0.1 to 10 g/10 min., more preferably from 0.1 to 5 g/10 min.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">Indicatively, the lower limit of ethylene and C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>&#x3b1;-olefins in (A), (A<sup>I</sup>) and/or (A<sup>II</sup>) is of 0.1% by weight, preferably of 0.5% by weight in the case of C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>&#x3b1;-olefins.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">Illustrative C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>&#x3b1;-olefins that can be present in (A), (A<sup>I</sup>) and/or (A<sup>II</sup>) include 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene and 1-octene, with 1-butene being particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">Preferably (A) and both (A<sup>I</sup>) and (A<sup>II</sup>) are propylene homopolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">Among the C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>&#x3b1;-olefins that are present in the copolymer component (B), propylene is preferred. Other examples of the said &#x3b1;-olefins are the same as previously given for (A).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">The diene when present, is typically in an amount of from 0.5 to 10% by weight with respect to the weight of (B). Examples of dienes are butadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene and ethylidene-norbornene-1.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">Other preferred features for the polyolefin composition (I) and for the foamed polyolefin composition of the present invention are:

Xylene Soluble and Insoluble Fractions
</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0069">2.5 g of polymer and 250 cm<sup>3 </sup>of xylene are introduced in a glass flask equipped with a refrigerator and a magnetical stirrer. The temperature is raised in 30 minutes up to the boiling point of the solvent. The so obtained clear solution is then kept under reflux and stirring for further 30 minutes. The closed flask is then kept for 30 minutes in a bath of ice and water and in thermostatic water bath at 25&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes as well. The so formed solid is filtered on quick filtering paper. 100 cm<sup>3 </sup>of the filtered liquid is poured in a previously weighed aluminum container which is heated on a heating plate under nitrogen flow, to remove the solvent by evaporation. The container is then kept in an oven at 80&#xb0; C. under vacuum until constant weight is obtained. The weight percentage of polymer soluble in xylene at room temperature is then calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0070">The percent by weight of polymer insoluble in xylene at room temperature is considered the isotacticity index of the polymer.
