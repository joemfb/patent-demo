<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electronic device includes a frame defining a slot and a first through hole, a slot cover moveably received in the slot, a latching member rotateably connected to the frame, and a torsion spring. The latching member includes a first arm and a second arm protruding therefrom and extending in opposite directions. When the latching member is at a locking position, the first arm faces the first through hole, and the second arm engages an elastic hook to retain the cover in the slot. The spring includes a first arm fixed to the first arm and a second arm fixed to the frame. The latching member is driven to rotate when the first arm is pushed by an elongated object passing through the first through hole, causing the second arm push the elastic hook to be deformed, thereby allowing the second arm to disengage from the elastic hook.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an electronic device <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>11</b> and a slot cover <b>12</b>. The frame <b>11</b> is mounted between an upper housing (not shown) and a lower housing (not shown) of the electronic device <b>10</b>, and used to support elements (not shown) of the electronic device <b>10</b>. The frame <b>11</b> defines a sidewall <b>113</b>, and the sidewall <b>113</b> defines a first through hole <b>13</b> and a slot <b>110</b>. The slot <b>110</b> can receive the cover <b>12</b>. An electronic card connector (not shown) is arranged within the frame <b>11</b> and electrically connected to a circuit board (not shown) with an open end aligned with the slot <b>110</b>, and is used to receive an electronic card, such as a flash memory card or a subscriber identity module (SIM) card. The cover <b>12</b> is configured to cover the slot <b>110</b>. The connector includes a conventional ejection mechanism (not shown) configured to push an electronic card out when the electronic card is depressed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The electronic device <b>10</b> further includes a lid <b>15</b>, a rotatable latching member <b>16</b>, and a torsion spring <b>17</b>. The frame <b>11</b> further defines an interior <b>112</b> extending through the sidewall <b>113</b> and a cavity <b>14</b> within the interior <b>112</b> of the frame <b>11</b> for receiving the lid <b>15</b>, the latching member <b>16</b>, and the torsion spring <b>17</b>. The cavity <b>14</b> and the slot <b>110</b> communicate with each other, the cavity <b>14</b> and the first through hole <b>13</b> also communicate with each other. A second through hole <b>150</b> is defined in the lid <b>15</b>. A screw <b>151</b> passes through the second through hole <b>150</b> and is screwed into a threaded hole <b>152</b> of the frame <b>11</b>, thereby fixing the lid elastic piece <b>15</b> to the frame <b>11</b>. The latching member <b>16</b> includes a main body <b>160</b> defining a third through hole <b>161</b>. A protruding pin <b>18</b> of the frame <b>11</b> which protrudes from the bottom <b>141</b> of the cavity <b>14</b> is received in the third through hole <b>161</b>. The torsion spring <b>17</b> which is connected between the bottom of the cavity <b>14</b> and the latching member <b>16</b> is received in the third through hole <b>161</b> and coiled around the protruding pin <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the latching member <b>16</b> further includes a first arm <b>162</b> and a second arm <b>163</b> protruding from opposite sides of the main body <b>160</b>. The torsion spring <b>17</b> includes a first arm <b>171</b> and a second arm <b>172</b>. The first arm <b>171</b> is fixed to the first arm <b>162</b>, and the end of the second arm <b>172</b> is received in a through hole <b>111</b> defined in the frame <b>11</b>. The torsion spring <b>17</b> can retain the latching member <b>16</b> in the normal position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cover <b>12</b> includes a cover body <b>125</b>, an elastic hook <b>120</b> and a positioning post <b>121</b> both protruding from the cover body <b>125</b> and extending towards a same longitudinally direction. The hook <b>120</b> and the positioning post <b>121</b> are located at two opposite ends <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> of the cover <b>12</b>, and the hook <b>120</b> is located at the end <b>123</b> which is closer to the first through hole <b>13</b> and which longitudinally extends through the slot <b>110</b> and radially outwardly extends towards the first through hole <b>13</b> to engage an interior surface <b>1131</b> of the sidewall <b>113</b>, and the hook <b>120</b> and the positioning post <b>121</b> are received in the slot <b>110</b> when the slot cover <b>12</b> is received in the slot <b>110</b>. The positioning post <b>121</b> is moveably received in the through hole of the frame <b>11</b>. The first arm <b>162</b> faces the first through hole <b>13</b> and the second arm <b>163</b> engages the hook <b>120</b> when the slot cover <b>12</b> is received in the slot <b>110</b>, thereby limiting the movement of the cover <b>12</b>. In the embodiment, the hook <b>120</b> defines an indentation <b>122</b> to receive a free end of the second arm <b>163</b> and thus come into engagement with the second arm <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When needed, a thin pin <b>20</b> can be inserted into the first through hole <b>13</b> to push the first arm <b>162</b>. The latching member <b>16</b> is then urged to rotate around the protruding pin <b>18</b>. The second arm <b>162</b> moves and pushes the elastic hook <b>120</b>, causing the elastic hook <b>120</b> to be elastically deformed radially inwardly away from the first through hole <b>13</b> until the elastic hook <b>120</b> disengages from the second arm <b>163</b>, which frees the cover <b>12</b> from the limitation of the second arm <b>163</b>, and the elastic hook <b>120</b> to disengage the interior surface <b>1131</b> of the sidewall <b>113</b> and to be longitudinally removed from the slot <b>110</b> in an unlatched condition to allow the cover <b>12</b> to move out of the slot <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the embodiment, the positioning post <b>121</b> is made of flexible material. When moving out of the slot <b>110</b>, the cover <b>12</b> can be turned over to show the electronic card positioned in the connector. In an alternative embodiment, the positioning post <b>121</b> may be made of hard material. When freeing from the limitation of the second arm <b>163</b>, the cover <b>12</b> can be pulled out of the opening <b>111</b> to disengage from the frame <b>11</b>, allowing the electronic card in the connector to be exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When the thin pin <b>20</b> pushes the first arm <b>162</b>, the first arm <b>171</b> fixed to the first arm <b>162</b> is driven to move in union with the first arm <b>162</b>. The spring <b>17</b> is thus deformed. When the hook <b>120</b> disengages from the second arm <b>163</b>, the rotatable latching member <b>16</b> is urged to return to the normal position by the restoring force of the spring <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the electronic card has been removed or inserted into the connector again, a user can push the cover <b>12</b> into the slot <b>110</b>. The hook <b>120</b> then pushes the second arm <b>163</b> to move. In the embodiment, the hook <b>120</b> includes an inclined plane <b>123</b> at the free end of the hook <b>120</b>. The inclined plane <b>123</b> resists against the free end of the second arm <b>162</b> when pushing the cover <b>12</b>, causing the hook <b>120</b> to be deflected. When the hook <b>120</b> deflects to the extent that the free end of the second arm <b>163</b> moves away from the engagement with inclined plane <b>123</b>, the second arm <b>163</b> is driven to move back by the spring <b>17</b> until contacting the sidewall of the indentation <b>122</b>. The free end of the second arm <b>162</b> is received in the indentation <b>122</b> when the hook <b>120</b> rebounds. Thus, the cover <b>12</b> can be retained in the slot <b>110</b>.</p>
