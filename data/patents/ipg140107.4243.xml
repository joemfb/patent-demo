No. 12/192,810, filed Aug. 15, 2008, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,174,852. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/440,882 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,174,852 are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to power supplies and, more particularly, the present invention relates to forward converters.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">AC-to-DC and DC-to-DC power supplies typically use a power conversion topology commonly known as a two-switch forward converter (that is, a forward converter having two active switches).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The two-switch forward converter typically uses two active switches and two passive switches in a configuration that applies an input voltage to the primary winding of a transformer. A secondary winding on the transformer produces a scaled voltage in response to the input voltage applied to the primary winding. The voltage on the secondary winding is rectified and filtered to generate an output voltage. The passive switches allow the magnetizing energy of the transformer to reset when the active switches are off. The magnetizing energy of the transformer is allowed to reset (that is, return to a much lower value) to prevent excess stored energy from saturating the transformer and thereby altering its properties.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The two-switch forward converter is often the lowest cost configuration that meets the requirements of power supplies for personal computers and similar applications. The symmetry of the circuit topology of the two-switch forward converter invites designers to choose nominally identical transistors for the two active switches and to choose nominally identical diodes for the two passive switches.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventional designs of two-switch forward converters specify either the same component or two different components with nearly identical properties for the two transistors, and likewise for the two diodes. Such designs fail to take advantage of an additional degree of freedom that can reduce system cost.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An asymmetric switch forward converter will now be described. Examples of the present invention involve a first and second active switch and a first and second passive switch.

The second active switch can be coupled to a second terminal of the primary winding of the transformer. The output capacitance of the first active switch is substantially greater than the output capacitance of the second active switch. The first passive switch can be coupled to the second active switch and to the second terminal of the primary winding. The second passive switch can be coupled to the first active switch and to the first terminal of the primary winding.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one example of a two-switch forward converter <b>100</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The two-switch forward converter uses two active switches, Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b>, with two passive switches, D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>116</b>, in a configuration that produces a voltage V<sub>P </sub><b>132</b> on a primary winding <b>130</b> of a transformer T<b>1</b> <b>128</b> from an input voltage V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b>. A secondary winding <b>134</b> of the transformer T<b>1</b> <b>128</b> produces a voltage proportional to the primary voltage V<sub>P </sub><b>132</b>. An output diode <b>136</b> rectifies the voltage at the secondary winding <b>134</b>. A freewheeling diode <b>138</b>, an output inductor L<b>1</b> <b>140</b>, and an output capacitor C<b>1</b> <b>142</b> filter the rectified voltage from the secondary winding <b>134</b> to produce an output voltage V<sub>O </sub><b>142</b> at a load <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A difference between an active switch and a passive switch is that the active switch receives a control signal that opens and closes the switch, whereas a passive switch does not usually receive a control signal. An open switch does not normally conduct current. A closed switch can conduct current. Active switches typically have one or more control terminals that determine whether or not two other terminals of the active switch may conduct current. The signals that open and close active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are not shown in the illustration to avoid obscuring teachings in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Passive switches generally have only two terminals. Typically, the voltage between the terminals determines whether a passive switch is open or closed. A diode can be considered a passive switch, since it conducts current when the voltage between its two terminals has one polarity (anode positive with respect to cathode), and it substantially blocks current when the voltage between the terminals has the opposite polarity (anode negative with respect to cathode).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> comprise metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETs) <b>106</b> and <b>124</b> respectively, with their respective inherent output capacitances depicted as capacitors C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> and C<sub>OSS2 </sub><b>126</b>, respectively. Capacitors C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> and C<sub>OSS2 </sub><b>126</b> are shown with broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to emphasize that they represent an inherent behavior of the MOSFETs <b>106</b> and <b>124</b>, and that they are not external components. Control signals turn on MOSFETs <b>106</b> and <b>124</b> to close active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b>. Control signals turn off MOSFETs <b>106</b> and <b>126</b> to open active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other examples, the respective active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> may be realized with other suitable electronic devices such as bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) or insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). The output capacitance of MOSFETs and other active switching devices is significant, as explained below. The switches can be integrated using a single substrate or provided as discrete components.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows the passive switches D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>116</b> comprise PN junction diodes <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> respectively, having reverse recovery characteristics that are modeled by reverse recovery capacitances depicted as capacitors C<sub>RR1 </sub><b>114</b> and C<sub>RR2 </sub><b>120</b>, respectively, with broken lines. The reverse recovery capacitors model a reverse recovery characteristic of real diodes. When the polarity of the voltage on a PN junction diode transitions to change the state of the diode from conducting current to blocking current, there is a momentary reverse current for a time known as the reverse recovery time that occurs while carriers of electric charge are removed from the device. Normally, the reverse recovery capacitance is considered to be present only during the reverse recovery time of the diode.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The reverse recovery time and the reverse current help define the reverse recovery characteristic of the diode. A diode that has a short reverse recovery time is considered to be a fast diode. A diode that has a long reverse recovery time can be known as a slow diode. A fast diode typically has a reverse recovery time substantially less than one microsecond. A slow diode typically has a reverse recovery time substantially greater than one microsecond. The reverse recovery characteristic of the passive switches D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>116</b> are explained in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one example, the MOSFETs <b>106</b> and <b>124</b> of respective active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> are either both switched on or are both switched off in response to their respective control signals. Diodes <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> in the passive switches D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>116</b>, respectively, turn on and off in response to the voltages that result from the switching of the active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Conventional designs of two-switch forward converters typically use nominally identical active switches and nominally identical passive switches to reduce the number of distinct parts required in the design. A reduction in the number of distinct components often results in reduced cost. As discussed in the examples below, however, the use of devices with substantially different characteristics for the two active switches and the use of devices with substantially different characteristics for the two passive switches can produce a lower cost design.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the availability of low-cost power integrated circuits that include high voltage MOSFET transistors having control functions allow the use of such devices to provide one of the active switches in the two-switch forward converter. The other active switch in the converter can be a discrete electronic device that can differ in many ways from the MOSFET in the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A parameter that is typically considered when selecting a switching device is the output capacitance of the device. The device dissipates the energy stored in its output capacitance every time the device turns on. The energy dissipated is proportional to the square of the voltage present in the capacitance when the device turns on. Dissipation of energy normally raises the temperature of the device. A larger package or a heat sink may be required to prevent excessive rise in temperature that could damage the device. Thus, the added cost of thermal management can offset the advantage of the low-cost power integrated circuit. Therefore, switching devices that typically have small output capacitances are used and are typically switched when the voltage on the capacitance is low.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In applications where one of the active switches is a MOSFET in an integrated circuit and the other active switch is packaged as a discrete component, the discrete component often has an on-resistance that is substantially lower than the on-resistance of the MOSFET in the integrated circuit. A low on-resistance is desirable to reduce conduction loss in the device. Output capacitance usually increases as on resistance is reduced. Consequently, the selected switching device packaged as a discrete component often has an output capacitance that is much greater than the output capacitance of the MOSFET in the integrated circuit. In accordance with the present disclosure, a two-switch forward converter that reduces excessive dissipation of energy when the active switches have substantially different output capacitance is described. The asymmetric switch forward converter uses asymmetric passive switches to reduce the voltage that remains across the active switch that has the higher output capacitance before the active switches turn on. The energy in the output capacitance is dissipated in the switch when the switch turns on. Thus, reducing the energy in the capacitance reduces the dissipation of energy in the active switch that has the higher output capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The example asymmetric two-switch forward converter <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in greater detail in the schematic diagram <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that the output capacitance C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> of active switch Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> is substantially greater than the output capacitance C<sub>OSS2 </sub><b>126</b> of active switch Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b>. In one example, the output capacitance C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> of active switch Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> that is a discrete transistor is approximately 330 picofarads, whereas the output capacitance C<sub>OSS2 </sub><b>126</b> of active switch Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> that is included in a power integrated circuit is approximately 50 picofarads.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, power dissipation in the active switches is managed by selecting operating characteristics of the passive switches D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>116</b> such that the reverse recovery time of passive switch D<b>1</b> (modeled by the reverse recovery capacitance C<sub>RR1</sub>) is substantially greater than the reverse recovery time of passive switch D<b>2</b> (modeled by the reverse recovery capacitance C<sub>RR2</sub>). In one example, the reverse recovery time of passive switch D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> is approximately 2 microseconds, whereas the reverse recovery time of passive switch D<b>2</b> <b>116</b> is approximately 75 nanoseconds. In the common terminology of the art, D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> is a slow diode and D<b>2</b> <b>116</b> is a fast diode.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> is a high-side active switch because one of its terminals is common with the positive terminal of the input voltage <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In general, the asymmetric two-switch forward converter has one active switch that has a large output capacitance and one active switch that has a low output capacitance. The active switch with the large output capacitance may either be a high-side switch or a low-side switch.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Passive switches D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>116</b> conduct in response to the voltages across them. The use of a slow diode for the passive switch D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> and a fast diode for the passive switch D<b>2</b> <b>116</b> permits the voltage V<sub>Q1 </sub><b>210</b> across active switch Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> to be reduced from a maximum of V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b> to a final value V<sub>Q1F </sub><b>315</b> at the end of interval t<sub>7 </sub><b>370</b>. In an ordinary two-switch forward converter that uses identical active switches, the final voltage V<sub>Q1F </sub><b>315</b> would remain at substantially the full value of V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The voltage on active switch Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> at the end of interval t<sub>7 </sub><b>370</b> is the final value V<sub>Q2F </sub><b>325</b>. The final value V<sub>Q2F </sub><b>325</b> is the difference between the input voltage V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b> and the final voltage V<sub>Q1F </sub><b>315</b>. The final voltage V<sub>Q1F </sub><b>315</b> is normally minimized as much as possible because the voltage V<sub>Q1F </sub><b>315</b> determines the energy in the large output capacitance C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> that will be dissipated in the MOSFET <b>106</b> when the active switches turn on again. The final voltage V<sub>Q2F </sub><b>325</b> on active switch Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> can be high without causing much difficulty because the output capacitance C<sub>OSS2 </sub><b>126</b> of Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> is much less than the output capacitance C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> of Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b>. The small output capacitance of active switch Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b> is normally unable to store enough energy to dominate the heating of active switch Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b>. Therefore, reduction of the voltage V<sub>Q1F </sub><b>315</b> to zero at the expense of increasing the voltage V<sub>Q2F </sub>to the maximum of V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b> is usually acceptable. The output capacitance of C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> is substantially greater than the output capacitance of C<sub>OSS2 </sub><b>126</b>. The net reduction in energy dissipated from C<sub>OSS1 </sub><b>108</b> and C<sub>OSS2 </sub><b>126</b> saves power, reduces cooling requirements, and raises the efficiency of the power supply.</p>

The current from the high-side passive switch D<b>1</b> <b>110</b> establishes a voltage V<sub>C3 </sub><b>540</b> on capacitor C<b>3</b> <b>530</b> between the positive terminal of the input voltage V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b> and the high-side passive switch D<b>1</b> <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The voltage V<sub>C3 </sub><b>540</b> adds to the input voltage V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b> to reduce the time required for the magnetizing current I<sub>M </sub><b>230</b> to decrease to zero in the interval t<sub>4 </sub><b>340</b>. The reduction in time for the magnetizing current I<sub>M </sub><b>230</b> to return to zero has the advantage of, for example, increasing the maximum time allowed for the interval t<sub>1 </sub><b>310</b> in a switching cycle, thereby allowing the range of control for the two-switch forward converter beyond the limitation of 50% duty ratio to be extended. The extended range of control allows the converter to provide a desired output for a wider range of input voltage V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b>. In an example that does not extend the range of input voltage V<sub>IN </sub><b>102</b>, a larger duty ratio allows lower RMS (root-mean-square) currents in the active switches Q<b>1</b> <b>104</b> and Q<b>2</b> <b>122</b>, thereby reducing conduction losses. Another added benefit can be that the voltage V<sub>C3 </sub><b>540</b> helps to discharge the output capacitance C<sub>OSS1 </sub>during time intervals t<sub>5 </sub><b>350</b> and t<sub>6 </sub><b>360</b>, which reduces the final voltage V<sub>Q1F </sub><b>315</b> on the high-side active switch Q<b>1</b> <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another example <b>600</b> of an asymmetric two-switch forward converter that adds a primary leakage inductance L<sub>LP </sub><b>605</b> to one end of the primary winding <b>130</b> of the transformer T<b>1</b> <b>128</b>. The primary leakage inductance L<sub>LP </sub><b>605</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents an inherent property of the transformer T<b>1</b> that may be augmented by a discrete inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The primary leakage inductance L<sub>LP </sub><b>605</b> stores energy from the primary current I<sub>P </sub><b>260</b>. Energy from the primary leakage inductance L<sub>LP </sub><b>605</b> helps the magnetizing inductance L<sub>M </sub><b>250</b> to charge the capacitor C<b>3</b> <b>530</b> during time intervals t<sub>3 </sub><b>330</b> and t<sub>4 </sub><b>340</b>. The resulting higher voltage on the capacitor C<b>3</b> <b>530</b> extends the recovery time of the passive switch D<b>1</b> <b>110</b>. Thus, energy from the primary inductance L<sub>LP </sub><b>605</b> also helps the magnetizing inductance L<sub>M </sub><b>250</b> to discharge the output capacitance C<sub>OSS1 </sub>during time intervals t<sub>5 </sub><b>350</b> and t<sub>6 </sub><b>360</b>.</p>
