<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a setting tool for driving fastening elements in constructional components and driven by expanding gases and including a housing, and a setting mechanism located in the housing for driving the fastening element in a constructional component and including a combustion chamber, a piston guide adjoining the combustion chamber, a bolt guide for the fastening element and adjoining the piston guide in a setting direction, and a drive piston displaceable in the piston guide for driving the fastening element received in the bolt guide and driven by expanding gases generated in the combustion chamber. The drive piston has a piston head and a piston body connectable with the piston head along an interface, with the piston head and the piston body having, respectively, in an interface region, at least one stop surface and at least one counter-stop surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the setting tools driven by expanding gases of the type discussed above, the piston head defines a piston area.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In setting tools with a comparatively small drive pressure of the expanding gases, the piston area should be significantly increased in order to provide a sufficiently large driving force. In order to prevent the increase of weight by the same amount, the piston body and the piston plate or head are formed as separate parts of different materials and which are then assembled. The piston body is formed, preferably, of a high-strength material because it directly contacts the set-in fastening element and should transmit, at a small diameter, which is substantially smaller than the head diameter, large forces.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,860,580 discloses a setting tool of the type described above and having a two-part piston in which a threaded connection provides for a fixed connection of the piston head with the piston body. The centering of the piston head with the piston body is carried out by the thread, whereas the transverse alignment of the piston head with the piston body is carried out by opposite flat or planar surfaces of the piston head and the piston body.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The drawbacks of such a piston consist in that the thread adversely influences the orthogonality between the piston head and the piston body because it is subjected to distortion upon hardening of the piston body by heat treatment. The orthogonality between the piston head and the piston body is necessary for retaining the piston in a proper setting position. The manufacturing of such piston is very expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, an object of the invention to provide a setting tool driven by expanding gases in which the orthogonality between the piston body and the piston head is insured.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to provide a setting tool with which the manufacturing of the drive piston and, thus, of the setting tool is cost-effective.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objects of the present invention, which will become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by providing in a setting tool of the type discussed above in which the at least one stop surface and the at least one counter-stop surface of the drive piston are formed by surfaces defining essentially complementary tapering regions that interface and provide orthogonal alignment of the piston body with the piston head.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Complementary tapering regions of the stop and the counter-stop surfaces insure a precise alignment of the piston body with the piston head which, in turn, insures their precise orthogonality. Further, the piston body and the piston head are easy to produce.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A secondary adjustment or even bending of the drive piston into a correct position during assembly of the setting tool is not any more necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is beneficial when the complementary tapering regions are formed as cone-shaped regions. The cone-shaped insure a backlash-free connection.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously, the stop surface, which is provided on the piston head, is formed as an inner cone, and the counter-stop surface, which is provided on the piston body, is formed as a substantially complementary outer cone. Thereby, a geometry, which is easy to produce, is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously, the stop surface and the counter-stop surface are inclined to a surface extending parallel to the piston head at an angle &#x3b1; from 10&#xb0; to 80&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another advantageous embodiment, the complementary tapering regions are formed as spherical regions. The spherical regions likewise insure a backlash-free connection.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Advantageously, the stop surface, which is provided on the piston head is formed as an inner sphere, and the counter-stop surface, which is provided on the piston body, is formed as a substantially complementary outer sphere. Thereby, a geometry, which is likewise easy to produce, is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is advantageous when the interface has thread connection elements. The thread connection elements insure that a fixed connection can be easily obtained, which provides for alignment of the piston body when the piston head and the piston body are screwed together.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The novel features of the present invention, which are considered as characteristic for the invention, are set forth in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its mode of operation, together with additional advantages and objects thereof, will be best understood from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, when ready with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A setting tool according to the present invention, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and is driven with a fuel gas or with a vaporized liquid fuel. The setting tool <b>101</b> includes a housing <b>110</b> and a setting mechanism located in the housing <b>110</b>. The setting mechanism drives a fastening element such as, e.g., a nail, a bolt, or the like in the constructional component. The setting mechanism includes, among others, a combustion chamber <b>111</b>, a piston guide <b>117</b> adjoining the combustion chamber <b>111</b>, and a drive piston <b>10</b> displaceably supported in the piston guide <b>117</b>, and bolt guide <b>116</b> for a fastening element. The fastening element is driven into a constructional component by an end of the drive piston <b>10</b> facing in the setting direction <b>140</b>. The bolt guide <b>116</b> adjoins the piston guide <b>117</b> at its end facing in the direction opposite to the setting direction. Fastening elements are stored, e.g., in a magazine <b>121</b> secured to the setting tool.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The drive piston <b>10</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is formed of two parts and has a plate-shaped piston head <b>11</b>, which extends in a plane <b>19</b> transverse to the piston axis <b>16</b>, and an elongate, extending in the direction of the piston axis <b>16</b>, piston body <b>12</b>. The piston head <b>11</b> and the piston body <b>12</b> are connected with each other along an interface <b>13</b>. To this end, the interface <b>13</b> is provided with thread means consisting of a threaded journal <b>17</b> provided on the piston body <b>12</b>, and a threaded bore <b>18</b> formed in the piston head <b>11</b>. In the piston head <b>11</b>, there is provided a stop surface <b>14</b> that is formed as an inner cone surrounding the mouth of the threaded bore <b>18</b>. A counter-stop surface <b>15</b>, which surrounds a shoulder section of the threaded journal <b>17</b>, abuts the stop surface <b>14</b>. The counter-stop surface <b>15</b> is formed as an outer cone substantially complementary to the inner cone that forms the stop surface <b>14</b>. The stop surface <b>14</b> and the counter-stop surface <b>15</b> extend, respectively, in a plane extending parallel to the plane <b>19</b>. The stop surface <b>14</b> and/or the counter-stop surface <b>15</b> are inclined at an angle &#x3b1; between 10&#xb0; and 80&#xb0; relative to the plane <b>19</b> extending parallel to the piston head <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">During the assembly of the piston <b>10</b>, the alignment of the piston body <b>12</b> relative to the piston head <b>11</b> takes place over the conical stop surface <b>14</b> and the complementary thereto, conical counter-stop surface <b>15</b>, without a need in any further adjustment. It should be understood that both the stop surface <b>14</b> and the counter-stop surface <b>15</b> can be formed as interrupted surfaces.</p>

The piston <b>10</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, differs from the piston <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only in that the stop surface <b>14</b> and the counter-stop surface <b>15</b> are formed as spherical annular surfaces. Here likewise, during the assembly of the piston <b>10</b>, the alignment of the piston body <b>12</b> relative to the piston head <b>11</b> takes place over the spherical stop surface <b>4</b> and, the complementary thereto, spherical counter-stop surface <b>15</b>, without a need in any further adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the combustion chamber <b>111</b>, there is provided ignition means. As the ignition means, e.g., a spark plug <b>114</b> can be used, which ignites an oxidation medium-fuel mixture fed into the combustion chamber <b>111</b>. The fuel may be fed in the combustion chamber <b>111</b> from a fuel tank <b>112</b> or another fuel source through a conduit <b>119</b>. A valve <b>118</b>, e.g., a mechanical or electronic metering valve, is arranged in the fuel conduit <b>119</b>. With the valve <b>118</b>, which is controlled by mechanical or electronic control means (not shown), an amount of fuel fed into the combustion chamber <b>111</b> can be controlled. In addition, pressure sensing means (not shown) such as, e.g., a pressure sensor, can be arranged in the combustion chamber <b>111</b>. With a pressure sensor, the oxidation medium-fuel mixture can be automatically ignited when the pressure in the combustion chamber <b>111</b> reaches a predetermined level. The automatic ignition of the oxidation means-fuel mixture can be effected with evaluating electronics which is connected with the pressure sensor and the ignition device <b>113</b> and which evaluates the pressure pulse generated by the pressure sensor and compares it with a set valve. In the transition region between the combustion chamber <b>111</b> and the piston guide <b>117</b>, there can be provided magnet means (not shown). The magnet means can be used for retaining the drive piston <b>10</b> with a predetermined holding force in its initial position at an end of the piston guide <b>117</b> adjacent to the combustion chamber <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The setting tool <b>101</b> is actuated, upon the bolt guide <b>116</b> having been pressed against a constructional component or another object, with a trigger switch <b>142</b> provided on the setting tool <b>101</b>. It should be noted that instead of the oxidation medium, the entire oxidation medium-fuel mixture can be pre-compressed by the compression device and be fed, in its compressed state, into the combustion chamber <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should also be pointed out that the oxidation means or the oxidation means-fuel mixture can be pre-compressed directly in the combustion chamber <b>111</b>. In this case, a storage reservoir can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Though the present invention was shown and described with references to the preferred embodiments, such are merely illustrative of the present invention and are not to be construed as a limitation thereof, and various modifications of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, not intended that the present invention be limited to disclosed embodiments or details thereof, and the present invention includes all variations and/or alternative embodiments within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
