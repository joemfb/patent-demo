<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Fluid head height and foam/gas level control apparatus associated with a primary reaction chamber of an effluent processing electrocoagulation assembly is disclosed. The apparatus includes a plurality of rotatable disks each having an orifice located therethrough toward an outer circumference of the disk. The disks are mounted in a horizontal array of openings located at an upper portion of the primary reactor chamber, the orifices communicating through the openings, height of the orifices in the chamber being selectable by rotation of the disks. Rotatable restrictor plates are mounted on the disks for selective restriction of flow through the orifice.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to effluent treatment, and, more particularly, relates to fluid level controls in electrocoagulation apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most industrial and municipal processes require water treatment facilities to treat effluents returned to the environment. Such facilities typically represent a significant investment by the business/community, and the performance of the facility (or failure thereof) can seriously impact ongoing operations financially and in terms of operational continuity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, not all effluent treatment requires the same technologies. Industrial effluents (such as is found at coal bed methane facilities or oil production sites, for example) all have different particulate, pollutant and/or biomass content inherent to both the industrial processes as well as the particular water and soil conditions found at the site. Municipal requirements would likewise vary depending on desired end-of-pipe quality and use (and again depending on the feed water present at the site).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electrocoagulation treatment in effluent treatment facilities is well known. Such treatment units must be carefully monitored during operation to avoid overflow of foams into the treated water stream or into other sensitive treatment areas. Moreover, head height control in such units is critical. Improvements directed to these issues could still be utilized. Moreover, improved treatment technologies adapted to this and other uses can always be utilized given the criticality of provision and maintenance of clean water.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This invention provides fluid head height and foam/gas level control apparatus associated with a primary reaction chamber of an effluent processing electrocoagulation assembly. The apparatus improves head height control in such assemblies and more precisely locates foam removal to thus avoid foam overflow from the assembly into the treated water stream or into other sensitive treatment areas.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The apparatus includes at least a first slidable cover located in an opening in an upper portion of the primary reactor chamber, the cover including an orifice communicating with the opening, height of the orifice in the chamber being selectable by sliding the cover. A first movable restrictor is mounted on the cover for selective restriction of flow through the orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An overall effluent processing electrocoagulation reaction chamber assembly of this invention includes a primary reaction chamber and primary treatment electrode plates mounted in the primary reaction chamber. A plurality of the covers is located in a plurality of openings in a horizontal array at an upper portion of the primary reaction chamber above the electrode plates. The covers are preferably in the form of rotatable disks each having an orifice located toward an outer circumference thereof. Each of the disks has a movable restrictor maintained thereat.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide improved fluid head height and foam/gas level control apparatus associated with a primary reaction chamber of an effluent processing electrocoagulation assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another object of this invention to provide fluid head height and foam/gas level control apparatus associated with a primary reaction chamber of an effluent processing electrocoagulation assembly that improves head height control and helps avoid foam overflow from the assembly into the treated water stream or into other sensitive treatment areas.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is still another object of this invention to provide a fluid head height and foam/gas level control apparatus associated with a primary reaction chamber of an effluent processing electrocoagulation assembly, the apparatus having at least a first slidable cover located in an opening in an upper portion of the primary reactor chamber, the cover including an orifice communicating with the opening, height of the orifice in the chamber being selectable by sliding the cover, and a first movable restrictor mounted on the cover for selective restriction of flow through the orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is yet another object of this invention to provide an effluent processing electrocoagulation reaction chamber assembly that includes a primary reaction chamber, primary treatment electrode plates mounted in the primary reaction chamber, a plurality of openings in a horizontal array at an upper portion of the primary reaction chamber and located above the electrode plates, a rotatable disk mounted in each of the openings, the rotatable disks each having an orifice located toward an outer circumference thereof, and a movable restrictor maintained at each of the disks for selective restriction of flow through the orifices.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With these and other objects in view, which will become apparent to one skilled in the art as the description proceeds, this invention resides in the novel construction, combination, and arrangement of parts substantially as hereinafter described, and more particularly defined by the appended claims, it being understood that changes in the precise embodiment of the herein disclosed invention are meant to be included as come within the scope of the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows effluent treatment apparatus (in this case a pre-treatment suite) <b>413</b>. These include pH and chemical dosing apparatus <b>801</b> and <b>802</b>, respectively, ODE/IDI membrane aeration apparatus <b>803</b>, electrocoagulation apparatus <b>805</b>, dissolved air/gas flotation <b>806</b>, vacuum introduced cyclone separation apparatus <b>807</b>, vacuum degassing <b>808</b>, lamella plate clarification <b>809</b> and sludge concentration output <b>810</b>. Additionally, eight testing nodes <b>811</b> through <b>825</b> are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The primary function of pre-treatment suite <b>413</b> is the removal or significant reduction (exceeding 90%) of colloidal matter with total suspended solids, such as polysaccharides or other slimy matter, less than about 75 nm. In addition, removal or significant reduction (by 80 to 90%) of fats, grease, oils and emulsions, and heavy metals (such as barium, strontium and others) by 60 to 99% is achievable. Finally, removal of entrained and produced gas by vacuum down to residual levels is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Regarding both ionized air/gas generation apparatus <b>804</b> and membrane aeration apparatus <b>803</b>, improved ion treatment and reactor technologies, applications and methods of use are described. This aspect of the invention relates to effluent treatment utilizing ionized air or gas and membrane aeration, and has its objects, among others, enhanced ionized gas transfer through known membrane aeration technology providing energy efficiency over conventional venturi technology. Using this technology, ionized gas transfer into feed water is further enhanced by means of a static-in-line mixing comprising, for example, a progressive single coil system or an electrically charged dual coil system made from conductive but non-sacrificial material such as synthetic graphite.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As will be seen, an integrated coil mixing system is conveniently located between a portion of the outer membrane side and the inner reactor wall of the liquid side. A gas ionization chamber is an integrated part of the membrane support body. A radioactive energy source for gas ionization may be utilized, and is directly connected to the ionization chamber thus minimizing occurrences of recombination of ion pairs prior to their diffusive transfer into the liquid phase. Transparency of the reactor's housing and coil support body allows for visual inspection of the microbubble column and is controllable through means of associated valving conveniently located on a reactor mounting panel. The reactor's ionized air input is monitored and controlled by means of an in-line oxygen sensor and controller unit. The feed quality is monitored and controlled by means of conductivity meters at the incoming feed and the outgoing treated water lines.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to affect a reasonable fallout rate of contaminants in the water after electro-coagulation, it is necessary to add a chemical polymer prior to the electro-coagulation cell. If no chemical is added, fallout rates are unacceptably long. For a full size plant, this adds a burdensome financial component with respect to chemical costs and plant footprint. Slow fallout rates translate into large tanks for increased retention times.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Ionized air is a well recognized and employed technology in the field of air purification. By creating a large number of negatively charged oxygen ions and positively charged nitrogen ion, the ions then released into the air where they attach themselves to floating particulate matter of opposing charge, heavier particles are created through charge neutralization thus allowing them to fall to the ground effectively reducing airborne contaminants. The following teaches similar approaches at apparatus <b>803</b> and <b>804</b> of pre-treatment suite <b>413</b> for agglomerating, or coagulating, waterborne contaminants which are otherwise too small or incorrectly charged for easy removal.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Most waterborne contaminants in particulate form are charged. The charge can be positive or negative, although most particles in certain post industrial effluents (such as coal bed methane water) develop a negative charge. When the particulate matter freely floats in water, they are continuously being repelled by each other, this repelling action making the particles difficult to agglomerate to form a more easily removable mass.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">By introducing a stream of negatively and positively charged ions into the water, one can effectively neutralize the particles specific charges thus allowing them to be brought into intimate contact to form more easily precipitated matter. Once the interparticle repulsive forces have been neutralized, the fallout rate in and after processing by electro-coagulation apparatus <b>805</b> will be enhanced and chemical treatment needs will be eliminated or drastically reduced. This process might also speed up and enhance the iron and manganese precipitation process as well. Finally, these ions are also very disinfective to harmful biologic components present in some feed waters presented for treatment and its holding tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Membrane aeration apparatus <b>803</b> of pre-treatment suite <b>413</b> promotes radial mixing through means of an electrically charged Dualplex-start-Coil-System (DSC) mixing system. The DSC consists of two independent, non-touching coils with an even pitch spacing twisted around the membrane. The coils are situated in the space between the outside diameter of a membrane and the inside diameter of a support body. These coils are made of non-sacrificial, but conductive material, for instance graphite or graphite coated support material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The proper non-touching spacing between the two coils is provided and secured through a thinwalled duplex-start grooved support body, made of clear nonconductive PVC. The duplex-starts in the support body are offset to each other (i.e., turned by 180&#xb0;). Pitch of each coil and groove of one inch, providing a pitch distance of half an inch between the two independent coils, suggest good performance for most applications. The coils are screwed into the support body concurrently and the support body is inserted as a cartridge into a reactor glass body tube. The outer support body diameter is sealed against the body tube (using O-rings, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">AC power is connected to the coil to provide for electrical connection away from the liquid phase. In essence this embodiment operates similar to an electrocoagulation system with non-sacrificial electrodes, the electrically charged mixing coils representing the electrodes and the pitch spacing representing the electrode C&#x2014;C distance. The operating current of the system is preferably 4 amps with a frequency converter setting of between 1 and 10 hertz.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">This unit can be employed with photo (UV) or other means of initiation of air ionization. For example, if radioactive initiated air ionization is employed, the positively charged a-particles will deflect towards the negatively charged electrical field. The frequency controlled alternating deflection of the a-particles takes place primarily within the upper portion of the ionization chamber. This alternating deflection provides additional collision potentials with the continual incoming large number of neutral air molecules, thus slowing the recombination of positive and negative ion pairs prior to exposure to the contaminated effluent.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The alternating current flow provides an enhanced distribution environment for the diffusively aerated ionized air/gas for balancing the surface charge of particles in the feed water solution thus removing or reducing the electrical repulsive charge on the particles. This hydrodynamic mixing energy, provided through the differential pressure of the flow altering coil system, generates a turbulent fluid motion environment for interparticle contacts, sometimes called orthokinetik flocculation. The interparticle contacts of charge neutralized materials (for example, colloids) now destabilizes out of the dispersion, followed by collision of destabilized particles to form aggregates. The aggregation of these particles into larger more easily settled aggregates is necessary for efficiency enhancement of following processes where separation by precipitation, sedimentation and flotation takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> show various other apparatus of treatment suite <b>413</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrating a particular arrangement thereof including the ten apparatus <b>801</b> through <b>810</b> heretofore identified configured with selected piping, flow control and instrumentation configuration. IDI inline ionizer unit <b>804</b> may be any known alpha ionizer such as the STATICMASTER series form NRD and related instrumentation. Level sight glasses <b>2101</b> and <b>2102</b> allow convenient on-site process inspection. Output from suite <b>413</b> proceeds to stage <b>415</b> including a bag filter system <b>2105</b> and belt filter system <b>2107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with this invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> and the following description illustrate the electrocoagulation apparatus and configuration in pre-treatment suite <b>413</b>. Electrocoagulation apparatus <b>805</b> operates conventionally but includes a number of unconventional features. In addition, apparatus <b>805</b> is positioned in tank <b>2111</b> (the larger of the two tanks <b>2111</b> and <b>2113</b> separated by separator plate <b>2115</b>) of lamella plate clarifier apparatus <b>809</b>. Electrocoagulation operates by the splitting off of ions from sacrificial electrodes, or utilization of non-sacrificial electrodes with native or added ions, in apparatus <b>805</b>. The ions are thus introduced into the water presented for treatment to destabilize suspended, emulsified or dissolved contaminants in the water by introduction of an electrical current. The water acts as an electric conductor in which current is carried, thus forming a hydroxide compound. The most common sacrificial electrodes utilized in such apparatus are made of iron or aluminum, the most common non-sacrificial electrodes being made of carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Present electrocoagulation art does not adequately address the mechanisms of flotation, sedimentation and the circulation effect of coagulant aggregation in the early stages as bridging flocs. In the electrocoagulation process, the partially lighter aggregated coagulants are transported to the liquid surface by their attachment onto the ascending electrolytic gas bubbles. The remaining, predominantly heavier, aggregated coagulants bridge to heavier, larger flocs and precipitate out into a sediment layer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Treatment analysis in advance of establishment of the treatment regimen determines the necessary mass quantity of matter that needs to be deposited by the sacrificial electrodes. For diagnostic real time capability, the electrocoagulation reactor described hereinafter may be equipped with selective multiple electrolytic cell choices (14 cells, for example) in the primary reactor chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the following relates to electrical apparatus for electrolytic flotation and electrochemical dosing referred to as electrocoagulation, and apparatus, configurations and methods for treating contaminated waters for selective pre-treatment and/or cleaning of the waters. Electrocoagulation presents a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for treatment of certain polluted waters or as a method for the pre-treatment of suspensions, emulsions and light sludges prior treatment with membrane technology, for instance clean up involving gas, dissolved and suspended solids removal from a hydraulic system where chemical or electrochemical dosing, coagulation, electroflotation, flocculation and sedimentation would be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Apparatus <b>805</b> of this invention allows for a variety of electrode materials to be implemented within one active electrode plate area for numerous electrolytic treatment applications. The apparatus is compact and portable for easy delivery and hookup and is used in conjunction with the other apparatus for blending air, plasma-gas and/or dissolved metal salts with the feed water. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of pumps for controlling the feed water flow and a plurality of conveniently located valves, regulators and pump controls for automated or manual control of the various functions of the apparatus <b>805</b> are provided. Apparatus <b>805</b> is integrated directly with dissolved air flotation apparatus <b>806</b> in clarifier apparatus <b>809</b>, and is further enhanced by integration with vacuum apparatus to accelerate the electroflotation of the floc-foam layer to the liquid surface of electrocoagulation reactor (together referred to herein as &#x201c;electrolytic dissolved air flotation&#x201d;&#x2014;EDAF&#x2014;treatment).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The EDAF treatment approach utilizes a modified plate electrocoagulation reactor design. Because electrocoagulation reactor <b>805</b> is an integrated part of clarifier tank <b>2111</b> of lamella apparatus <b>809</b>, shear-free sludge transfer in a compact single unit structure is provided. Vacuum enhanced electroflotation is provided through the employment of an enclosed vacuum hood <b>2117</b> above flotation chamber <b>2119</b> of flotation apparatus <b>806</b>, to speed up the flotation process and as well remove unwanted created or entrained gases via vacuum degassing apparatus <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Vacuum hood <b>2117</b> is adjustable for proximity and vacuum lift capability to optimize the electroflotation effect as well as floc-foam surface layer removal at cyclone separator apparatus <b>807</b>. Hood <b>2117</b> is mounted on outer housing <b>2121</b> holding inner reactor assembly <b>2123</b> of electrocoagulation apparatus <b>805</b>. Inner assembly <b>2123</b></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is defined by four corner posts <b>2125</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) together establishing primary reaction chamber <b>2127</b> and secondary reaction chambers <b>2129</b> and <b>2131</b> adjacent the primary chamber. The secondary chambers provide additional electrocoagulation treatment stages to optimize the overall electrocoagulation treatment on an as needed basis. Each secondary chamber includes an anode, cathode and bipolar electrode <b>2133</b>, <b>2135</b> and <b>2137</b>, respectively, held in corner post <b>2139</b> for insulating the secondary chambers as well as forming supports for insulating walls <b>2141</b> of the primary chamber. A small jet of previously clarified process water received through conduits <b>2142</b> washes electrode <b>2137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Conical integrated sludge chamber <b>2143</b> is formed below primary reaction chamber <b>2127</b> and vacuum/flotation chamber <b>2119</b> of flotation apparatus <b>806</b> is formed below chamber <b>2127</b>. Primary electrode plates (either sacrificial or, preferably, non-sacrificial) are held at a plurality of electrode positioners <b>2145</b> at opposed chamber walls. This electrode framework allows rapid electrode interchangeability and/or electrode set ups specially adapted to site circumstances. For example, a composite electrode setup with electrodes of different materials combined within a single electrode stack could be utilized for treatment of complex feed waters. Bipolar electrodes <b>2137</b> of secondary chambers <b>2129</b> and <b>2131</b> are readily accessible for maintenance purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Integrated sludge chamber <b>2143</b> provides buoyancy and/or electromechanically actuated sludge transfer via a sludge cone valve <b>2149</b>. Sludge is transferred from sludge chamber <b>2143</b> into the fluid bed of the sludge holding/disposal chamber <b>810</b> at lamella clarifier tank <b>2111</b> of clarifier apparatus <b>809</b>, thus minimizing a shear introducing gradient to the delicate floc structure within the sedimentated electrocoagulation sludge. This eliminates or greatly reduces the need for expensive floc polymers and/or coagulants as well as reducing energy requirements for the floc rebuilding process. A compound sludge chamber angle of repose of 35&#xb0; for hydroxide sludge is employed thus, in conjunction with a matching sludge cone release valve, preventing sludge build up within the chamber and expediting sludge release.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Float <b>2150</b> has a tap and valve arrangement <b>2153</b> at a suction line provided to allow weight adjustment by water addition to the float column or removal therefrom for trimming buoyancy of the float (wastewater removed is sent to cyclone unit <b>2155</b> to drain). Float <b>2150</b> is balanced across pivot (P) against valve <b>2149</b> to actuate the valve actuating arm <b>2156</b> and open the valve when the weight of solids content in chamber <b>2143</b> overcomes the buoyancy of float <b>2150</b>. The resultant flush continues until head height equalizes and valve <b>2149</b> closes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A variable discharge head and distribution system may be employed to minimize surface floc-foam layer carry over from the primary chamber and provide suitable discharge distribution geometry into secondary electrocoagulation chamber(s), thus minimizing channeling and ensuring effective electrocoagulation treatment in the secondary electrocoagulation. Secondary electrocoagulation flow control may be provided through discharge disks and dampener adjustment to ascertain proper flow distribution, retention time and minimize channeling, providing an effective secondary and efficient overall electrocoagulation treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Multiple flat bar electrodes <b>2203</b> forming multiple electrode stacks <b>2205</b> (only one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are employed. These standard vertical stacks consist of electrode bars <b>2203</b> arranged one on top of another. Horizontal stacks <b>2205</b> may be arranged with electrode bars <b>2203</b> in a side by side arrangement (instead on atop one another) and secured by a top contactor clip which also provides current transfer from one stack <b>2205</b> to the next. The vertical multi-flat bar stack <b>2205</b> arrangement is more suitable to maximize sacrificial electrode life. The sacrifice of electrode material is more pronounced on the leading edge/area of the ascending feed water flow in a downward or upward directed parabolic shape. The leading edge problem can be minimized by substituting the bottom bar with a nonmetallic, but conductive graphite bar. If unacceptable, a new sacrificial bottom bar needs to be added from time to time between whole stack replacements.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The vertical multi-flat bar option provides a mechanism for active electrode area reduction without sacrificing reactor retention time by insertion of dielectric/nonconductive plate area (PVC or CPVC) into the vertical stack electrode structure in place of active electrode bar(s). This allows varying of the active surface area to volume ratio to find the optimum ratio for a particular application. This variable ratio option is an important feature in establishing scale-up of this parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Required electrical field strength (dependent upon concentration levels and contaminant types in the feed water) can be manipulated by varying electrode C&#x2014;C spacing for treatment optimization. Primary electrocoagulation facilities at <b>2127</b> are powered with a variably applied amperage in the range of 0.1 to 60 amps. With electrode bars set in series connection mode, the same current flows through all the electrodes, and voltage is allowed to vary as electrocoagulation treatment progresses over time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A crossflow electrode flushing capability option through valve <b>2151</b> is preferably provided to create a turbulent flow regime with the ascending water flow in primary electrocoagulation reactor chamber <b>2127</b> and with the descending flow within the secondary electrocoagulation reactor chambers <b>2129</b> and <b>2131</b>. Flow direction of flush water jetting is staggered crosswise and perpendicular to the electrocoagulation process water flow over the electrode plates. The directed turbulent flow continually washes the sides of the electrodes and prevents or significantly retards the build-up of impermeable oxide layers (passive) on the cathode as well as deterioration of the anode due to oxidation. This can be done instead of polarity switching or, in a fine regulated mode, in addition to polarity switching in severe scaling situations or in applications that contain heavy amounts of grease or oils.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A small jet of previously clarified and pressurized process water flow is constantly or time sequentially introduced into the electrocoagulation process water flow through a plurality small ( 1/32&#x2033;, for example) holes drilled into electrode positioners <b>2145</b> at primary electrocoagulation reactor chamber <b>2127</b>. Secondary electrocoagulation reactor chambers <b>2129</b> and <b>2131</b> have a plurality of similar holes <b>2142</b> drilled into spaces at insulating corner post <b>2139</b> between and close to the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The three phase separation and removal areas of electrocoagulation reactor apparatus <b>805</b> operates as a standard parallel electrode unit (in a fluidized bed configuration a different arrangement would be applied). In phase one, light flotation solids in,the floc-foam, gas (H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>), and oil and grease layers are separated at the liquid surface and removed by the adjustable vacuum at vacuum chamber <b>2119</b>. In phase two, the semi-clarified effluent of the primary electrocoagulation treated water is separated from underneath the floc-foam surface layer at chamber <b>2127</b> and is removed or transferred through adjustable disk head control devices into the secondary electrocoagulation reactor chambers <b>2129</b>/<b>2131</b>. It is here either optionally treated or directly discharged into the settling portion of the lamella clarifier tank <b>2111</b> to develop clarity prior to discharge from the lamella separator <b>2115</b> overflow into the clear flow catch tank <b>2113</b>. In phase three, the solids precipitate out into integrated primary electrocoagulation sludge chamber <b>2143</b>, proceeding through the normal sedimentation process mechanics.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When operating electrocoagulation apparatus <b>805</b> with non-sacrificial electrodes, for instance with electrically conductive synthetic graphite electrodes, the necessary positively charged ions for maintaining the electrocoagulation process are partially provided by the feed water itself. The remaining part of the required positively charged ions are added in form of metallic ions such as Al+, Ca+, Fe+ and Mg+ salts. For an enhanced electron migration, the electrocoagulation process should be operated within the acidic range through chemical dosing with hydrochloric (HCl), sulfuric (HS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) or phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). Utilization of synthetic graphite electrodes avoids the consumption, replacement and operating down-time associated with conventional sacrificial electrodes, and reduces energy and maintenance costs. Moreover, metallic salts are less expensive than the refined, finished, sawcut and otherwise machined or fabricated sacrificial metal electrode plates. Varying the voltage controls the rate of electrochemical activity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">To facilitate effluent feed into chamber <b>2127</b>, feed controller assembly <b>2164</b> is provided (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). A longitudinal tube <b>2165</b> of assembly <b>2164</b> is connected with effluent feed line <b>2166</b> and has plural elongated slots <b>2167</b> extending the length thereof (substantially the entire length of chamber <b>2127</b>). Tube <b>2165</b> turns (for net feed area adjustment) inside stationary 1-&#xbc;&#x2033; base pipe <b>2169</b> having co-located elongated slots <b>2171</b> formed therealong. Turn adjustment of tube <b>2165</b> thus defines net opening slot area defined by the selected overlap or slots <b>2167</b> and <b>2171</b>, and thereby distributes the whole feed through the entire length of primary electrocoagulation reactor chamber <b>2127</b> (thus avoiding channeling and other distribution problems).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To facilitate foam/gas level control and discharge from inner reactor assembly <b>2123</b>, and control primary fluid head level height in the reactor assembly, apparatus <b>2173</b> is provided for primary fluid head height level and foam/gas level control in electrocoagulation unit <b>805</b>'s primary reactor chamber <b>2127</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Selectively positionable orifices <b>2175</b> of discharge weir disks <b>2177</b> are provided for flow control from chamber <b>2127</b> or into secondary chambers <b>2129</b> and/or <b>2131</b> (other shapes and slidable covers or arrangements could be utilized as may be appreciated from this disclosure). To prevent surface foam carry over into the discharge or secondary electrocoagulation treatment chambers, a positive fluid head above the center of these orifices needs to be maintained at all times. Disks <b>2177</b> are mounted in opening through the walls of chamber <b>2127</b>. Orifices <b>2175</b> are positioned through disks <b>2177</b> toward the outer circumference thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Head height is controlled by rotation of disks <b>2177</b> to locate fluid transfer orifices <b>2175</b> at selected positions (heights). The head height in reactor chamber <b>2127</b> is higher than the surrounding fluid levels in the secondary chambers <b>2129</b> and <b>2131</b> and in the clarifier tank <b>2111</b>. This higher level is instrumental in securing proper flushing of sedimented solids out of the sludge chamber during automated flushing cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Variable foam level control is achieved by fine adjustment of the areas of orifices <b>2175</b> in disks <b>2177</b> utilizing rotatable flow restrictor plate (or cover) <b>2179</b> pivotably mounted on disks <b>2177</b>. Covers <b>2179</b> are utilized for selectively restricting flow through orifices <b>2175</b>. In this way, fluid level height within primary chamber <b>2127</b> is controlled well above the transfer orifices' height, thereby avoiding transfer of foam on top of the chamber fluid through orifices <b>2175</b>. Thus, foam and entrained oil, grease and other surface scum in primary chamber <b>2127</b> is retained in chamber <b>2127</b> for vacuum evacuation along with free gases as disclosed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Through simple contact plunger manipulation at an easily accessible multinode terminal bar or bars adjacent the electrodes (either manual or automated contact manipulation could be deployed), electrocoagulation reactor operating circuitry can be arranged for different modes of operation. For parallel operation, contact plungers are provided at each electrode node at a terminal bar. This arrangement of the electrocoagulation reactor circuitry provides parallel connection using monopolar electrodes. In this mode, the electric current is divided between all of the electrodes in relation to the resistance of the individual cells. The same voltage is present in all of the contact plungers. Varying the current controls the rate of electrochemical activity</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For series operation, one contact plunger remains active at the terminal bar furthest from the source power connections. Insulated jumpers connect the nodes. In this mode of operation the contactor terminal bar provides series connection for the monopolar electrodes in the electrocoagulation reactor. In series cell arrangements, a higher potential difference is required for a given current to flow, because of higher cumulative resistance. The same current would, however, flow through all the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a parallel, bipolar configuration (as shown in the secondary chambers <b>2129</b> and <b>2131</b>, but which could be applied primarily), one contact plunger at both contactor terminal bars remains, the one furthest from the source power connections. Only the monopolar anode and cathode electrodes are connected to the electrical power connections. In this mode, bipolar electrodes with cells in parallel are used. The bipolar electrodes are placed between the two parallel anode/cathode electrodes without any electrical connections. When an electric current is passed through the two electrodes, the neutral sides of the conductive plate of the bipolar electrodes will be transformed to charged sides, which have opposite charge compared to the parallel side beside it. This cell arrangement provides, where applicable, a desirable testing platform for a full scale unit application. Its simple set-up and maintenance can lower the overall electrocoagulation operating cost.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A mixed parallel and series configuration could be provided, providing individual mixed cell circuitry configurations. For instance, in a fourteen cell reactor, half the cells could be connected in a series circuitry and the remaining seven cells connected in parallel, either as monopolar, bipolar or in mixed mode. This option can be used as a diagnostic tool when different amperages are needed for different electrode materials within the primary electrocoagulation reactor for specific treatment situations.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">These parallel or series power connection choices are implemented by spring loaded contactor bars with integrated connection interchangeability (plungers). DC or AC operating power options with variable current density controls are implementable for control of electrochemical dosing and electrolytic bubble density production for sacrificial electrodes, as well as regulating the required transport current for the required added positively charged ions when nonmetallic and non-sacrificial electrodes are employed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Controlled polarity switching for DC power implementations is provided to prevent or minimize oxide build up as well as hydrogen polarization. A vector frequency controller for the AC power option provides for frequency control below 60 Hertz to prevent disaggregation of agglomerated particles. To accommodate rapid changes of electrodes and/or customization of electrode setups, main power distribution through removable, quick release, swing away main contactor bars, providing as well for rapid change from parallel to series power connection, is utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Regarding pre-treatment suite stages <b>411</b> and <b>413</b>, zeta potential is an important part of the electrokinetic phenomena of interaction between particles in suspension. The zeta potential is the electrokinetic potential of a suspended particle as determined by its electrophoretic mobility. This electric potential causes colloidal particles to repel each other and stay in suspension. The zeta potential is a measurement of the overall charge characteristic of the suspended particles in the water. The kind and magnitude of the electrical charge depends on the surface potential of the particles, or the zeta potential. A negative zeta potential indicates that the water contains free negatively charged suspended solids (common in many treatment feed waters) that are stabilized and therefore more likely to stay in solution.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A neutral zeta potential indicates that the suspended solids do not carry a charge to assist in their electrical repulsion of each other. They are more likely to destabilize and coagulate into larger particulate groups and fall out of solution, and therefore being removed as part of the pre-treatment. The importance of the zeta potential rests on the fact that it can be measured experimentally and in many cases serves as a good approximation of the unmeasurable surface potential of the colloidal particle, since there is a fairly immobile layer of counter ions that sticks tightly to the surface of the particle. Treatment diagnostics herein thus uses the zeta potential measurement to gauge coagulant requirements (if any), and can be adapted for automated adjustment of an injected cationic (positively charged) coagulant such as reverse osmosis Quest 6000, which could be used in pre-treatment stage <b>411</b>, to achieve a neutral zeta potential upstream of pre-treatment stage <b>413</b>. Thus utilized, suspended solids would be more likely to fall out of solution into <b>2111</b> of clarifier <b>809</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Filtration stage <b>415</b> (step 7) makes use conventional know bag filter systems <b>2105</b> and or belt filtration systems <b>2107</b> (such as the Roll-A-Filter or Lazy Filter fabric media systems produced by SERFILCO.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Vacuum introduced cyclone separation apparatus <b>807</b> of suite <b>413</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) utilizes a conventional cyclone unit or units <b>2155</b> and <b>2157</b> connected for vacuum inducement apparatus <b>808</b> and hood <b>2117</b> and outlet for foam collection through filters <b>2159</b> and <b>2161</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the functions of vacuum inducement apparatus <b>808</b> and hood <b>2117</b> for vacuum evacuation of foam/gas retained in reactor chamber <b>2127</b> of electrocoagulation unit <b>805</b>. Height adjustable vacuum nozzle device <b>2601</b> is located in flotation chamber <b>2119</b> and is mounted through vacuum hood <b>2117</b> (preferably made of clear LEXAN). Nozzle device <b>2601</b> is provided with vacuum suction from either a vacuum pump or venturi arrangement. Suction inline cyclone unit <b>2155</b> separates the major portion of the wet surface foam from the gas phase.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Nozzle device <b>2601</b> includes nozzle body <b>2603</b> and a rotatable inlet port shroud <b>2605</b> mounted at the end of body <b>2603</b>. Vacuum stem pipe <b>2607</b> has a length selected to position nozzle body <b>2603</b> below or partly below fluid level. Shroud <b>2605</b> is adjustable so that foam intake slots <b>2609</b> are located in the foam layer and above the fluid level thus avoiding vacuum intake of fluid while allowing evacuation of the foam layer between the electrode plate and the area with primary chamber <b>2127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Adjustable vacuum relief valve <b>2610</b> is set appropriately to avoid damage to the unit. A suction line includes adjustable valve <b>2153</b> to trim the level in float <b>2150</b> and collected foam is sent to cyclone unit <b>2155</b> though port <b>2611</b>. Vacuum level is controlled at adjustment valve <b>2613</b>. Excess air from aeration processing at membrane aeration apparatus <b>803</b> is received though port <b>2615</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Air (from ionized air/gas generation apparatus <b>804</b> and/or membrane aeration apparatus <b>803</b>) dissolved into the fluid entering unit <b>805</b> diminishes the solids carrying capacity of fluid in unit <b>805</b>, thus expediting the precipitation of solids from the fluid and enhancing foam creation floating the lighter solids and oils to the surface for evacuation.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As may be appreciated from the foregoing, improved fluid head height and foam/gas level control apparatus associated with a primary reaction chamber of an effluent processing electrocoagulation assembly are provided. The apparatus improves head height control in such assemblies and more precisely locates foam removal to thus avoid foam overflow from the assembly into the treated water stream or into other sensitive treatment areas.</p>
