<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a circuit device which improves the heat dissipation of a resin package, and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As one example of a conventional method of manufacturing a circuit device, the following manufacturing method has been known. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a circuit board <b>71</b> made of a metal substrate such as an Al substrate is prepared, and an insulative resin layer <b>72</b> and a conductive pattern <b>73</b> are formed on an upper surface of the circuit board <b>71</b>. Further, circuit elements <b>74</b> and leads <b>75</b> are electrically connected to the top of the conductive pattern <b>73</b> to form a hybrid integrated circuit on the circuit board <b>71</b>. Then, the circuit board <b>71</b> is placed in a cavity <b>77</b> of a resin encapsulation mold <b>76</b>, and the leads <b>75</b> are clamped between an upper mold half <b>78</b> and a lower mold half <b>79</b>. Thus, the circuit board <b>71</b> is fixed in the cavity <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, resin is injected into the cavity <b>77</b> through a gate portion <b>80</b> of the resin encapsulation mold <b>76</b>. At this time, as indicated by an arrow <b>81</b>, the injected resin collides against a side surface of the circuit board <b>71</b> first. The resin flows to the upper and lower surface sides of the circuit board <b>71</b> as indicated by arrows <b>81</b>A and <b>81</b>B. Further, a curved surface <b>82</b> is disposed at an edge portion of the lower surface of the circuit board <b>71</b>, and therefore the resin is allowed to efficiently flow to the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>71</b>. Although the thickness of a resin encapsulant under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>71</b> is, for example, approximately 0.5 mm, the aforementioned resin injecting method enables the narrow gap to be filled with the resin. This technology is described for instance in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2003-17515 (pages 6 to 9, and FIGS. 8 and 9).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, as one example of a conventional circuit device, the following structure has been known. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in a circuit device <b>91</b>, a hybrid integrated circuit including a conductive pattern <b>93</b> and circuit elements <b>94</b> is constructed on an upper surface of a circuit board <b>92</b>, and the upper, side, and lower surfaces of the circuit board <b>92</b> are integrally covered with a resin encapsulant <b>95</b>. Further, the resin encapsulant <b>95</b> includes a first resin encapsulant <b>95</b>A formed by transfer molding and a second resin encapsulant <b>95</b>B formed by melting a solid resin sheet. It should be noted that as shown in the drawing, from side surfaces of the resin encapsulant <b>95</b>, leads <b>96</b> electrically connected to the conductive pattern <b>93</b> on the upper surface of the circuit board <b>92</b> are led out of the resin encapsulant <b>95</b>. This technology is described for instance in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2010-67852 (pages 4 to 10, and FIGS. 1 to 4).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">First, in the manufacturing method described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the resin injected through the gate portion <b>80</b> of the resin encapsulation mold <b>76</b> collides against a side surface of the circuit board <b>71</b>, and the utilization of the curved surface <b>82</b> formed in the circuit board <b>71</b> makes it easy to fill a narrow region under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>71</b> with the resin. Further, to prevent the formation of an incompletely filled region in the narrow region under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>71</b>, a width enough to allow the flow of the resin is needed. Thus, there is the problem that it is difficult to realize a reduction in the thickness of the resin encapsulant under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>71</b>, and to improve the heat dissipation from the resin encapsulant.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, conceivable ways to solve this problem of heat dissipation include increasing the filler content in resin for encapsulation and increasing the particle size of the filler. However, increasing the filler content or increasing the particle size thereof causes another problem that the flowability of the resin deteriorates to make an incompletely filled region more likely to be formed under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>71</b>. Furthermore, with regard to the material and shape of the filler used, manufacturing methods in which all the surfaces of the circuit board <b>71</b> are integrally encapsulated in a single type of resin also have problems such as damage to circuit elements and breakage of fine metal wires, thus having the problem that the material and shape thereof are limited.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Next, in the circuit device <b>91</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, though an incompletely filled region is prevented from being formed under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>92</b>, and a reduction in the thickness of the resin encapsulant is realized, no disclosure is made with regard to a structure for further improving heat dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, a region indicated by a circle <b>97</b> represents a polymerized region of the first resin encapsulant <b>95</b>A and the second resin encapsulant <b>95</b>B. As shown in the drawing, the second resin encapsulant <b>95</b>B is formed to extend to the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>92</b> to such an extent to cover a lower end portion of the circuit board <b>92</b>. Further, the polymerized region is prone to have a lower withstand voltage characteristic than single-material regions of the respective first and second resin encapsulants <b>95</b>A and <b>95</b>B. Accordingly, there is the problem that the circuit board <b>92</b> is short-circuited through the polymerized region when the polymerized region is located under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>92</b> or on lower portions of the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, if a reduction in the thickness of the second resin encapsulant <b>95</b>B is realized to improve the heat dissipation of the circuit device <b>91</b>, the percentage of the film thickness of the first resin encapsulant <b>95</b>A to the thickness of the entire resin encapsulant <b>95</b> increases. Accordingly, there is the problem that the circuit board <b>92</b> is prone to warpage due to the shrinkage force of first resin encapsulant when the first resin encapsulant <b>95</b>A is thermally cured in the resin encapsulation mold.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned circumstances. A circuit device of the present invention is a circuit device including a circuit board, a conductive pattern provided on the side of one main surface of the circuit board, a circuit element fixed on the conductive pattern, and a resin encapsulant covering the circuit board. The circuit board has the one main surface, other main surface opposite to the one main surface, and a side surface located between the one main surface and the other main surface. The resin encapsulant includes a first resin encapsulant covering at least the side of the one main surface of the circuit board and part of the side surface thereof and a second resin encapsulant covering at least the side of the other main surface of the circuit board and part of the side surface thereof. A polymerized region of the first resin encapsulant and the second resin encapsulant is located to extend beside the side surface of the circuit board, and a top portion of the polymerized region is located at a position lower than the side of an upper surface of the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, a method of manufacturing a circuit device of the present invention is a method of manufacturing a circuit device in which a circuit board having a circuit element disposed on the side of one main surface thereof is placed in a resin encapsulation mold and in which a first encapsulating resin is injected into a cavity of the resin encapsulation mold to form a resin encapsulant. The method includes the steps of preparing a resin sheet formed by pressing a powdery resin material containing a thermosetting resin and placing the resin sheet in the cavity of the resin encapsulation mold so that the circuit board may be mounted on the resin sheet, and forming the resin encapsulant in such a manner that, the second encapsulating resin covers the side of other main surface of the circuit board, which is opposite to the one main surface, and part of a side surface of the circuit board, which is located between the one main surface and the other main surface, and the first encapsulating resin injected into the cavity covers the side of the one main surface of the circuit board and part of the side surface of the circuit board, while the first encapsulating resin and the second encapsulating resin are polymerized beside the side surface.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a perspective view of a circuit device <b>1</b>. In the circuit device <b>1</b>, a hybrid integrated circuit including a conductive pattern <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) and circuit elements is constructed on an upper surface of a circuit board <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) in a resin encapsulant <b>2</b>, and leads <b>3</b> connected to this circuit are led out of the resin encapsulant <b>2</b>. Further, the upper, side, and lower surfaces of the circuit board <b>4</b> are covered with the resin encapsulant <b>2</b> made of a thermosetting resin.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the circuit board <b>4</b> is a substrate made of metal such as aluminum or copper, and has, for example, a shape in which length&#xd7;width&#xd7;thickness=approximately 61 mm&#xd7;42.5 mm&#xd7;1.5 mm. Here, a material other than metal may be employed as the material of the circuit board <b>4</b>. For example, a ceramic or a resin material may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An insulating layer <b>5</b> is formed to cover the entire region of a surface of the circuit board <b>4</b>. The insulating layer <b>5</b> is made of an epoxy resin highly filled with filler. Further, the conductive pattern <b>6</b> is formed such that a predetermined circuit is realized on the upper surface of the insulating layer <b>5</b>. The conductive pattern <b>6</b> is made of a metal film of, for example, copper or the like, and the thickness thereof is approximately 50 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A semiconductor element <b>7</b> and a chip element <b>8</b> constituting the circuit elements are fixed at predetermined positions on the conductive pattern <b>6</b> with an adhesive <b>9</b> such as solder. Further, the semiconductor element <b>7</b> and the conductive pattern <b>6</b> are connected through fine metal wires <b>10</b>. Here, a transistor, an LSI chip, a diode, or the like is employed as the semiconductor element <b>7</b>. A chip resistor, a chip capacitor, or the like is employed as the chip element <b>8</b>. It should be noted that as shown in the drawing, a heat sink may be disposed between the semiconductor element <b>7</b> and the conductive pattern <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The leads <b>3</b> are fixed to pads <b>11</b> provided in a peripheral portion of the circuit board <b>4</b>, and function as external connection terminals through which input signals and output signals pass. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a large number of leads <b>3</b> are disposed along two opposite side edges of the circuit board <b>4</b> in the longitudinal direction. It should be noted that the pads <b>11</b> constitute part of the conductive pattern <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The resin encapsulant <b>2</b> includes a first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A and a second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B. A region indicated by circles <b>12</b> is a polymerized region (region in which resins are mixed and in which sufficient bonding strength can be obtained) of the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A and the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B, and the resin encapsulants <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B are integrated in this region. This polymerized region is a region in which a withstand voltage characteristic tends to be slightly lower than a region in which the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A or the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is singly formed. Further, in the case where this polymerized region is located on the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> and in the vicinities of lower end portions of the side surfaces thereof, and where the circuit device <b>1</b> is mounted on the upper surface of a heat sink, the circuit board <b>4</b> and the heat sink are short-circuited through this polymerized region.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, in this embodiment, this polymerized region is located above the centers of the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Thus, the circuit board <b>4</b> is prevented from being short-circuited to external members through this polymerized region. Moreover, as indicated by the circles <b>12</b>, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B on the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>4</b> is cured to protrude toward the upper surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Further, the size and thickness of a resin sheet <b>13</b> are adjusted so that a top portion <b>12</b>A of the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B may be lower than the upper surface (including the surface of the insulating layer <b>5</b>) of the circuit board <b>4</b>. This structure prevents the resin constituting the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B from moving around to the upper surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b>, and prevents the moisture resistance on the upper surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> from being deteriorated by alumina contained in the resin. Further details will be described later. Moreover, the size and shape of alumina prevent damage to the circuit elements and breakage and the like of fine metal wires.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A is formed by injecting melted resin into a cavity of a resin encapsulation mold. The first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A covers the circuit elements such as the semiconductor element <b>7</b>, connecting portions of the leads <b>3</b>, and the upper surface and part (upper portion of the circuit board <b>4</b>) of the side surface of the circuit board <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">On the other hand, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is formed by melting the resin sheet <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) placed under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b>. The second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B covers the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b>, and further covers to upper portions, which are indicated by the circles <b>12</b>, of the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Further, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b> has a thickness T<b>1</b> of, for example, not less than 0.1 mm nor more than 0.3 mm to form a very thin film. Moreover, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B at the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>4</b> also has a thickness T<b>2</b> of, for example, not more than 1.0 mm to form a thin film. Since the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B contains alumina, which has excellent thermal conductivity, and has small thicknesses T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> to form a thin film, the thermal resistance in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is reduced. Further details will be described later. Further, heat radiated from the circuit elements such as the semiconductor element <b>7</b> is favorably radiated outside the circuit device <b>1</b> through the circuit board <b>4</b> and the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is formed in the shape of a sheet by molding a granular, powdered resin having a thermosetting resin as the main ingredient thereof by compression molding (tableting). An epoxy resin, ortho-cresol novolac/biphenyl, dicyclopentadiene, or the like is employed as the powdered resin. Further, filler is mixed in the powdered resin. With regard to the type of the filler, alumina is employed. Crystalline silica, crushed silica, fused silica, or silicon nitride may be employed to be mixed with alumina.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The two-dimensional size (L<b>1</b>&#xd7;L<b>2</b>) of the resin sheet <b>13</b> depends on the type of the circuit device <b>1</b> in which the resin sheet <b>13</b> is used. The resin sheet <b>13</b> has a size similar to that of the circuit board <b>4</b> to be used or is slightly larger than the circuit board <b>4</b>. On the other hand, the thickness T<b>3</b> of the resin sheet <b>13</b> is, for example, not less than 0.1 mm nor more than 0.8 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is made of a powdered resin <b>14</b> including a large number of particles. This powdered resin <b>14</b> is made of a thermosetting resin, such as an epoxy resin, which has an additive such as filler added thereto. The diameter of each particle of the powdered resin <b>14</b> is, for example, not more than 1.0 mm. Further, in the resin sheet <b>13</b>, the packing fraction (the fraction of the space occupied by the powdered resin <b>14</b> in the total volume of the resin sheet <b>13</b>) of the powdered resin <b>14</b> is not less than 99%. Thus increasing the packing fraction of the resin sheet <b>13</b> reduces the occurrence of voids in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B formed by the melting of the resin sheet <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described previously, first, the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A is formed by injecting melted resin into the cavity of the resin encapsulation mold. Further, it is necessary to prevent the hard filler contained in the resin from colliding against the circuit elements and the fine metal wires at the time of resin injection and causing damage to the circuit elements and wire sweep and breakage of the fine metal wires. Accordingly, spherical filler is used as the filler contained in the resin which forms the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A, and the particle size thereof is up to approximately 75 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A mainly covers the upper surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b>, and is required to have moisture resistance for the purposes such as the prevention of corrosion of the fine metal wires rather than heat dissipation. Accordingly, silica, which has excellent moisture resistance, is used as the filler. Since the materials cost of silica is inexpensive compared to that of alumina, materials cost is reduced while ensuring the moisture resistance of the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A. It should be noted that in the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A, since importance is placed on moisture resistance, the filler content can also be reduced. In this case, the hard filler less frequently collides against the circuit elements and the fine metal wires at the time of resin injection. Thus, damage to circuit elements and the like are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is formed by melting the resin sheet <b>13</b>. The circuit board <b>4</b> sinks into the resin of the melted resin sheet <b>13</b>, causing the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B to cover the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Further details will be described later. In other words, unlike the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A, the resin forming the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B does not need to flow through a gap of, for example, approximately 0.3 mm between the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b> and an inner wall of a lower mold half <b>22</b>. Accordingly, filler having a particle size of up to approximately 150 &#x3bc;m is used as the filler contained in the resin forming the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B. In other words, in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B, since filler having a larger particle size than that of the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A is used, the thermal resistance in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is greatly reduced, and heat dissipation from the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> is greatly improved. It should be noted that since the resin forming the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B hardly flows at all as described previously, the entire region of the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is relatively uniformly filled with the filler. This structure makes the thermal resistance of the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B uniform over the entire region thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is intended to mainly cover from the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> to an upper portion of the side surfaces thereof, and is formed not to move around to the upper surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Accordingly, as described previously, no consideration needs to be given to problems such as damage to the circuit elements and breakage of the fine metal wires, and filler having a polygonal shape such as crystalline filler or crushed filler is used as the filler. Since the filler shape is a polygonal shape, the surface area of the filler increases, the contact area between the filler and the resin increases, thermal conductivity through the filler becomes favorable, and the thermal resistance in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is greatly reduced. This structure realizes excellent heat dissipation not only from the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> but also from the side surface side thereof in the circuit device <b>1</b>, and greatly improves the total heat dissipation of the circuit device <b>1</b>. It should be noted that increasing the amount of the filler contained in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B to an amount larger than that of the filler contained in the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A also reduces the thermal resistance in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is required to have heat dissipation rather than moisture resistance. Thus, alumina, which has an excellent thermal conductivity of 2.1 W/m&#xb7;K, is used as the filler contained in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B. Since the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B contains alumina, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B becomes porous to exhibit high moisture absorption. However, this is not particularly a problem because circuit elements, fine metal wires, and the like are not disposed on the lower surface side and side surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b>. It should be noted that as described previously, as the filler contained in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B, crystalline silica, crushed silica, fused silica, or silicon nitride may be used to be mixed with alumina.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described previously, alumina, which has an excellent thermal conductivity, is used in the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B. Alumina having a polygonal shape such as crystalline alumina or crushed alumina is used. Accordingly, disposing the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B such that the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>4</b> are covered as high as possible under conditions in which the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B does not move around to the upper surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b>, solves the aforementioned problem of short circuits, and improves the heat dissipation of the circuit device <b>1</b>. In other words, the range of the side surfaces of the circuit board <b>4</b> which is covered with the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is adjusted in a range in which the moisture resistance of the upper surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> can be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that though a description has been made in this embodiment for the case where the resin sheet <b>13</b> placed under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b> is melted and thermally cured to form the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B, the present invention is not limited to this case. For example, similar to the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B may be formed by other manufacturing method such as the injection of resin into a resin encapsulation mold or potting. In other words, as described previously, it is enough to reduce the thermal resistance of the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B and to improve heat dissipation from the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> and the side surface side thereof. Other various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, a method of manufacturing a circuit device according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> are cross-sectional views for explaining a state in which a circuit board is placed in a resin encapsulation mold. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are cross-sectional views for explaining a state in which resin is injected into the resin encapsulation mold. It should be noted that in this embodiment, since a method of manufacturing the circuit device described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2B</figref> will be described, the same components are denoted by the same reference numerals, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2B</figref> are appropriately referenced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, first, the circuit board <b>4</b> is prepared, and the insulating layer <b>5</b> is formed on the circuit board <b>4</b>. By attaching a metal film of, for example, copper to the upper surface of the insulating layer <b>5</b> and etching the metal film into a desired pattern, the conductive pattern <b>6</b> and the pads <b>11</b> are formed on the circuit board <b>4</b>. Further, a large number of semiconductor elements <b>7</b> and chip elements <b>8</b> are fixed at desired positions on the conductive pattern <b>6</b>, and the leads <b>3</b> are fixed on the pads <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is mounted on the upper surface of the inner wall of the lower mold half <b>22</b> of the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b>, and then the circuit board <b>4</b> is mounted on the upper surface of this resin sheet <b>13</b>. Further, an upper mold half <b>23</b> and the lower mold half <b>22</b> are brought into contact with each other to clamp the leads <b>3</b> between the upper and lower mold halves <b>23</b> and <b>22</b>. Thus, the position of the circuit board <b>4</b> is fixed in a cavity <b>24</b>. It should be noted that at a stage prior to heat treatment after the placement in the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b>, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is in a solid state obtained by molding a granular thermosetting resin by compression molding as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the thickness T<b>3</b> of the resin sheet <b>13</b> is, for example, approximately 0.8 mm. Thus, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is formed to have a thickness larger than the thickness T<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) of the resin encapsulant <b>2</b> covering the lower surface side of the circuit board <b>4</b> of the circuit device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, as described previously, the circuit board <b>4</b> in the cavity <b>24</b> comes into a state in which the leads <b>3</b> are clamped between the upper and lower mold halves <b>23</b> and <b>22</b>, and in which the position of the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b> is fixed at a position separated from the upper surface of the inner wall of the lower mold half <b>22</b> by T<b>1</b>. Accordingly, when the leads <b>3</b> are clamped by the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b> in a state in which the circuit board <b>4</b> is mounted on the upper surface of the resin sheet <b>13</b>, the leads <b>3</b> are elastically deformed as indicated by a circle <b>25</b>. Further, the circuit board <b>4</b> presses the resin sheet <b>13</b> against the lower mold half <b>22</b> to bring the resin sheet <b>13</b> into a fixed state.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b> is equipped with a heater system (not shown), and the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b> is heated by the heater system to a temperature (e.g., 170&#xb0; C. or higher) at which the resin sheet <b>13</b> is melted and thermally cured. Further, the positions of the resin sheet <b>13</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> are fixed in the cavity <b>24</b>, and then the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b> is heated. Thus, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is melted and softened with the elapse of time.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described previously, the leads <b>3</b> are clamped by the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b> in an elastically deformed state. Accordingly, when the resin sheet <b>13</b> is melted, the leads <b>3</b> return to original shapes as indicated by a circle <b>26</b>, and the circuit board <b>4</b> sinks into the melted resin. Further, with the sinking of the circuit board <b>4</b>, the melted resin moves from a region under the circuit board <b>4</b> to a region beside the circuit board <b>4</b> to cure. Thus, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B covers from the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b> to the vicinities of upper portions of the side surfaces thereof. At this time, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is formed to have a two-dimensional size larger than that of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Accordingly, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B reliably covers to the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Moreover, since the melted resin is moved from a region under the circuit board <b>4</b> to a region beside the circuit board <b>4</b>, the occurrence of voids under the lower surface of the circuit board <b>4</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a tablet <b>28</b> is dropped into a pod <b>27</b> provided in the lower mold half <b>22</b> to be heated and melted, and then the tablet <b>28</b> is pressed using a plunger <b>29</b>. The tablet <b>28</b> is a product obtained by molding a powdery thermosetting resin (epoxy resin, ortho-cresol novolac/biphenyl, dicyclopentadiene, or the like) having an additive such as filler mixed therein into a columnar shape by compression molding. The resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b> is heated to approximately 170&#xb0; C. or higher as described previously. Accordingly, when the tablet <b>28</b> is dropped into the pod <b>27</b>, the tablet <b>28</b> is gradually melted. Further, the tablet <b>28</b> is melted into a liquid or semisolid state to flow through a runner <b>30</b> and pass through a gate <b>31</b>, thus being supplied into the cavity <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the cavity <b>24</b> is filled with the resin obtained by the melting of the tablet <b>28</b>. At this time, since the temperature of the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b> is higher than the temperature at which the melted resin is thermally cured, the resin filling the cavity <b>24</b> polymerizes and cures with the elapse of time.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, in this step, for example, by adjusting the work sequence of the step and the formulation of resins, the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B is thermally cured before the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A. Since this step causes the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B to first cure integrally with the circuit board <b>4</b>, the circuit board <b>4</b> is prevented from being warped by the shrinkage force produced when the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A cures. Moreover, since the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A is supplied into the cavity <b>24</b> in a liquid state, the thermal curing of the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A proceeds under pressure from the plunger <b>29</b>. As a result, as indicated by the circles <b>12</b>, at a boundary surface between the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A and the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B, pressure is applied from the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A to the side of the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B. This facilitates the polymerization of the resin encapsulants <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, and improves the degree of integration thereof. Thus, moisture resistance in this polymerized region is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Finally, when the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A and the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B sufficiently polymerize and thermally cure in the resin encapsulation mold <b>21</b>, the upper mold half <b>23</b> and the lower mold half <b>22</b> are separated, and the circuit device <b>1</b> as a molded product is taken out. Then, portions of the cured resin which fill an air vent <b>32</b>, the runner <b>30</b>, and the like are cut off from the resin encapsulant <b>2</b>, and outer lead portions of the leads are processed. Thus, the circuit device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, a semiconductor device according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, which is taken along line B-B. It should be noted that portions which are invisible due to the presence of a resin encapsulant are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, and will be described. Moreover, in the explanation thereof, the explanation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2B</figref> will be appropriately taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a semiconductor device <b>41</b> mainly includes an island <b>42</b>, a semiconductor element <b>43</b> fixed on the island <b>42</b> with an adhesive such as solder, leads <b>46</b> electrically connected to electrode pads <b>44</b> of the semiconductor element <b>43</b> with fine metal wires <b>45</b>, and a resin encapsulant <b>47</b> integrally covering the foregoing components. As shown in the drawing, support leads <b>48</b> extend from four corners of the island <b>42</b> outward. The island <b>42</b> is mechanically supported by these support leads <b>48</b> to be continuous with a frame.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the resin encapsulant <b>47</b> includes a first resin encapsulant <b>47</b>A and a second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B. In the drawing plane, a boundary between the first resin encapsulant <b>47</b>A and the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B is drawn. However, in the actual semiconductor device <b>41</b>, the resin encapsulants <b>47</b>A and <b>47</b>B polymerize to be integrated. Further, the first resin encapsulant <b>47</b>A is formed by injecting melted resin into the cavity of the resin encapsulation mold, and the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B is formed by melting the resin sheet <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) placed under the lower surface of the island <b>42</b>. The second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B has a thickness T<b>4</b> of, for example, not less than 0.1 mm nor more than 0.3 mm to form a very thin film. Thus, thermal resistance in the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, the composition of the resin constituting the first resin encapsulant <b>47</b>A is the same as that of the first resin encapsulant <b>2</b>A, and the composition of the resin constituting the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B is the same as that of the second resin encapsulant <b>2</b>B. With regard to the explanation thereof, the explanation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2B</figref> in the first embodiment will be taken into consideration, and the explanation thereof will be omitted here. Further, as indicated by a circle <b>48</b>, in the semiconductor device <b>41</b>, also, the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B covers from the lower surface of the island <b>42</b> to an upper portion of the side surfaces thereof. Further, since the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B under the lower surface of the island <b>42</b> is a thin film, the thermal resistance of the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B is reduced. Thus, heat radiated from the semiconductor element <b>43</b> is favorably radiated outside the semiconductor device <b>41</b> through the island <b>42</b> and the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that though a description has been made in this embodiment for the case where the resin sheet <b>13</b> placed under the lower surface of the island <b>42</b> is melted and thermally cured to form the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B, the present invention is not limited to this case. For example, similar to the first resin encapsulant <b>47</b>A, the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B may be formed by other manufacturing method such as the injection of resin into a resin encapsulation mold or potting. In other words, as described previously, it is enough to reduce the thermal resistance of the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B and to improve heat dissipation from the lower surface side of the island <b>42</b>. Other various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are plan views for explaining a die bonding step and a wire bonding step. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref> are cross-sectional views for explaining a state in which a frame is placed in a resin encapsulation mold. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are cross-sectional views for explaining a state in which resin is injected into the resin encapsulation mold. It should be noted that in this embodiment, since a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> will be described, the same components are denoted by the same reference numerals. Moreover, in the explanation thereof, the explanation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4B</figref> will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, first, a lead frame <b>51</b> having a predetermined shape is prepared. The lead frame <b>51</b> is made of a metal plate of copper or the like having a thickness of, for example, approximately 0.3 mm, and is formed into a predetermined shape by etching or press working. Further, the lead frame <b>51</b> has the shape of a strip as a whole, and a plurality of collective blocks <b>52</b> indicated by dotted lines are disposed in the longitudinal direction of the lead frame <b>51</b>. In each of the collective blocks <b>52</b>, a plurality of mount portions <b>53</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, in the collective block <b>52</b>, connecting portions <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> extend in the faun of a grid in the horizontal and vertical directions, and a mount portion <b>53</b> is formed in each of regions surrounded by the connecting portions <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> as indicated by a dotted line. Further, for each of the mount portions <b>53</b>, the semiconductor element <b>43</b> is fixed on the island <b>42</b> with an adhesive, and the electrode pads <b>44</b> of the semiconductor element <b>43</b> and the leads <b>46</b> are electrically connected to each other with the fine metal wires <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is mounted on the upper surface of the inner wall of a lower mold half <b>57</b> of a resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b>, and then the island <b>42</b> is mounted on the upper surface of this resin sheet <b>13</b>. Further, an upper mold half <b>58</b> and the lower mold half <b>57</b> are brought into contact with each other to place the mount portion <b>53</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) including the island <b>42</b> in a cavity <b>59</b>. As shown in the drawing, the support leads <b>48</b> are clamped between the upper and lower mold halves <b>58</b> and <b>57</b>. Thus, the position of the island <b>42</b> in the cavity <b>59</b> is fixed. It should be noted that at a stage prior to heat treatment after the placement in the resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b>, as described previously, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is in a solid state obtained by molding a granular thermosetting resin by compression molding as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the thickness T<b>3</b> of the resin sheet <b>13</b> is, for example, approximately 0.8 mm. Thus, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is formed to have a thickness larger than the thickness T<b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>) of the resin encapsulant <b>47</b> covering the lower surface side of the island <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, as described previously, the island <b>42</b> in the cavity <b>59</b> comes into the state in which the support leads <b>48</b> are clamped between the upper and lower mold halves <b>58</b> and <b>57</b>, and in which the position of the lower surface of the island <b>42</b> is fixed at a position separated from the upper surface of the inner wall of the lower mold half <b>57</b> by T<b>3</b>. Accordingly, when the support leads <b>48</b> are clamped by the resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b> in a state in which the island <b>42</b> is mounted on the upper surface of the resin sheet <b>13</b>, the support leads <b>48</b> are elastically deformed, and the resin sheet <b>13</b> is fixed in place in the state of being pressed against the lower mold half <b>57</b> by the island <b>42</b>. It should be noted that dotted lines indicate a state in which the support leads <b>48</b> are not deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b> is equipped with a heater system (not shown), and the resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b> is heated by the heater system to a temperature (e.g., 170&#xb0; C. or higher) at which the resin sheet <b>13</b> is melted and thermally cured. Further, the positions of the resin sheet <b>13</b> and the island <b>42</b> are fixed in the cavity <b>59</b>, and then the resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b> is heated. Thus, the resin sheet <b>13</b> is melted and softened with the elapse of time, and the lower surface of the island <b>42</b> is covered with the melted resin. It should be noted that the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B has a thickness T<b>4</b> of, for example, not less than 0.1 mm nor more than 0.3 mm to form a very thin film, and that the thermal resistance in the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in the drawing, when the resin sheet <b>13</b> is melted, the support leads <b>48</b> return to original shapes, and the island <b>42</b> sinks downward. Further, with the sinking of the island <b>42</b>, part of the melted resin moves from a region under the island <b>42</b> to a region beside the island <b>42</b>, and the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B covers from the lower surface of the island <b>42</b> to upper portions of the side surfaces thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a tablet <b>61</b> is dropped into a pod <b>60</b> provided in the lower mold half <b>57</b> to be heated and melted, and then the tablet <b>61</b> is pressed using a plunger <b>62</b>. The tablet <b>61</b> is a product obtained by molding a powdery thermosetting resin (epoxy resin, ortho-cresol novolac/biphenyl, dicyclopentadiene, or the like) having an additive such as filler mixed therein into a columnar shape by compression molding. The resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b> is heated to approximately 170&#xb0; C. or higher as described previously. Accordingly, when the tablet <b>61</b> is dropped into the pod <b>60</b>, the tablet <b>61</b> is gradually melted. Further, the tablet <b>61</b> is melted into a liquid or semisolid state to flow through a runner <b>63</b> and pass through a gate <b>64</b>, thus being supplied into the cavity <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the cavity <b>59</b> is filled with the resin obtained by the melting of the tablet <b>61</b>. At this time, since the temperature of the resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b> is higher than the temperature at which the melted resin is thermally cured, the resin filling the cavity <b>24</b> polymerize and cure with the elapse of time. It should be noted that as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> previously, the boundary surface between the first resin encapsulant <b>47</b>A and the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B polymerizes to integrally cure.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Finally, when the first resin encapsulant <b>47</b>A and the second resin encapsulant <b>47</b>B sufficiently polymerize and thermally cure in the resin encapsulation mold <b>56</b>, the upper mold half <b>58</b> and the lower mold half <b>57</b> are separated, and the semiconductor device <b>41</b> as a molded product is taken out. Then, portions of the cured resin which fill an air vent <b>65</b>, the runner <b>63</b>, and the like are cut off from the resin encapsulant <b>47</b>, and outer lead portions of the leads are processed. Thus, the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the preferred embodiments, the resin encapsulant includes two types of encapsulating resins, and the polymerized region of the encapsulating resins is located on the side surfaces of the circuit board. Thus, the withstand voltage characteristic is improved, and the circuit board is prevented from being short-circuited.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, in the preferred embodiments, the particle size of the filler of the encapsulating resin covering from the lower surface side of the circuit board to the upper portion of the side surfaces thereof is larger than the particle size of the filler of the encapsulating resin covering the upper surface side of the circuit board. Thus, heat dissipation to the outside of the circuit device is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, in the preferred embodiments, the structure is employed in which circuit elements and the like are not disposed on the lower surface side of the circuit board, and alumina is used as the filler in the resin on the lower surface side of the circuit board. Thus, the thermal resistance of the resin containing the filler is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, in the preferred embodiments, the resin on the lower surface side of the circuit board is formed by using the resin sheet. Thus, the particle size of the filler contained in the resin becomes large, and heat dissipation to the outside of the circuit device is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Moreover, in the preferred embodiments, the shape of the filler disposed on the lower surface side of the circuit board is the polygonal shape. Thus, the thermal resistance of the resin containing the filler is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, in the preferred embodiments, silica is used as the filler in the resin on the upper surface side of the circuit board in which importance is placed on moisture resistance. Thus, materials cost is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Moreover, in the preferred embodiments, the encapsulating resin covering from the lower surface side of the circuit board to the upper portion of the side surface thereof is cured before the encapsulating resin covering the upper surface side of the circuit board. Thus, the warpage of the circuit board can be prevented.</p>
