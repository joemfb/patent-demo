<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A signal interference handling method adapted to a cellular system, and a system and an apparatuses using the same are provided, where the cellar system includes a macro/micro cell base station (MBS), a home base station (HBS), and a MBS-served mobile station (m-MS), and the signal interference handling method includes steps. The m-MS detects whether there is mutual interference. The m-MS sends an interference mitigation (IM) request to the HBS if there is mutual interference. The HBS enters a low duty mode (LDM) after the HBS receives the IM request.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates to a signal interference handling method. Particularly, the disclosure relates to a signal interference handling method for handling interference of a home base station (HBS) to a macro/micro cell base station (MBS)-served mobile station (MS) (m-MS), and a system, a HBS and a MS using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Development of a cellular system has gradually become mature, and presently not only a macro/micro cell base station (MBS) could serve a mobile station (MS), but a home base station (HBS) could also be established within a coverage range of the MBS to serve the MS. The HBS is, for example, a femtocell base station, and a coverage range thereof is partially overlapped with the coverage range of the MBS.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The HBS could be a limited access base station, for example, a closed subscriber group home base station (CSG HBS), which does not allow accessing of the MS of a non-registered or non-member user. When the MBS-served MS (m-MS) approaches the HBS, MBS control signal (coming from the MBS) received by the m-MS could be severely interfered by HBS control signal (corning from the HBS), where the HBS control signal is used to control the MS of its subscriber, and is not used to control the m-MS. Therefore, the HBS control signal is a source of interference of the MBS control signal received by the m-MS.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Firstly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a cellular system according to an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. The cellular system <b>1</b> includes a macro/micro cell base station (MBS) <b>11</b>, a home base station (HBS) <b>12</b>, a MBS-served mobile station (m-MS) <b>13</b> (served by the MBS <b>11</b>) and a MS <b>14</b> (served by the HBS <b>12</b>), where the HBS <b>12</b> is, for example, a closed subscriber group home base station (CSG HBS) or a femtocell base station, and a coverage range <b>15</b> of the HBS <b>12</b> is partially overlapped to a coverage range of the MBS <b>11</b>. When the m-MS <b>13</b> approaches to the HBS <b>12</b>, MBS signal (comes from the MBS <b>11</b>) received by the m-MS <b>13</b> is probably interfered by HBS signal (corning from the HBS <b>12</b>). The MBS signal and the HBS signal could be control signals or data signals of the system. Therefore, exemplary embodiments of the disclosure provide a plurality of signal interference handling methods for mitigating or handling the interference of the HBS signal to the MBS signal, so that the m-MS <b>13</b> could correctly receive the MBS signal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a signal interference handling method according to an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, in which the steps marked by dot lines are non-necessary steps. In step S<b>201</b>, the MBS <b>11</b> sends a MBS signal to the m-MS <b>13</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, the MBS signal is a system control signal. Then, in step S<b>202</b>, the m-MS <b>13</b> detects whether there is mutual interference according to the received MBS signal. When the m-MS <b>13</b> approaches to the HBS <b>12</b>, the MBS signal could be severely interfered by the HBS signal, so that the MBS signal received by the m-MS <b>13</b> could be incorrect. Therefore, the m-MS <b>13</b> could determine whether there is mutual interference by decoding, demodulating the received MBS signal or estimating a signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is assumed that the m-MS <b>13</b> detects the mutual interference, so that in step S<b>203</b>, the m-MS <b>13</b> sends an interference mitigation (IM) request to the HBS <b>12</b>. After the HBS <b>12</b> receives the IM request, the HBS <b>12</b> directly enters a low duty mode (LDM), where a LDM duration and an activating-deactivating pattern of a LDM setting are predetermined LDM duration and activating-deactivating pattern. The LDM duration is an operation duration of the LDM, and the LDM activating-deactivating pattern represents an interlaced distribution of activating periods and deactivating periods in the LDM duration. If the LDM duration is set unlimited or there is no restriction on the LDM duration, it means that the HBS <b>12</b> will operate in the LDM continually until receiving any event, signalling or command to stop the LDM.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another possible implementation is that after the HBS <b>12</b> receives the IM request, the HBS <b>12</b> first determines whether there is any serving mobile station (MS) within the coverage range of the HBS <b>12</b>, and if there is no serving MS, and there is no MS performing network entry or network re-entry within the coverage range of the HBS <b>12</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> enters the LDM.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">However, in order to avoid a situation that a malicious m-MS sends the IM request to the HBS <b>12</b>, in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, before the HBS <b>12</b> enters the LDM, a step S<b>204</b> is executed, though the step S<b>204</b> is not a necessary step. In the step S<b>204</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> confirms an authentication of the IM requestor (i.e. the m-MS <b>13</b>) from the MBS <b>11</b>, and only when the HBS <b>12</b> successfully confirms the authentication of the IM requestor, a step S<b>2051</b> is executed. In the step S<b>2051</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> sets the LDM duration and the activating-deactivating pattern of the LDM setting. Generally, the LDM setting is a predetermined LDM setting (i.e., the predetermined LDM duration and activating-deactivating pattern are used).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step S<b>2052</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> enters the LDM, and during the activating period of the LDM duration, the HBS <b>12</b> is operated in a normal mode, and during the deactivating period of the LDM duration, the HBS <b>12</b> and the member MS of the HBS <b>12</b> within the coverage range thereof are forbidden to receive signal from a wireless channel and transmit signal to the wireless channel. However, the MBS <b>11</b> may continually transmit the MBS signal to the m-MS <b>13</b>. For example, in step S<b>206</b>, the MBS <b>11</b> transmits another MBS signal to the m-MS <b>13</b>. Then, in step S<b>207</b>, the m-MS <b>13</b> detects whether there is mutual interference. In this exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that there is mutual interference, so that a step S<b>208</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the step S<b>208</b>, the m-MS <b>13</b> sends the IM request to the HBS <b>12</b>. Similarly, in order to avoid the situation that the malicious m-MS sends the IM request to the HBS <b>12</b>, in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, before the HBS <b>12</b> executes the step S<b>2053</b>, a step S<b>209</b> is firstly executed, though the step S<b>209</b> is not a necessary step. In the step S<b>209</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> confirms the authentication of the IM requestor (i.e., the m-MS <b>13</b>) from the MBS <b>11</b>, and only when the HBS <b>12</b> successfully confirms the authentication of the IM requestor, the step S<b>2053</b> is executed. In the step S<b>2053</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> determines whether the LDM setting is required to be adjusted, and if the LDM is required to be adjusted, the HBS <b>12</b> reconfigures the LDM duration and the activating-deactivating pattern of the LDM setting. Then, in step S<b>2054</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> is continually operated in the LDM.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be noticed that each time when the LDM setting is adjusted, the HBS <b>12</b> could also transmit response signal to the member MS of the HBS <b>12</b> within the coverage range thereof, so that the member MS of the HBS <b>12</b> within the coverage range thereof could obtain the interlaced distribution of the activating periods and the deactivating periods in the LDM duration. Moreover, the LDM described in the exemplary embodiment of the disclosure could be a LDM of an IEEE 802.16 system, though the LDM is not limited to the LDM of the IEEE 802.16 system. In other wireless communication standards, although a name of the LDM could be different, as long as an actual effect thereof is the same, it is considered to be within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cellular system <b>1</b> is, for example, an IEEE 802.16m system, and the IM request is an advanced air interface ranging request (AAI-RNG-REQ) with an indication of femto interference mitigation. In another exemplary embodiment, the HBS <b>12</b> enters the LDM only when there is no serving MS within its coverage range and there is no MS performing network entry or network re-entry within its coverage range.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Moreover, when the cellular system <b>1</b> is the IEEE 802.16m system, the aforementioned activating period is a service available interval (AI), and the deactivating period is a service unavailable interval (UAI). When the HBS <b>12</b> enters the LDM, the HBS <b>12</b> is operated in the normal mode during the AI, and the HBS <b>12</b> does not transmit any signal to the air interface during the UAI. The HBS <b>12</b> transmits an advanced air interface registration response (AAI-REG-RSP) to the member MS of the HBS <b>12</b> within the coverage range thereof, so that the member MS of the HBS <b>12</b> within the coverage range thereof could obtain the interlaced distribution of the AI and the UAI in the LDM duration. In other words, the AAI-REG-RSP is a message carrying LDM parameter configuration information.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for confirming an authentication of the IM requestor according to an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. In step S<b>301</b>, when the m-MS <b>13</b> detects the interference, the m-MS <b>13</b> sends the IM request to the HBS <b>12</b>, and the IM request may include a m-MS identification and an authentication message. In another exemplary embodiment, the HBS <b>12</b> may request the m-MS identification and the authentication message from the m-MS <b>13</b> after receiving the IM request.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The step S<b>304</b> includes a step S<b>302</b> and a step S<b>303</b>. In the step S<b>302</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> sends the m-MS identification and the authentication message to the MBS <b>11</b>. If the MBS <b>11</b> determines that the m-MS <b>13</b> is a legitimate user according to the m-MS identification and the authentication message, the step S<b>303</b> is executed. If the MBS <b>11</b> determines that the m-MS <b>13</b> is an illegitimate user according to the m-MS identification and the authentication message, the MBS <b>11</b> sends a rejection message to the HBS <b>12</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that the MBS <b>11</b> determines that the m-MS <b>13</b> is a legitimate user according to the m-MS identification and the authentication message. Therefore, in the step S<b>303</b>, the MBS <b>11</b> sends a confirmation message to the HBS <b>12</b>, so that the HBS <b>12</b> could successfully confirm the authentication of the IM requestor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart of the signal interference handling method provided by the exemplary embodiment of the disclosure executed on the m-MS. In step S<b>401</b>, the m-MS <b>13</b> receives the MBS signal. Then, in step S<b>402</b>, the m-MS <b>13</b> detects whether there is mutual interference. If the m-MS <b>13</b> does not detect the mutual interference, the signal interference handling method is ended, and if the m-MS <b>13</b> detects the mutual interference, a step S<b>403</b> is executed. In the step S<b>403</b>, the m-MS <b>13</b> sends the IM request to the HBS <b>12</b>. As described above, the IM request may include the m-MS identification and the authentication message. In the IEEE 802.16 system, the IM request is represented by an indication of femto interference mitigation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of the signal interference handling method provided by the exemplary embodiment of the disclosure executed on the HBS, in which the steps marked by dot lines are non-necessary steps, and if the non-necessary determination-type steps are not executed, determination results thereof could be determined according to system predetermined values. First, in step S<b>501</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> receives the IM request. Then, in step S<b>502</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> determines whether or not to confirm an authentication of the IM requestor. If the HBS <b>12</b> successfully confirms the authentication of the IM requestor, a step S<b>503</b> is executed, and if the HBS <b>12</b> does not successfully confirm the authentication of the IM requestor, the whole signal interference handling method is ended. As described above, the step S<b>502</b> is executed to avoid a situation that a malicious m-MS sends the IM request, and the step S<b>502</b> could be removed from the signal interference handling method.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the step S<b>503</b>, the LDM duration and the activating-deactivating pattern in the LDM setting are set. After the setting is completed, a step S<b>504</b> is executed. In the step S<b>504</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> is operated in the LDM during the LDM duration. In step S<b>505</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> determines whether the LDM duration is ended. If the HBS <b>12</b> determines that the LDM duration is ended, a step S<b>506</b> is executed, and if the HBS <b>12</b> determines that the LDM duration is not ended, a step S<b>508</b> is executed. The steps S<b>505</b> and S<b>506</b> are non-necessary steps. In another exemplary embodiment, the HBS <b>12</b> may not end the LDM. In the step S<b>506</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> ends the LDM, and is continually operated in the normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the step S<b>508</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> determines whether the IM request is received during the activating period. If the HBS <b>12</b> receives the IM request during the activating period, a step S<b>507</b> is executed, and if the HBS <b>12</b> does not receive the IM request during the activating period, the step S<b>504</b> is executed, so that the HBS <b>12</b> is continually operated in the LDM using the previous LDM setting. In the step S<b>507</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> determines whether or not the LDM setting is required to be adjusted. If the HBS <b>12</b> determines that the LDM setting is required to be adjusted, the step S<b>503</b> is executed, by which the LDM setting is adjusted, and after the step S<b>503</b>, the step S<b>504</b> is executed, so that the HBS <b>12</b> is operated in the LDM using the new LDM setting. If the HBS <b>12</b> determines that the LDM setting is not required to be adjusted, the step S<b>504</b> is executed, so that the HBS <b>12</b> is continually operated in the LDM using the previous LDM setting.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Generally, if the HBS <b>12</b> still receives the IM request during the activating period, it represents that the mutual interference is not effectively mitigated, so that the HBS <b>12</b> increases a ratio of the deactivating period, so as to mitigate the signal interference. However, in case that the mutual interference is not effectively mitigated is not considered, the steps S<b>507</b> and S<b>508</b> could be removed form the signal interference handling method. In overall, in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the steps S<b>502</b>, S<b>505</b>-S<b>508</b> are non-necessary steps.</p>

In step S<b>605</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> communicates with the MBS <b>11</b>, and sets transmission power and a fractional frequency reuse (FFR) duration of a frequency partition of the HBS signal in a FFR setting, the FFR refers to that the BS further divides its applicable frequency band, and the divided small frequency bands could be repeatedly used in different communication ranges according to communication demands, environments, conditions and settings, or could be shared by other BSs. Therefore, the frequency used by the HBS <b>12</b> for transmitting the HBS signal could be different to a frequency of the MBS signal. Then, in step S<b>606</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> is operated at a communicated frequency partition during the FFR duration, i.e., the HBS <b>12</b> uses the frequency and the transmission power of a frequency partition result to transmit the HBS signal.</p>

Then, in step S<b>704</b>, the HBS is operated at the communicated frequency partition during the FFR duration, i.e., the HBS <b>12</b> uses the frequency and the transmission power of the frequency partition result to transmit the HBS signal.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, in step S<b>705</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> detects whether the FFR duration is ended. If the FFR duration is ended, a step S<b>706</b> is executed, and in the step S<b>706</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> is operated in an original frequency (a frequency used before the FFR setting is set or a default frequency), and uses the original frequency to transmit the HBS signal. If the FFR duration is not ended according to the step S<b>705</b>, it is to return to the step S<b>703</b>, and each time before the HBS signal is transmitted, the frequency partition, the transmission power and the FFR duration of the FFR setting are set first.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of a signal interference handling method according to an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, in which the step marked by dot lines is a non-necessary step.

In step S<b>805</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> sends a signal request to the MBS <b>11</b>. In step S<b>806</b>, after the MBS <b>11</b> receives the signal request, the MBS <b>11</b> sends the MBS signal to the HBS <b>12</b>. In step S<b>807</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> transmits the HBS signal and the MBS signal to the m-MS <b>13</b> in a multiplexing transmission mode, where the multiplexing transmission mode is to perform different channel encoding to the MBS signal and the HBS signal, and add the encoded MBS signal and the HBS signal for transmitting to the m-MS <b>13</b>. In other words, the HBS <b>12</b> forwards the MBS signal to the m-MS <b>13</b>. The MBS signal and the HBS signal could be respectively added with a weight thereof, and then the two signals are added to obtain a weighted adding result. If the weights of the two signals are both a unit weight (for example, the weight is equal to 1), a non-weighted adding result is obtained.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a HBS frame <b>91</b> transmitted by the HBS <b>12</b> includes encoded HBS signal <b>92</b> and encoded MBS signal <b>93</b>. The encoded HBS signal <b>92</b> and the encoded MBS signal <b>93</b> are superposed and transmitted to the m-MS <b>13</b>. The superposition of multiple encoded signals could be achieved by adding them together, which is also a method of signal multiplexing. Since the channel encodings used in the encoded HBS signal <b>92</b> and the encoded MBS signal <b>93</b> are different, the m-MS <b>13</b> could successfully decode and differentiate the MBS signal from the superposed signal according to the channel encoding used in the encoded MBS signal <b>93</b>.</p>

In step S<b>1005</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> transmits the HBS signal and the MBS signal to the m-MS <b>13</b> in the multiplexing transmission mode.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step S<b>1006</b>, the HBS <b>12</b> detects whether the MBS <b>11</b> has to provide other MBS signal to be transmitted.

If the MBS <b>11</b> does not have to provide other MBS signal to be transmitted, a step S<b>1007</b> is executed. In the step S<b>1007</b>, it is detected whether the HBS <b>12</b> still requires the MBS <b>11</b> to provide other MBS signal. If the HBS <b>12</b> still requires the MBS to provide the other MBS signal, then it is return to the step S<b>1003</b>, by which the HBS <b>12</b> continually requests the MBS <b>11</b> to provide the MBS signal. If the HBS <b>12</b> does not require the MBS <b>11</b> to provide the other MBS signals, the signal interference handling method is ended.
