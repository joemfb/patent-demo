<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system, method, and computer readable medium that facilitates processing of a mobile-originated voice call for a mobile station attached with a femtocell system are provided. The femtocell system may broadcast a notification that authentication is required for all system access, e.g., via an overhead message train. The femtocell system receives a call origination request from the mobile station and, in turn, issues a service request message to a convergence server deployed in a core network. The convergence server then engages in an authentication procedure with the mobile station's mobile core network and returns a global challenge response to the femtocell system. Then convergence server may then determine if the mobile station is to be validated and, if so, may continue call set up for the call origination request.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally related to radio access technologies and, more particularly, to mechanisms for facilitating mobile station registration and authentication via a femtocell system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Contemporary cellular radio systems, or mobile telecommunication systems, provide an over-the-air interface to wireless mobile stations (MSs), also referred to as user equipments (UEs), via a radio access network (RAN) that interfaces with at least one core network. The RAN may be implemented as, for example, a CDMA2000 RAN, a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) RAN, a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) RAN, or another suitable radio access network implementation. The MSs may comprise, for example, a mobile terminal such as a mobile telephone, a laptop computer featuring mobile telephony software and hardware, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or other suitable equipment adapted to transfer and receive voice or data communications with the radio access network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A RAN covers a geographical area comprised of any number of cells each comprising a relatively small geographic area of radio coverage. Each cell is provisioned by a cell site that includes a radio tower, e.g., a base transceiver station (BTS), and associated equipment. BTSs communicate with MSs over an air interface within radio range of the BTSs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous BTSs in the RAN may be communicatively coupled to a base station controller (BSC), also commonly referred to as a radio network controller (RNC). The BSC manages and monitors various system activities of the BTSs serviced thereby. BSCs are typically coupled with at least one core network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">BTSs are typically deployed by a carrier network in areas having a high population density. The traffic capacity of a cell site is limited by the site's capacity and affects the spacing of cell sites. In suburban areas, sites are often up to two miles apart, while cell sites deployed in dense urban areas may be as close as one-quarter of a mile apart. Because the traffic capacity of a cell site is finitely limited, as is the available frequency spectrum, mobile operators have a vested interest in technologies that allow for increased subscriber capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A microcell site comprises a cell in a mobile phone network that covers a limited geographic area, such as a shopping center, hotel, airport, or other infrastructure that may have a high density mobile phone usage. A microcell typically uses power control to limit the radius of the microcell coverage. Typically a microcell is less than a mile wide.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although microcells are effective for adding network capacity in areas with high mobile telephone usage, microcells extensively rely on the RAN, e.g., a controlling BSC and other carrier functions. Because contemporary BSCs have limited processing and interface capacity, the number of BTSs&#x2014;whether microcell BTSs or typical carrier BTSs&#x2014;able to be supported by the BSC or other RAN functions is disadvantageously limited.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Contemporary interest exists in providing enterprise and office access, including small office/home office (SOHO) radio access, by an even smaller scale BTS. The radio coverage area of such a system is typically referred to as a femtocell. In a system featuring a femtocell, an MS may be authorized to operate in the femtocell when proximate the femtocell system, e.g., while the MS is located in the SOHO. When the MS moves beyond the coverage area of the femtocell, the MS may then be serviced by the carrier network. The advantages of deployment of femtocells are numerous. For instance, mobile users frequently spend large amounts of time located at, for example, home, and many such users rely extensively on cellular network service for telecommunication services during these times. For example, a recent survey indicated that nearly thirteen percent of U.S. cell phone customers do not have a landline telephone and rely solely on cell phones for receiving telephone service. From a carrier perspective, it would be advantageous to have telephone services provisioned over a femtocell system, e.g., deployed in the user's home, to thereby reduce the load and effectively increase the capacity on the carrier RAN infrastructure. However, no efficient mechanisms have been provided for efficiently providing a convergence of femtocell and macrocellular systems in a manner that facilitates processing of mobile station call-originations.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, what is needed is a mechanism that overcomes the described problems and limitations.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides a system, method, and computer readable medium that facilitates processing of a mobile-originated voice call for a mobile station attached with a femtocell system. The femtocell system may broadcast a notification that authentication is required for all system access, e.g., via an overhead message train. The femtocell system receives a call origination request from the mobile station and, in turn, issues a service request message to a convergence server deployed in a core network. The convergence server then engages in an authentication procedure with the mobile station's mobile core network and returns a global challenge response to the femtocell system. Then convergence server may then determine if the mobile station is to be validated and, if so, may continue call set up for the call origination request.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an embodiment, a method of facilitating processing of a mobile-originated voice call for a mobile station attached with a femtocell system is provided. The method includes receiving, by the femtocell system, a call origination request from the mobile station, transmitting, by the femtocell system, authentication data in a service request message to a convergence server deployed in a core network, receiving, by the femtocell system, a global challenge response from the convergence server, and receiving, by the femtocell system, a determination of validation for the voice call from the convergence server.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another embodiment, a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions tangibly embodied thereon for execution by a processing system for facilitating processing of a mobile-originated voice call for a mobile station attached with a femtocell system is provided. The computer-readable medium comprises instructions that, when executed, cause the processing system to notify, by the femtocell system, the mobile station that authentication is required by the mobile station for system access, receive, by the femtocell system, a call origination request from the mobile station, transmit, by the femtocell system, authentication data in a service request message to a convergence server deployed in a core network, receive, by the femtocell system, a global challenge response from the convergence server, and receive, by the femtocell system, a determination of validation for the voice call from the convergence server.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with another embodiment, a network system that facilitates processing of a mobile-originated voice call for a mobile station attached with a femtocell system is provided. The system comprises a core network that includes a convergence server, a mobile core network that includes an authentication center and a Home Location Register, and an Internet Protocol-based femtocell system that provides a radio access point for a mobile station. The femtocell system receives a call origination request from the mobile station, transmits authentication data in a service request message to the convergence server, receives a global challenge response from the convergence server, and receives a determination of validation for the voice call from the convergence server.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a network system <b>100</b> that includes a cellular network <b>110</b> adapted to provide macro-cellular coverage to a mobile station. Cellular network <b>110</b> may comprise, for example, a code-division multiple access (CDMA) network, such as a CDMA-2000 network.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Cellular network <b>110</b> may include any number of base transceiver stations (BTSs) <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>communicatively coupled with a base station controller (BSC) <b>114</b> or RNC. Each individual BTS <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>under the control of a given BSC may define a radio cell operating on a set of radio channels thereby providing service to an MS <b>125</b>, such as a mobile terminal. BSC <b>114</b> manages the allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from mobile terminals, controls handovers, as well as various other functions as is understood. BSC <b>114</b> is interconnected with a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>116</b> that provides mobile terminal exchange services. BSC <b>114</b> may be additionally coupled with a packet data serving node (PDSN) <b>118</b> or other gateway service that provides a connection point between the CDMA radio access network and a packet network, such as Internet <b>160</b>, and provides mobility management functions and packet routing services. MSC <b>116</b> may communicatively interface with a circuit switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>150</b>, and may additionally be communicatively coupled with an interworking function (IWF) <b>122</b> that provides an interface between cellular network <b>110</b> and PSTN <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">System <b>100</b> may also include a signaling system, such as a signaling system #7 (SS7) network <b>170</b>. SS7 network <b>170</b> provides a set of telephony signaling protocols which are used to set up the vast majority of the world's PSTN telephone calls. SS7 network <b>170</b> is also used in cellular networks for circuit switched voice and packet-switched data applications. As is understood, SS7 network <b>170</b> includes various signaling nodes, such as any number of service control points (SCPs) <b>172</b>, signal transfer points (STPs) <b>174</b>, and service switching points (SSPs) <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">BTSs <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>deployed in cellular network <b>110</b> may service numerous network <b>110</b> subscribers. Cell cites provided by BTSs <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>commonly feature site ranges of a quarter to a half mile, e.g., in densely populated urban areas, to one to two miles in suburban areas. In other remotely populated regions with suitable geography, site ranges may span tens of miles and may be effectively limited in size by the limited transmission distance of relatively low-powered MSs. As referred to herein, a cell provided by a BTS deployed in carrier network <b>110</b> for access by any authorized network <b>110</b> subscriber is referred to as a macrocell.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a conventional network system <b>200</b> configuration featuring a femtocell. In the depicted example, a central BSC <b>214</b> deployed in a cellular carrier network <b>210</b> may connect with a soft switch core <b>212</b> that is connected with a MSC <b>216</b>. MSC <b>216</b> connects with the cellular core network and may interface with other networks, such as the PSTN as is understood. BSC <b>214</b> may be connected with and service numerous BTSs <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<b>212</b><i>c </i>that provide macrocells to cellular network <b>210</b> subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">BSC <b>214</b> may additionally connect with a tunnel gateway system <b>218</b> that is adapted to establish secured tunnels <b>232</b><i>a</i>-<b>232</b><i>x </i>with respective femtocell systems <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<b>250</b><i>x</i>. Femtocells comprise cellular access points that connect to a mobile operator's network using, for example, a residential Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or cable broadband connection. Femtocells <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<b>250</b><i>x </i>provide a radio access point for MS <b>225</b> when the MS is within range of a femtocell system with which the MS has authorized access. For example, femtocell system <b>250</b><i>a </i>may be deployed in a residence of the user of MS <b>225</b>. Accordingly, when the user is within the residence, mobile telecommunications may be provided to MS <b>225</b> via an air-interface provided by femtocell system <b>250</b><i>a</i>. In this instance, MS <b>225</b> is effectively offloaded from the macro BTS, e.g., BTS <b>212</b><i>a</i>, and communications to and from the MS are carried out with femtocell system <b>250</b><i>a </i>over Internet <b>260</b>. Thus, femtocell systems <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<b>250</b><i>x </i>may reduce the carrier radio resource demands by offloading MSs from macrocells to femtocells and thereby provide for increased subscriber capacity of cellular network <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In contemporary implementations such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a femtocell system <b>250</b><i>a </i>comprises a transceiver without intelligence and is thus required to be connected and managed by BSC <b>214</b>. Thus, femtocell systems <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<b>250</b><i>x </i>are reliant on the carrier network centralized BSC <b>214</b> which has limited capacity and thus does not exhibit desirable scaling characteristics or capabilities. Moreover, high communications overhead are realized by the BTS backhaul.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a network system <b>300</b> in which a femtocell system implemented in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may be deployed. System <b>300</b> includes a mobile core network <b>310</b> implemented as, for example, a code division multiple access (CDMA) core network that interfaces with a SS7 network <b>370</b>. Mobile core network <b>310</b> may include a Messaging Center (MC) <b>312</b>, a Home Location Register (HLR) <b>314</b>, an authentication center (AC) <b>315</b>, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>316</b>, a Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) <b>318</b>, and various other components. The HLR <b>314</b> is a central database that contains details of each MS subscriber authorized to use the mobile core network <b>310</b>. There may be several HLRs deployed in the core network <b>310</b>. The HLR <b>314</b> maintains details of each Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card issued by the mobile network operator, e.g., the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) stored in the SIM card, services authorized for the associated user, a location of the MS, and various other information. The HLR <b>314</b> may interface with the AC <b>315</b> that functions to facilitate authentication of MSs that access the cellular network. The MSC <b>316</b> provides mobile terminal exchange services and may communicatively interface with a circuit switched network, such as the public switched telephone network. The MSC <b>316</b> handles voice calls and Short Message Service (SMS), sets up and releases end-to-end connections, and handles mobility and hand-over requirements during calls as well as other functions. The PDSN <b>318</b> provides an interface between the radio access and IP networks. The PDSN <b>318</b> provides, for example, mobility management functions and packet routing functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">System <b>300</b> includes an Internet Protocol (IP) core network <b>320</b> that interfaces with the SS7 network <b>370</b>, e.g., via IS-41. In accordance with an embodiment, the IP core network <b>320</b> includes a convergence server (CS) <b>322</b>, a softswitch/Media Gateway Controller Function (MGCF) <b>324</b>, and a Media Gateway (MGW) <b>326</b> among other components. The CS <b>322</b> may be communicatively coupled with the SS7 network <b>370</b> and a Packet Data Interworking Function (PDIF) <b>332</b>, e.g., via Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) communications. The CS <b>322</b> provides SIP registration functions and a central interface point to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) elements and the softswitch/MGCF <b>324</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In many CDMA networks, a subscriber is uniquely identified by the combination of an electronic serial number (ESN) and a mobile identification number (MIN). A mobile equipment identifier (MEID) is an extension of the ESN that facilitates an increase in the number of manufacturers' codes. A pseudo-ESN (p-ESN) may be derived from the MEID to be used in place of the ESN. The MIN-ESN, or MIN-p-ESN, combination is used primarily for registration and authentication functions. Contemporary CDMA MSs may support an international mobile station identity (IMSI) and use the IMSI in place of the MIN to offer an improved address space and utilization by international applications. With the introduction of IMSI, the concept of a mobile station identity may be either an MIN or an IMSI. Due to the variations in different parameters for identification, it is assumed herein that a unique identifier is included in the username portion of the To Header of a SIP:REGISTER request to create and identify the mobile station subscriber during the registration procedures described hereinbelow. This unique identifier is referred to herein as the register ID (RegID). An optional network dependent predefined prefix may be stripped from the register ID prior to use in the convergence server functions. The register ID may contain an MIN or an IMSI paired with either an MEID, an ESN, or a p-ESN. However, other options may be suitably implemented without departing from the disclosed embodiments.</p>

A SIP registration phase is invoked by transmission of an OMT by the femtocell system <b>350</b> (step <b>602</b>). An OMT facilitates autonomous registration and may, for example, be transmitted on paging/access channels. Transmission of the OMT by the femtocell system <b>350</b> may be made at a predefined interval, e.g., once a second. The OMT may include parameters for system and region identification and may be distinguished from OMTs transmitted by other entities, e.g., by macro BTSs. An MS <b>325</b> in idle mode may detect the OMT when the MS <b>325</b> is within range of the femtocell system <b>350</b>. In accordance with an embodiment, the OMT transmitted by the femtocell system <b>350</b> includes an authentication bit (AUTH) having a value, e.g., &#x201c;1&#x201d;, that indicates authentication is required for all system access. Further, the OMT includes a random number (RAND) generated by the femtocell system <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Based on the values in the OMT, the MS determines that a new serving system has been encountered and that authentication is required based on the authentication bit value (AUTH=1). Subsequently, the MS <b>325</b> attempts to obtain the random number (RAND) to be used for the authentication from the OMT. If the random number is not available, a zero value may be used by the MS as prescribed by TR-45 authentication procedures. The MS <b>325</b> then generates an authentication result (AUTHR). For example, the MS <b>325</b> may generate an authentication result from a shared secret data key (SSD-A) stored by the MS <b>325</b>, the ESN or p-ESN, the MIN, and the RAND value obtained from the OMT. The authentication result may be generated, for example, by execution of the well known CAVE algorithm by the MS <b>325</b>. The MS then transmits a registration request to the femtocell system <b>350</b> (step <b>604</b>). The register message may include the MS's MIN, ESN or p-ESN, the authentication result (AUTHR), a CallHistoryCount (COUNT), and a random confirmation (RANDC) derived from the random number (RAND) used to compute the authentication result (AUTHR).</p>

The location updating request message includes the random number (RAND) rather than the random number confirmation (RANDC). The location updating request message additionally may include parameters, such as a Register ID, ESN, MEID, MIN, IMSI, etc. Using the Register ID, the CS <b>322</b> may associate the location updating request with the preceding SIP:REGISTER request received thereby from the femtocell system <b>350</b> in step <b>606</b>.

On receipt of the OMT, the MS determines that a new serving system has been encountered and that authentication is required based on the authentication bit value (AUTH=1). Subsequently, the MS <b>325</b> attempts to obtain the random number (RAND) to be used for the authentication from the OMT. If the random number is not available, a zero value may be used by the MS as prescribed by TR-45 authentication procedures. The MS <b>325</b> then generates an authentication result (AUTHR), and transmits a registration request to the femtocell system <b>350</b> (step <b>704</b>). The registration message may include the MS's MIN, ESN or p-ESN, the authentication result (AUTHR), a CallHistoryCount (COUNT), and a random number confirmation (RANDC) derived from the random number (RAND) used to compute the authentication result (AUTHR).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">An IMS registration phase <b>730</b> is then initiated by the femtocell system <b>350</b> sending a registration request to the S-CSCF (step <b>706</b>). The S-CSCF then sends a 3rd-party registration request to the CS <b>322</b> (step <b>708</b>), and the CS <b>322</b> returns a 200 OK SIP response to the S-CSCF (step <b>710</b>) for the 3rd-party registration which completes the IMS network registration.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the registration fails, the CS <b>322</b> informs the femtocell system <b>350</b> to perform IMS network deregistration. Assuming the registration is successful, an authentication process is then invoked by the femtocell system <b>350</b> transmitting 1x authentication parameters received from the MS <b>325</b> at step <b>704</b> to CS <b>322</b> in a SIP: MESSAGE(LOCATION_UPDATING_REQUEST) (step <b>712</b>). The location updating request message includes the random number (RAND) rather than the random number confirmation (RANDC). The location updating request message additionally may include parameters, such as a Register ID, ESN, MEID, MIN, IMSI, etc. If the location updating request message includes a P-Access-Network-Info (PANI) header that may specify information about the access technology, the CS <b>322</b> saves the PANI information.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The CS <b>322</b> acknowledges receipt of the location updating request message by transmitting a 200 OK SIP response to the femtocell system <b>350</b> (step <b>714</b>). Network authentication and registration then occurs via exchanges between the CS <b>322</b> and HLR/AC (step <b>716</b>). As part of the authentication response, the HLR/AC may trigger Unique Challenge, SSD update, or CountUpdate procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The CS <b>322</b> informs the femtocell system <b>350</b> of the authentication and registration results by transmitting a SIP location updating response message to the femtocell system <b>350</b> (step <b>718</b>). In the event of an authentication or registration failure, the CS <b>322</b> may send a SIP:MESSAGE containing, for example, an XML-encoded message body that facilitates deregistration of the femtocell system <b>350</b>. The femtocell system <b>350</b> acknowledges receipt of the authentication and registration results by sending a 200 OK SIP response to the CS <b>322</b> (step <b>720</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the event of either a registration or authentication failure, a deregistration process <b>740</b> is invoked by the femtocell system <b>350</b> transmitting a deregistration message, e.g., a SIP: REGISTER message with a expire value &#x201c;0&#x201d;, to the S-CSCF (step <b>722</b>). The S-CSCF acknowledges receipt of the deregistration message by transmitting a 200 OK SIP response to the femtocell system <b>350</b> (step <b>724</b>). The S-CSCF then transmits the deregistration message to the CS <b>322</b> (step <b>726</b>) which acknowledges receipt of the deregistration message by transmitting a 200 OK SIP response to the S-CSCF (step <b>728</b>) thereby completing deregistration of the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The CS <b>322</b> may receive a SIP:REGISTER message for a subscriber who is not currently SIP registered, but for whom the CS <b>322</b> maintains subscription data from the HLR. For example, the CS <b>322</b> may maintain the HLR subscription information for a configurable period after a SIP deregistration. In this scenario, a MS re-registration procedure may be invoked. The re-registration may be consistent with that as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> except the CS <b>322</b> is not required to request the user profile from the HLR.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Periodic registration is optionally required in mobile networks. If periodic registration is enabled, the HLR may return an &#x201c;Authorization Period&#x201d; in response to a Registration Notification (REGNOT). In this case, the CS <b>322</b> may send a SIP:MESSAGE (ORDERED_REGISTRATION_REQUEST) before the &#x201c;Authorization Period&#x201d; expires. On receiving this request, the femtocell system <b>350</b> may send the ordered registration request to the MS <b>325</b> to send registration-related parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Regardless of an &#x201c;Authorization Period&#x201d; timer, the SIP registration period dictates the interval at which the SIP registration from the femtocell system <b>350</b> needs to be refreshed. In such a case, the femtocell system <b>350</b> needs to refresh the registration prior to the expiration period while the MS <b>325</b> is attached to the femtocell system <b>350</b>. Such registration procedures are preferably processed locally at the CS <b>322</b>. The femtocell system <b>350</b> sends a SIP:REGISTER message to the CS <b>322</b>, and the CS <b>322</b> returns a SIP 200 OK response to the femtocell system <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When deregistration occurs, e.g., either due to registration timeout or mobile-initiated/network deregistration, the CS <b>322</b> may typically not delete HLR subscriber data which is eligible to be aged out, or removed by a REGCANC message. The CS <b>322</b> may send a mobile station inactive (MSINACT) message to the HLR with the optional DeregistrationType parameter omitted which indicates that subscriber data is still being maintained by the CS <b>322</b>. Such a situation may occur, for example, due to the MS <b>325</b> being powered off and it is desirable to have the subscription data available when the MS is powered back on. However, the time the MS was last registered is maintained with the subscription data.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the MS does not re-register for a configurable time (e.g., 24 hours), the subscriber data may be deleted and an MSINACT message is sent to the HLR with the DeregistrationType set to &#x201c;administrative reason&#x201d; indicating that the subscriber data has been purged from the CS <b>322</b>. This may also occur as needed to free up space in the database thereby deleting the oldest data first based on when it was last accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A mobile initiated de-registration process may be invoked when the CS <b>322</b> receives a SIP:REGISTER from the femtocell system <b>350</b> with a timeout of zero for a current registration. In an IMS network, the CS <b>322</b> may receive this message from the S-CSCF as a 3rd-party SIP:REGISTER message. For example, such a de-registration may occur when the femtocell system <b>350</b> receives a power-down indication from the MS, the femtocell system <b>350</b> detects MS inactivity, or the femtocell system <b>350</b> detects a loss of radio contact.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Deregistration may additionally occur due to location updating. When the MS registers in a macrocell, the HLR preferably notifies the CS <b>322</b> accordingly. If the SIP registration for the corresponding MS is currently active, the CS <b>322</b> may send a SIP:MESSAGE (Deregister) to the femtocell system <b>350</b> requesting it to deregister. Registration cancellation may additionally occur due to administrative reasons as well. In such a case, the MS may be in a call or using some network service. If the cancellation indicates that service is to be discontinued immediately, the CS <b>322</b> terminates any call in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In accordance with disclosed embodiments, mechanisms that facilitate mobile originated voice calls are provided. In the disclosed embodiments, it is assumed that the MS is fully registered.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a diagrammatic representation of a signaling flow <b>800</b> of a mobile originated voice call implemented in accordance with an embodiment. The MS is successfully registered in the network system (step <b>802</b>), e.g., via a SIP registration process. The MS then determines that authentication is required on all system accesses, e.g., on receipt of the Overhead Message Train (OMT) that includes an authentication value (e.g., AUTH=1) that indicates authentication is required (step <b>804</b>). The random number (RAND) to be used for authentication may also be obtained by the MS from the OMT. If it is not, a zero value may be used by the MS as prescribed by TR-45 authentication. The MS executes an instance of the CAVE algorithm using the dialed digits, the RAND, the ESN/p-ESN, and the SSD currently stored to produce an origination Authentication Result (AUTHR).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The MS then sends an origination message to the femtocell system providing the dialed digits, its MIN, ESN/p-ESN, the Authentication Result (AUTHR), the CallHistoryCount (COUNT), and the RANDC from the RAND used to compute the Authentication Result (AUTHR) (step <b>806</b>). The femtocell system, on receipt of the call origination attempt by the MS, sends 1x authentication data in a service request message required for the authentication using SIP: MESSAGE (CM_SERVICE_REQUEST) to the CS (step <b>808</b>), and the CS acknowledges receipt thereof by returning a SIP 200 OK response (step <b>810</b>). The CS then engages the HLR/AC to authenticate the MS (step <b>812</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The CS then forwards the result of the authentication to the femtocell system using a SIP message including a global challenge response (GLOBAL_CHALLENGE_RESPONSE) along with the encryption information received from the HLR/AC and a locally generated authentication token (step <b>814</b>). The femtocell system presents the authentication token received in the global challenge response to the CS in a subsequent SIP:INVITE message to initiate a SIP voice call. The CS may deny the establishment of SIP calls if this token is not received. The femtocell system acknowledges receipt of the SIP:MESSAGE by returning a SIP 200 Ok response to the CS (step <b>816</b>). The femtocell system may then establish the voice/traffic channel with the MS (step <b>818</b>). The femtocell system then sends a SIP:INVITE message that includes the called and calling party numbers (e.g., as MDNs) to the CS along with the authentication token previously received from the CS (step <b>820</b>). The INVITE content-type may be multipart/mixed with SDP in one message body and the authentication token in a separate message body.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the event the validation of the authentication token received in the SIP:INVITE fails (block <b>850</b>), the CS sends a &#x201c;SIP:403 Forbidden&#x201d; to the femtocell system to indicate the authentication failure (step <b>822</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In case of a successful validation of the authentication token, the CS applies subscription checks to the call. If all the checks are successful (block <b>852</b>), a SIP call setup handshake is invoked (step <b>824</b>) between the CS and a MGCF/MGW, and the CS notifies the femtocell system that the call is being attempted to be placed, e.g., by transmitting a SIP:100 Trying message to the femtocell system (step <b>826</b>). Optional SIP information responses may be exchanged between the femtocell system and the MGCF/MGW (step <b>828</b>). In the event the call is successfully placed, the MGCF/MGW may transmit a SIP:INVITE 200 Ok message to the CS (step <b>830</b>), which forwards the message to the femtocell system (step <b>832</b>). The femtocell system acknowledges the SIP:INVITE 200 Ok with the CS (step <b>834</b>), which forwards the acknowledgement to the MGCF/MGW (step <b>836</b>). A 1xRTT voice connection is then established between the MS and the femtocell system (step <b>838</b>), and an RTP session is established between the femtocell system and the MGW (step <b>840</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the mobile originated call is prohibited, e.g., by operator-determined barring, a call barring supplementary service, or by the failure of an attempt to use any supplementary service, the call is rejected by the CS. In this instance, the femtocell system sends a SIP:INVITE to the CS which returns a &#x201c;100 Trying&#x201d; message to the femtocell system. The CS then returns a SIP(&#x201c;603 Declined&#x201d;) message to the femtocell system which acknowledges the call declined message.</p>

Assuming the MS is free to receive the call, the CS <b>322</b> forwards a SIP: INVITE message that includes the called party MIN to the femtocell system <b>350</b> serving the MS (step <b>1008</b>), and the femtocell system may acknowledge the SIP:INVITE by sending a &#x201c;SIP: 100 Trying&#x201d; message to the CS <b>322</b> (step <b>1010</b>). Additionally, the femtocell system <b>350</b> attempts to page the MS corresponding to the MIN of the INVITE (step <b>1012</b>). Upon recognizing the page message with its MIN, the MS executes an instance of the CAVE algorithm using the SSD-A currently stored by the MS, the ESN/p-ESN, the MIN1, and the RAND value to produce a termination authentication result (AUTHR).

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The paging authentication request message <b>1100</b> preferably includes a random number field <b>1104</b> that includes the random number (RAND) used for authentication, an authentication result field <b>1106</b> that includes the authentication result (AUTHR), and a count field <b>1108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As described, mechanisms for facilitating processing of a mobile-originated voice call for a mobile station attached with a femtocell system are provided. The femtocell system may broadcast a notification that authentication is required for all system access, e.g., via an overhead message train. The femtocell system receives a call origination request from the mobile station and, in turn, issues a service request message to a convergence server deployed in a core network. The convergence server then engages in an authentication procedure with the mobile station's mobile core network and returns a global challenge response to the femtocell system. Then convergence server may then determine if the mobile station is to be validated and, if so, may continue call set up for the call origination request.</p>
