<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0000271, filed on Jan. 4, 2010 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to a dialogue system using an extended domain, which has a dialogue using a natural language used by a human, and a natural language recognition method and computer-readable medium thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Language is the basic means of human communication. Natural language recognition in a robot or an Automatic Response System (ARS) service providing apparatus communicating with a human is a recent major topic.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is very difficult for a robot to completely understand all natural language used by a human and to respond thereto. Since it is difficult to translate all natural language into meaningful language and to use the meaningful language, the natural language is translated into meaningful language only within a group (hereinafter, referred to as a domain) obtained by organizing meanings necessary for a use environment and expressions corresponding thereto by an expert. For example, in the case where an expert configures a domain including an input set &#x201c;Where is my cup?,&#x201d; when a user actually inputs an input set &#x201c;Where is my mug?,&#x201d; because this input set is not present in the domain, the meaning thereof may not be understood. Since a dialogue pattern actually input by a user may be different from a dialogue pattern predicted by an expert, a natural language recognition rate of a dialogue system deteriorates.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is an aspect of the example embodiments to provide a dialogue system which has a dialogue with a user using an extended domain to increase a natural language recognition rate, and a recognition method and computer-readable medium thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing and/or other aspects are achieved by providing a method of recognizing natural language in a dialogue system, the method including parsing, by a processor, voice data of a user into syllables to generate an input set, understanding, by the processor, a user language using an input set of an initial domain generated before dialogue with the user and an extended input set of an extended domain generated upon dialogue with the user, generating, by the processor, a response sentence based on a result of understanding the user language and generating, by the processor, user language based on the response sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the parsed input set is not included in the initial domain, the extended domain may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The extended domain may be generated by generating the extended input set using associated language data of a certain word configuring the parsed input set.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The associated language data may include at least one of a synonym, a hyponym and a hypernym associated with the certain word, and the extended input set may be generated by changing at least one word of the parsed input set to the associated language data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method may further include applying a weight to the extended input set in order to restrict a size of the generated extended domain, and stopping the generation of the extended domain if the weight applied to the extended input set is greater than a predefined value.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The weight may be differently applied depending on one of which words and how many words of the parsed input set are changed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A weight applied to the extended input set generated by changing a certain word of the parsed input set to a hyponym may be greater than a weight applied to the extended input set generated by changing the certain word to a synonym, and a weight applied to the extended input set generated by changing the certain word to a hypernym may be greater than the weight applied to the extended input set generated by changing the certain word to the hyponym.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foregoing and/or other aspects are achieved by providing a method of recognizing natural language in a dialogue system, the method including parsing, by a processor, voice data of a user into syllables to generate an input set, generating, by the processor, an extended domain including an extended input set generated using an initial input set generated by predicting meanings necessary for a use environment and expressions corresponding thereto and associated language data of the initial input set before dialogue with a user, and understanding user language using the extended input set of the extended domain, generating, by the processor, a response sentence based on a result of understanding the user language and generating, by the processor, user language based on the response sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foregoing and/or other aspects are achieved by providing a dialogue system using an extended domain, the dialogue system including a language parser to parse voice data of a user into syllables to generate an input set, a language understanding unit to understand user language using an input set of an initial domain generated before dialogue with the user and an extended input set of an extended domain generated upon dialogue with the user, a dialogue manager to generate a response sentence based on a result of understanding the user language, and a language generator to generate user language based on the response sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The language understanding unit may further include an initial domain comparator to determine whether the parsed input set is included in the initial domain, and an extended domain comparator to determine whether the parsed input set is included in the extended domain, and, if the parsed input set is not included in the initial domain, the extended domain comparator may make a request for generation of the extended domain.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The language understanding unit may further include an associated word bank having associated language data of a certain word configuring the parsed input set, an input set generator to generate the extended input set using the associated language data, and an extended domain generator to make a request for generation of the extended input set to the input set generator according to the request for the generation of the extended domain.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The associated language data may include at least one of a synonym, a hyponym and a hypernym associated with the certain word, and the input set generator may change at least one word of the parsed input set to the associated language data.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The language understanding unit may further include a domain restrictor to restrict a size of the extended domain, and the domain restrictor may apply a weight to the extended input set and make a request for stoppage of the generation of the extended input set to the input set generator if the weight applied to the extended input set is greater than a predefined value.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The weight may be differently applied depending on one of which words and how many words of the parsed input set are changed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The domain restrictor may apply, to the extended input set generated by changing a certain word of the parsed input set to a hyponym, a weight greater than a weight applied to the extended input set generated by changing the certain word to a synonym, and apply to the extended input set generated by changing the certain word to a hypernym a weight greater than the weight applied to the extended input set generated by changing the certain word to the hyponym.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The foregoing and/or other aspects are achieved by providing a dialogue system using an extended domain, the dialogue system including a language parser to parse voice data of a user into syllables to generate an input set, a language understanding unit to generate an extended domain including an extended input set generated using an initial input set generated by predicting meanings necessary for a use environment and expressions corresponding thereto and associated language data of the initial input set before dialogue with a user, and to understand user language using the extended input set of the extended domain, a dialogue manager to generate a response sentence based on a result of understanding the user language and a language generator to generate user language based on the response sentence.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a dialogue system using natural language, a dialogue with a user may progress by understanding text input using a keyboard or language recognized by voice recognition.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a dialogue system <b>10</b> using an extended domain according to example embodiments may include a voice recognizer <b>100</b>, a language parser <b>101</b>, a language understanding unit <b>102</b>, a dialogue manager <b>111</b> and a language generator <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The voice recognizer <b>100</b> may convert user voice input through a microphone into voice data and provide the voice data to the language parser <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The language parser <b>101</b> may receive the voice data, parse the voice data into syllables to generate an input set, and provide the parsed input set to the language understanding unit <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">User input is not limited to voice. A user may input text using a keyboard instead of the voice recognizer <b>100</b> and the language parser <b>101</b> may generate and provide an input set.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The language understanding unit <b>102</b> may understand language input by the user based on the parsed input set and provide the understood result to the language manager <b>111</b>. The language manager <b>111</b> may generate a response sentence to define a dialogue based on the understood result of the language, and provide the response sentence to the language generator <b>112</b>. The language generator <b>112</b> may generate language corresponding to the response sentence. Thereafter, the language generated by the language generator <b>112</b> may be audibly output through a speaker to have a dialogue with a person. Text may be displayed simultaneously with or separately from a voice output, to have a dialogue with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the language understanding unit <b>102</b> understands the language based on the parsed input set, the input set may or may not be present in an initial domain <b>104</b>. The initial domain <b>104</b> has input sets generated by organizing meanings necessary for a use environment and expressions corresponding thereto. For example, an input set <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be generated by an expert in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A user dialogue pattern may be different from a dialogue pattern predicted by an expert. Accordingly, the parsed input set may not be included in the initial domain <b>104</b>. In this case, an extended domain <b>110</b> may be generated by input sets generated using an associated word bank <b>108</b> of the language understanding unit <b>102</b>, and the language input by the user may be understood by an input set present in the extended domain <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The associated word bank <b>108</b> may include a database established according to associated language data (a synonym, a hyponym and a hypernym) of a certain word. The synonym may have the same meaning as a certain word and may replace the certain word. The hyponym may not replace a certain word but may include subordinate-concept words of the certain word, and may be used to directly infer the certain word. The hypernym may include superordinate-concept words of a certain word, and may be used to indirectly infer the certain word.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, in associated language data <b>30</b> of a word &#x201c;Cup&#x201d;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a word registered as a synonym of the word &#x201c;cup&#x201d; is not present, words &#x201c;coffee cup&#x201d; and &#x201c;teacup&#x201d; are registered as a hyponym of &#x201c;cup&#x201d;, and words &#x201c;dishware&#x201d;, &#x201c;tableware&#x201d; and &#x201c;container&#x201d; are registered as a hypernym of &#x201c;cup.&#x201d; As another example, in associated language data of a word &#x201c;mother&#x201d;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the words &#x201c;female parent&#x201d; are registered as a synonym of the word &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; words &#x201c;mama&#x201d; and &#x201c;mom&#x201d; are registered as a hyponym of the word &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; and a word registered as a hypernym of the word &#x201c;Mother&#x201d; is not present.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The input set generator <b>109</b> may receive the associated language data from the associated word bank <b>108</b> according to a request of an extended domain generator <b>106</b> and generate input sets necessary for domain extension. The extended domain <b>110</b> may be generated by the generated input sets.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A method of generating input sets by the input set generator <b>109</b> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, two extended input sets <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> may be generated by changing a word &#x201c;mother&#x201d; of an input set <b>20</b> to the synonym &#x201c;female parent&#x201d; and the hyponym &#x201c;mama.&#x201d; In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, two extended input sets <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> may be generated by changing a word &#x201c;cup&#x201d; of the input set <b>20</b> to the hyponyms &#x201c;coffee cup&#x201d; and &#x201c;teacup.&#x201d; As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, two extended input sets <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> may be generated by changing a word &#x201c;cup&#x201d; of the input set <b>20</b> to the hypernyms &#x201c;dishware&#x201d; and &#x201c;container.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, at least two words included in the input set <b>20</b> may be changed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, two extended input sets <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> may be generated by changing the word &#x201c;cup&#x201d; of the input set <b>20</b> to the hyponym &#x201c;coffee cup&#x201d; and changing the word &#x201c;mother&#x201d; to the synonym &#x201c;female parent&#x201d; and the hyponym &#x201c;mama.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Since an excessive number of input sets may be generated by the input set generator <b>109</b> generating input sets using the associated language data provided by the associated word bank <b>108</b>, adequate restriction is necessary. A domain restrictor <b>107</b> may restrict the size of the extended domain <b>110</b> so that the number of input sets present in the extended domain <b>110</b> is not excessively increased.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The domain restrictor <b>107</b> may define extension types depending on which words or how many words of the input set generated by the user input are changed and apply weights according to the extension types, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At this time, the degree of change of the extended input set generated from the input set may be checked by the applied weight.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If a changed portion of the extended input set has a meaning similar to a meaning thereof before change, a small weight may be applied and if a changed portion of the extended input set has a different meaning, a large weight may be applied. For example, a weight &#x201c;1&#x201d; may be applied to an extended input set obtained by changing a word to a synonym, a weight &#x201c;2&#x201d; may be applied to an extended input set obtained by changing a word to a hyponym, and a weight &#x201c;3&#x201d; may be applied to an extended input set obtained by changing a word to a hypernym.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, respective weights may be applied to the extended input sets <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> generated from the input set <b>20</b> of the initial domain <b>104</b> according to the extension types. If a weight sum is large, the number of changed portions may be relatively large and, if the weight sum is small, the number of changed portions may be relatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Since the weights are applied to the extended input sets, the applied weights and a predefined value to restrict the domain may be compared to restrict the size of the extended domain <b>110</b>. An input set having a weight sum less than the predefined value may be included in the extended domain <b>110</b> and an input set having a weight sum greater than the predefined value may not be included in the extended domain <b>110</b>, thereby restricting the size of the extended domain <b>110</b>. Thus, the extended domain <b>110</b> may include only input sets each having a weight sum less than the predefined value. For example, if the predefined value is set to 3 in order to restrict the size of the extended domain <b>110</b>, only seven input sets <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> may be included in the extended domain <b>110</b>, excluding one input set <b>28</b> having a weight sum of 4. As another example, if the predefined value is set to 6 in order to restrict the size of the extended domain <b>110</b>, all eight input sets <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> each having a weight sum less than the predefined value may be included in the extended domain <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The range ED of the extended domain <b>110</b> restricted by the weights may be shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The range ED of the extended domain <b>110</b> may be obtained in the case where the predefined value is set to 6. A certain word K may be consecutively changed to synonyms having a weight of 1 to perform 6-step extension. The consecutive change may indicate that the changed synonym is changed to another synonym again. In addition, a certain word may be consecutively changed to hyponyms to perform 3-step extension or may be consecutively changed to hypernyms to perform 2-step extension. If the weight sum does not exceed 6, the synonym, the hyponym and the hypernym may be mixed to perform extension.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The range ED of the extended domain <b>110</b> may be wider in a first synonym direction A<b>1</b> and a second synonym direction A<b>2</b> to which a relatively small weight is applied than in a first hyponym direction B<b>1</b> and a first hypernym direction C<b>1</b>. The range ED of the extended domain <b>110</b> generated in consideration of weights may be wider in the synonym direction than a domain D extending to a constant distance from a certain word K in all associated word (synonym, hyponym and hypernym) directions. Input sets which are not included in the domain D may be included in a hatched portion H.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since the range ED of the extended domain <b>110</b> extends widely in the synonym direction, an input set more similar to an input pattern of the user in terms of meaning may be included although an input dialogue pattern of the user deviates from a predicted dialogue pattern. In addition, the size of the domain may decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, the operation of a dialogue system using an extended domain according to the example embodiments will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a user who wants to have a dialogue may input a voice signal (<b>201</b>). Then, the voice recognizer <b>100</b> may convert the input voice signal into voice data and provide the voice data to the language parser <b>101</b>. The signal input by the user may not be limited to the voice signal. Although not specially described in the example embodiments, the user who wants to have a dialogue may input text using a keyboard to provide the text to the language parser <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">If the voice data is received (Yes in <b>203</b>), voice recognition may be performed using the voice data provided by the language parser <b>101</b>, the voice data may be parsed into syllables to generate an input set, and provide the input set to an initial domain comparator <b>103</b> (<b>205</b> and <b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The initial domain comparator <b>103</b> may determine whether the parsed input set is included in the initial domain <b>104</b> (<b>209</b>). If the parsed input set is included in the initial domain <b>104</b> (Yes in <b>209</b>), then the language may be understood based on the input set and the understood result may be provided to the dialogue manager <b>111</b>. Then, the dialogue manager <b>111</b> may generate and provide the response sentence to define the dialogue to the language generator <b>112</b>, and the language generator <b>112</b> may generate language used to have a dialogue with the user according to the response sentence (<b>219</b>). Thereafter, the language generated by the language generator <b>112</b> may be audibly output through a speaker, thereby providing a dialogue with the user (<b>221</b>). The language generated by the language generator <b>112</b> may be displayed as text simultaneously with or separately from a voice output, thereby providing a dialogue with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the parsed input set is not included in the initial domain <b>104</b> (No in <b>209</b>), an extended domain comparator <b>105</b> may provide the parsed input set to an extended domain generator <b>106</b> to make a request for domain extension. Then, the extended domain generator <b>106</b> may make a request for generation of an input set to generate an extended domain to the input set generator <b>109</b>. The input set generator <b>109</b> may generate extended input sets based on the synonym, the hyponym and the hypernym received from the associated word bank <b>108</b> with respect to words configuring the parsed input set. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref>, the extended input sets may be generated using the synonym, the hyponym and the hypernym and the extended domain <b>110</b> may be generated using the generated extended input sets (<b>211</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The domain restrictor <b>107</b> may apply weights to the generated extended input sets and provide information about the weights to the extended domain generator <b>106</b>. The information about the weights may include weights applied according to extension types defined depending on which words or how many words of the input set are changed. The degree of change of the input set may be checked by the weights applied to the extended input sets. If a changed portion of the extended input set has a meaning similar to a meaning thereof before change, a small weight may be applied and if a changed portion of the extended input set has a different meaning from a previous meaning, a large weight may be applied (<b>213</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The extended domain generator <b>106</b> may determine whether the size of the extended domain <b>110</b> needs to be restricted according to the information about the weights received from the domain restrictor <b>107</b>. If the sum of weights applied to the input set generated by the input set generator <b>109</b> is less than the predefined value (No in <b>215</b>), the domain may continue to be extended. If the sum of weight applied to the input set generated by the input set generator <b>109</b> is greater than the predefined value, it is recognized that the size of the extended domain <b>110</b> may need to be restricted (Yes in <b>215</b>) to make a request for stoppage of the generation of the input set to the input set generator <b>109</b>. Then, the input set generator <b>109</b> may stop the generation of the input set.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After generating the extended domain <b>110</b>, the extended domain comparator <b>105</b> may determine whether the parsed input set is included in the extended domain <b>110</b> (<b>217</b>). If the parsed input set is included in the extended domain <b>110</b> (Yes in <b>217</b>), the extended domain comparator <b>105</b> may understand the language based on the input set and provide the understood result of the language to the dialogue manager <b>111</b>. Then, the dialogue manager <b>111</b> may generate a response sentence to define a dialogue and provide the response sentence to the language generator <b>112</b>, and the language generator <b>112</b> may generate language to have a dialogue with the user according to the response sentence (<b>219</b>). The language generated by the language generator <b>112</b> may be audibly output through the speaker (<b>221</b>). The language generated by the language generator <b>112</b> may be displayed as text simultaneously with or separately from voice output, thereby providing a dialogue with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the parsed input set is not included in the extended domain <b>110</b> (No in <b>217</b>), the dialogue system <b>10</b> may ignore the user input, finish the process, and wait for user voice input.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although an extended domain may be generated with respect to user voice input in real time to have a dialogue with a user in the example embodiments, an extended domain may be generated in advance to have a dialogue with a user based on the extended domain as in the following example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a dialogue system <b>11</b> using an extended domain according to example embodiments may include a voice recognizer <b>100</b>, language parser <b>101</b>, language understanding unit <b>122</b>, dialogue manager <b>111</b>, and language generator <b>112</b>. The components other than the language understanding unit <b>122</b> are substantially equal to those of the above-described example embodiments and are denoted by the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The language understanding unit <b>122</b> may include an extended domain comparator <b>123</b> and an extended domain <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The extended domain <b>124</b> may include an initial input set generated by predicting meanings necessary for a use environment and expressions corresponding thereto and an extended input set generated using associated language data (synonym, hyponym and hypernym) of the initial input set. The extended domain <b>124</b> may be generated in advance. Then, when having a dialogue with a user, the extended domain comparator <b>123</b> may understand language using input sets included in the extended domain <b>124</b>. Thereafter, language to define a dialogue may be generated based on the understanding of the language and audibly output, thereby providing a dialogue with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the extended domain <b>124</b> may be generated in advance (<b>301</b>) and a user may input a voice signal (<b>303</b>).

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the voice data is received (Yes in <b>305</b>), the language parser <b>101</b> may perform voice recognition based on the voice data, parse the voice data to generate an input set, and provide the input set to the extended domain comparator <b>123</b> (<b>307</b> and <b>309</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The extended domain comparator <b>123</b> may determine whether the parsed input set is included in the extended domain <b>124</b> (<b>311</b>).</p>
