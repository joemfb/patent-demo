<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-68817, filed on Mar. 24, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The embodiments described herein relate to a semiconductor memory device and an operation method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, resistive memory devices utilizing a variable resistor as a memory element are receiving attention as candidates to succeed flash memory. The resistive memory devices herein are assumed to include not only resistive RAM (ReRAM), in a narrow sense, that uses a transition metal oxide as a recording layer and stores its resistance states in a non-volatile manner, but also the likes of Phase Change RAM (PCRAM) that uses chalcogenide or the like as a recording layer to utilize the resistance information of crystalline states (conductors) and amorphous states (insulators).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Two kinds of operation modes in memory cells of resistive memory devices are known. In one kind, known as a bipolar type, a high-resistance state and a low-resistance state are set by switching a polarity of an applied voltage. In the other kind, known as a unipolar type, setting of the high-resistance state and the low-resistance state are made possible by controlling a voltage value and a voltage application time, without switching the polarity of the applied voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The unipolar type is preferable for realizing a high-density memory cell array. This is because, in the case of the unipolar type, the cell array can be configured by overlapping a variable resistor and a rectifier such as a diode at intersections of bit lines and word lines, without using a transistor. Furthermore, arranging such memory cell arrays three-dimensionally in stacks enables a large capacity to be realized without causing an increase in cell array area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of unipolar type ReRAM, write of data to a memory cell is performed by applying a certain voltage to the variable resistor for a short time. This causes the variable resistor to change from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state. This operation to change the variable resistor from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state is hereinafter referred to as a setting operation. On the other hand, erase of data in the memory cell is performed by applying a certain voltage to the variable resistor for a long time, the certain voltage being lower than that applied during the setting operation, and the variable resistor being in the low-resistance state subsequent to the setting operation. This causes the variable resistor to change from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state. This operation to change the variable resistor from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state is hereinafter referred to as a resetting operation. The memory cell adopts, for example, the high-resistance state as a stable state (reset state), and, in the case of binary data storage, write of data is performed by the setting operation in which the reset state is changed to the low-resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A read operation of the memory cell is performed by applying a certain voltage to the variable resistor and using a differential amplifier to monitor a current flowing through the variable resistor. This read operation allows determination of whether the variable resistor is in the low-resistance state or the high-resistance state. It is required in this kind of semiconductor memory device that the read operation causes data to be read reliably from a selected memory cell, even if there are dispersions in characteristics of the variable resistors.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present invention are now described with reference to the accompanying drawings. A semiconductor memory device described in the present embodiments is a resistive memory device employing a variable resistor as memory element.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Configuration of Semiconductor Memory Device in Accordance with First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing part of a memory cell array <b>10</b> in a semiconductor memory device in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a resistive memory device of a unipolar type has resistive-type unit memory cells MC disposed at respective intersections of mutually-intersecting bit lines BL and word lines WL. The resistive-type unit memory cell MC has a rectifier, for example, a diode Di, and a variable resistor VR connected in series. Here, the bit lines BL are assumed to be signal lines connected to an anode side of the diode Di and the word lines WL are assumed to be signal lines connected to a cathode side of the diode Di. Moreover, the memory cells MC configured by the diode Di and the variable resistor VR connected in series are expressed using symbols shown in the figure. This applies similarly to the example below. Here, a disposition and polarity of the diode Di and variable resistor VR configuring the memory cell MC are likewise not limited to what is shown in the figure. The memory cell array <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has, for example, 4 k memory cells MC disposed in a longitudinal direction of the bit line BL (y direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and 1 k memory cells MC disposed in a longitudinal direction of the word line WL (x direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the memory cells MC being arranged in a two-dimensional matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The variable resistor VR is, for example, one having a structure comprising electrode/transition metal oxide/electrode or the like. The variable resistor VR varies a resistance of the metal oxide based of applied conditions of voltage, current, heat and so on, and stores those differing states of resistance as information in a nonvolatile manner. Utilizable as the variable resistor VR are, more specifically, for example, ones like chalcogenide or the like in which the resistance is varied due to phase transition between a crystalline state and an amorphous state (PCRAM), ones in which the resistance is varied by precipitating metal cations to form a contacting bridge between the electrodes and ionizing the precipitated metal to destroy the contacting bridge (CBRAM: Conductive Bridging RAM), and ones in which the resistance is varied by voltage or current application (broadly divided into ones in which a resistance variation occurs due to presence/absence of a trapped charge in a charge trap existing in an electrode interface and ones in which a resistance variation occurs due to presence/absence of a conductive path induced by oxygen deficiency or the like) (ReRAM).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the case of unipolar type ReRAM, write of data to the memory cell MC is performed by applying to the variable resistor VR a voltage of, for example, 3.5 V (actually about 4.5 V if a voltage drop portion of the diode Di is included) and a current of about 10 nA for a time of about 10 ns-100 ns. This causes the variable resistor VR to change from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state (setting operation).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">On the other hand, erase of data in the memory cell MC is performed by applying to the variable resistor VR in the low-resistance state subsequent to the setting operation a voltage of 0.8 V (actually about 1.8 V if a voltage drop portion of the diode Di is included) and a current of about 1 &#x3bc;A-10 &#x3bc;A for a time of about 500 ns-2 &#x3bc;s. This causes the variable resistor VR to change from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state (resetting operation).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A read operation of the memory cell MC is performed by applying to the variable resistor VR a voltage of 0.4 V (actually about 1.4 V if a voltage drop portion of the diode Di is included) and monitoring a current flowing through the variable resistor VR using a sense amplifier. This allows it to be determined whether the variable resistor VR is in the low-resistance state or the high-resistance state. This read operation is described in detail in the embodiments hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a control circuit in the semiconductor memory device of the present embodiment. The control circuit includes a sense amplifier <b>20</b>, a latch <b>30</b>, a column decoder <b>40</b>, a main row decoder <b>50</b>, a sub row decoder <b>60</b>, and a word line drive circuit <b>70</b>. In the configuration of the control circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the column decoder <b>40</b>, the main row decoder <b>50</b>, and the word line drive circuit <b>70</b> are shared by a plurality of memory cell arrays <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Bit lines BL are connected to the sense amplifier and the latch <b>30</b> via the column decoder <b>40</b>. A plurality of sense amplifiers <b>20</b> respectively detect read-out data, and a plurality of latches <b>30</b> temporarily retain the read-out data and write data. The sense amplifiers <b>20</b> and latches <b>30</b> are also shared by the plurality of memory cell arrays <b>10</b>. The column decoder <b>40</b> comprises a plurality of column circuit units each including a decoder circuit and a bit line switch circuit, the decoder circuit being configured to simultaneously select, for example, 16 bit lines BL. The description below proceeds assuming the number of sense amplifiers <b>20</b> to be 16 corresponding to the number of bit lines BL simultaneously selected by the column decoder <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The latches <b>30</b> are connected to the page buffer <b>200</b>, and temporarily retain read data and write data sent and received between the sense amplifiers <b>20</b> and the page buffer <b>200</b> during a read operation and a write operation. The page buffer <b>200</b> is a data register configured to temporarily retain one page of data (for example, 2 k bytes) which is the unit of data processing. If the page buffer <b>200</b> is configured to retain multiple pages of data, it can be operated as a cache memory.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Word lines WL are connected to the main row decoder <b>50</b> and sub row decoder <b>60</b>. The main row decoder <b>50</b> and sub row decoder <b>60</b> allow one word line WL to be selected. Here, the row decoder is assumed to have a hierarchical structure of a main row decoder <b>50</b> shared by a plurality of memory cell arrays <b>10</b>, and a sub row decoder <b>60</b> attached to each of the memory cell arrays <b>10</b>. Word line selection is performed by this hierarchically structured row decoder. A selected word line WL and an unselected word line WL are applied with, respectively, a certain selected word line voltage and a certain unselected word line voltage, from the word line drive circuit <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Here, an assembly of the control circuits such as the column decoder <b>40</b>, sense amplifiers <b>20</b>, main row decoder <b>50</b>, sub row decoders <b>60</b>, and a certain number of the memory cell arrays <b>10</b> that share these control circuits is termed a bank <b>100</b>. The semiconductor memory device comprises a plurality of banks <b>100</b> (Bank_<b>0</b>-Bank_m). A region where this plurality of banks <b>100</b> (Bank_<b>0</b>-Bank_m) is aligned is termed a memory core unit. Disposed in a periphery of the memory core unit are various peripheral circuits configured to perform operation control of the memory core unit.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The peripheral circuits include a data input/output buffer <b>110</b>, an input/output control circuit <b>120</b>, an address register <b>130</b>, a command register <b>140</b>, an operation control circuit <b>150</b>, a parameter register <b>160</b>, an internal voltage generating circuit <b>170</b>, a core control buffer <b>180</b>, a data register <b>190</b>, and the page buffer <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The data input/output buffer <b>110</b> is connected to an I/O pad and performs input/output of data to this semiconductor memory device. The circuit configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a multiplex system in which commands, addresses, and data used in operation of the semiconductor memory device are all provided by the I/O pad. For example, when writing data, a data write command, an address indicating a location of a selected memory cell MC, and write data are provided to the semiconductor memory device via the data input/output buffer <b>110</b>. Moreover, when reading data, a data read command and selection address are likewise provided to the semiconductor memory device. Read data read-out from the memory core unit based on these command and address is stored in the page buffer <b>200</b>; subsequently, the data is outputted to external via the data input/output buffer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The input/output control circuit <b>120</b> controls identification of data and so on inputted/outputted from the I/O pad and controls data output. Provided from external to the input/output control circuit <b>120</b> are various control signals such as write enable signal, read enable signal, command latch enable signal, address latch enable signal, and so on. The input/output control circuit <b>120</b> controls input/output data based on combination of states of these signals and based on the timings thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The input/output control circuit <b>120</b> recognizes, when command is provided thereto, data inputted from the data input/output buffer <b>110</b> as a command, and stores the data in the command register <b>140</b>. Similarly, the input/output control circuit <b>120</b> recognizes, when address is provided thereto, data inputted from the data input/output buffer <b>110</b> as an address, and stores the data in the address register <b>130</b>. The input/output control circuit <b>120</b> stores, when data is provided thereto, data inputted from the data input/output buffer <b>110</b> in the page buffer <b>200</b>. Conversely, during data output, input/output control circuit <b>120</b> allows the page buffer <b>200</b> to be capable of output data. When write data and control parameters are inputted, these are stored in, respectively, the data register <b>190</b> and the parameter register <b>160</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the input/output control circuit <b>120</b> may be configured to administer output control of status indicating operation state of the semiconductor memory device, ID code output, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During the read operation, a command is inputted whereby an internal control clock is activated and the operation control circuit <b>150</b> starts the operation. Additionally activated is the internal voltage generating circuit <b>170</b> configured to generate an internal voltage appropriate to various operations. During the read operation, the operation control circuit <b>150</b> outputs a timing signal to the core control buffer <b>180</b> to perform a desired read operation in the memory core unit. The timing signal controls charging/discharging of the word lines WL and bit lines BL, precharge of the sense amplifiers <b>20</b>, and a sensing operation. In addition, the internal voltage generating circuit <b>170</b> supplies a certain voltage to the memory core unit and the core control buffer <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The core control buffer <b>180</b> herein is provided to each of the banks Bank_<b>0</b>-Bank_m. Hence, simultaneously operated banks can be freely or independently controlled. For example, when raising data processing speed of the read operation and write operation, it is only required to increase the number of simultaneously activated banks. Current consumption may be very large according to the operation. Accordingly, the number of simultaneously activated banks may be increased or decreased appropriately.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Operation of Semiconductor Memory Device in Accordance with First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, the read operation in the semiconductor memory device configured as above is described. In the read operation in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment, data is read simultaneously from a plurality of the memory cells MC in the memory cell array <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When reading data simultaneously from a plurality of selected memory cells MC, a plurality of selected bit lines BL (for example, 16) in the memory cell array <b>10</b> are applied with a selected bit line voltage VUX. On the other hand, a single selected word line WL is applied with a selected word line voltage Vss_row. Other unselected bit lines BL and unselected word lines WL are applied with, respectively, an unselected bit line voltage VUB and an unselected word line voltage VUX.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, it is assumed that a value of the voltage VUX is set to a certain voltage such that a voltage dV<b>1</b> is applied, along the forward bias direction of the diode Di, between both ends of the plurality of memory cells MC that are connected at intersections of the plurality of selected bit lines BL and the single selected word line WL, and are in a selected state. As an example, the voltage dV<b>1</b> herein may be set to a voltage necessary for correctly reading a memory cell MC when a read method of reading a memory cell MC one by one by selecting a single bit line BL and single word line WL (a bit-by-bit read method) is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An amount of a cell current Icell changes according to whether the variable resistor VR in the selected memory cell MC is in the low-resistance state (first resistance state) or the high-resistance state (second resistance state). If a cell current Icell flowing in the memory cell MC is equal to or more than a determining current I_read, the variable resistor VR is determined to be in the low-resistance state, and data &#x201c;0&#x201d; is read out. Alternatively, if the cell current Icell flowing in the memory cell MC is below the determining current I_read, the variable resistor VR is determined to be in the high-resistance state, and data &#x201c;1&#x201d; is read out.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the read operation in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment, the sensing operation is repeated two or more times to determine data retained in the memory cells MC. A sensing operation herein refers to the above-described operation configured to apply the voltage VUX to the plurality of selected bit lines BL and the voltage Vss_row to the single selected word line WL and thereby read data from the plurality of selected memory cells MC.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment, memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state of &#x201c;0&#x201d; data in any one of the sensing operations are excluded from subjects of the sensing operation in the next sensing operation. Specifically, when a certain memory cell MC is determined to be in the low-resistance state, in any one of the sensing operation, a bit line BL connected to such the memory cell MC is discharged, and the memory cell MC is not subject to the next sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">This read operation is described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view explaining the read operation in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a frequency distribution of cell current Icell when the value of the voltage VUX is set such that the memory cells MC are applied with the voltage dV<b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the horizontal axis shows the cell current Icell, and the vertical axis shows the number of memory cells MC. Shown at symbols &#x201c;a&#x201d;-&#x201c;c&#x201d; are the distribution of memory cells MC in, respectively, the first, second, and third sensing operations. Each time the sensing operation is performed, a memory cell MC in which a cell current Icell equal to or larger than the determining current I_read flows is read as being in the low-resistance state (&#x201c;0&#x201d; data: distribution RL (&#x201c;0&#x201d;) cell). Alternatively, a memory cell MC in which a cell current Icell lower than the determining current I_read flows is read as being in the high-resistance state (&#x201c;1&#x201d; data: distribution RH (&#x201c;1&#x201d;) cell). In the explanation of the embodiments, this determining current I_read corresponds to a boundary current value at which the sense amplifiers <b>20</b> determine L/H of the memory cells MC. Moreover, the determining current I_read is described as coinciding with the lower limit of the distribution of the low-resistance state cells. This determining current I_read is thus easily understood by imagining a setting verify read subsequent to a setting pulse application. In an actual ordinary read operation, a certain margin is required with respect to the data distributions, hence a determining current I_read&#x2032; shown in the figure is set as the determining current. However, a read operation in a state where that margin is lost for some reason, has the relationship of the determining current I_read and the distribution shown in the figure. In the description below, a read operation employing a determining current I_read in the sense amplifiers is described, without making any special distinction between the setting verify read operation and the ordinary read operation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a distribution showing a state of the first sensing operation, which is the first of the multiply-repeated sensing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the first sensing operation, if it is assumed that many of the selected memory cells MC are in the low-resistance state, a cell current Icell_on (Icell_on is assumed here to be an average cell current flowing in the low-resistance state memory cells when reading using the bit-by-bit method) flows from each of those many low-resistance state memory cells MC into the selected word line WL. If there are n selected memory cells MC in the low-resistance state, the current flowing into the selected word line WL is n&#xd7;Icell_on. As a result, the voltage of the selected word line WL rises higher than the voltage Vss_row, and the voltage applied to the selected memory cell MC becomes smaller than the above-described value dV<b>1</b>. As a result, it becomes difficult for the cell current to flow, which therefore leads to decrease of the cell current Icell_on, i.e., the average current of the low-resistance state memory cells MC. In practice, there is dispersion in the cell current in the low-resistance state memory cells MC. Accordingly, a cell current in some memory cells MC which is supposed to be set to the low-resistance state may fall below the determining current I_read. That is, the lower limit of distribution of the memory cells MC in the low-resistance state becomes a value of the determining current I_read or less (refer to distribution shown by a solid line in symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the other hand, in the first sensing operation, if many of the selected memory cells MC are assumed to be in the high-resistance state and have a resistance value one digit or more higher than in the low-resistance state case, the influence on the voltage of the selected word line WL is small, even if current flows into the selected word line WL. In that case, the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC hardly changes from dV<b>1</b>, and the low-resistance state memory cells MC can allow flow of a cell current, which is the determining current I_read or more, in a state similar to the state of the bit-by-bit method. The distribution of the low-resistance state memory cells MC in this case, including the lower limit of the distribution, may be imagined to lie on or above the determining current I_read (refer to distribution shown by a dashed-dotted line in symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the first sensing operation, memory cells MC having a cell current not less than the determining current I_read are determined by the sense amplifiers. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the first sensing operation are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to the sensing operation in the next sensing operation. When many of the selected memory cells MC are in the low-resistance state (distribution shown by a solid line in symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), several of the memory cells MC on a lower limit side of the distribution of low-resistance state memory cells MC may be provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state. However, memory cells MC, in which a cell current not less than the determining current I_read flows, are accurately determined to be in the low-resistance state and excluded from the memory cells MC subject to the sensing operation in the next sensing operation. Specifically, the selected bit lines BL connected to the memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the first sensing operation are discharged, and the sensing operation is not performed on those memory cells MC in the second sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Note that when many of the selected memory cells MC are in the high-resistance state and the current flowing into the word line WL is small, it is conceivable that all of the memory cells MC in the low-resistance state are read normally.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Symbol &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a distribution showing a state of the second sensing operation, which is the second of the multiply-repeated sensing operations. The value of the voltage VUX is set such that the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC is also dV<b>1</b> in the second sensing operation. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the first sensing operation have their corresponding bit lines BL discharged and are not applied with a voltage in the second sensing operation (shown by the shaded circular symbols in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). That is, in the second sensing operation, only memory cells MC provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state but actually in the low-resistance state and memory cells MC actually in the high-resistance state are subject to the sensing operation. As a result of memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the first sensing operation being excluded from the memory cells MC subject to the sensing operation, the number of low-resistance state memory cells MC to be simultaneously subjected to the sensing operation is reduced. As a result, the current flowing into the selected word line WL via the memory cells MC is reduced. In that case, the rise in potential of the selected word line WL is suppressed compared to the first sensing operation, and the voltage applied to the remaining selected memory cells MC subject to the second sensing operation increases to approach the applied voltage as it should normally be. Consequently, of the low-resistance state memory cells MC provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state in the first sensing operation, several are accurately determined to be in the low-resistance state in the second sensing operation. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the second sensing operation are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to the sensing operation in the third sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Symbol &#x201c;c&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a distribution showing a state of the third sensing operation, which is the third of the multiply-repeated sensing operations. The value of the voltage VUX is set such that the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC is also dV<b>1</b> in the third sensing operation. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the first and second sensing operations have their corresponding bit lines BL discharged and are not applied with a voltage in the third sensing operation (shown by the shaded circular symbols in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As a result, the current flowing into the selected word line WL via the memory cells MC is further reduced. The rise in potential of the selected word line WL is suppressed compared to the second sensing operation, and the voltage applied to the remaining selected memory cells MC subject to the third sensing operation increases. Consequently, the low-resistance state memory cells MC provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state in the second sensing operation are reliably determined to be in the low-resistance state in the third sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this way, the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment repeats the sensing operation multiple times to determine data retained in the memory cells MC. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state each time the sensing operation is performed are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to the sensing operation in the next sensing operation. As the sensing operation is repeated in this way, the number of the selected memory cells MC decreases, hence the current flowing into the selected word line WL decreases. As a result, the rise in potential of the selected word line WL from the voltage Vss_row due to the current flowing into the selected word line WL also becomes smaller. Those of the plurality of low-resistance state memory cells MC having a comparatively high resistance value (small cell current) have their cell current further reduced by the rise in potential of the selected word line WL and, as a result, may be provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state in the first sensing operation. However, in the second and later sensing operations, when the number of memory cells MC subject to the sensing operation is reduced, the rise in potential of the selected word line WL is also reduced. This leads to the memory cells MC being applied with a desired read voltage, whereby it may be accurately determined that the memory cells MC are in the low-resistance state. Determination results of the repeated sensing operations are aggregated in a temporary data retaining devices such as the latch circuits <b>30</b> provided to each of the sense amplifiers <b>20</b>, whereby control of bit lines BL for which a certain determining operation is completed can be individually performed. Moreover, subsequent to the last of a certain number of sensing operations being completed, a final read result is stored in the data retaining devices.</p>

The equalize transistor <b>26</b> is connected between the sense node NSEN and the inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <b>23</b>. The equalize transistor <b>26</b>, which is turned on when a signal EQn is &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, sets the voltage of the sense node NSEN equal to the reference voltage VREF_SA. A reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> configured to output the reference voltage VREF_SA is included in the core control buffer <b>180</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The discharge transistor <b>25</b> is connected between the signal line DSA and a VUB terminal (terminal applied with between 0 V and a diode forward bias direction voltage Vf (up to about 0.6 V)). The discharge transistor <b>25</b> has its gate inputted with a bit line discharge signal BLDIS and thereby functions to discharge the signal line DSA to a potential VUB of the VUB terminal (or aground potential), PMOS transistors <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b </i>shown by the broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may also be added to assist bit line precharge. The transistors <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b </i>charge the bit lines BL to a voltage VCLAMP when signals PRECHGna and SW_<b>0</b> are &#x201c;L&#x201d; state.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the current mirror circuit <b>22</b> is connected to the sense node NSEN, the current mirror circuit <b>22</b> being configured from a current supply circuit <b>22</b><i>a </i>and PMOS transistors <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>d</i>, and <b>22</b><i>e</i>. Moreover, a power supply VSEL is also a part of the current mirror circuit <b>22</b>. The PMOS transistors <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>d</i>, and <b>22</b><i>e </i>configure a current mirror having a switch control function. The current mirror has the power supply VSEL connected thereto, and is applied with a certain voltage from the power supply VSEL, the certain voltage being necessarily-and-sufficiently higher than a setting level of the bit line BL. In addition, current is supplied to the current mirror circuit <b>22</b> by the current supply circuit <b>22</b><i>a</i>. When the signal SW_<b>0</b> and a signal PRECHGns are in &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, the current mirror circuit <b>22</b> passes a certain current to the sense node NSEN. During the read operation, the current mirror circuit <b>22</b> passes a read-dedicated reference current IL to the sense node NSEN.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A basic operation of the sense amplifier <b>20</b> is as follows. That is, while the voltage of the bit line BL is clamped by the clamp transistor <b>21</b>, a cell current Icell_<b>0</b> is passed through the selected memory cell MC. The reference current IL is passed from the current mirror circuit <b>22</b> into the sense node NSEN. The change in voltage of the sense node NSEN due to the difference between these current cell Icell_<b>0</b> and reference voltage IL is determined by the differential amplifier <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An output signal out_<b>0</b> of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> is loaded into the sense data latch <b>24</b>. The sense data latch <b>24</b> latches the output signal out_<b>0</b> of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> based on a signal STRBn.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The memory cells MC_<b>1</b>-MC_n simultaneously selected to undergo execution of the read operation are also connected, via the respective signal lines DSA_<b>1</b>-DSA_n, to corresponding sense amplifiers <b>20</b> configured similarly to the sense amplifier <b>20</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, the read operation employing the control circuit in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows states of typical control signals, and voltage values of the word lines WL, bit lines BL, and the sense node NSEN of the sense amplifier <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">First, at time T<b>0</b>, a signal MWLSEL and a signal BLSWSEL become &#x201c;B&#x201d; state, whereby the main row decoder <b>50</b> and the column decoder <b>40</b> are enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, at time T<b>1</b>, a signal VROWUP and a signal WLDVSEL become &#x201c;H&#x201d; state, whereby the sub row decoder <b>60</b> is enabled. The selected word line WL is applied with the voltage Vss_row, and the unselected word lines WL are applied with the voltage VUX. Additionally, at time T<b>1</b>, the bit lines BL are applied with the unselected bit line voltage VUB.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">At time T<b>2</b>, a signal BLSEL becomes &#x201c;H&#x201d; state, whereby a signal BLC applied to a gate of the clamp transistor <b>21</b> becomes &#x201c;H&#x201d; state. The signal BLC is set to a voltage VCLAMP+Vtn, so that the voltage of the bit line subject to read attains VCLAMP (=VUX), when the reference current IL flows in the clamp transistor <b>21</b> during the read operation.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Simultaneously, the signal SW_<b>0</b>, which is controlled for respective memory cell MC becomes &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, thereby turning on the PMOS transistors <b>22</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>e</i>. This causes the reference current IL to begin to flow in the bit line BL. Now, the clamp transistor <b>21</b> is applied with a gate voltage (the voltage BLC) that causes the voltage value of the signal line DSA to attain exactly the voltage VCLAMP (=VUX), when a cell current Icell of the same current value as the reference current IL flows in the selected memory cell MC.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, the signal EQn becomes &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, which causes the equalize transistor <b>26</b> to be turned on. The sense node NSEN and the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> become connected, whereby the voltages of the two input terminals of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> become equal. Now, the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> bear a load large enough to maintain the potential of wirings that extend via the signal lines DSA to the bit lines BL at the reference voltage VREF_SA. Accordingly, the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> needs to have a sufficient charge/discharge ability.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, the signal PRECHGn becomes &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, while the signal PRECHGns is maintained at &#x201c;H&#x201d; state. The PMOS transistor <b>22</b><i>f </i>is turned off, and not used in precharge of the bit line BL. Now, the signal PRECHGna becomes &#x201c;L&#x201d; in tandem with the signal PRECHGn. The signal PRECHGna and the signal SW_<b>0</b> become &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, whereby the voltage VCLAMP (=VUX) is supplied directly to the signal line DSA via the PMOS transistors <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Subsequent to time T<b>2</b>, a cell current Icell according with the state of the selected memory cell MC flows, whereby the selected word line WL is charged. The voltage of the selected bit line BL is determined such that it is in an equilibrium state where a balance between the current flowing into the bit line BL from sense amplifier <b>20</b> and the current flowing out to the word line WL is accomplished. A load current Idrv_all of the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> is a total of cell current Icell subtracted from reference current IL for each of the sense amplifiers <b>20</b>. The reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> ensures that a voltage drop due to this load current Idrv_all and wiring resistance does not cause the voltage VREF_SA applied to each of the sense amplifiers <b>20</b> to deviate largely from a certain voltage value.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">At time T<b>3</b>, the signal EQn becomes &#x201c;H&#x201d; state to complete precharge of the bit lines BL and sense node NSEN, and the read operation is started. A period tSEN from time T<b>3</b> to time T<b>4</b> is a period of the first sensing operation. If the cell current is large compared to the reference current IL (IL&#x3c;Icell), the voltage of the sense node NSEN falls. Conversely, if the cell current Icell is small compared to the reference current IL (IL&#x3e;Icell), the voltage of the sense node NSEN rises. The value of the determining current I_read used in data determination is I_read=Csen&#xb7;(VCLAMP&#x2212;VREF_SA)/tSEN+IL (where Csen is capacitance of the sense node NSEN). In the present embodiment, the voltage VCLAMP of the sense node NSEN and the reference voltage VREF_SA are set equal. Since voltage amplitude for determining data is small, it may be regarded that determining current Iread&#x2248;IL.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At time T<b>4</b>, when the signal STRBn becomes &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, the differential amplifier <b>23</b> compares the reference voltage VREF_SA with the sense node NSEN. A determination result of data is then loaded into the sense data latch <b>24</b> based on the output signal of the differential amplifier <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At time T<b>5</b>, if the voltage of the sense node NSEN connected to the selected memory cell MC is determined to befalling (Icell&#x3e;IL(&#x2248;Iread)), the selected memory cell MC is assumed to be in the low-resistance state and is read as &#x201c;0&#x201d; data. In subsequent sensing operations, that selected memory cell MC is excluded from the memory cells MC subject to read. Therefore, the bit line discharge signal BLDIS is set to &#x201c;H&#x201d; state, based on the result of the sense data latch <b>24</b>, the bit line discharge transistor <b>25</b> is thereby turned on, and the selected bit line BL(Icell_<b>1</b>) discharged. This results in the cell current Icell no longer flowing in the memory cell MC excluded from the memory cells MC subject to the read operation. The first sensing operation ends at time T<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">At time T<b>6</b>, the signal. EQn is reset to &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, thereby returning the voltage of the sense node NSEN to a state prior to the first sensing operation. The potential of the bit line BL is almost set at the bit line voltage VUX in sense amplifiers <b>20</b> connected to memory cells MC where read data is not established, i.e., memory cells where the bit line BL is not discharged. Moreover, the voltage of the sense node NSEN is at a higher level than the reference voltage VREF_SA. Consequently, in a precharge period from time T<b>6</b>, the voltage of the sense node NSEN, which has small capacitance, is simply returned to the reference voltage VREF_SA. Hence, the precharge is completed in a comparatively short time.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thereafter, a period between time T<b>6</b> and time T<b>10</b>, is a period of the second sensing operation, during which a similar operation to that from time T<b>2</b> to time T<b>6</b> is performed. Selected memory cells MC read as being in the low-resistance state in the second sensing operation are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to read. Therefore, the bit line discharge signal BLDIS is set to &#x201c;H&#x201d; state, based on the result of the sense data latch <b>24</b>, the bit line discharge transistor <b>25</b> is thereby turned on, and the selected bit line BL(Icell_m) discharged. Furthermore, from time T<b>10</b> to time T<b>14</b> is a period of the third sensing operation, during which a similar operation to that from time T<b>2</b> to time T<b>6</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the series of read operations is completed in the third sensing operation, at time T<b>14</b>, the signal BLSEL is set to &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, thereby discharging all of the bit lines BL. Then, at time T<b>15</b>, discharge of the unselected word lines WL is performed, and, at time T<b>16</b>, the main row decoder <b>50</b> and the column decoder <b>40</b> are disabled, thereby completing the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When changing the selected bit lines BL and restarting a next series of read operations, there is no need to set the control signal MWLSEL of the main row decoder <b>50</b> to &#x201c;L&#x201d; state each time. In this case, the enable signal BLSWSEL of the column decoder <b>40</b> is set to &#x201c;L&#x201d; state, then the selected bit line addresses are changed. Then, the signal BLSWSEL is reset to &#x201c;H&#x201d; state allowing the read operation to be continued.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Advantages of the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment are described with reference to a semiconductor memory device in comparative examples. A configuration of the semiconductor memory device in the comparative examples is assumed to be similar to the above-described configuration of the semiconductor memory device in accordance with the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Operation of Semiconductor Memory Device in Accordance with Comparative Examples</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view explaining a read operation in a semiconductor memory device in a comparative example. The semiconductor memory device in the comparative example also reads data simultaneously from a plurality of memory cells MC in the memory cell array <b>10</b>. However, the semiconductor memory device in the comparative example executes the read operation in only a single sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When data is read simultaneously from the plurality (for example, 16) of memory cells MC, a cell current flows towards the single selected word line WL from each of the several of those 16 selected memory cells MC that are in the low-resistance state. If there are a large number of low-resistance state memory cells MC, the voltage of the selected word line WL rises higher than the voltage Vss_row, whereby the voltage between the selected bit lines BL and the selected word line WL becomes less than the desired value dV<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a distribution showing a state when the read operation is executed simultaneously on the plurality of selected memory cells MC. If there are a large number of low-resistance state memory cells MC among the plurality of memory cells MC subject to the multiple-cell simultaneous read, the potential of the selected word line WL rises, whereby the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC decreases to below the supposed value dV<b>1</b>. This leads to the risk that memory cells MC close to the lower limit in the distribution RL can only pass a cell current Icell which is below the determining current I_read and are thus provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state (distribution RH), even if those memory cells MC are in the low-resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In order to prevent this kind of mis-determination, it is required to take the above-described rise in voltage of the selected word line WL into account, and, accordingly, set the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC to be larger than the voltage dV<b>1</b>. A voltage dV<b>2</b> (dV<b>1</b>&#x3c;dV<b>2</b>) can be applied to the selected memory cells MC by adjusting the voltage VUX of the selected bit lines RL or the voltage Vss_row of the selected word line WL.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Symbol &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a distribution showing a state when the read operation is executed simultaneously on the plurality of selected memory cells MC applying the voltage dV<b>2</b> to the plurality of selected memory cells MC. As shown by the distribution of symbol &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, even when there are a large number of low-resistance state memory cells MC among the plurality of memory cells MC subject to the multiple-cell simultaneous read, and accordingly the voltage of the selected word line WL rises, the voltage dV<b>2</b> larger than the voltage dV<b>1</b> may be applied to the memory cells MC to cause the cell current Icell of the low-resistance state memory cells MC to become not less than the determining current I_read. Data can be reliably read.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">However, there must be a sufficient margin between an upper limit of the cell current Icell during read of the memory cells MC and a lower limit value I_rst_min of the resetting current, in order to prevent an erroneous resetting operation from occurring during the read operation. As shown by the distribution of symbol &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the voltage dV<b>2</b> is applied, a sufficient margin cannot be ensured between the lower limit value I_rst_min of the resetting current and the vicinity of the upper limit of the cell current Icell distribution. In this way, there is a possibility that, if the read operation is completed using only a single sensing operation, read-disturb cannot be reliably suppressed at the same time as accurately reading data from the memory cells MC.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view explaining a read operation in a semiconductor memory device in another comparative example. The semiconductor memory device in the other comparative example performs the read operation by a bit-by-bit method in which data is read one-by-one basis from one memory cell MC in the memory cell array <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the case of the bit-by-bit method where data is read from one selected memory cell MC, a single selected bit line BL in the memory cell array <b>10</b> is applied with the selected bit line voltage VUX. Moreover, the single selected word line WL is applied with the selected word line voltage Vss_row. The other unselected bit lines BL and unselected word lines WL are applied with, respectively, the unselected bit line voltage VUB and the unselected word line voltage VUX. When the memory cell MC is read one-by-one, a current does not flow in the other memory cells MC. As a result, only the cell current Icell flowing in the single selected memory cell MC flows into the selected word line WL, and the voltage of the selected word line WL changes only by the voltage drop due to the cell current in the selected memory cell MC itself, thereby causing no problems.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a distribution showing a state when the read operation is performed by the bit-by-bit method applying the voltage dV<b>1</b> to the memory cell MC. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a distribution of low-resistance state memory cells MC which pass a cell current of the determining current I_read or more (RL(&#x201c;0&#x201d;) cell), and a distribution of high-resistance state memory cells MC which pass a cell current below the determining current I_read (RH(&#x201c;1&#x201d;) cell) are illustrated. In the bit-by-bit method, effects of the other memory cells MC need not be considered, hence data can be read precisely from the selected memory cell MC. The determining current I_read is determined from the lower limit value of the distribution of the low-resistance state memory cells MC when this bit-by-bit method is used. If that lower limit value itself is adopted as the determining current I_read, it becomes a determining value allowing read only by the bit-by-bit method. Hence, the determining current I_read is determined after being adjusted enough to allow simultaneous read of several memory cells MC, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the case where the cell current Icell of the read low-resistance state memory cell MC is close to the lower limit of the distribution. Symbol &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the case where the cell current Icell of the read low-resistance state memory cell MC is close to the upper limit of the distribution. In the case of the bit-by-bit method, a certain margin can be obtained between the lower limit value I_rst_min of the resetting current and the upper limit of the distribution of the cell current Icell of the low-resistance state memory cells MC. Moreover, data can also be read accurately from the low-resistance state memory cell MC. However, in the bit-by-bit method, read speed of data is slow, since data is read one-by-one from the memory cell MC in the memory cell array <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In contrast, the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment simultaneously reads data retained in a plurality of memory cells MC. Even when many of the selected memory cells MC as objects of the simultaneous sensing operation in the first sensing operation are in the high-resistance state in the present embodiment, increase in the upper limit of the distribution (refer to symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is quite small as compared to the upper limit of the distribution when reading by the bit-by-bit method (refer to symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). That is, in the present embodiment, there is no need to set read voltage application conditions under which 16 bits have to be read simultaneously. It is sufficient to set voltage application conditions allowing a few bits to be read simultaneously. Therefore, significant increase in the cell current flowing in the memory cells MC can be suppressed, and risk of erroneous resetting during read can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, when the sensing operation is repeated multiple times, memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to a sensing operation in the next sensing operation. As the sensing operation is repeated in this way, the number of selected memory cells MC decreases, hence the current flowing into the selected word line WL decreases. Therefore, the potential rise in the selected word line WL due to the current flowing into the selected word line WL is gradually reduced. Memory cells MC in the low-resistance state but having a small value of cell current Icell are provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state in the first sensing operation. However, in the second and later sensing operations, such memory cells MC are read in a state where the number of memory cells MC subject to simultaneous read is reduced and the potential rise of the selected word line WL is reduced. The distribution of cell current during these second and third sensing operations is close to the distribution when a single memory cell MC is applied with the voltage dV<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), thereby allowing data to be read precisely from the selected memory cells MC. Therefore, there is no risk of low-resistance state (data &#x201c;0&#x201d;) memory cells being erroneously read as high-resistance state (data &#x201c;1&#x201d;) memory cells. The semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment allows data to be read reliably from selected memory cells while also reducing the risk of read-disturb.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the control circuit in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment differs from the first embodiment in comprising a switch transistor <b>183</b> and a capacitor <b>184</b> between the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> and the sense amplifiers <b>20</b>. The switch transistor <b>183</b> is controlled by a signal VROUTn and, when turned off, is capable of setting to a floating state the inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> applied with the reference voltage VREF_SA. In addition, the capacitor <b>184</b> maintains that voltage when the inverting input terminal is set to the floating state.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The read operation employing the control circuit in the semiconductor memory device in the second embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the control signal VROUTn of the added switch transistor <b>183</b> is controlled in a substantially similar manner to the signal EQn.

As a result, simultaneous with precharge of the bit line BL and the sense node NSEN by the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> being completed, the signal EQn and the signal VROUTn become &#x201c;H&#x201d; state, whereby the switch transistor <b>183</b> and the equalize transistor <b>26</b> are turned off. The inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> set to the floating state is maintained at the reference voltage VREF_SA by the capacitor <b>184</b>.

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Advantages of Semiconductor Memory Device in Accordance with Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment also repeats a sensing operation multiple times to determine data retained in memory cells MC. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state each time the sensing operation is performed are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to a sensing operation in the next sensing operation. As the sensing operation is repeated in this way, the number of selected memory cells MC decreases, hence the current flowing into the selected word line WL decreases. This causes the potential rise in word line voltage to be suppressed, and allows data to be reliably read even from memory cells MC in the low-resistance state but having a small value of cell current Icell.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the first embodiment, the load current Idrv_all of the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> during the precharge operation is defined as the total of differences between the reference current IL and the cell current Icell for each of the sense amplifiers <b>20</b>.

On the other hand, during the sensing operation, the reference voltage drive circuit <b>181</b> is not subject to a current load of the kind of the load current Idrv_all, and hence the reference voltage VREF_SA does not change. Consequently, in the control circuit in the first embodiment, it is necessary to be careful there are no effects due to a level difference in the reference voltage VREF_SA in the input terminals of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> during the precharge operation and during the sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">However, in the control circuit in the present embodiment, the inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> applied with the reference voltage VREF_SA is set to the floating state during the sensing operation thereby maintaining that voltage. Even if the reference voltage VREF_SA changes during the precharge operation, that voltage during the precharge operation is maintained also during the sensing operation, hence equalizing precision can be improved.</p>

A configuration of the memory cell array <b>10</b>, peripheral circuits, and so on, in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment is similar to those in the aforementioned semiconductor memory device in the first embodiment.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the control circuit in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment differs from the first and second embodiments in being configured without employing the equalize transistor <b>26</b>, the switch transistor <b>183</b>, and the capacitor <b>184</b>. In the control circuit in the present embodiment, the voltage applied to the inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <b>23</b> is constantly maintained at the reference voltage VREF_SA.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Operation of Semiconductor Memory Device in Accordance with Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The read operation employing the control circuit in the semiconductor memory device in the third embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows states of typical control signals, and voltage values of the word lines WL, bit lines BL, and the sense node NSEN of the sense amplifier <b>20</b>. The timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> differs from those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</figref> in excluding the signal EQn configured to control the equalize transistor <b>26</b> and in excluding the signal VROUTn configured to control the switch transistor <b>183</b>. The timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> also differs from those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</figref> in having an identical waveform for the signal PRECHGns and the signal PRECHGn. Operation timing of the other signals is similar to that in the first and second embodiments. Moreover, voltage values of the word lines WL and bit lines BL are also similar to those in the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the timing chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the precharge voltage of the sense node NSEN and the method of data determination differ from those in the first and second embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">At time T<b>2</b>, the signal BLC becomes &#x201c;H&#x201d; state, whereby the clamp transistor <b>21</b> is turned on. Simultaneously, the reference current IL begins to flow into the bit line BL from the current mirror circuit <b>22</b>. This causes the sense node NSEN to be precharged. In the first and second embodiments, the sense node NSEN is equalized with the inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier <b>23</b>, hence the voltage only rises to the reference voltage VREF_SA. By contrast, in the present embodiment, the signal PRECHGns is set to &#x201c;L&#x201d; state during the bit line precharge period, thereby turning on the PMOS transistors <b>22</b><i>g </i>and <b>22</b><i>f</i>. As a result, the sense node NSEN of the sense amplifier <b>20</b> is charged to the voltage VSEL.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">When the signal PRECHG becomes &#x201c;H&#x201d; state and precharge of the bit lines BL and the sense node NSEN is completed, the sensing operation starts. As mentioned above, the voltage of the sense node NSEN changes due to comparison between the reference current IL supplied by the current mirror circuit <b>22</b> and the cell current Icell. In the control circuit in the present embodiment, the data determination condition is defined by whether or not the sense node NSEN falls to the value of the reference voltage VREF_SA during a certain sensing time tSEN. The value of the determining current I_read employed in the data determination is I_read=Csen&#xb7;(VSEL&#x2212;VREF_SA)/tSEN+IL (where Csen is capacitance of the sense node NSEN). In the sensing operations in accordance with the first and second embodiments, the voltage amplitude for determining data is small, hence it may be regarded that the determining current Iread&#x2248;IL. By contrast, in the present embodiment, the difference between the voltage VSEL of the sense node NSEN and the reference voltage VREF_SA is large, resulting in the component of the first term in the expression for the determining current I_read being increased.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Consequently, a threshold of the cell current Icell with respect to the reference current IL differs from that in the first and second embodiments. However, in the present embodiment, data of the selected memory cell MC can be determined by using the differential amplifier <b>23</b> to detect whether the sense node NSEN oscillates as far as the value of the reference voltage VREF_SA. Likewise in the present embodiment, in each of the periods from time T<b>2</b> to time T<b>6</b>, from time T<b>6</b> to time T<b>10</b>, and from time T<b>10</b> to time T<b>14</b>, a corresponding one of the multiple time sensing operations is executed to perform the read operation, similarly to the first and second embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment also repeats a sensing operation multiple times to determine data retained in memory cells MC. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state each time the sensing operation is performed are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to a sensing operation in the next sensing operation. As the sensing operation is repeated in this way, the number of selected memory cells MC decreases, hence the current flowing into the selected word line WL decreases. This causes the potential rise in word line voltage to be suppressed, and allows data to be reliably read even from memory cells MC in the low-resistance state but having a small value of cell current Icell.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A configuration of the memory cell array <b>10</b>, peripheral circuits, and so on, in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment is similar to that in the semiconductor memory devices in the aforementioned embodiments. A read operation in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view explaining the read operation in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment. Likewise in the read operation in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment, data is read simultaneously from a plurality of memory cells MC in the memory cell array <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment differs from those in previous embodiments in the following point. Namely, in the read operation in the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment, when the sensing operation is repeated two or more times to detect data retained in the memory cells MC, the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC is changed. This read operation is described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a distribution showing a state of the first of the multiply-repeated sensing operations. The selected bit line voltage VUX is set such that a voltage dV<b>3</b> is applied to the selected memory cells MC during this sensing operation. A value of the voltage dV<b>3</b> applied to the memory cells MC is smaller than the voltage dV<b>1</b> applied in the aforementioned embodiments. In the aforementioned embodiments, the selected bit line voltage and the selected word line voltage when the voltage dV<b>1</b> is applied to the selected memory cells MC are assumed to be, for example, 2 V and 0.5 V, respectively. On the other hand, the selected bit line voltage and the selected word line voltage when the voltage dV<b>3</b> is applied to the selected memory cells MC can be set to, for example, 2 V and 0.7 V, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the first sensing operation, the voltage dV<b>3</b> is smaller than the voltage dV<b>1</b>, hence there are more memory cells MC having a cell current Icell falling below the determining current I_read than in the first embodiment shown at symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Therefore, the distribution shown at symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is shifted overall to the left side compared to the distribution shown at symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the first sensing operation, even in the case that many of the selected memory cells MC are in the high-resistance state such that current does not flow into the selected word line WL and the voltage of the selected word line WL does not rise, there are some memory cells MC in which the cell current Icell does fall below the determining current I_read (refer to the distribution shown by the dashed-dotted line at symbol &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Now, the voltage dV<b>3</b> must be set such that the cell current Icell does not fall below the determining current I_read for any of the selected memory cells MC. For example, if many of the selected memory cells MC are in the low-resistance state and there are no memory cells MC in which the cell current Icell is the determining current I_read or more, there will be no memory cells to be excluded from the memory cells subject to a sensing operation in the next sensing operation. Therefore, the voltage dV<b>3</b> is set such that the cell current Icell of memory cells MC in the distribution that have a large cell current Icell will be the determining current I_read or more. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in this first sensing operation are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to a sensing operation in the next sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Symbol &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a distribution showing a state of the second of the multiply-repeated sensing operations. The voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC during the second sensing operation is changed to the same voltage dV<b>1</b> as in the previously-described embodiments. Likewise in the sensing operations in the present embodiment, the number of selected memory cells MC is reduced in the second sensing operation, hence the potential rise in the selected word line WL is suppressed compared to the first sensing operation. In addition, the voltage dV<b>1</b> in the second sensing operation is larger than the voltage dV<b>3</b> in the first sensing operation. Consequently, the voltage applied to the remaining selected memory cells MC subject to the second sensing operation is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Several of the low-resistance state memory cells MC provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state in the first sensing operation have their cell current Icell become the determining current I_read or more in the second sensing operation, and thus may be accurately determined to be in the low-resistance state. These low-resistance state memory cells MC are determined by the sense amplifiers. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the second sensing operation are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to a sensing operation in the next sensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Symbol &#x201c;c&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a distribution showing a state of the third of the multiply-repeated sensing operations. The voltage applied during the third sensing operation is set to dV<b>1</b>+&#x3b2;(&#x2267;dV<b>1</b>). The voltage dV<b>1</b>+&#x3b2; may have the same value as the voltage dV<b>1</b> (&#x3b2;=0), or may have a different value to the voltage dV<b>1</b>. In the third sensing operation, memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state in the first and second sensing operations have their bit lines BL discharged and are not applied with a voltage (shown by shaded circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). As a result, the current flowing into the selected word line WL via the memory cells MC is reduced. The potential rise in the selected word line WL is suppressed compared to the second sensing operation, hence the voltage applied to the remaining selected memory cells MC subject to the third sensing operation is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Consequently, the low-resistance state memory cells MC provisionally determined to be in the high-resistance state in the second sensing operation have their cell current Icell become the determining current I_read or more in the third sensing operation, and thus may be accurately determined to be in the low-resistance state. These low-resistance state memory cells MC are determined by the sense amplifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In this manner, the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment repeats the sensing operation multiple times to determine data retained in the memory cells MC. Further, each time the sensing operation is performed, the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC is given a different value. The voltage dV<b>3</b> applied to the selected memory cells MC during the first sensing operation has a value smaller than that of the voltage dV<b>1</b>. Hence, the upper limit of the cell current Icell during read of the memory cells MC never exceeds the lower limit value I_rst_min of the resetting current. As a result, data can be read accurately without occurrence of read-disturb, even from memory cells MC where a large cell current Icell flows.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Next, operation timing in the control circuit configured to enable such operation is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> are timing charts explaining the read operation. The control circuit employed in the fourth embodiment may be any of the control circuit in the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the control circuit in the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, or the control circuit in the third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a timing chart when employing the control circuit in the first and second embodiments, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a timing chart when employing the control circuit in the third embodiment. Operation timing of signals, and voltage values of the bit lines BL, the sense node NSEN, and so on, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> are similar to those in the corresponding embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The timing charts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> differ from the previously-described embodiments in having the voltage Vss_row applied to the selected word line WL changing each time the sensing operation is performed. The voltage of the selected word line WL is a voltage Vss_row<b>1</b> during the first sensing operation, a voltage Vss_row<b>2</b> during the second sensing operation, and a voltage Vss_row<b>3</b> during the third sensing operation. In the read operation in the present embodiment, the voltage applied to the selected word line WL from the word line drive circuit <b>70</b> each time the sensing operation is performed changes. This allows the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC to be set to a different value each time the sensing operation is performed. Likewise in the present embodiment, in each of the periods from time T<b>2</b> to time T<b>6</b>, from time T<b>6</b> to time T<b>10</b>, and from time T<b>10</b> to time T<b>14</b>, a corresponding one of the multiple time sensing operations is executed to perform the read operation, similarly to the previously-described embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Advantages of Semiconductor Memory Device in Accordance with Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment also repeats a sensing operation multiple times to determine data retained in memory cells MC. Memory cells MC determined to be in the low-resistance state each time the sensing operation is performed are excluded from the memory cells MC subject to a sensing operation in the next sensing operation. As the sensing operation is repeated in this way, the number of selected memory cells MC decreases, hence the current flowing into the selected word line WL decreases. This causes the potential rise in word line voltage to be suppressed, and allows data to be reliably read even from memory cells MC in the low-resistance state but having a small value of cell current Icell.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In addition, when repeating the sensing operation multiple times, the semiconductor memory device in the present embodiment sets the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC to different values. Adjusting to an optimal value the voltage applied to the selected memory cells MC each time the sensing operation in performed allows data to be read reliably even from memory cells MC where a large cell current Icell flows. In particular, during the first sensing operation, by applying the voltage dV<b>3</b> lower than the voltage dV<b>1</b> to the memory cells MC, erroneous resetting operation due to the cell current Icell exceeding the lower limit value I_rst_min of the resetting current can be prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> is a view showing a control circuit in a semiconductor memory device in another example.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the previously-described embodiments, no consideration is given to where the plurality of selected memory cells MC subject to the simultaneous read operation are in the memory cell array <b>10</b>. However, the value of the parasitic resistance up to the word line drive circuit <b>70</b> differs between when the selected memory cells MC are close to the word line drive circuit <b>70</b> and when the selected memory cells MC are distant from the selected memory cells MC.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">For example, the memory cell array <b>10</b> is divided into four regions, namely regions A, B, C, and D. The memory cells MC in each of the regions A-D are selected by the column decoder <b>40</b> and the sub row decoder <b>60</b>, and are connected to certain sense amplifiers <b>20</b> and the word line drive circuit <b>70</b>. Selection of the memory cells MC is performed by a column decoder unit <b>41</b> (aforementioned bit line switch <b>41</b>) and select transistors <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>, and by a sub row decoder unit (aforementioned word line switch <b>61</b>) and select transistors <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>. When a memory cell MC in region A is selected, a parasitic resistance R_bl of the bit line BL, a parasitic resistance R_wl of the word line WL, and, moreover, a parasitic resistance R_wldv in the sub row decoder <b>60</b>, in a path from the word line drive circuit <b>70</b> to the sense amplifiers <b>20</b> via the memory cell MC, are small. Conversely, when a memory cell MC in region C is selected, all of the above-described parasitic resistances become large.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is a distribution showing a state when the read operation is executed simultaneously on a plurality of memory cells MC (during the first sensing operation in the read method in the aforementioned embodiments). If the distributions of cell current in the memory cells MC in region A and cell current in the memory cells MC in region C are displayed separately, the distribution of cell current in region C is displaced in a direction of decreased current compared to the cell current distribution in region A. This is because, as previously mentioned, there is a large parasitic resistance in the current path of the memory cells MC in region C, leading to a large voltage drop effect. Moreover, in the cell current distribution in region A, simultaneously selecting a plurality of memory cells causes the cell current to be displaced to a certain extent in the direction of decreased current compared with the cell current distribution when using the aforementioned bit-by-bit method. The determining current I_read in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is assumed to be similar to the determining current in the read method shown in the aforementioned embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the read method in the aforementioned embodiments, when it comes to the second sensing operation and the third sensing operation, the number of memory cells MC that are simultaneously selected and pass a large cell current decreases, hence the effects of voltage drop are gradually reduced. Therefore, the difference between the cell current in region A and the cell current in region C is gradually reduced. Hence, the read operation in the aforementioned embodiments functions even when the respective regions are selected. However, a difference intrinsically arises in the cell current between region A and region C in the bit-by-bit method, hence it is difficult to optimize the read operation to also adjust and absorb this difference in the cell current, simply by the aforementioned consecutive sensing operations. In other words, a large difference in conditions between region A and region C is not desirable when promoting optimization of more desirable applied voltages and number of sensing times.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, a resistance adjusting circuit <b>71</b>, configured having its resistance value changeable, is connected between the word line drive circuit <b>70</b> and the memory cell array <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a configuration example of the resistance adjusting circuit <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The resistance adjusting circuit <b>71</b> requires a function for adjusting the parasitic resistance (R_wl, R_bl) of wiring material of the word lines WL (and including also the bit lines BL), and a function for adjusting a resistance of wiring material configuring the parasitic resistance R_wldv in the sub row decoder <b>60</b> which is wiring material other than that of the bit lines BL and word lines WL. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, between a node nr<b>1</b> and a node nrm, there is a resistance adjusting circuit employing dummy word lines dummyWL, and between the node nrm and a node nr<b>0</b>, there is a circuit configured to adjust a wiring resistance of other than the word lines WL and bit lines BL. In the resistance adjusting circuit employing the dummy word lines dummyWL, word lines WL employing a partly different structure to that of ordinary word lines WL are used to reference the resistance of the wiring material of the word lines WL.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Consider, for example, the dummy word line dummyWL<b>0</b>. The dummy word line dummyWL<b>0</b> is connected from the node nrm to the wiring layer of the word line WL via a dummy word line switch dsw. The dummy word line dummyWL<b>0</b> then doubles back in region LC and returns once again to the dummy word line switch dsw, as dummy word line dummyWL<b>0</b>&#x2032;, to be connected to node nr<b>1</b>. For example, in the process for forming the word lines WL and bit lines BL using a side wall processing process, there is usually a cut region such as region LC. In the dummy word line portion of this resistance adjusting circuit <b>71</b>, the region LC is left uncut, thereby enabling dummy word lines of doubled-back shape to be easily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">When the word lines WL are doubled back in this way, and when the sheet resistance is the same, the resistance is doubled by the dummy word lines making a round trip. Therefore, by parallelizing using a plurality of dummy word lines and using control signals dwlt_<b>0</b>-dwlt_<b>3</b> to enable adjustment of the number of parallelized dummy word lines, a desired dummy resistance can be inserted in the current path of the cell current.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In addition, in the resistance adjusting circuit between the node nr<b>0</b> and the node nrm, a resistance adjusting path including a plurality of different resistances (Rm_<b>1</b>, Rm_<b>2</b>) can be selected by control signals dmt<b>0</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Enabling adjustment of the resistance (R_wl, R_bl) of the word line WL (and including also the bit line BL) portion in the memory cell array <b>10</b> and enabling adjustment of the resistance (R_wldv) of a portion other than this portion in the memory cell array <b>10</b> in the above-described way makes it possible to adjust the resistance of memory cells MC having a parasitic resistance component that differs according to the position of the selected memory cells MC in the memory cell array <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">For example, if a memory cell MC in region C is selected, the resistance of the word line WL and the parasitic resistance within the sub row decoder <b>60</b> both increase. In this case, the resistance adjusting circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> performs an operation selecting the signals dwlt_<b>0</b> and dmt_<b>0</b> to prevent the resistance increasing any further.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">If a memory cell MC in region B is selected, the resistance of the word line WL is comparatively reduced, hence, for example, the signals dwlt_<b>1</b> and dwlt_<b>2</b>, and the signal dmt_<b>0</b> are selected. As a result, the dummy word line resistance adjusted by the signals dwlt_<b>1</b> and dwlt_<b>2</b> is added, whereby the resistance of the current path of the memory cell MC in region B approaches the resistance of the aforementioned current path in region C.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">If a memory cell MC in region A is selected, then, for example, the signals dwlt_<b>1</b> and dwlt_<b>2</b>, and the signal dmt_<b>1</b> are selected, since region A is a region where the resistance of the current path is smallest. In this case, not only is the resistance due to the dummy word line added, but also the resistance Rm_<b>1</b> to adjust the parasitic resistance of other non-word line wiring is added, whereby the resistance of the current path of the memory cell MC in region C is approached.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The dummy word line switch dsw_off in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is used when the unselected word line voltage VUX is applied without using the resistance adjusting circuit of the dummy word lines dummyWL. The dummy word line switch dsw_off is turned off, and the node nrm and node nr<b>1</b> are directly connected by the signal dwit_<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When the read operation is executed, an approximate value of the parasitic resistance from the selected memory cell MC to the word line drive circuit <b>70</b> can be known based on the address of the selected memory cell MC. Setting the resistance value of the resistance adjusting circuit <b>71</b> to an optimum value such that values of this parasitic resistance are aligned enables voltage application conditions when memory cells MC in each region are selected to be aligned. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, when a bias application is performed during the read operation, the difference in cell current distribution of memory cells MC between region A and region C can be reduced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> is a representation of the cell current distribution during an initial sensing operation in the read operation of the aforementioned embodiments. The cell current distribution is under the determining current I_read, but continuing to perform the sensing operation a second and third time by the aforementioned method makes it possible to complete read under the determining current I_read. By thus performing the read operation in conjunction with an adjustment for position dependency of the cell current in the selected memory cells MC using the resistance adjusting circuit <b>71</b>, data can be read more accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Note that this dummy word line dummyWL can be provided along with an ordinary word line WL in an ordinary memory cell array <b>10</b>. In this case, the memory cell MC formed at an intersection of the dummy word line dummyWL and the bit line BL must be a memory cell MC that is not executed a forming operation. If the dummy word line dummyWL is provided in the memory cell array <b>10</b>, when a certain memory cell MC is selected, a dummy word line in the same memory cell array <b>10</b> can be used as the dummy word line dummyWL. In addition, when a certain memory cell MC is selected, a dummy word line dummyWL disposed in another unselected memory cell array <b>10</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Even if the memory cell MC formed in the dummy word line dummyWL is a memory cell MC that is not executed the forming operation and is in an unselected memory cell array <b>10</b>, it is desirable that that memory cell MC is applied with only an extremely weak bias. In addition, a configuration may be adopted in which the memory cell MC or diode Di are not formed at the intersection of the dummy word line dummyWL and the bit line BL. In that case, although the processing step becomes rather complex, the above-described limitations are removed, whereby resistance adjustment becomes more easily controllable.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">This concludes description of embodiments of the present invention, but it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and that various alterations, additions, and so on, are possible within a range not departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, in the embodiments, the read operation in a resistive memory device was described. However, the embodiments may also be applied to a verify operation for verifying whether a selected memory cell MC transitions to a desired resistance state subsequent to the setting operation or resetting operation. For example, in the case of a setting verify operation for verifying if a memory cell MC transitions to the low-resistance state, it is not always the case that all the memory cells MC transition to the low-resistance state. In this case, although it cannot be determined that the memory cell MC is in the low-resistance state even on performing the sensing operation a certain number of times, a result signifying &#x2018;verify fail&#x2019; can be obtained. Based on this verify result, a setting operation is reliably executed on the &#x2018;verify fail&#x2019; memory cell MC in the next setting pulse application operation.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In addition, in the embodiments, the sensing operation is described as being repeated three times. However, the number of times the sensing operation is repeated is not limited to three. The number of times the sensing operation is repeated can be selected as desired based on the time required for the read operation, the precision of the write operation, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions. Indeed, the novel embodiments described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms; furthermore, various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form of the embodiments described herein may be made without departing from the spirit of the inventions. The accompanying claims and their equivalents are intended to cover such forms or modifications as would fall within the scope and spirit of the inventions.</p>
