<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/AU2008/000020 filed Jan. 10, 2008 and which claims the benefit of Australian Patent Application No. 2007900274, the disclosures of all applications being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a variable angle plate pump/motor and the associated hydraulic circuits and more particularly but not exclusively to such a pump/motor and its hydraulic circuit when used in a regenerative drive system for a motor vehicle such as a motor lorry.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Described in International Patent Applications PCT/AU2005/001241, PCT/AU2006/001426, PCT/AU2003/001235, PCT/AU2003/001238, PCT/AU2003/001236, PCT/AU2003/001237, PCT/AU2003/000757, PCT/AU2003/001237, PCT/AU2003/00040, PCT/AU2003/00042 and PCT/AU2003/00041 are regenerative drive systems, including pumps/motors, electrical and hydraulic control systems, particularly adapted for motor lorries for the purposes of recovering energy that would be normally dissipated when a motor lorry is deaccelerating.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the above International application PCT/AU2006/001426 there is described a variable angle swash plate pump/motor and an associated hydraulic circuit to be used in a regenerative drive system for a motor vehicle such as a motor lorry. Hydraulic fluid under pressure is generated internally of the pump/motor to vary the angle of the swash plate. The pump/motor is operatively associated with the main drive train of the motor lorry via a clutch. When the clutch is disengaged, the pump/motor is held in a pumping mode so that when the clutch is engaged it will generate pressure enabling operation of the swash plate. This takes time and represents a substantial loss of energy that could be captured. It must be kept in mind that the clutch is engaged at the very start of a cycle, a time at which maximum energy should be captured.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A still further problem in respect of the above discussed pump/motor is that it must be adapted to revert to a pumping mode when not being driven. This adds to the complexity of the pump/motor and can limit the range of available pump/motors.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is the object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate at least one of the above disadvantages.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">In the accompanying drawings there is schematically depicted an assembly <b>10</b> forming part of a regenerative drive system of a motor lorry. The motor lorry has a drive train that is operatively associated with the assembly <b>10</b> so as to cause operation of the assembly <b>10</b> to store energy, or alternatively to be driven by the assembly <b>10</b> by depletion of energy stored by the assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">The assembly <b>10</b> includes a variable angle swash plate pump/motor <b>11</b> from which there extends a shaft <b>12</b>. The shaft <b>12</b> is coupled to a clutch <b>13</b>, with the clutch <b>13</b> connecting the shaft <b>12</b> and a first gear (first driven member) <b>14</b>. The gear <b>14</b> is meshingly engaged with a second gear (second driven member) <b>15</b>. The gear <b>15</b> drives or is driven by the main drive train of the motor lorry.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">When the motor lorry is de-accelerating, the clutch <b>13</b> is engaged so that the gear <b>15</b> drives the pump/motor <b>11</b>. Driving of the pump/motor <b>11</b> charges a reservoir <b>16</b> via a hydraulic circuit <b>17</b>, the hydraulic circuit <b>17</b> being more fully described in International patent application PCT/AU2006/001426. When the reservoir <b>16</b> is charged, the stored energy may be used to drive the motor lorry by the circuit <b>17</b> discharging hydraulic fluid under pressure stored in the reservoir <b>16</b> via the pump/motor <b>11</b>, causing the pump/motor <b>11</b> to act as a motor and drive the shaft <b>12</b>. The clutch <b>13</b> would be engaged so that the shaft <b>12</b> is drivingly associated with the gear <b>15</b> that in turn drives the main drive train of the motor lorry.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">The pump/motor <b>11</b> includes a variable angle swash plate <b>18</b> that is moved by a hydraulic actuator <b>19</b>. Operation of the actuator <b>19</b>, by the delivery of hydraulic fluid under pressure thereto, causes the plate <b>18</b> to change in angle and therefore change the operative capacity of the pump/motor <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">Assuming the reservoir <b>16</b> has sufficient hydraulic fluid under pressure, the circuit <b>17</b> can be operated to deliver hydraulic fluid under pressure to a hydraulic line <b>20</b> communicating with the actuator <b>19</b> to cause operation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">More particularly the actuator <b>19</b> has a first port <b>21</b> and a second port <b>22</b>. The line <b>20</b> delivers hydraulic fluid under pressure to the line <b>22</b> as well as a valve <b>23</b>. The valve <b>23</b> is also connected to the port <b>21</b>. By operation of the valve <b>23</b> pressure is varied between the ports <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> to change the angle of the plate <b>18</b> by operation of the actuator <b>19</b>. In the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, both ports <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are receiving hydraulic fluid under pressure so that the actuator <b>19</b> is essentially in a &#x201c;central&#x201d; position. In a second configuration, the valve <b>23</b> will deliver hydraulic fluid under pressure to the port <b>21</b> but vent port <b>22</b> to a tank <b>24</b>. Accordingly the angle of the swash plate <b>18</b> will be changed by operation of the actuator <b>19</b>. In a second configuration of the valve <b>23</b>, the port <b>22</b> receives hydraulic fluid under pressure while the port <b>21</b> is vented to the tank <b>24</b>. The angle of the plate <b>18</b> will change accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">The assembly <b>10</b> also includes a hydraulic circuit <b>25</b> that includes a reservoir <b>26</b> that receives hydraulic fluid under pressure. The circuit <b>25</b> further includes a pump <b>27</b> and an electric motor <b>28</b> that drives the pump <b>27</b> to produce hydraulic fluid under pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">The circuit <b>25</b> has an hydraulic line <b>29</b> that is connected with the line <b>20</b> so as to deliver hydraulic fluid under pressure to the valve <b>23</b> by extending between the motor/pump <b>11</b> and the reservoir <b>26</b>. The pump <b>27</b> is also connected to the line <b>29</b> so that when operated by the motor <b>28</b>, hydraulic fluid under pressure is delivered to the reservoir <b>26</b> to charge the reservoir <b>26</b>. The circuit <b>25</b> includes a spool valve <b>30</b> that is operated to deliver hydraulic fluid under pressure via a line <b>31</b> to the clutch <b>13</b>, or alternatively to drain hydraulic fluid from the clutch <b>13</b> to a tank <b>32</b>. Accordingly operation of the clutch <b>13</b> is controlled via the valve <b>30</b>. Hydraulic fluid under pressure is delivered to the valve <b>30</b> via a pressure regulating valve <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">A first pressure sensitive switch <b>34</b> (assuming the assembly <b>10</b> is operative) activates the motor <b>28</b> when pressure in the line <b>29</b> falls bellows a predetermined pressure. When the pressure exceeds a predetermined pressure, the pressure sensitive switch <b>35</b> turns the motor <b>28</b> off.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">The valve <b>30</b> in a first configuration (as shown in the accompanying drawings) connects the clutch <b>13</b> with the tank <b>32</b> so that the clutch <b>13</b> is open and therefore drivingly disconnecting the shaft <b>12</b> and gear <b>15</b>. In a second configuration the valve <b>30</b> disconnects the line <b>31</b> from the tank <b>32</b> and connects the reservoir <b>26</b> with the clutch <b>13</b> to cause operation of the clutch <b>13</b> to therefore drivingly disconnect the shaft <b>12</b> with respect to the gear <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">The pump/motor <b>11</b> is also connected to a tank <b>36</b> via a line <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">As also can be noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, hydraulic fluid under pressure in the reservoir <b>16</b> cannot be used to charge the reservoir <b>26</b> due to the valve <b>40</b>. The one-way valve <b>38</b> prevents flow from the line <b>29</b> to the line <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">Start-Up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036">When the assembly <b>10</b> is first activated by an electronic control (such as that described in PCT/AU2005/001241), the control would sense that switch <b>34</b> is closed, that is there is low pressure in the line <b>29</b>. The motor <b>28</b> would then be activated so that the pump <b>27</b> charges the reservoir <b>26</b>. This will continue until the switch <b>35</b> detects that there is a maximum pressure in the line <b>29</b>, thereby turning the motor <b>28</b> off. The switch <b>35</b> could also be replaced with a &#x201c;timer&#x201d; that would limit the time the motor <b>28</b> is operative. By way of a safety mechanism, a valve <b>39</b> is provided that would vent excess pressure to the tank <b>32</b> should the switch <b>35</b> fail. Accordingly the reservoir <b>26</b> is charged thereby enabling operation of the actuator <b>19</b> by operation of the valve <b>23</b>. In that regard, it should be appreciate the valve <b>23</b> is electrically operated and again would be operatively associated with the control system described in International patent application PCT/AU2205/001241.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">Circuit Ready (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">When the reservoir <b>26</b> is charged the line <b>29</b> has sufficient pressure. Accordingly the motor <b>28</b> is turned off and therefore is generally inoperative.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">Clutch Engagement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">When the clutch <b>13</b> drivingly connects the shaft <b>12</b> and gear <b>15</b>, the valve <b>30</b> is operated to deliver hydraulic fluid under pressure from the line <b>29</b> to the line <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0041">Clutch Steady State Operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">Once the clutch <b>13</b> is engaged, there is no further flow although pressure is maintained in the line <b>31</b> as well as line <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">Reservoir Charge-Up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">During operation of the above described assembly <b>10</b>, should the pressure in the line <b>29</b> drop below a predetermined pressure, the switch <b>35</b> will cause operation of the motor <b>28</b> to drive the pump <b>27</b> to restore pressure in the reservoir <b>26</b> so that this pressure is available to the pump/motor <b>11</b> for the purposes of operating the actuator <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">Clutch Disengagement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">When the clutch <b>13</b> is to be disengaged, the valve <b>30</b> is operated so as to connect the line <b>31</b> to the tank <b>32</b>. This drains pressure from the clutch <b>13</b> causing it to disengage the shaft from gear <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">Shut Down (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">When the assembly <b>10</b> is to be inoperative, the valve <b>30</b> will revert to a configuration at which the line <b>31</b> is connected to the tank <b>24</b>, thereby draining hydraulic fluid from the clutch <b>13</b>. An overall control system will also deactivate the motor <b>28</b>, to position the plate <b>18</b> prior to or during clutch engagement to address the issue of is capturing maximum energy from the motor lorry decelerating or returning capturing energy more rapidly to the motor lorry accelerating.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">In the above preferred embodiment, the variable volume pump is a variable angle swash plate pump <b>11</b>. Other variable volume pumps may be employed, for example pumps that employ electronically controlled valves to change the pump capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">The above described preferred embodiment has the advantage of providing the pump/motor <b>11</b> with hydraulic fluid under pressure to position the plate <b>18</b> to address the issue of capturing maximum energy from the motor lorry decelerating.</p>
