<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the present invention features a penile enhancer apparatus <b>100</b> comprising an elongated tube <b>110</b> having a proximal end <b>111</b> and a distal end <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the tube <b>110</b> is a straight tube. In some embodiments, the tube <b>110</b> is a bent tube. In some embodiments, the tube <b>110</b> is a curved tube (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). In some embodiments, the tube <b>110</b> has an inner wall <b>116</b> and an outer wall <b>117</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A first opening <b>120</b> is disposed at the proximal end <b>111</b> for insertion of a penis. In some embodiments, a base groove <b>119</b> is disposed at the proximal end (e.g., for comfort). In some embodiments, the proximal end <b>111</b> is angled, for example the proximal end <b>111</b> is formed at an angle with respect to an upper lip <b>115</b> and lower lip <b>116</b> of the opening. Without wishing to limit the present invention to any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the angled proximal end <b>111</b> is advantageous because it allows for a more comfortable and better anatomic fit while the apparatus is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The angle may be of various sizes (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, <b>1</b>D). For example, in some embodiments, the angle is about 20 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle is between about 5 to 10 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle is between about 10 to 15 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle is between about 15 to 20 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle is between about 20 to 25 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle is between about 25 to 30 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle is more than about 30 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; refers to plus or minus 10% of the referenced number. For example, an embodiment wherein the angle is about 20 degrees includes an angle that is between 18 and 22 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The diameter of the first opening <b>120</b> can be adjusted, for example via an adjustment means. In some embodiments, the adjustment means comprises opposing doors, for example a first door <b>210</b> and a second door <b>220</b> that are arranged on opposing sides of the first opening <b>120</b> (e.g., upper lip <b>115</b> and lower lip <b>116</b>, or first side and second side). The first door <b>210</b> is pivotally attached to the first opening <b>120</b> via first hinges <b>230</b><i>a </i>and the second door <b>220</b> is pivotally attached to the first opening <b>120</b> via second hinges <b>230</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first door <b>210</b> and second door <b>220</b> can move between a closed position wherein the doors cover a portion of the first opening <b>120</b> and an open position wherein the doors do not cover a portion of the first opening <b>120</b>. When the doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are in the closed position, the doors <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may be secured together via a snap mechanism (e.g., interlocking joints <b>228</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first door <b>210</b> and second door <b>220</b> may have a generally rounded U-shape. When both doors are in the closed position, second opening is formed wherein the second opening is a portion of the first opening <b>120</b>. The diameter of the second opening is less than that of the first opening <b>120</b>. The doors may be interchangeable to provide for various second openings with various reduced diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Without wishing to limit the present invention to any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the ability to adjust the diameter of the opening of the proximal end (e.g., first opening <b>120</b>, second opening) is advantageous because it may help reduce the area of the abdomen exposed to negative air pressure when the apparatus <b>100</b> is attached to a vacuum pump. Also, the adjustable diameter allows a user to increase the diameter as he achieves an erection.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention further comprises an aperture <b>150</b> disposed on the tube <b>110</b> for withdrawing air and creating a vacuum in the apparatus <b>100</b>. A vacuum pump can be attached to the aperture <b>150</b>. Vacuum pumps are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the aperture <b>150</b> is a one-way valve <b>157</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, in some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises a strap <b>610</b> attachable to the tube <b>110</b>. The strap <b>610</b> may be used with the curved tube <b>110</b>. The strap <b>610</b> may help to secure the apparatus <b>100</b> in place if a user is walking or moving. In some embodiments, the first end of the strap <b>610</b> attaches to a base attachment ring <b>350</b> at or near the proximal end <b>111</b> of the tube <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the second end of the strap <b>610</b> attaches to a top attachment ring <b>360</b> at or near the distal end <b>112</b> of the tube <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention can be used as an adaptor <b>500</b> for a second penile enhancer tube <b>900</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the distal end <b>112</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a connector means <b>550</b> to fluidly engage the second enhancer tube <b>900</b>. The connector means <b>550</b> may be a telescopic joint. For example, the distal end <b>112</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> may telescopically receive the outer end of the second penile enhancer tube <b>900</b>. In some embodiments, a rubber coating <b>552</b> is disposed on the connector means <b>550</b> to help secure the apparatus <b>100</b> and second penile enhancer tube <b>900</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises a neck region <b>440</b> disposed at the proximal end <b>111</b> (e.g., an extension of the proximal end <b>111</b>). The neck region <b>440</b> has a smaller diameter as compared to the remainder of the tube <b>110</b> (e.g., the region extending towards the distal end <b>112</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
