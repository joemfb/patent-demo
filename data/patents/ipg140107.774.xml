<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a delta robot, comprising a stationary base plate and at least three drives fastened thereon, which are in each case connected to at least one arm, of which at least one is connected at the other end thereof to two rods by way of a ball joint, said rods running parallel to each other and at the other end thereof being connected, via a further ball joint, to a movable parallel plate, wherein each ball joint has a ball segment head and a hollow ball segment designed complementary thereto, and the two ball joints, which adjoin each other on parallel rods, are oriented mirror-symmetrically to each other, and each hollow ball segment is pressed onto the associated ball segment head by tensioning at least one permanently elastic element between two rods that are parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the prior art, delta robots have proven their worth in particular for packaging lightweight foods, since they permit extremely high dynamics of up to three packaging operations per second.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first delta robots had three arms. However, variants with four and more arms are known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the prior art, most delta robots consist of a base plate on which three servo drives are mounted. At the drive shaft thereof, an arm&#x2014;also known as upper arm&#x2014;is attached, on which, as lower arm, two parallel rods are pivotably mount, which in turn are in pivotable connection with the parallel plate. By a swivelling of the servo drives, the parallel plate can be manoeuvred into any desired position of the available work space. Because the underarms consist of two parallel rods, the parallel plate thus always moves&#x2014;as its name suggests&#x2014;parallel to the base plate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In principle, a universal joint or cardan joint can be used for the articulated connection of the rods to the arms and to the parallel plate. The maximum pivoting angles that can thereby be achieved, however, are significantly lower in comparison to a ball joint, consisting of a ball segment head and a complementary hollow ball segment sliding thereon. Because ball joints thus have a larger pivot angle and thereby permit a larger working space, they are now the joint design most used for delta robots.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the prior art, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,333,514, Osamu Toyama, discloses a delta robot, the lower arm of which consists of parallel rod pairs, at the ends of which hollow ball segments, also designated ball sockets or ball cups, are arranged, and are pressed onto the ball segment heads on the arm or on the parallel plate in that the ends of the two parallel rod-shaped lower arms are held together by tensioning springs. The hollow ball segment then moves on the ball head in the manner of a sliding bearing. A considerable advantage of this bearing is that a similar contact area is produced at every angle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The various depictions of the rods in U.S. Pat. No. 5,333,514 show the same width from all points of view, from which it follows that the rods have a round cross-section. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the patent, it can be seen that the rods are a thin-walled tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There, it is also shown that the opening surfaces of the hollow ball segments of the ball joints are oriented in an extension of the centre axis.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, from this arrangement&#x2014;which is typical in the prior art&#x2014;it emerges as the major disadvantage that the rods are asymmetrically loaded, and therefore can easily bend, as is explained below: In a tube, the centre axis is also the longitudinal support axis. If a force acts in the direction of this longitudinal support axis, then the tube is precisely symmetrically loaded and the forces are distributed to all regions of the tube wall and the maximum of the load bearing capacity of the tube is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, as soon as the loading migrates from the longitudinal support axle, part of the tube wall is more strongly loaded than the other parts, and collapses, although the maximum load-bearing strength of the tube has not yet been reached.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Since, in a ball joint, the forces are distributed beyond the contact surface, in the aforementioned arrangement, compresses forces that are introduced, via a ball head and the associated hollow ball segment, into a road are disadvantageously not transmitted into the longitudinal support axis, but outside thereof. Therefore, on that side at which the hollow ball segment is arranged, the tube will collapse already at compressive loads that lie below the maximum load-bearing capacity of the tube.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Against this background, it is the object of the invention, in a delta robot, to arrange the connection between a ball joint and a rod of the lower arm, such that tensile or compressive forces are distributed uniformly on the rod and do not load it with additional bending moments, so that its load-bearing capacity is exploited to the full extent.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As solution, the invention proposes that the centre of at least one ball segment head is arranged displaced with respect to the longitudinal support axis of the rod connected to the ball joint, and the direction of displacement points centrally away from the hollow ball segment and the amount of the displacement is smaller than the radius of the ball segment head.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The advantages and significant features of the invention are illustrated on the practical example of a rod in the form of a tube, because that is a very widely used configuration for delta robots, and can also be comparatively simply explained. It is easy to understand the longitudinal support axis for a tube is the centre axis, since when a tube is loaded with a force precisely in the direction of the centre axis, the forces are uniformly distributed in the wall of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The gist of the invention is therefore to ensure that the tensile or compressive force exerted from the ball joint on the rod is also directed in the direction of the longitudinal support axis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To transfer the force from the ball segment head to the rod, a hollow ball segment is used. In the prior art, it was assumed that the resulting force, which the hollow ball segments exerts in the longitudinal direction on the rod bears is applied at the front edge of the opening of hollow ball segment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">On a precise consideration of the force distribution, however, it becomes clear that this assumption is not correct. The force in a ball joint is rather distributed over the surface. The resulting force vector of all the forces acting from the hollow ball segment in the longitudinal direction of the rod therefore continues to lie in the interior of the hollow ball segment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The gist of the invention is therefore to displace the hollow ball segment with respect to the longitudinal axis of the rod to the extent that the resulting force of the hollow ball segment is shifted into the longitudinal support axis. To this end the hollow ball segment must be displaced with respect to the longitudinal axis of the rod in a direction that points centrally through the hollow ball segment. The amount of the displacement is always less than the radius of the ball segment head.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is readily apparent that a displacement by the entire amount of the radius does not provide an improvement In the sense of the object of the invention, but only transfers the unevenness of the force distribution to the opposite side of the wall of the tube. The optimum lies in between, that is to say at an amount of the displacement that is greater than zero and smaller than the radius of the ball segment head. An improvement is already achieved when the amount of the displacement is greater than &#xbc; and smaller than &#xbe; of the radius of the ball segment head.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For calculating the sum vector of all components of the tensile and compressive forces oriented parallel to the longitudinal support axis of the rod, the curve must be used, on which those components of the tensile and compressive forces running in the direction of the longitudinal support axis are plotted against a radius running perpendicular to the aforementioned longitudinal support axis. The force distribution over that radius of the hollow sphere that runs through the centre of its opening and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rod that it is connected to is also relevant. This force distribution can also be represented by a force distribution curve. The centroid of the area beneath this force distribution curve lies on that point of the radius at which the sum of all force vectors would have the same effect as when a single force vector acted in this point.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This is the amount by which the centre of the hollow ball segment must be displaced with respect to the longitudinal support axis if it is to be optimized for the components of the compressive and tensile forces acting in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The longitudinal support axis in the case of a cylindrical or hollow cylindrical rod is its centre line, which is easy to comprehend, for which reason the explanations given above are based on the easy-to-explain example of a tubular rod.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the most general case, however, the rod can also be of arbitrary shape, thus not having a uniform profile along its length. An example of such a form is similar to the thigh bone in the case of humans and animals, which has been shaped by evolution into an optimum ratio between material outlay and load-bearing strength. A similar form can be produced, for example, from aluminium foam and used as the lower arm of a robot. For this shape as for others, the longitudinal support axis is the connection of the centroids of all the cross-sections of the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is only in a further restriction that the rod has a uniform profile along the length. However, this profile must not necessarily be a tube but can also assume any other arbitrary shape.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Examples of suitable other profiles result from the tensioning spring, which in each case connects two adjacent rods and acts with high lateral forces on the rod, so that it is subject to bending moments. It is suitable to reinforce the rod by giving it, for example, the profile of a rectangle, an elongated polygon, an oval or an ellipse. The longitudinal axis of this profile should then point in the direction of the tensioning spring.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A suitable variant is that the opening area of the hollow ball segment is a plane that runs parallel to the longitudinal support axis. Then the transfer of the tensile forces to the hollow ball segment behaves in the same way as the transfer of the compressive forces.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hollow ball segment preferably comprises the ball segment head&#x2014;with respect to the centre&#x2014;at an angle of 180&#xb0;. In this case, the laterally occurring forces are lowest and therefore the bending load of the rods is also minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, in another variant it is also possible that the encompassing angle is less than 180&#xb0;. An advantage of this configuration is that the pivot angle of the ball joint. Another advantage is the function as overload protection: As of a force limit determined by the force of the permanently elastic elements for holding together two adjacent ball joints, the hollow ball segments jump off the ball segment heads. As a result, the arms and gears in the drive are effectively protected against damage. It must also be taken into account that the laterally acting force components become greater.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another variant, the hollow ball segment has two openings, which lie opposite one another, such that the ball segment head is then enclosed in an annular manner. The advantage of this configuration is that the resulting force application point only displaces a little, even with loads increasing in pulses, and therefore permits even greater exploitation of the maximum load-bearing strength of the rod. This configuration could also be appropriate in particular for delta robots with very high short-term overloading.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another advantage is that the necessary force of the permanently elastic element is minimized. By virtue of the ball joints on the arms at both sides, only forces in the arm direction and against the spring force can be transmitted. Forces against the springs are caused by the mass inertias in the case of acceleration processes and by the normal forces occurring on the wall of the hollow ball segment. By virtue of the annular recess, that region of the surface is removed that would generate the greatest transverse forces.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It has proven suitable in the case of delta robots for a long time to provide the inner surface of the hollow ball segment and/or the surface of the associated ball segment head with a layer of elastic and very slidable plastic. In an efficient embodiment, a hollow-spherical plastic insert is fastened in the hollow ball segment.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The example from the prior art mentioned at the outset has a hollow ball segment at the ends of the rod. In this case, a complementary ball segment head in each case is mounted on the arms and on the parallel plate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The example of the thigh bone shows that an inverse combination is also possible, that is to day the ball heads are formed on the rods and complementary hollow ball segments are formed in the arms and in the parallel plate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In contrast to the above-mentioned bone-like form with a non-uniform profile over the length of the rod, which must be cast or machined from the solid, the rods of the delta robot, in practice, will usually have a uniform profile along their length, because the profiles can be produced easily by extrusion or folding or rolling of sheet metals. A shape that is appropriate both in terms of manufacturing technology and statics is a tube.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Independently of the form, a wide variety of materials can be used for the rods. Glass fibre-reinforced plastics (GRP) have been known for some time. In the state of the art, carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics (CRP) are most widespread. In principle, other admixtures in plastics or other plastics are also conceivable. As material for the rods, formed sheet metal or metal foam, such as foamed aluminium, have already been mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As variant, it is conceivable that the metal foam is foamed in a mould that not only contains the surface of the rod but also the ball head connected thereto. In this case, the outer skin of the foamed, one-piece part is homogeneous and therefore harder and more durable than the interior, which is made lighter by numerous cavities without sacrificing its load-bearing strength too much.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The limitation of this manufacturing method is the outlay for manufacturing the mould and the casting, so that this variant is interesting in particular for larger quantities.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A very much lower outlay for the production of the individual rod is required by metal tubes, since they are available in the most varied dimensions, wall thicknesses and materials. The production of the lower arms from metal tube is therefore comparatively very cost effective even for very small quantities.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An inherent disadvantage of metal tubes in comparison to tubes of CRP with the same load-bearing strength is the higher weight of the metal tubes. The weight influences mass moment of inertia with the fourth power of the effective pivot radius and therefore the achievable dynamics of the robot.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In comparison to previous arrangements, however, the metal tube can, as a result of the arrangement according to the invention of the ball segment, be made so much lighter that this disadvantage with respect to CRP is compensated. For the same dynamics, the delta robot, despite a thinner wall thickness of its lower arms, can carry the same maximum payload.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In principle, it is not out of the question to use bamboo tube, wood and/or another natural material, as material for the rods. Conceivable application possibilities are, e.g., wood-processing machinery. In these cases, too, an arrangement according to the invention of the ball joint with respect to the longitudinal support axis ensures uniform loading of the rods and therefore better utilization of its maximum load bearing strength.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a further variant in the interests of the object of further reducing the flexural loading of the rods, it is appropriate to further extend a hollow spherical segment with 180&#xb0; enclosure of the ball segment head by means of a hollow cylinder with the same internal radius. Although this hollow cylinder limits the maximum possible pivot angle of the ball joint somewhat, it avoids a &#x201c;lateral sliding off&#x201d; of the two rods with respect to one another. By this means, the flexural loading of the rod is further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the prior art, the permanently elastic elements&#x2014;such as springs&#x2014;which keep the hollow ball segments on the ball head segments were always articulated in the centre of a round or tubular rod. Since, with an arrangement of round rods according to the invention, their centre axis no longer connects the centre points of the ball head segments but is arranged outside this line, the springs would no longer lie on the line between the centres of rotation of the ball head segments.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">However that would have the consequence that, on pivoting of the rods, the distance between the articulation points of the springs would change so that the springs would have to expand and contract repeatedly, which, in view of the large number of load cycles of a delta robot, would lead to premature rupture of the springs necks.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The invention therefore proposes that the pivot axes of the permanently elastic elements are arranged on a straight connecting line between the centres of rotation of the two ball joints at both ends of the respective rod. They are therefore arranged outside the centre line of the rods.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The springs, which tension the two parallel-guiding rods to one another, are a source of bending moments that act on the rods. According to the prior art, only one spring in each case is arranged in the vicinity of each ball joint. Alternatively, it is proposed to extend the rod beyond the ball joint and also to arrange another tensioning spring on the other side of the ball joint. If these two tensioning springs have approximately the same characteristics, no bending movements occur, as a result, which are transmitted into the rod and can contribute to a bending of the rod in its centre between the two ball joints.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURE AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the schematic diagram of a delta robot according to the invention with tensile-spring-stabilized rods <b>32</b>. At the upper edge of the drawing, the base plate <b>1</b> with its three approximately fork-shaped receptacles for the arms <b>31</b> and the servo drives <b>2</b> can be seen, which, via their drive shaft <b>21</b>, move the arms <b>31</b> like a crank. At the ends of each arm <b>31</b>, one pair of rods <b>32</b> in each case is connected via ball joints <b>5</b>. Also via ball joints <b>5</b>, this pair of rods <b>32</b> is again connected to the parallel plate <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The parallel plate <b>4</b> therefore always remains parallel to the stationary base plate <b>1</b>, independently of in which positions of the achievable pivot space of the delta robot it moves.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the parallel plate <b>4</b>, a good pickup, a tool, a sensor, such as a camera, or another object can be fixed, which determines the actual activity of the delta robot, and is moved by it into the particular desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is shown how each pair of rods <b>32</b> is held together at the upper and lower end by a permanently elastic element <b>6</b>. It is only in the case of the arm <b>31</b> that faces forward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that the connection to the rods <b>32</b> actually attached thereto is broken in the drawing. By this means, on the right-hand side, the hollow ball segment <b>52</b> is visible, which, in this perspective, allows a view into its hemispherical depression. This socket-like depression is complementary in shape to the ball segment head <b>51</b>. One such is visible at the left-hand side of the arm <b>31</b> at the front in the drawing, because the rod <b>32</b> actually connected thereto is cutaway in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For the sake of clarity, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the permanently elastic element <b>6</b> is omitted at the upper ends of the two forward-facing rods <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is clear that the tensioning springs <b>6</b> in each case press a pair of rods <b>32</b>, with the hollow ball segments <b>52</b> fastened thereon, onto the ball segment heads <b>51</b>, and in this manner ensure the functioning of the ball joints <b>5</b>. It is also clear that, for a relatively high tensile force of the tensioning springs <b>6</b>, the hollow ball segments <b>51</b> always in full-area contact with the associated ball segment head <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a section through a ball joint <b>5</b>. The ball segment head <b>51</b> encloses the hollow ball segment <b>52</b> with an enclosing angle of approx. 180&#xb0;, a plastic layer <b>54</b> separating the two elements from one another, and the coefficients of static and dynamic friction between the hollow ball and ball segment being considerably improved.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The ball segment head <b>51</b> is fixed on an arm <b>31</b>&#x2014;not shown here&#x2014;or on the parallel plate <b>4</b>&#x2014;which is also not shown here.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The hollow ball segment <b>52</b> merges into the rod <b>32</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, this consists of a massive attachment <b>54</b> and a hollow cylinder <b>34</b>, such as a sheet metal tube, plugged thereon. In the section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen that the sheet metal tube <b>34</b>, is pressed from both sides into notches of the attachment <b>35</b>, and is therefore protected against tensile, compressive and flexural forces. This connection can be produced, for example, by magnetic pulse forming.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a permanently elastic element <b>6</b> engages on the attachment <b>35</b> of the rod <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can readily be seen that the laterally acting force of the permanently elastic element <b>6</b> presses the hollow ball segment <b>52</b> against the ball segment head <b>51</b> in full-area contact, insofar as that end of the rod <b>32</b> shown here as broken off is to be considered unmovable, which is ensured by the fact that the rod <b>32</b>, at its other end, also bears a hollow ball segment <b>52</b>, which&#x2014;as in FIG. <b>2</b>&#x2014;is pressed onto a complementary ball segment head. <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, even at first glance, that the axis of rotation of the fastening of the permanently elastic element <b>6</b>&#x2014;e.g. a tensioning spring&#x2014;is by no means arranged in the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b>, but on a surface that connects the centre points of the two ball heads. In this arrangement of the articulated arrangement of the springs, it always retains its length, irrespective of the angular position of the two rods <b>32</b>, which increases its lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> clearly illustrates the main feature of the invention, namely the distance between the centre <b>53</b> of the ball segment head <b>51</b> and the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> of the rod <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the case of a tube, the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> is known to be identical to its centre axis. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this axis is identified by a dash-dot-dash line.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the prior art, this longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> would run through the centre <b>53</b> of the ball segment head <b>51</b>. In the case of the invention, however, the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> is displaced into the hollow ball segment <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is readily apparent that the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> thereby comes at least very close to the line along which the resulting force vector of all the force components that impinge on the inner face of the hollow ball segment <b>52</b> in a vertical direction runs. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is apparent that a tensile force that acts via the rod <b>32</b> on the hollow ball segment <b>52</b> is distributed uniformly on the inner side thereof and thereby generates a resulting force vector that runs outside the centre point <b>53</b> of the ball segment head <b>51</b>:</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Below the centre point <b>53</b>, the force component that acts in the direction of the support line <b>33</b> is biggest; at the &#x201c;same level&#x201d; as the centre point <b>53</b>, that is to say in the centre of the inner surface of the hollow ball segment <b>52</b> the force component in the direction of the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> is equal to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If all the force components parallel to the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> are projected onto a line running perpendicular to the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b>, then it is shown that they increase very strongly from the value of zero in the centre of the inner side of the hollow spherical segment, to well over 50% &#x201c;half way&#x201d; to the centre, and have risen to 100% when they reach the centre point <b>53</b>. The location of the centroid of the area below this curve is the optimum distance for the longitudinal support axis <b>33</b> from the centre point <b>53</b>. In this point&#x2014;according to the object of the invention&#x2014;the tensile force is namely very uniformly distributed over the rod <b>32</b>, so that it can be loaded with the greatest possible tensile or compressive force.</p>
