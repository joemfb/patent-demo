<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the national stage application of corresponding international application number PCT/EP2009/064413 filed Nov. 2, 2009, which claims priority to and the benefit of Italian application nos. MI2008A002042, filed Nov. 18, 2008, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a process for the preparation of non ionic iodinated contrast agents and, in more details, it relates to a process for the preparation of Iopamidol in high yields and with a high degree of purity. Iopamidol, as well as others non ionic iodinated contrast agents, is employed in the diagnostic field in the X-ray imagine techniques.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">N,N&#x2032;-Bis[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-[[(2S)-2-hydroxy-1-oxopropyl]-amino]-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzendicarboxamide (see the formula below), generally known as Iopamidol (The Merck Index, XIII Ed., 2001, Nr. 5073), is a compound broadly used for diagnostic methodologies:</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="32.09mm" wi="59.44mm" file="US08624061-20140107-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several processes are known in literature for the preparation of Iopamidol, e.g. starting from 5-nitroisophtalic acid, contemplating the use of many reagents and solvent systems, the optional isolation of the synthetic intermediates and the purification of the final product. The 5-nitroisophtalic acid, as a possible starting material, is suitably reduced to the corresponding amine derivative, e.g. by catalytic hydrogenation, and it is subsequently iodinated on the phenyl ring so to form the corresponding 2,4,6-triiodine derivative.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This latter, e.g. in the presence of thionyl chloride, is then converted into the corresponding 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride, (see, e.g. WO 96/037458, WO96/037459, WO96/016927 and WO96/036590).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The process for the preparation of Iopamidol starting from 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride, comprising possible variations thereof, may be described according to the following synthetic scheme (see, e.g., WO 96/037460, U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,905, WO 97/047590, WO 98/24757, WO 98/028259 and WO 99/058494):</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002">
<img id="EMI-C00002" he="80.86mm" wi="135.30mm" file="US08624061-20140107-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride (I) is converted to the corresponding compound of formula (II) in the presence of (S)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride. The intermediate of formula (II) thus prepared, is then converted in the acetyl-iopamidol of formula (III) in the presence of 2-amino-1,3-propandiol. Finally, the hydrolysis of the compound of formula (III) and the subsequent purification step, allow for the isolation of Iopamidol (formula (IV).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The use of suitable bases in the condensation reaction between 2-amino-1,3-propandiol and compound (II) is known in the art where, particularly, a tertiary amine is added to the reaction system before the addition of 2-amino-1,3-propandiol (see, e.g., WO 98/24757).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such addition results to be remarkably advantageous as it enables for the neutralization of the acid being formed during the reaction between compound (II) and 2-amino-1,3-propandiol, avoiding by that, the possible and undesired salification of said acid with the 2-amino-1,3-propandiol.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Among the possible tertiary amines which may be employed, aliphatic tertiary amines, in particular, have been reported, such as, for instance, triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine and diisopropylethylamine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As disclosed in the aforementioned patent applications, the use of inorganic bases in lieu of the tertiary amines would not result as favourable as the use of a tertiary amine, since it would require particularly long reaction times, due to the insolubility of the bases in the organic reaction solvent, such as e.g. dimethylacetamide (DMA).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the salts resulting from the reaction of the excess of (S)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride in the reaction system would likely be filtered together with the product, and therefore they might help in compromising the overall yield and the impurities profile of the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To our knowledge, the use of specific bases in the condensation reaction between an aminoalcohol and an appropriate isopthalic acid dichloride, has been described in literature even for the preparation of other non ionic iodinated contrast agents.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">We refer, for example, to a process for the preparation of ioversol (The Merck Index, XIII Ed., 2001, Ne. 5085) by reacting 3-amino-1,2-propandiol with 5-acetoxyacetamido-2,4,6-triiodoisopthalic acid dichloride, in the presence of bases and aprotic dipolar organic solvents, particularly dimethylacetamide (DMA) dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, the only experimental evidences noticed about the above condensation reaction, whenever said reaction is carried out in the presence of inorganic bases as described, for instance, in the Indian patent IN 187816, contemplate the use of sodium hydroxide in the presence of isopropanol as possible solvent or, alternatively, the employment of potassium carbonate in DMF.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Surprisingly, we have now found that specific inorganic bases, such as, for example, alkaline or rare earth metals oxides or hydroxides, in the reaction conditions as herein set forth, may be conveniently employed in the process for the preparation of iopamidol. Such a process allows at the same time for the neutralization of the acid as formed during the afore mentioned condensation reaction and for the use of mild conditions in the selected solvent. Said process, further, enables for the preparation of iopamidol in high yields and with a high degree of purity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this respect, as it is for the others contrast agents being used in the diagnostic field, it is of major importance also for iopamidol that the raw material may be obtained with a high degree of purity so to be able to optimize, even with remarkable results, the purification steps as required for the achievement of the final product, being the latter intended for the administration and therefore in conformity with the limits and the specifications according to Pharmacopoeia.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Among the known impurities related to iopamidol, it is worth noting, in particular, the compound N&#x2032;-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-[[(2S)-2-hydroxypropanoyl]amino]-2,4,6-triodo-N,N-dimethylbenzene-1,3-dicaroxamide, which structure is reported below:</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003">
<img id="EMI-C00003" he="27.26mm" wi="59.44mm" file="US08624061-20140107-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The above compound, hereinafter indicated as F-impurity, is within the list of possible side-products generated from the synthesis of iopamidol (e.g. see European Pharmacopoeia 6.0 Ed. 01/2008:1115).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Advantageously, the process of the present invention enables for the preparation of iopamidol with a particularly low amount of F-impurity as well as others side-products, whilst using inorganic bases. All the above allows for the removal of such side products by ordinary purification steps, so to collect the final product within the imposed limitations, as previously indicated</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention, a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (III) comprising the condensation reaction of the acid dichloride of formula (II) with 2-amino-1,3-propandiol, being said reaction carried out in an aprotic dipolar solvent and in the presence of an alkaline or alkaline rare earth metal oxide or hydroxide:</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The addition of the hydroxide is carried out according to those techniques conventionally employed in industrial applications, i.e. by adding a suitable amount of the selected base, either in a solid form or as an aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Said addition is performed by a single addition or, alternatively, portion-wise, up to the achievement of the necessary amount of hydroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Typically, the selected base is employed in a ratio of at least 2:1 (equivalents) compared to the amount of compound (II) [i.e. in a ratio of 1:1 (equivalents), compared to the amount of 2-amino-1,3-propandiol] and more preferably in excess.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As reported in the experimental part, the base may be added to the solution of compound (II) either previously, or at the same time, or even after, the addition of 2-amino-1,3-propandiol.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">During the addition of the base and 2-amino-1,3-propandiol to the reaction system, the mixture is conveniently stirred, according to the common procedures as industrially employed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the addition of both the 2-amino-1,3-propandiol and the base is performed gradually, by monitoring the reaction mixture temperature, being said temperature kept under about 30&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As formerly reported, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an aprotic dipolar organic solvent, preferably dimethylacetamide (DMA).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Both the reactives and the solvents as employed in the reaction are known and broadly used in the industrial context. Also the starting material, i.e. compound of formula (II), is a known compound, and, in case, it can be prepared according to the above scheme, starting from the corresponding 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride of formula (I).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this respect, it is worth noting that the compound of formula (III) may be obtained according to the process object of the present invention, either starting from compound of formula (II) as such, or, optionally, starting from the corresponding compound of formula (I), without the needing of isolate the intermediate of formula (II), thus formed. Therefore, it is a further object of the present invention a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (III) comprising the steps of:</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">a) reacting 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride of formula (I) with (S)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride, in an aprotic dipolar organic solvent, to obtain a solution of the compound of formula (II), and</p>

b) adding an alkaline or an alkaline rare-earth metal oxide or hydroxide and 2-amino-1,3-propandiol to the solution of the compound of formula (II), to obtain the compound of formula (III)

</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The condensation reaction between the 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride of formula (I) and (S)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride, as per step (a), is accomplished following methods known in the art, preferably in DMA as possible aprotic dipolar organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The thus obtained reaction mixture is then directly added with the selected alkaline or alkaline rare-earth metal oxide or hydroxide along with the suitable amount of 2-amino-1,3-propandiol, in a manner as previously reported.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, unlike the reaction conducted starting from the isolated derivative of formula (II), in the reaction performed under a procedure &#x201c;one-pot&#x201d; the amount of base to be employed is remarkably higher.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In such a case, the base is employed not only for the neutralization of the acid formed during the reaction of amidation between 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride (I) and (S)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride, but also for the neutralization of the acid that may arise from the possible excess of (S)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride, and, also, for the neutralization of the acid formed during the amidation reaction between compound (II) and 2-amino-1,3-propandiol. Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, when the present process is carried out without isolation of the intermediate (II), the selected base is employed in a ratio of at least 3:1 (equivalents) respect to the amount of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride of formula (I), and more preferably in excess.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Typically, due to the presence of the acid in the raw reaction material containing the compound of formula (II), the addition of the base to the reaction system is performed before the addition of 2-amino-1,3-propandiol actually occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Also in this case, the addition of the reactives, e.g. the addition of the hydroxide or oxide, either in a solid form or as aqueous solution, and the 2-amino-1,3-propandiol, is preferably effected slowly or portion-wise, under stirring and keeping the temperature below about 30&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Even more preferably, the addition of the base to the crude reaction material, which contains the intermediate of formula (II), is conducted at a temperature between about 5&#xb0; C. and about 20&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The thus obtained compound of formula (III), either starting from the isolated compound of formula (II) or starting from the corresponding precursor of formula (I), is afterwards converted in iopamidol (IV), by operating according to the methods known in literature.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Typically, for instance as reported in the experimental part, compound of formula (III) is first isolated from the crude reaction material, purified, optionally by a passage through ionic exchange resins, and then hydrolyzed under basic conditions for the cleavage of the acetyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is in this respect, a further object of the present invention a process for the preparation of iopamidol (IV) comprising the basic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetyl iopamidol of formula (III), being said compound of formula (III) prepared as previously indicated, i.e. by a condensation reaction of the compound of formula (II), as it is or when present in the crude reaction material, prepared by reaction between 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid dichloride of formula (I) and (S)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride, with 2-amino-1,3-propandiol in an aprotic dipolar solvent and in the presence of an alkaline or rare-earth alkaline metal oxide or hydroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specific operative conditions and possible variations of the used specifications, e.g. regarding the addition times of the reactives, the optional dilution of the reaction mixture, the excess of the base, the concentration of the selected hydroxide whenever it should be added as aqueous solution or, further possible variations regarding the temperature and/or the reaction time, are to be intended as possible optimization of the process in object and are comprised in the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The process in object leads to the desired product in high yield and with a high degree of purity. The amount of the existing impurities, and among them the F-impurity as mentioned above, is particularly low so that said impurities may be removed, by conventional purification methodologies.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Moreover, the present process may have a general industrial applicability and may be advantageously applied in the preparation of other iodinated non ionic contrast agents, which synthesis contemplate the condensation reaction between a suitable derivative of the dichloride of the 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid and an aminoalcohol. It is therefore an additional object of the present invention a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (VII) comprising the condensation reaction between the acid dichloride of formula (V) with an aminoalcohol of formula (VI), being said reaction carried out in an aprotic dipolar solvent and in the presence of an alkaline or rare-earth alkaline metal oxide or hydroxide</p>
