<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a combination of therapeutic agents for use in treating a patient a subject suffering from cancer. The combination comprises (1) at least one polyploidy inducing agent; and (b) at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. In addition, the present disclosure also relates to diagnostic assays useful in classification of patients for treatment with a polyploidy inducing agent, a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor or a combination of a polyploidy inducing agent and a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. In particular, the present disclosure relates to identifying the presence or absence of at least one mutation in a BAX gene, a BAK gene or a NOXA gene and then classifying patients as eligible for receiving treatment with a polyploidy inducing agent, a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor or a combination of a polyploidy inducing agent and a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein members are associated with a number of diseases and thus are under investigation as potential therapeutic drug targets. These important targets for interventional therapy include, for example, the Bcl-2 family of proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Bcl-w. Recently inhibitors of Bcl-2 family members have been reported in the literature, see, for example, WO 2005/049594, Oltersdorf, et. al., <i>Nature, </i>435:677-681 (2005), U.S. Pat. No. 6,720,338 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,030,115. While this art teaches inhibitors having high binding to the target protein, this is only one of many parameters that must be considered as a compound is investigated for further or continued drug development. As part of this development, it is highly desirable to produce compounds that are efficacious in animal models of cancer after oral administration. To achieve this oral efficacy, it is well known in the art that a compound must not only display potent activity against a tumor type or cell line under investigation, but must also achieve acceptable levels of systemic exposure after oral administration. A typical measure of a compound's cellular activity is the concentration eliciting 50% cellular effect (EC<sub>50</sub>). A typical measure of systemic exposure is the area under the curve resulting from graphing the plasma compound concentration after oral administration vs. time (AUC). The ratio between these parameters (AUC/EC<sub>50</sub>) is well known in the art to constitute a useful pharmacodynamic parameter to predict oral efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, this disclosure is directed to a series of haloalkylsulfonylaryl analogs that demonstrate enhanced and unexpected properties with respect to cellular efficacy and systemic exposure after oral administration in animals. Specifically, compounds of this disclosure maintain potent cellular efficacy while exhibiting suitable systemic exposure after oral administration to animals. This results in AUC/EC<sub>50 </sub>ratios significantly higher than that of the compounds taught in the art. Other aspects of the disclosure are disclosed and apparent herein.</p>

Cell viability was determined 3 days after exposure to the combination regimens. Synergy or antagonism of drug combinations was determined using the Bliss additivism model of drug-drug interactions (See, Berenbaum, M. C., <i>Cancer Res </i>35, 269-335 (1981)). The value in excess of Bliss additivism for each dose was determined for all combinations and defined as follows: &#x3e;15=synergistic, 0-15=no interaction, &#x3c;&#x2212;15=antagonistic. These values are expressed in a heatmap using SPOTFIRE&#xae; (TIBCO&#xae;) data analysis software where synergy is indicated in red, no interaction in gray, and antagonism in blue. Each dose response included a point for VX-680 alone (0 &#x3bc;M combination compound). These values are not applicable for Bliss analysis and were excluded from the heatmap. Compounds tested in combination are shown at the right. The targets/mechanisms of action of each of these agents and the corresponding dose responses for the combination screen is summarized in Table A in EXAMPLE 40. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows Bliss analysis of cell viability determinations for VX-680 in combination with ABT-263 in dose-response in D54MG, HCT116, SW620, A549, PC3, and EJ1 cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> shows cell viability determinations analyzed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>

Polyploidization functionally neutralizes Mcl-1 by downregulating Mcl-1 protein, inducing NOXA, increasing the interaction of NOXA with Mcl-1, or some combination of these effects. Additionally, Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>becomes burdened by BH3-only proteins, such as tBID and BIK. This renders cell survival increasingly dependent upon Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. This dependence or &#x201c;addiction&#x201d; represents a molecular Achilles' heel of polyploidization, as ABT-263, which disables the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, elicits rapid and robust apoptosis in polyploid tumor cells.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0110" num="0148">In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to the discovery of a synergistic effect that occurs in tumor and cancer cells when these cells are administered a therapeutically effective amount of at least one polyploidy inducing agent and a therapeutically effective amount of at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. Specifically, the inventors of the present disclosure discovered that the induction of polyploidization in certain tumor and cancer cells makes or renders the survival of these resulting polyploidy cells dependent on the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. More specifically, inducing polyploidy in these tumor and cancer cells sensitizes these cells to Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibition. Thus, the inventors have discovered a polyploidy-mediated method for inducing apoptosis or cell death in these cells. This method involves administering to a patient suffering from cancer a combination of therapeutic agents. Specifically, the patient is administered at least one polyploidy inducing agent. The purpose of the polyploidy inducing agent is to induce polyploidy in one or more cancer cells. As mentioned previously herein, after induction of polyploidy, the survival of these polyploid tumor and cancer cells is dependent on Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. Apoptosis or death of these polyploidy tumor and cancer cells can be obtained or achieved by administering to the patient at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. The order in which the at least one polyploidy inducing agent and the at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor are administered is not critical. However, because tumor and cancer cells do not become sensitized to Bcl-2 family protein inhibitors until after the induction of polyploidy, it is preferred to administer the at least one polyploidy inducing agent to the patient prior to or along with the at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. In connection with the above discovery, the inventors of the present disclosure also discovered that tumor and cancer cells (regardless of whether or not these cells are induced to be polyploid or not) which contain at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene are immune or exhibit resistance to treatment with a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor after induction of polyploidy (such as with at least one polyploidy inducing agent). In other words, polyploid tumor and cancer cells which contain at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and human NOXA gene do not exhibit or experience apoptosis or cell death when simultaneously or subsequently treated with at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0149">Thus, in view of this further discovery, in another aspect, the present disclosure also provides methods and compositions for monitoring cancer and tumor cells for resistance to polyploidy inducing agent (such as an Aurora Kinase inhibitor) therapy, Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor therapy or a combination of polyploidy inducing agent and Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor therapy. The disclosure provides diagnostic assays for identifying, classifying and monitoring cancer patients which comprises assessing a test sample for the presence or absence of at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene. The inventive assays include assay methods for identifying patients eligible to receive a polyploidy inducing agent, Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor therapy or a polyploidy inducing agent and Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor therapy (as a combination therapy together or together with yet another therapy (e.g., such as with chemotherapy, radiation or combinations thereof) and for monitoring patient response to such therapy. The disclosure comprises, for example, determining by fluorescent in situ hybridization the presence or absence of at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene. The methods herein can be performed prior to the induction of polyploidy or after the induction of polyploidy. Patients classified as having one or mutations or an increase in one or more mutations over a baseline (or predetermined) level in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene would be considered to be ineligible to receive at least one polyploidy inducing agent, at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor or the combination therapy of a polyploidy inducing agent and Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor therapy because such patients would be considered to be less likely to respond to each of these therapies.

A typical measure of binding affinity of an anti-apoptotic protein inhibitor is the balance between the binding and dissociation processes between the protein and the inhibitor (Ki).</p>

<p id="p-0171" num="0209">&#x201c;Native gene&#x201d; refers to a gene as found in nature with its own regulatory sequences. In contrast, &#x201c;chimeric construct&#x201d; refers to a combination of nucleic acid fragments that are not normally found together in nature. Accordingly, a chimeric construct may comprise regulatory sequences and coding sequences that are derived from different sources, or regulatory sequences and coding sequences derived from the same source, but arranged in a manner different than that normally found in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0210">o) Percent (%) Nucleic Acid Sequence Identity</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0211">&#x201c;Percent (%) nucleic acid sequence identity&#x201d; with respect to nucleic acid sequences is defined as the percentage of nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotides in the sequence of interest, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining % nucleic acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0212">When nucleotide sequences are aligned, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of a given nucleic acid sequence C to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D (which can alternatively be phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that has or comprises a certain % nucleic acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D) can be calculated as follows:

<p id="p-0176" num="0218">p) Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0219">&#x201c;Polymerase Chain Reaction&#x201d; or &#x201c;PCR&#x201d;, a technique for the synthesis of large quantities of specific DNA segments, consists of a series of repetitive cycles (Perkin Elmer Cetus Instruments, Norwalk, Conn.). Typically, the double stranded DNA is heat-denatured, the two primers complementary to the 3&#x2032; boundaries of the target segment are annealed at low temperature and then extended at an intermediate temperature. One set of these three consecutive steps is referred to as a cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0220">PCR is a powerful technique used to amplify DNA millions of fold, by repeated replication of a template, in a short period of time. ((Mullis, K., et al., <i>Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. </i>51 Pt 1:263-73 (1986)); European Patent Application No. 50,424; European Patent Application No. 84,796; European Patent Application No. 258,017, European Patent Application No. 237,362; European Patent Application No. 201,184, U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202; U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,788; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,194). The process uses sets of specific in vitro synthesized oligonucleotides to prime DNA synthesis. The design of the primers is dependent upon the sequences of DNA that are to be analyzed. The technique is carried out through many cycles (usually 20-50) of melting the template at high temperature, allowing the primers to anneal to complementary sequences within the template and then replicating the template with DNA polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0221">The products of PCR reactions can be analyzed by separation in agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining and visualization with UV transillumination. Alternatively, radioactive dNTPs can be added to the PCR in order to incorporate label into the products. In this case the products of PCR are visualized by exposure of the gel to x-ray film. The added advantage of radiolabeling PCR products is that the levels of individual amplification products can be quantitated.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0222">q) Polynucleotide</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0223">A &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; is a nucleic acid polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), modified RNA or DNA, or RNA or DNA mimetics (such as PNAs), and derivatives thereof, and homologues thereof. Thus, polynucleotides include polymers composed of naturally occurring nucleic bases, sugars and covalent inter-nucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as polymers having non-naturally-occurring portions that function similarly. Such modified or substituted nucleic acid polymers are well known in the art and are referred to as &#x201c;analogues.&#x201d; Oligonucleotides are generally short polynucleotides from about 10 to up to about 160 or 200 nucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0224">Polynucleotides also comprise primers that specifically hybridize to target sequences, including analogues and/or derivatives of the nucleic acid sequences, and homologues thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0225">Polynucleotides can be prepared by conventional techniques, such as solid-phase synthesis using commercially available equipment, such as that available from Applied Biosystems USA Inc. (Foster City, Calif.; USA), DuPont, (Wilmington, Del.; USA), or Milligen (Bedford, Mass.; USA). Modified polynucleotides, such as phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives, can also be readily prepared by similar methods known in the art (See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,948,882, 5,464,746, and 5,424,414).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0226">r) Polynucleotide Analogues</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0227">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polynucleotide analogues&#x201d; refers to polymers having modified backbones or non-natural inter-nucleoside linkages. Modified backbones include those retaining a phosphorus atom in the backbone, such as phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates, as well as those no longer having a phosphorus atom, such as backbones formed by short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl inter-nucleoside linkages, mixed heteroatom and alkyl or cycloalkyl inter-nucleoside linkages, or one or more short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic inter-nucleoside linkages. Modified nucleic acid polymers (analogues) can contain one or more modified sugar moieties.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0228">Analogs that are RNA or DNA mimetics, in which both the sugar and the inter-nucleoside linkage of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups, are also useful. In these mimetics, the base units are maintained for hybridization with the target sequence. An example of such a mimetic, which has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) (See, Buchardt, O., P. Nielsen, and R. Berg. 1992<i>. Peptide Nucleic Acids</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0229">s) Polyploidy Inducing Agent</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0230">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;polyploidy inducing agent&#x201d; refers to a therapeutic compound of any type (e.g., non-selective or selective), including small molecule, antibody, antisense, small interfering RNA, or microRNA-based compounds, that induce polyploidy in one or more cells. Methods for determining the induction or evidence of polyploidy in one or more cells can be obtained using routine techniques known in the art. For example, evidence of polyploidy can be determined by detecting elevated expression of p53. p53 is a surrogate for polyploidization in cells harboring wildtype p53 (See, Gizatullin, F. et al., &#x201c;The Aurora Kinase inhibitor VX-680 induces endoreduplication and apoptosis preferentially in cells with compromised p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint function,&#x201d; <i>Cancer Res. </i>66, 7668-77. (2006)). Additionally, cells in which polyploidy has been induced exhibit a gross morphological increase in cell size and multinucleation, both of which can be detected using routine techniques known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0231">Examples of polyploidy inducing agents, include, but are not limited to, Aurora Kinase inhibitors, microtubule inhibitors (such as, for example, Taxotere, vincristine, nocodazole, paclitaxel or colcemid), pan-kinase inhibitors (such as, for example, staurosporine), oncolytic viruses (such as, for example, ONYX-015), Acridine orange, Dolastain-10, Noscapine, topoisomerase II inhibitors (such as, for example, ICRF-187 or ICRF-193), 2-{4-[(7-chloro-2-quinoxalinyl)oxy]phenoxy}propionic acid, 2-{4-[(7-bromo-2-quinolinyl)oxy]phenoxy}propionic acid, Platycodin D, microtubule poisons (such as, for example, JG-03-14), actin polymerization inhibitors (such as, for example, Cytochalasin B), Bistramide A or antitumor antibiotics (such as, for example, Mithramycin SKI).</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0232">t) Predetermined Level</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0233">As used herein, the term &#x201c;predetermined level&#x201d; refers generally to an assay cut-off value that is used to assess diagnostic results by comparing the assay results against the predetermined level, and where the predetermined level already has been linked or associated with various clinical parameters (e.g., assessing risk, severity of disease, progression/non-progression/improvement, determining the age of a test sample, determining whether a test sample (e.g., serum or plasma) has hemolyzed, etc.). An example of a predetermined level that can be used is a baseline level obtained from one or more subjects that may optionally be suffering from one or more diseases or conditions. It is well known that cutoff values may vary dependent on the nature of the assay. It further is well within the ordinary skill in the art to adapt the disclosure herein for other assays to obtain assay-specific cut-off values for those other assays based on this description.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0234">u) Primer or Probe</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0235">A &#x201c;probe&#x201d; or &#x201c;primer&#x201d; as used herein is a polynucleotide that is at least 8 nucleotides in length and forms a hybrid structure with a target sequence, due to complementarity of at least one sequence in the probe or primer with a sequence in the target region. The polynucleotide regions of the probe can be composed of DNA and/or RNA and/or synthetic nucleotide analogs. Preferably, the probe does not contain a sequence that is complementary to the sequence or sequences used to prime for a target sequence during the polymerase chain reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0236">v) Recombinant</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0237">&#x201c;Recombinant&#x201d; refers to an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence, e.g., by chemical synthesis or by the manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids by genetic engineering techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0238">w) Specifically Hybridize</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0239">&#x201c;Specifically hybridize&#x201d; refers to the ability of a nucleic acid to bind detectably and specifically to a second nucleic acid. Polynucleotides specifically hybridize with target nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding by non-specific nucleic acids.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0240">x) Stringency or Stringent Conditions</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0241">The specificity of single stranded DNA to hybridize complementary fragments is determined by the stringency of the reaction conditions. Hybridization stringency increases as the propensity to form DNA duplexes decreases. In nucleic acid hybridization reactions, the stringency can be chosen to favor specific hybridizations (high stringency). Less-specific hybridizations (low stringency) can be used to identify related, but not exact, DNA molecules (homologous, but not identical) or segments.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0242">DNA duplexes are stabilized by: (1) the number of complementary base pairs, (2) the type of base pairs, (3) salt concentration (ionic strength) of the reaction mixture, (4) the temperature of the reaction, and (5) the presence of certain organic solvents, such as formamide, which decrease DNA duplex stability. A common approach is to vary the temperature: higher relative temperatures result in more stringent reaction conditions (See, Ausubel, F. M., R. Brent, R. E. Kingston, et al. 1987. <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</i>. John Wiley &#x26; Sons, New York) provide an excellent explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0243">Hybridization under &#x201c;stringent conditions&#x201d; means hybridization protocols in which nucleotide sequences at least 60% homologous to each other remain hybridized. Polynucleotides can include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane. In addition, oligonucleotides can be modified with hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (See, van der Krol et al., <i>Biotechniques. </i>6:958-76 (1988) or intercalculating agents (Zon, G., <i>Pharm Res. </i>5:539-49 (1988)). The oligonucleotide can be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, a hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, a transport agent, a hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0244">y) Subject(s) or Patient(s)</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0245">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;subject&#x201d; and &#x201c;patient&#x201d; are used interchangeably irrespective of whether the subject has or is currently undergoing any form of treatment. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;subject&#x201d; and &#x201c;subjects&#x201d; refer to any vertebrate, including, but not limited to, a mammal (e.g., cow, pig, camel, llama, horse, goat, rabbit, sheep, hamsters, guinea pig, cat, dog, rat, and mouse, a non-human primate (for example, a monkey, such as a cynomolgous monkey, chimpanzee, etc) and a human). Preferably, the subject is a human. Subjects or patients can be living or expired.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0246">z) Target Sequence or Target Nucleic Acid Sequence</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0247">&#x201c;Target sequence&#x201d; or &#x201c;target nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; means a nucleic acid sequence encompassing, for example, a gene, or complements or fragments thereof, that is amplified, detected, or both using a polynucleotide primer or probe. Additionally, while the term target sequence sometimes refers to a double stranded nucleic acid sequence; a target sequence can also be single-stranded. In cases where the target is double-stranded, polynucleotide primer sequences preferably amplify both strands of the target sequence. A target sequence can be selected that is more or less specific for a particular organism. For example, the target sequence can be specific to an entire genus, to more than one genus, to a species or subspecies, serogroup, auxotype, serotype, strain, isolate or other subset of organisms.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0248">aa) Test Sample</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0249">&#x201c;Test sample&#x201d; means a sample taken from a subject, or a biological fluid, wherein the sample may contain a target sequence. A test sample can be taken from any source, for example, tissue, blood, saliva, sputa, mucus, sweat, urine, urethral swabs, cervical swabs, urogenital or anal swabs, conjunctival swabs, ocular lens fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, etc. A test sample can be used (i) directly as obtained from the source; or (ii) following a pre-treatment to modify the character of the sample. Thus, a test sample can be pre-treated prior to use by, for example, preparing plasma or serum from blood, disrupting cells or viral particles, preparing liquids from solid materials, diluting viscous fluids, filtering liquids, adding reagents, purifying nucleic acids, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0250">bb) Therapeutically Effective Amount</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0251">The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; means an amount of drug, which is effective for producing a desired therapeutic effect upon administration to a patient, for example, to stem the growth, or result in the shrinkage, of a cancerous tumor or to produce the death of a cancerous cell or tumor.</p>

<p id="p-0248" num="0290">BiTE antibodies are bi-specific antibodies that direct T-cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani (1997) <i>J. of Immunology. </i>158 (12): 5783).</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0291">SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2&#x2032;-deoxynucleotide, 2&#x2032;-OCH3-containing ribonucleotides, 2&#x2032;-F-ribonucleotides, 2&#x2032;-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single/double strands, bulges, nicks/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5&#x2032;- and/or the 3&#x2032;-ends of a given strand. For example, siRNAs targeting Mcl-1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT-263, (i.e., N-(4-(4-((2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1-cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(morpholin-4-yl)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide) or ABT-737 (i.e., N-(4-(4-((4&#x2032;-chloro(1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl)-2-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide) in multiple tumor cell lines (Tse et. al (2008) <i>Cancer Research. </i>68(9): 3421 and references therein).</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0292">Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term &#x201c;multispecific binding protein&#x201d; means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.</p>

<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Selected Compounds in Rat</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0341">The pharmacokinetic behavior of compounds of this disclosure was determined following a single 2 mg/kg intravenous or 5 mg/kg oral dose in male Sprague-Dawley derived rats (n=3 per group). The compounds were prepared as 2 mg/mL solution in a 10% DMSO in PEG-400 formulation for both oral and intravenous administration. The 1 mL/kg intravenous dose was administered as a slow bolus (about 1-2 minutes) in the jugular vein of a rat under light ether anesthetic. The oral dose was administered by gavage. Serial blood samples were obtained from a tail vein of each rat prior 0.1 (IV only), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after dosing. The heparinized samples were thoroughly mixed and placed in an ice bath. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored frozen prior to analysis. The results are also shown in TABLE 1.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0342">The compounds of interest were separated from the plasma using protein precipitation with acetonitrile. A plasma (100-200 &#x3bc;L, sample or spiked standard) aliquot was combined with 50 &#x3bc;L of internal standard (structurally related analog prepared in acetonitrile) and 1 ml acetonitrile in a 96-well polypropylene deep well plate. The plates were vortexed for 30 seconds followed by centrifugation (3500 rpm&#xd7;15 minutes, 4&#xb0; C.). In an automated manner, the supernatant was transferred to a clean 96-well plate. The samples were evaporated to near dryness on a Micro-Vap&#x2122; under a stream of dry nitrogen over low heat (&#x2dc;37&#xb0; C.). The samples were reconstituted vortexing with 0.2 mL 5% DMSO in acetonitrile. A 0.1-0.2 ml aliquot of acetonitrile: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (20:80, by volume) was added to each well, followed by an additional 30 second vortexing. The plates were centrifuged (3500 rpm&#xd7;15 minutes, 4&#xb0; C.) prior to HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Samples were analyzed simultaneously with spiked plasma standards. All samples from each study were analyzed as a single batch on the LC-MS/MS.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0343">The compounds of interest and the internal standard were separated from each other and co-extracted contaminants on a 50&#xd7;3 mm Keystone Betasil CN 5 &#x3bc;m column with an acetonitrile: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid mobile phase (50:50, by volume) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Analysis was performed on a Sciex API 300&#x2122; Biomolecular Mass Analyzer using a heated nebulizer interface. Peak areas of the title compounds and internal standards were determined using the Sciex MacQuan&#x2122; software. Calibration curves were derived from peak area ratio (parent drug/internal standard) of the spiked rat plasma standards using least squares linear regression of the ratio versus the theoretical concentration. The methods were generally linear over the range of the standard curve (correlation coefficients &#x3e;0.99) with an estimated quantitation limit of 0.01 &#x3bc;g/mL. The plasma concentration data for each animal were submitted to multi-exponential curve fitting using WinNonlin. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to t hours (time of the last measurable plasma concentration) after dosing (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule for the plasma concentration-time profiles. The residual area extrapolated to infinity, determined as the final measured plasma concentration (C<sub>t</sub>) divided by the terminal elimination rate constant (&#x3b2;), was added to AUC<sub>0-t </sub>to produce the total area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-&#x221e;</sub>). The results are also shown in TABLE 1. Ki values shown in the tables below were determined using Wang's equation (Wang Z X., An Exact Mathematical Expression For Describing Competitive Binding Of Two Different Ligands To A Protein Molecule. <i>FEBS Lett. </i>1995; 360:111-4)).</p>

<p id="p-0303" num="0345">The compounds of the present disclosure were compared to compounds disclosed in WO 2005/049594, identified herein as EXAMPLES A-L, by determining the ratio of systemic exposure to cellular efficacy. This measure, sometimes reported as AUC/EC<sub>50</sub>, is well known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical drug discovery and drug development as a useful pharmacodynamic predictor of oral efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0346">The examples of the present disclosure and compounds disclosed in WO 2005/049594 were both tested in an H146 cellular assay and evaluated for oral pharmacokinetic properties in rat, both as previously described herein. The results are shown in TABLES 2 and 3. As can be seen with reference to the data, the compounds of the present disclosure have a more preferred pharmacodynamic profile (meaning that the compounds of the present invention exhibit higher AUC/EC<sub>50 </sub>values) as compared to the compounds known in the art. From these results, a number of observations can be drawn. It can be observed that the compounds having a NO<sub>2 </sub>moiety at position W<sup>1 </sup>tend to have good to excellent cellular potency (e.g., EC<sub>50</sub>&#x3c;1 &#x3bc;M). However, when the pharmacokinetic properties of these same compounds are determined, it can be seen that the systemic exposure after oral administration is poor, resulting in AUC/EC<sub>50 </sub>ratios of from 0.5 to 19.7. On the other hand, when compounds having a CF<sub>3 </sub>or CN moiety at position W<sup>1 </sup>are tested in the cellular assay, these derivatives have relatively poor cellular efficacy (e.g., EC<sub>50</sub>&#x3e;1 &#x3bc;M) even though they have suitable systemic exposure after oral administration. Again, this combination provides overall AUC/EC<sub>50 </sub>ratios from about 2.8 to about &#x3c;7.4. Surprisingly, compounds of the present disclosure demonstrate cellular efficacy on par with compounds having an NO<sub>2 </sub>moiety while maintaining suitable systemic exposure after oral administration. The resulting AUC/EC<sub>50 </sub>ratios for the compounds of the disclosure are from about 20 to about 554.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">C. Synergistic Combinations of Polyploidy Inducing Agents and Bcl-2 Family Protein Inhibitors for Use in Treating Cancer</heading>
<p id="p-0329" num="0371">In another aspect, the present disclosure relates to the discovery of synergistic combinations of therapeutic agents that are useful in treating patients suffering from cancer. As mentioned previously herein, the inventors of the present disclosure discovered that the induction of polyploidization in certain tumor and cancer cells makes or renders the survival of these resulting polyploid cells dependent on the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. Because these polyploid cells now dependent on Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>for their survival, these tumor and cancer cells are sensitized to Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibition.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0372">Thus, the present disclosure relates to a combination of therapeutic agents (namely, a combination therapy) that comprise (1) at least one polyploidy inducing agent; and (2) at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. The at least one polyploidy inducing agent can be an Aurora Kinase inhibitor (such as an Aurora Kinase B inhibitor), a microtubule inhibitor (such as, for example, Taxotere, vincristine, nocodazole, paclitaxel or colcemid), a pan-kinase inhibitor (such as, for example, staurosporine), an oncolytic virus (such as, for example, ONYX-015), Acridine orange, Dolastain-10, Noscapine, a toposiomerase II inhibitor (such as, for example, ICRF-187 or ICRF-193), 2-{4-[(7-chloro-2-quinoxalinyl)oxy]phenoxy}propionic acid, 2-{4-[(7-bromo-2-quinolinyl)oxy]phenoxy}propionic acid, Platycodin D, a microtubule poison (such as, for example, JG-03-14), an actin polymerization inhibitor (such as, for example, Cytochalasin B), Bistramide A or an antitumor antibiotic (such as, for example, Mithramycin SKI). An exemplary polyploidy inducing agent is an Aurora Kinase inhibitor. An exemplary Aurora Kinase inhibitor that can be used is an Aurora Kinase B inhibitor. Examples of Aurora Kinase B inhibitors that can be used include, but are not limited to, AZD1152, ZM447439, VX-680/MK0457 and Hesperadin. An exemplary Aurora Kinase B inhibitor that can be used is AZD1152.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0373">Methods for determining the induction or evidence of polyploidy in one or more cells can obtained or determined using routine techniques known in the art. For example, evidence of polyploidy can be determined by detected elevated expression of p53. p53 is a surrogate for polyploidization in cells harboring wildtype p53 (See, Gizatullin, F. et al., &#x201c;The Aurora Kinase inhibitor VX-680 induces endoreduplication and apoptosis preferentially in cells with compromised p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint function,&#x201d; <i>Cancer Res. </i>66, 7668-77. (2006)). Additionally, cells in which polyploidy has been induced exhibit a &#x3e;4N DNA content, gross morphological increase in cell size and multinucleation, all of which can be detected using routine techniques known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0374">The at least one Bcl-2 family member inhibitor can be any of the compounds described in Section B herein (such as, for example, ABT-263), ABT-737, Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibitors (such as A-1113567 and A-1182848) and combinations thereof. An exemplary Bcl-2 family member inhibitor is ABT-263.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0375">The aforementioned combination of therapeutic agents, namely, the at least one polyploidy agent and the at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor, can be used to treat a patient suffering from at least one type of cancer. Specifically, such treatment methods involve administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one polyploidy inducing agent and a therapeutically effective amount of at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor to a patient suffering from cancer and in need of treatment thereof. The order in which the at least one polyploidy inducing agent and the at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor are administered to the patient is not critical. However, because tumor and cancer cells do not become sensitized to Bcl-2 family protein inhibitors until after the induction of polyploidy, it is most beneficial to administer the therapeutically effective amount at least one polyploidy inducing agent to the patient prior to or subsequently with the therapeutically effective amount of at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0376">The therapeutically effective amount of the at least one polyploidy inducing agent and the therapeutically effective amount of the at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor to be administered the patient being treated with the combination of therapeutic agents described herein can be readily determined by those skilled in the art, namely, the treating physician.</p>

<p id="p-0336" num="0378">The aforementioned described combinations of therapeutic agents can be administered to a patient suffering from any type of tumor, cancer, malignancy or combinations thereof.

<p id="p-0337" num="0379">In connection with the discovery described above in Section C, the inventors of the present disclosure also discovered that tumor and cancer cells (regardless of whether or not these cells have been induced to be polyploid or not) and which contain at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene are immune or exhibit resistance to treatment with a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor after induction of polyploidy with at least one polyploidy inducing agent. In other words, polyploid tumor and cancer cells which contain at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene do not exhibit or experience apoptosis or cell death when simultaneously or subsequently treated with at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0380">Thus, in view of this discovery, in another aspect, the present disclosure provides nucleic acid assay methods to detect the presence or absence of at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene by: (i) in situ hybridization assays to intact tissue or cellular samples, (ii) microarray hybridization assays to chromosomal DNA extracted from a tissue sample, and (iii) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other amplification assays to chromosomal DNA extracted from a tissue sample. Assays using synthetic analogs of nucleic acids, such as peptide nucleic acids, in any of these formats can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0381">The assays of the disclosure are used to identify at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene for use in both predicting therapy response and for monitoring patient response to polyploidy inducing agent therapy, a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor or a combination of polyploidy inducing agent therapy and a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. Assays for response prediction can be run before the administration of at least one polyploidy inducing agent (to induce polyploidy) or after induction of polyploidy but prior to the administration of at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor, and patients that do not show or exhibit showing at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene would be considered eligible for therapy with a polyploidy inducing agent, a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor or a combination of a polyploidy inducing agent and a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0382">For monitoring patient response, the assay can be run at the initiation of therapy (namely at the time of administration of at least one polyploidy inducing agent or after administration of at least one polyploidy inducing agent but prior to the administration of at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor) to establish the baseline levels of the mutation(s) in the tissue sample, for example, the percent of total cells or number of cells showing at least one mutation in the sample. The same tissue is then sampled and assayed and the amount or number of mutations are then compared to the baseline or predetermined level. Where the number of mutations remains the same or decrease, the therapy is likely being effective and can be continued. Where significant increase in mutations over baseline level occurs, the patient may not be responding or may have developed resistance to continued polyploidy inducing agent therapy, Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor therapy or a combination of polyploidy inducing agent therapy and Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0383">The assays of the disclosure can be used with test samples obtained from a patient suffering from cancers such as, but not limited to, acoustic neuroma, acute leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia (monocytic, myeloblastic, adenocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, astrocytoma, myelomonocytic and promyelocytic), acute t-cell leukemia, basal cell carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, bronchogenic carcinoma, cervical cancer, chondrosarcoma, chordoma, choriocarcinoma, chronic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic (granulocytic) leukemia, colorectal cancer, craniopharyngioma, cystadenocarcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, dysproliferative changes (dysplasias and metaplasias), embryonal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, endotheliosarcoma, ependymoma, epithelial carcinoma, erythroleukemia, esophageal cancer, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, essential thrombocythemia, Ewing's tumor, fibrosarcoma, follicular lymphoma, germ cell testicular cancer, glioma, heavy chain disease, hemangioblastoma, hepatoma, hepatocellular cancer, hormone insensitive prostate cancer, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, lung carcinoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's), malignancies and hyperproliferative disorders of the bladder, breast, colon, lung, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, skin and uterus, lymphoid malignancies of T-cell or B-cell origin, leukemia, lymphoma, medullary carcinoma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, meningioma, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, myeloma, myxosarcoma, neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, oligodendroglioma, oral cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, papillary adenocarcinomas, papillary carcinoma, pinealoma, polycythemia vera, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sarcoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, seminoma, small cell lung carcinoma, solid tumors (carcinomas and sarcomas), small cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma, synovioma, sweat gland carcinoma, Waldenstr&#xf6;m's macroglobulinemia, testicular tumors, uterine cancer and Wilms' tumor (<i>Cancer Res., </i>2000, 60, 6101-10).</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0384">The inventive assays are performed on any type of test sample, such as a patient tissue sample of any type or on a derivative thereof, including peripheral blood, tumor or suspected tumor tissues (including fresh frozen and fixed paraffin-embedded tissue), cell isolates such as circulating epithelial cells separated or identified in a blood sample, lymph node tissue, bone marrow and fine-needle aspirates.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0385">The present disclosure comprises detection of the genomic biomarkers by hybridization assays using detectably labeled nucleic acid-based probes, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probes or protein nucleic acid (PNA) probes, or unlabeled primers which are designed/selected to hybridize to a specific chromosomal target. The unlabeled primers are used in amplification assays, such as by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which after primer binding, a polymerase amplifies the target nucleic acid sequence for subsequent detection. The detection probes used in PCR or other amplification assays are preferably fluorescent, and still more preferably, detection probes useful in &#x201c;real-time PCR&#x201d;. Fluorescent labels are also preferred for use in situ hybridization but other detectable labels commonly used in hybridization techniques, e.g., enzymatic, chromogenic and isotopic labels, can also be used. Useful probe labeling techniques are described in the literature (Fan, Y.-S. 2002<i>. Molecular cytogenetics: protocols and applications</i>. Humana Press, Totowa, N.J. xiv, p. 411, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). In detection of the genomic biomarkers by microarray analysis, these probe labeling techniques are applied to label a chromosomal DNA extracted from a patient sample, which is then hybridized to the microarray.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0386">Preferably, in situ hybridization is used to detect the presence or absence of at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene. Exemplary genes for which the presence or absence of at least one mutation is detected is a human BAX gene, a human BAK gene, a human NOXA gene and any combinations thereof. Primer and probes can be made by one of skill in the art using routine techniques in the art or using probes such as those available in commercially available kits, such as the TAQMAN&#xae; Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) for detecting and/or determining expression of the BAX, BAK and NOXA genes. Examples of TAQMAN&#xae; Gene Expression Assays available from Applied Biosystems which can be used are shown below in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0346" num="0388">Probes for use in the in situ hybridization methods of the disclosure fall into two broad groups: chromosome enumeration probes, i.e., probes that hybridize to a chromosomal region, usually a repeat sequence region, and indicate the presence or absence of an entire chromosome; and locus specific probes, i.e., probes that hybridize to a specific locus on a chromosome and detect the presence or absence of a specific locus. Chromosome arm probes, i.e., probes that hybridize to a chromosomal region and indicate the presence or absence of an arm of a specific chromosome, can also be used. It is preferred to use a locus specific probe that can detect changes of the unique chromosomal DNA sequences at the interrogated locus, such as, for example, one or more of human BAX, BAK and NOXA loci. Methods for use of unique sequence probes for in situ hybridization are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,841, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0389">A chromosome enumeration probe can hybridize to a repetitive sequence, located either near or removed from a centromere, or can hybridize to a unique sequence located at any position on a chromosome. For example, a chromosome enumeration probe can hybridize with repetitive DNA associated with the centromere of a chromosome. Centromeres of primate chromosomes contain a complex family of long tandem repeats of DNA comprised of a monomer repeat length of about 171 base pairs, that are referred to as alpha-satellite DNA. Centromere fluorescent in situ hybridization probes to each of chromosomes 14 and 18 are commercially available from Abbott Molecular (Des Plaines, Ill.).</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0390">Exceptionally useful in situ hybridization probes are directly labeled fluorescent probes, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,224, incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,224 also describes simultaneous FISH assays using more than one fluorescently labeled probe.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0391">Useful locus specific probes can be produced in any manner and generally contain sequences to hybridize to a chromosomal DNA target sequence of about 10,000 to about 1,000,000 bases long. Preferably the probe hybridizes to a target stretch of chromosomal DNA at the target locus of at least 100,000 bases long to about 500,000 bases long and also includes unlabeled blocking nucleic acid in the probe mix, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,696, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference, to avoid non-specific binding of the probe. It is also possible to use unlabeled, synthesized oligomeric nucleic acid or peptide nucleic acid as the blocking nucleic acid. For targeting the particular gene locus, it is preferred that the probes include nucleic acid sequences that span the gene and thus hybridize to both sides of the entire genomic coding locus of the gene. The probes can be produced starting with human DNA-containing clones such as Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BAC's) or the like. BAC libraries for the human genome are available from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) and can be investigated for identification of useful clones. It is preferred to use the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser to identify DNA sequences in the target locus. These DNA sequences can then be used to synthesize PCR primers to screen BAC libraries to identify useful clones. The clones can then be labeled by conventional nick translation methods and tested as in situ hybridization probes.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0392">Examples of fluorophores that can be used in the in situ hybridization methods described herein are: 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (AMCA); Texas Red&#x2122; (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oreg.); 5-(and-6)-carboxy-X-rhodamine; lissamine rhodamine B; 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein; fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC); 7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid, tetramethyl-rhodamine-5-(and-6)-isothiocyanate; 5-(and-6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; 7-hydroxy-coumarin-3-carboxylic acid; 6-[fluorescein 5-(and-6)-carboxamido]hexanoic acid; N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a diaza-3-indacenepropionic acid; eosin-5-isothiocyanate; erythrosine-5-isothiocyanate; 5-(and-6)-carboxyrhodamine 6G; and Cascade&#x2122; blue acetylazide (Molecular Probes; an Invitrogen brand).</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0393">Probes can be viewed with a fluorescence microscope and an appropriate filter for each fluorophore, or by using dual or triple band-pass filter sets to observe multiple fluorophores. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,688, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Any suitable microscopic imaging method can be used to visualize the hybridized probes, including automated digital imaging systems. Alternatively, techniques such as flow cytometry can be used to examine the hybridization pattern of the chromosomal probes.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0394">Although the cell-by-cell gene amplification analysis resulting from in situ hybridization is preferred, the genomic biomarkers can also be detected by quantitative PCR. In this embodiment, DNA is extracted from the tissue sample, and is then amplified by PCR using a pair of primers specific to at least one of (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human BH3 encoding gene (such as a human BID gene, a human NOXA gene, a human PUMA gene, a human BIK gene, a human BIM gene and a human BAD gene), or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and in a human BH3 encoding gene (such as a human BID gene, a human NOXA gene, a human PUMA gene, a human BIK gene, a human BIM gene and a human BAD gene), or by multiplex PCR, using multiple pairs of primers. Any primer sequence for the biomarkers can be used. Examples of primers that can be used are shown below in Table 4. The presence of at least one mutation is then determined by comparison to a reference amplification standard.</p>

<p id="p-0356" num="0398">The level of gene expression for (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene gene can be determined by assessing the amount of one or more mRNAs in the test sample. Methods of measuring mRNA in samples are known in the art. To measure mRNA levels, the cells in a test sample can be lysed, and the levels of mRNA in the lysates or in RNA purified or semi-purified from lysates can be measured by any variety of methods familiar to those in the art. Such methods include hybridization assays using detectably labeled DNA or RNA probes (i.e., Northern blotting) or quantitative or semi-quantitative RT-PCR methodologies using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. Alternatively, quantitative or semi-quantitative in situ hybridization assays can be carried out using, for example, tissue sections, or unlysed cell suspensions, and detectably labeled (e.g., fluorescent, or enzyme-labeled) DNA or RNA probes. Additional methods for quantifying mRNA include RNA protection assay (RPA), cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays, representation difference analysis (RDA), differential display, EST sequence analysis, and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE).</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0399">In suitable embodiments, PCR amplification is used to detect for at least one mutation in a (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene in the test sample. Briefly, in PCR, two primer sequences are prepared that are complementary to regions on opposite complementary strands of the marker sequence, for example containing the sequences for (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene. An excess of deoxynucleotide triphosphates are added to a reaction mixture along with a DNA polymerase, e.g., Taq polymerase. If the target sequence is present in a sample, the primers will bind to the sequence and the polymerase will cause the primers to be extended along the marker sequence by adding on nucleotides. By raising and lowering the temperature of the reaction mixture, the extended primers will dissociate from the marker to form reaction products, excess primers will bind to the marker and to the reaction products and the process is repeated, thereby generating amplification products. A reverse transcriptase PCR amplification procedure can be performed in order to quantify the amount of mRNA amplified.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0400">Any suitable fragment of (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene can be amplified and detected. Designing efficient primers for PCR is within the ordinary skill in the art. Typically, amplified fragments for detection are approximately 50 to 300 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0401">Amplification products can be detected in several ways. Amplification products can be visualized by electrophoresis of the sample in a gel and then staining with a DNA binding dye, e.g., ethidium bromide. Alternatively, the amplification products can be integrally labeled with a radioactive or fluorescent nucleotide and then visualized using x-ray film or under the appropriate stimulating spectra.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0402">Amplification can be also monitored using &#x201c;real-time&#x201d; methods. Real-time PCR allows for the detection and quantitation of a nucleic acid target. Typically, this approach to quantitative PCR utilizes a fluorescent dye, which can be a double-strand specific dye, such as SYBR GREEN&#xae;. Alternatively, other fluorescent dyes (e.g., FAM or HEX) can be conjugated to an oligonucleotide probe or a primer. Various instruments capable of performing real time PCR are known in the art and include, for example, the ABI PRISM&#xae; 7900 (Applied Biosystems) and LIGHTCYCLER&#xae; systems (Roche). The fluorescent signal generated at each cycle of PCR is proportional to the amount of PCR product. A plot of fluorescence versus cycle number is used to describe the kinetics of amplification and a fluorescence threshold level is used to define a fractional cycle number related to initial template concentration. When amplification is performed and detected on an instrument capable of reading fluorescence during thermal cycling, the intended PCR product from non-specific PCR products can be differentiated using melting analysis. By measuring the change in fluorescence while gradually increasing the temperature of the reaction subsequent to amplification and signal generation it can be possible to determine the Tm of the intended product(s) as well as that of the nonspecific product.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0403">The methods can include amplifying multiple nucleic acids in sample, also known as &#x201c;multiplex detection&#x201d; or &#x201c;multiplexing.&#x201d; Multiplex PCR&#x2033; refers to PCR that involves adding more than one set of PCR primers to the reaction in order to detect and quantify multiple nucleic acids, including nucleic acids from one or more target gene markers. Furthermore, multiplexing with an internal control (e.g., 18S rRNA, GADPH, or actin) provides a control for the PCR without reaction.</p>
<heading id="h-0027" level="1">F. Sample Processing and Assay Performance</heading>
<p id="p-0362" num="0404">As discussed previously herein, the test sample of the present disclosure can be a tissue sample. The tissue sample to be assayed by the methods of the present disclosure can comprise any type, including a peripheral blood sample, a tumor tissue or a suspected tumor tissue, a thin layer cytological sample, a fine-needle aspirate sample, a bone marrow sample, a lymph node sample, a urine sample, an ascites sample, a lavage sample, an esophageal brushing sample, a bladder or lung wash sample, a spinal fluid sample, a brain fluid sample, a ductal aspirate sample, a nipple discharge sample, a pleural effusion sample, a fresh frozen tissue sample, a paraffin embedded tissue sample or an extract or processed sample produced from any of a peripheral blood sample, a tumor tissue or a suspected tumor tissue, a thin layer cytological sample, a fine needle aspirate sample, a bone marrow sample, a lymph node sample, a urine sample, an ascites sample, a lavage sample, an esophageal brushing sample, a bladder or lung wash sample, a spinal fluid sample, a brain fluid sample, a ductal aspirate sample, a nipple discharge sample, a pleural effusion sample, a fresh frozen tissue sample or a paraffin embedded tissue sample. For example, a patient peripheral blood sample can be initially processed to extract an epithelial cell population, and this extract can then be assayed. A microdissection of the tissue sample to obtain a cellular sample enriched with suspected tumor cells can also be used. The preferred tissue samples for use herein are peripheral blood, tumor tissue or suspected tumor tissue, including fine needle aspirates, fresh frozen tissue and paraffin embedded tissue, and bone marrow.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0405">The tissue sample can be processed by any desirable method for performing in situ hybridization or other nucleic acid assays. For the preferred in situ hybridization assays, a paraffin embedded tumor tissue sample or bone marrow sample is fixed on a glass microscope slide and deparaffinized with a solvent, typically xylene. Useful protocols for tissue deparaffinization and in situ hybridization are available from Abbott Molecular Inc. (Des Plaines, Ill.). Any suitable instrumentation or automation can be used in the performance of the inventive assays. PCR based assays can be performed on the m2000 instrument system (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, Ill.). Automated imaging can be used for the preferred fluorescent in situ hybridization assays.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0406">In one embodiment, the sample comprises a peripheral blood sample from a patient which is processed to produce an extract of circulating tumor or cancer cells to be examined for the presence or absence of at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene. The circulating tumor cells can be separated by immunomagnetic separation technology such as that available from Immunicon (Huntingdon Valley, Pa.). The at least one mutation is determined for the circulating tumor cells is then compared to the baseline level or predetermined level of circulating tumor cells having a determination made of the presence or absence of one or more mutations determined at a previous point in time, such as at the start of therapy. Increases or the presence of at least one mutation compared to the baseline level or the predetermined level can indicate therapy failure.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0407">Test samples can comprise any number of cells that is sufficient for a clinical diagnosis, and typically contain at least about 100 cells. In a typical FISH assay, the hybridization pattern is assessed in about 25-1,000 cells. Test samples are typically considered &#x201c;test positive&#x201d; when found to contain the gene amplification in a sufficient proportion of the sample. The number of cells identified with at least one mutation and used to classify a particular sample as positive, in general, varies with the number of cells in the sample. The number of cells used for a positive classification is also known as the cut-off value. Examples of cut-off values that can be used in the determinations include about 5, 25, 50, 100 and 250 cells, or 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50% and 60% of cells in the sample population. As low as one cell can be sufficient to classify a sample as positive. In a typical paraffin embedded tissue sample, it is preferred to identify at least 30 cells as positive and more preferred to identify at least 20 cells as positive for having at least one mutation. For example, detection in a typical paraffin embedded colorectal carcinoma of 30 cells would be sufficient to classify the tissue as positive and eligible for treatment.</p>
<heading id="h-0028" level="1">G. Kits</heading>
<p id="p-0366" num="0408">The present disclosure also contemplates a variety of kits. In one aspect, the kit contains at least the following two therapeutic agents: (1) at least polyploidy inducing agent; and (2) at least one Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. In addition, the kit can optionally include instructions for use, namely, the administration of the at least two therapeutic agents to a patient suffering from cancer and need of treatment thereof. These instructions may be provided in paper form or in computer-readable form, such as a disc, CD, DVD or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0409">In another aspect, the kit of the present disclosure is a kit for detecting the presence or absence of at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene in a test sample. Exemplary genes for which the presence or absence of at least one mutation is detected using said kit is a human BAX gene, a human BAK gene, a human NOXA gene and any combinations thereof. Such kits can comprise one or more reagents for determining the presence or absence of the above described at least one mutation. For example, said kit can contain one or more nucleic acid probes. Alternatively, or in addition to the probes, the kit can contain one or more nucleic acid primers.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0410">Thus, the present disclosure further provides for diagnostic and quality control kits comprising one or more nucleic acid primers, nucleic acid probes or nucleic acid primers and probes described herein.

Additionally, the assays, kits and kit components can be employed in other formats, for example, on electrochemical or other hand-held or point-of-care assay systems. The present disclosure is, for example, applicable to the commercial Abbott Point of Care (i-STAT&#xae;, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.) electrochemical immunoassay system that performs sandwich immunoassays for several cardiac markers, including TnI, CKMB and BNP. Immunosensors and methods of operating them in single-use test devices are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0170881, 2004/0018577, 2005/0054078 and 2006/0160164, which are incorporated herein by reference. Additional background on the manufacture of electrochemical and other types of immunosensors is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,063,081 which is also incorporated by reference for its teachings regarding same.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0411">Optionally the kits include quality control reagents (e.g., sensitivity panels, calibrators, and positive controls). Preparation of quality control reagents is well known in the art, and is described, e.g., on a variety of immunodiagnostic product insert sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0412">The kit can incorporate a detectable label, such as a fluorophore, radioactive moiety, enzyme, biotin/avidin label, chromophore, chemiluminescent label, or the like, or the kit may include reagents for labeling the nucleic acid primers, the nucleic acid probes or the nucleic acid primers and nucleic acid probes for detecting the presence or absence of at least one mutation as described herein. The primers and/or probes, calibrators and/or controls can be provided in separate containers or pre-dispensed into an appropriate assay format, for example, into microtiter plates.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0413">The kits can optionally include other reagents required to conduct a diagnostic assay or facilitate quality control evaluations, such as buffers, salts, enzymes, enzyme co-factors, substrates, detection reagents, and the like. Other components, such as buffers and solutions for the isolation and/or treatment of a test sample (e.g., pretreatment reagents), may also be included in the kit. The kit may additionally include one or more other controls. One or more of the components of the kit may be lyophilized and the kit may further comprise reagents suitable for the reconstitution of the lyophilized components.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0414">The various components of the kit optionally are provided in suitable containers. As indicated above, one or more of the containers may be a microtiter plate. The kit further can include containers for holding or storing a sample (e.g., a container or cartridge for a blood or urine sample). Where appropriate, the kit may also optionally contain reaction vessels, mixing vessels and other components that facilitate the preparation of reagents or the test sample. The kit may also include one or more instruments for assisting with obtaining a test sample, such as a syringe, pipette, forceps, measured spoon, or the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0029" level="1">H. Adaptation of Kits</heading>
<p id="p-0374" num="0416">The kit (or components thereof), as well as the method of determining the presence or absence of at least one mutation in (i) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene), (ii) a human NOXA gene, or (iii) a human Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic encoding gene (such as a human BAX gene and a human BAK gene) and a human NOXA gene using the components and methods described herein, can be adapted for use in a variety of automated and semi-automated systems (including those wherein the solid phase comprises a microparticle), as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,089,424 and 5,006,309, and as commercially marketed, e.g., by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, Ill.) as ARCHITECT&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0417">Some of the differences between an automated or semi-automated system as compared to a non-automated system (e.g., ELISA) include the substrate to which the first specific binding partner (e.g., capture antibody) is attached (which can impact sandwich formation and analyte reactivity), and the length and timing of the capture, detection and/or any optional wash steps. Whereas a non-automated format such as an ELISA may require a relatively longer incubation time with sample and capture reagent (e.g., about 2 hours) an automated or semi-automated format (e.g., ARCHITECT&#xae;, Abbott Laboratories) may have a relatively shorter incubation time (e.g., approximately 18 minutes for ARCHITECT&#xae;). Similarly, whereas a non-automated format such as an ELISA may incubate a detection antibody such as the conjugate reagent for a relatively longer incubation time (e.g., about 2 hours), an automated or semi-automated format (e.g., ARCHITECT&#xae;) may have a relatively shorter incubation time (e.g., approximately 4 minutes for the ARCHITECT&#xae;).</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0418">Other platforms available from Abbott Laboratories include, but are not limited to, AxSYM&#xae;, IMx&#xae; (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0377" num="0419">It further goes without saying that the methods and kits as described herein necessarily encompass other reagents and methods for carrying out the assays. For instance, encompassed are various buffers such as are known in the art and/or which can be readily prepared or optimized to be employed.</p>

Cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 1 mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum, maintained at 37&#xb0; C. in a humidified atmosphere equilibrated with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% air and used between passages 3-7 when in log phase for tumor cell inoculation. Cells (1&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) were mixed 1:1 with matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected s.c. (0.2 mL) into the shaved flank of female mice. Tumors were size-matched (482-606 mm<sup>3</sup>) and allocated into treatment groups before dosing was initiated. Two bisecting diameters were measured with calipers and tumor volumes were estimated from the formula: (length&#xd7;width<sup>2</sup>)/2. VX-680 was administered intraperitoneally (I.P., 50 mg/kg/d, b.i.d. to end; 17 days depending on when the endpoint was reached and the study was terminated) in a vehicle containing 10% Solutol (BASF, Florham Park, N.J.) and 90% tartaric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.).

<p id="h-0131" num="0000">siRNA Transfections</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0524">Typically, cells were seeded at 5,000/well in 96-well plates in antibiotic-free growth medium and cultured overnight. The following day, cells were transfected with siRNA oligos using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) or DharmaFECT transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Individual siRNAs were transfected at a final concentration of 10 nM. For immunoblotting experiments, cells were cultured for a further 3 days, then lysates were prepared. For, siRNA/drug combinations, cells were treated with compound 24 hour post-transfection, then cultured for a further 72 hours. For long-term polyploidization, cells were cultured for up to 10 days post-transfection.</p>

<p id="p-0483" num="0525">Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-GLO luminescence assay (Promega) according to manufacturer's suggested protocol. Generally, cells were seeded at &#x3e;90% viability (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) into 96-well plates overnight, treated with compounds or siRNAs for indicated duration, and the overall cell viability was determined by measuring luminescence.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0526">Caspase-3 activity was determined using the Caspase-GLO 3/7 Assay (Promega) in tandem with the CellTiter-GLO viability assay (Promega). Parallel experiments were performed, where in one experiment Caspase-3/7 activity was measured and in the other, cell viability was determined. As Caspase-3/7 activity on a per cell basis reflects both the specific activity of the Caspase-3 enzyme and the number of viable cells, the data are expressed as Caspase-3/7 activity divided by cell viability.</p>

Cell homogenates were centrifuged twice at 1,000&#xd7;g for 5 minutes at 4&#x2032;C to pellet nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000&#xd7;g for 10 minutes at 4&#x2032;C. The pellet from this spin was designated &#x201c;mitochondria&#x201d; and further extracted in 80 &#x3bc;l of CHAPS lysis buffer. Extraction of mitochondria was performed on ice by repeatedly vortexing the samples for 1 minute each for &#x2dc;20 minutes. The final extract was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000&#xd7;g for 10 minutes at 4&#xb0; C. to remove any contaminating cell debris. The 10,000&#xd7;g supernatant containing cytosol and low density membranes was centrifuged again at 100,000&#xd7;g (55,000 rpm in a TLA 120.2 rotor) for 1 hour to pellet membranes.

<p id="p-0488" num="0530">Frozen cell pellets were lysed and total RNA was isolated using the QIAshredder and RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Labeled cRNA was prepared according to the microarray manufacturer's protocol and hybridized to human genome U133A 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). The microarray data files were loaded into Rosetta Resolver software for analysis, and the intensity values for all probe sets were normalized using the Resolver's Experimental Definition. Clustering analysis within Resolver used the Agglomerative algorithm and Pearson correlation for the similarity measure, using genes that had a 1.5-fold change or higher in 1 treatment condition. Only differences with a p-value less than 0.001 are shown. For the pathway analysis, a 1.5-fold cut-off was applied and a 5% false discovery rate was used for p-value cut-off (See, Benjamini, Y. &#x26; Hochberg, Y., &#x201c;Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing,&#x201d; <i>J R Statist Soc B </i>57, 289-300 (1995)).</p>

<p id="p-0489" num="0531">Endogenous Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Mcl-1 were immunoprecipitated from HCT116 cells. Samples to be processed for mass spectrometry were loaded into every other well of a 10-well&#xd7;1 mm 4-12% Bis/Tris gel (Invitrogen) to reduce lateral contamination. The gels were run at a constant 200 V in MOPS running buffer for 45-60 minutes, then fixed in a solution of 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 15 minutes. After rinsing in water, the gels were treated with Sypro Ruby protein gel stain (Invitrogen) for 3 hr at room temperature. Once completed, the gels were destained in a solution of 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 10 minutes followed by washing and incubation in water for 30 minutes Protein bands were subsequently imaged on a Fuji imager using the green channel.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0532">Each lane on the gel was manually cut into 24 equally-sized pieces, placed into a 96-well plate and minced. The minced gel pieces were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion at 37&#xb0; C. for 5 hr using a Perkin-Elmer MassPrep unit and sequencing grade modified trypsin (6 ng/&#x3bc;L). The extracted peptides for each sample were lyophilized prior to resuspension in 10 &#x3bc;L of a solution of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. 9.5 &#x3bc;L of the resuspended samples were injected onto a 15 cm analytical capillary column (I.D. 75 &#x3bc;m, 5&#x3bc; particle size, 200 &#x212b; pore size) packed with Michrom C18AQ magic reversed-phase resin. The peptides were eluted using an Eiksigent nano-LC unit in a 35 minute linear gradient (15 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). Hydrophobic peptides were subsequently removed by increasing the acetonitrile composition from 35% to 80% over the next 5 minutes. The eluent was directed into the orifice of a linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Mass.). Scans were collected in data-dependent double-play mode for the duration of the chromatographic separation.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0533">Each LC-MS/MS data file was searched using Mascot Daemon v.2.2 against the NCBI non-redundant database restricted to the mammalian taxonomy. Peptides of 2<sup>+</sup> to 3<sup>+</sup> charge state were searched, with a maximum of 2 missed trypsin cleavages, carboxyamidomethyl as a fixed modification, oxidized methionine as a variable modification and a mass window of +1.2 Da for intact peptides and +0.8 Da for ions generated from tandem mass spectrometry. The Mascot search results for each data file were compiled by gel lane in Scaffold v.1.0 using the MudPIT compilation feature to yield protein identifications by treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0534">An interactome map of the Bcl-2 network was constructed manually using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems Redwood City, Calif.).

<p id="p-0493" num="0535">Small-molecule inhibitors that specifically target the Aurora family of serine/threonine kinases are under clinical evaluation as monotherapy and will no doubt be combined with other chemotherapeutic agents. To experimentally identify agents that could be therapeutically combined with Aurora Kinase inhibitors, VX-680, a pan-Aurora inhibitor, was screened in combination with 19 clinical and experimental cancer therapeutics for their effect on cell viability. A unique synergistic activity was observed when VX-680 was combined with ABT-263 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), an orally bioavailable, small-molecule BH3 mimetic that inhibits Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). Bliss analysis showed that VX-680 was synergistic with ABT-263 in tumor cell lines irrespective of histological type (e.g., D54MG (glioma), NCI-H460 and A549 (lung carcinoma), PC3 (prostate carcinoma), EJ1 (bladder carcinoma), HCT116, DLD1, and SW620 (colon carcinoma), and 786-O (renal carcinoma); <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A-B</figref> and data not shown), indicating that the synergy observed for these two classes of oncology drugs may reflect a molecular susceptibility pervasive in cancer cells. The targets/mechanisms of action of each of the 19 clinical and experimental cancer therapeutics and the corresponding dose responses for the combination screen is summarized in Table A, below.</p>

The Synergistic Activity of VX-680 and ABT-263 can be Fully Ascribed to the Combined Inhibition of Aurora B and Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>
</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0537">VX-680 is a potent inhibitor of Aurora A, B, and C kinases with K<sub>i(app) </sub>values of 0.6, 18, and 4.6 nM, respectively. Inhibition of Aurora A results primarily in mitotic delay or arrest (See, Manfredi, M. G. et al., &#x201c;Antitumor activity of MLN8054, an orally active small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase,&#x201d; <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>104, 4106-11 (2007)); whereas inhibition of Aurora B produces gross polyploidization (See, Wilkinson, R. W. et al., &#x201c;AZD1152, a selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase, inhibits human tumor xenograft growth by inducing apoptosis,&#x201d; <i>Clin Cancer Res. </i>13, 3682-8 (2007)). It was, therefore, important to distill from the pan-Aurora profile of VX-680 the Aurora Kinase activity that would suffice for synergy with ABT-263. Likewise, ABT-263 inhibits Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w with similar potencies, displaying K, values of and nM, respectively, and presents a similar complication. Therefore, these activities were deconvoluted to identify the activities that were sufficient for synergy using both siRNA and selective small-molecules. When added in combination with ABT-263, Aurora B, but not Aurora A, siRNA was synergistically antiproliferative in combination with ABT-263, though both siRNAs efficiently knocked down their respective targets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>). MLN8054, a small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A, showed no synergy in combination with ABT-263 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>) at Aurora A-selective concentrations (&#x3c;5 &#x3bc;M) (See, Manfredi, M. G. et al., &#x201c;Antitumor activity of MLN8054, an orally active small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase,&#x201d; <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>104, 4106-11 (2007) and Li, J. et al., &#x201c;Inhibition of Aurora B kinase sensitizes a subset of human glioma cells to TRAIL concomitant with induction of TRAIL-R2<i>,&#x201d; Cell Death Differ</i>, Epub ahead of print (2008)). In contrast, synergy was observed when ABT-263 was combined with the Aurora B-selective inhibitor, AZD1152 (See, Wilkinson, R. W. et al., &#x201c;AZD1152, a selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase, inhibits human tumor xenograft growth by inducing apoptosis,&#x201d; <i>Clin Cancer Res. </i>13, 3682-8. (2007) and Mortlock, A. A. et al., &#x201c;Discovery, synthesis, and in vivo activity of a new class of pyrazoloquinazolines as selective inhibitors of aurora B kinase,&#x201d; <i>J Med Chem </i>50, 2213-24 (2007)) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0538">While ABT-263 inhibits Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, and Bcl-w, it is relatively inactive vs. other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-A1. Because Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>are commonly expressed in many human cancer cells, siRNA was used to determine which of the two ABT-263 targets, when inhibited, would phenocopy the synergistic activity observed for ABT-263 in combination with AZD1152. When transfected into cancer cells of different tumor origin (HCT116, DLD1, EJ1, PC3, D54MG), Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, but not luciferase, Bcl-2, or Mcl-1 siRNA exhibited a synergistic inhibition of cell growth in combination with AZD1152 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E-FIG</figref>. <b>9</b>G and data not shown). Therefore, inhibition of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, but not Bcl-2, cooperates with Aurora B inhibition to induce cell death in these cell lines. Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Aurora B siRNAs were also synergistically antiproliferative (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9H</figref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the synergistic activity of VX-680 and ABT-263 can be fully ascribed to inhibition of Aurora B and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>.</p>
<p id="h-0140" num="0000">ABT-263 Triggers Rapid Apoptosis in Polyploid Cells.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0539">As polyploidy represents the ultimate cell fate associated with sustained inhibition of Aurora B, the inventors set out to determine whether Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibition and polyploidization were synergistically cytotoxic, independently of Aurora B. The CPC is an epistasis group comprising Aurora B, survivin, INCENP, and borealin, and is the core of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (See, Ruchaud, S., Carmena, M. &#x26; Earnshaw, W. C., &#x201c;Chromosomal passengers: conducting cell division,&#x201d; <i>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol </i>8, 798-812 (2007)). Disruption of the CPC results in cytokinesis failure and polyploidy (See, Honda, R., K&#xf6;rner, R. &#x26; Nigg, E. A., &#x201c;Exploring the functional interactions between Aurora B, INCENP, and survivin in mitosis,&#x201d; <i>Mol Biol Cell </i>14, 3325-41 (2003)). In accordance with INCENP's role to safeguard against polyploidy (See, Uren, A. G. et al., &#x201c;Survivin and the inner centromere protein INCENP show similar cell-cycle localization and gene knockout phenotype,&#x201d; <i>Curr Biol </i>10, 1319-28 (2000)). INCENP siRNA induced morphological hallmarks of polyploidy, such as grossly enlarged cells with multiple micronuclei (data not shown). Knockdown of INCENP was synergistically antiproliferative with Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>knockdown (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A-B</figref>), suggesting that inhibition of Bcl-XL is deleterious for polyploid cells. However, targeting INCENP with siRNA also delocalizes Aurora B and inhibits its activity (See, Klein, U. R., Nigg, E. A. &#x26; Gruneberg, U., &#x201c;Centromere targeting of the chromosomal passenger complex requires a ternary subcomplex of Borealin, Survivin, and the N-terminal domain of INCENP,&#x201d; <i>Mol Biol Cell </i>17, 2547-58 (2006)). Therefore, the effect of INCENP siRNA cannot be fully dissociated from disruption of Aurora B. To conclusively determine whether polyploidy per se was sufficient to sensitize cells to Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibition, cells were treated with AZD1152 to induce polyploidy, washed out the drug, and the polyploid cells cultured until Aurora B activity was restored. Polyploidy was evidenced by elevated expression of p53 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>), a surrogate for polyploidization in cell harboring wildtype p53 (See, Gizatullin, F. et al., &#x201c;The Aurora Kinase inhibitor VX-680 induces endoreduplication and apoptosis preferentially in cells with compromised p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint function,&#x201d; <i>Cancer Res. </i>66, 7668-77. (2006), Li, J. et al., &#x201c;Inhibition of Aurora B kinase sensitizes a subset of human glioma cells to TRAIL concomitant with induction of TRAIL-R2<i>,&#x201d; Cell Death Differ</i>, Epub ahead of print (2008) and Kojima, K., Konopleva, M., Tsao, T., Nakakuma, H. &#x26; Andreeff, M., &#x201c;Concomitant inhibition of Mdm2-p53 interaction and Aurora Kinases activates the p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoints and synergistically induces p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis along with reduced endoreduplication in acute myelogenous leukemia,&#x201d; <i>Blood </i>112, 2886-95 (2008)) and by the gross morphological increase in cell size and multinucleation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>). Following AZD1152 wash-out, histone H3 phosphorylation returned to untreated levels indicating that Aurora B activity had been fully restored (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>) in polyploid cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>). ABT-263 induced Caspase-3 activity and loss of viability in polyploid cells, but not diploid cells, independently of the activation status of Aurora B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E-F</figref>). These data suggest that acute induction of polyploidy renders cell survival dependent on the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>.</p>
<p id="h-0141" num="0000">Polyploidization Shifts the Survival Burden to Bcl-X<sub>L </sub></p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0540">The multidomain apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK together constitute an obligatory portal to apoptosis (See, Wei, M. C. et al., &#x201c;Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death,&#x201d; <i>Science </i>292, 727-30 (2001) and Zong, W. X., Lindsten, T., Ross, A. J., MacGregor, G. R. &#x26; Thompson, C. B., &#x201c;BH3-only proteins that bind pro-survival Bcl-2 family members fail to induce apoptosis in the absence of BAX and BAK,&#x201d; <i>Genes Dev </i>15, 1481-6 (2001)). To begin to shed light on the mechanisms through which Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>neutralization elicits cell death in polyploid cells, the activation of BAX and BAK in cells rendered polyploid with AZD1152 using antibodies that selectively recognize the active BAX and BAK conformers was examined. Addition of ABT-263 to polyploid HCT116, D54MG, SW620, and EJ1 cells rapidly and synergistically induced BAX and BAK activation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The activation of BAX and BAK was followed by mitochondrial release of cytochrome C into the cytosol, a decisive event in the commitment to apoptosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0541">The pro-apoptotic function of BAX and BAK is normally inhibited by anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Mcl-1, and it is the balance of interactions between BH3-only and multidomain proteins that sets the threshold for apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway (See, Kim, H. et al., &#x201c;Hierarchical regulation of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis by BCL-2 subfamilies,&#x201d; <i>Nat Cell Biol </i>8, 1348-58 (2006) and Willis, S, N. et al., &#x201c;Apoptosis initiated when BH3 ligands engage multiple Bcl-2 homologs, not BAX or BAK,&#x201d; <i>Science </i>315, 856-9 (2007)). In contrast to what was observed in polyploid cells, neutralization of Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>is not normally sufficient to trigger apoptosis in diploid or aneuploid cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>). To elucidate how polyploidization engages elements of the apoptotic machinery and renders polyploid cell survival Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>-dependent, the Bcl-2 network was monitored at the mRNA and protein level in response to polyploidization. Hierarchical clustering of Bcl-2 network genes indicated that the transcriptional profiles of polyploidization (VX-680 and AZD1152) were consistently most similar compared to Aurora A inhibition (MLN8054), though they differed across cell lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). At the protein level, a number of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins were upregulated following polyploidization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>). An increase in PUMA and NOXA was a conserved effect across cell lines; whereas, tBID, BIK, BIM, and BAX increased in a cell line-dependent manner. Though only subtle changes in expression were observed for Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Mcl-1 was significantly reduced in HCT116, SW620, and EJ1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> and data not shown). NOXA binds to and inhibits the anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1 (See, Chen, L. et al., &#x201c;Differential targeting of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins by their BH3-only ligands allows complementary apoptotic function,&#x201d; <i>Mol Cell </i>17, 393-403 (2005)). Therefore, the upregulation of NOXA in D54MG is predicted to antagonize Mcl-1, though the abundance of Mcl-1 in D54MG cells was not reduced (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>). Collectively, polyploidization induced effectors of apoptosis while compromising Mcl-1 function. As cell viability is maintained during this period of polyploidization, it was inferred that the burden to support viability is shifted from Mcl-1 to Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0542">While gene expression represents one level at which the Bcl-2 network is regulated, the collection of binding events between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins ultimately determines the balance between survival and apoptosis. The Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Mcl-1 interactomes were empirically defined and monitored the effect of polyploidization on these interactions. HCT116 cells were treated with DMSO, ABT-263, AZD1152, or AZD1152 and ABT-263. Endogenous Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>or Mcl-1 was then immunoprecipitated, and the immune complexes were analyzed by in-gel tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS. The protein identifications were compiled from all treatments yielding a composite interactome that represents all Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Mcl-1 interactions detected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Interactions were subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting under each treatment condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D-E</figref>). None of the coimmunoprecipitated proteins were detected in anti-S6K1 immunoprecipitates using an IgG isotype-matched antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D-E</figref>), highlighting the specificity of these interactions. In polyploid cells (AZD1152), the interactions of Bik and tBid with Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>were increased while the binding of BAD, BIM, BAX, and PUMA was unchanged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>) indicating that Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>was increasingly burdened by pro-apoptotic proteins upon polyploidization. Consistent with the reduction of Mcl-1 protein level, a reduced amount of Mcl-1 was captured by immunoprecipitation in polyploid cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>). In addition, there was a stoichiometric increase in NOXA binding during polyploidization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>). Furthermore, the association of Mcl-1 with Bim and Puma was significantly attenuated in polyploid cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>), suggesting that the reduction of Mcl-1 and concomitant increase of NOXA was sufficient to partially neutralize Mcl-1.</p>
<p id="h-0142" num="0000">Identification of Bcl-2 Network Components Required for Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>/Aurora B Inhibitor Synergy</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0543">Although multiple Bcl-2 family proteins were modulated by polyploidization at the levels of expression and/or protein-protein interaction, it was unclear which, if any, were essential for sensitization of polyploid cells to Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibition. An siRNA screen was carried out emphasizing the Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Mcl-1 interactomes, to identify elements of the Bcl-2 network that, upon knockdown, could rescue viability in the presence of dual inhibition of Aurora B and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. Multiple siRNAs targeting NOXA, BAX, and to a lesser extent, those targeting BAK were found to rescue polyploid cells from ABT-263-mediated cell death (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). In fact, siRNA-mediated depletion of NOXA and BAX in several cell lines rendered polyploid cells resistant to Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). These data imply causal roles for NOXA and BAX in the synergistic activity of Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>inhibition in polyploid cells.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0544">To further understand how Noxa inhibition protects polyploid cells from ABT-263-mediated apoptosis, the Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>and Mcl-1 interactomes were compared before and after polyploidization in cells transfected with a control or NOXA siRNA. As before, a reduction of Mcl-1 protein and a stoichiometric increase in NOXA binding to Mcl-1 was observed in cells made polyploid using AZD1152 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>). Depletion of NOXA restored the binding of Puma and Bim to Mcl-1 in polyploid cells indicating that the capacity of Mcl-1 to bind pro-apoptotic effectors had been restored. Though it is sufficient to cause Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>dependence, the inhibition of Mcl-1 during polyploidization appears incomplete, as apoptosis induced by AZD1152/ABT-263 is augmented by Mcl-1 knockdown (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0143" num="0000">Polyploidization-Mediated Apoptosis Involves a Mechanism Distinct from Dual Aurora B/Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>Inhibition</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0545">Cancer cells accumulate viable cell mass during polyploidization and continue to do so for up to a week after the addition of AZD1152. However, 10 days after the onset of polyploidy, viability sharply declines as cells succumb to the polyploidization process (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). To determine whether apoptosis secondary to prolonged polyploidization engages the same, albeit delayed, apoptotic program as dual inhibition of Aurora B/Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, an additional siRNA rescue screen were performed to identify components of the Bcl-2 network that, when functionally disrupted, would preserve the long-term viability of polyploid cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref>). In contrast to the predominant requirement of BAX and NOXA for acute apoptosis induced by the AZD1152/ABT-263 combination, siRNAs against BAX and BAK confer similar degrees of protection, and siRNAs against BIK and BID, which were ineffective in the earlier rescue screen, protected cells from polyploidization-mediated loss of viability (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref>). Furthermore, depletion of NOXA failed to provide any protective effect in this setting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0144" num="0000">ABT-263 Enhances the Efficacy of Aurora Kinase Inhibitors In Vivo</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0546">Although Aurora Kinase inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious in preclinical studies, targeting Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>in polyploid tumor cells may produce efficacy superior to Aurora Kinase inhibitors as monotherapy. This was assessed by comparing the antitumor efficacy of single agent AZD1152 treatment to the combination of AZD1152/ABT-263 in a stringent and therapeutically relevant setting: well-established, large tumors (&#x2dc;0.5 gram) and with the maximum tolerated dose of AZD1152 AZD1152 as a single agent produced significant tumor growth inhibition in the HCT116 colon carcinoma model, though tumors started to recover from therapy within one week (as evidenced by tumor regrowth). In contrast, the combination regimen of AZD1152/ABT-263 resulted in a rapid and more sustained tumor regression that persisted for at least 2 weeks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>). In tumors that were pretreated for 3 days with AZD1152, an induction in p53 was observed, a surrogate marker of polyploidization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). The active BAX conformer was detected within 4 hours of ABT-263 treatment in tumors from AZD1152-treated mice, but not in naive tumors, reflecting the rapid onset of ABT-263-mediated apoptosis in polyploid tumor cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>).</p>
