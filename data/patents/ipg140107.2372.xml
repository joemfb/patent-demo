<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a quinoxaline derivative, and a light emitting element, a light emitting device, and an electronic appliance each of which uses the quinoxaline derivative.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">An organic compound has various material systems compared with an inorganic compound, and has possibility to synthesize a material having various functions depending on the molecular design. Owing to these advantages, photo electronics and electronics which use a functional organic material have been attracting attention in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">For example, a solar cell, a light emitting element, an organic transistor, and the like can be mentioned as examples of an electronic device using an organic compound as a functional organic material. These are devices taking advantage of electric properties and optical properties of the organic compound. Among them, in particular, a light emitting element has been making remarkable development.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">It is said that light emission mechanism of a light emitting element is as follows: when a voltage is applied between a pair of electrodes which interpose a light emitting layer, electrons injected from a cathode and holes injected from an anode are recombined in the light emission center of the light emitting layer, so as to form a molecular exciton and energy is released to emit light when the molecular exciton returns to a ground state. As excitation states, a singlet excitation state and a triplet excitation state are known, and light emission is considered to be possible through any of these excitation states.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Such a light emitting element has a lot of problems depending on a material in the case where an element property thereof is improved. In order to solve the problems, improvement of an element structure, development of a material, and the like are carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">As the most basic structure of a light emitting element, the following structure is known: a hole transporting layer formed of an organic compound having a hole transporting property and an electron transporting light emitting layer formed of an organic compound having an electron transporting property are stacked to form a thin film of approximately 100 nm thick in total, and this thin film is interposed between electrodes (see Non-Patent Document 1, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">A voltage is applied to the light emitting element described in Non-Patent Document 1, thereby light emission can be obtained from organic compounds having a light emitting property and an electron transporting property.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Further, in the light emitting element described in Non-Patent Document 1, functions are separately carried out. That is, a hole transporting layer transports a hole, whereas an electron transporting layer transports an electron and emits light. However, various interactions (for example, formation of exciplex, and the like) occur on an interface of stacked layers. As a result, a change in light emission spectrum or a decline in light emission efficiency may be caused.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">In order to improve a change in light emission spectrum or a decline in light emission efficiency which is caused by the interaction at an interface, a light emitting element in which functions are further separately carried out is devised. For example, supposed is a light emitting element having a structure where a light emitting layer is sandwiched between a hole transporting layer and an electron transporting layer (see Non-Patent Document 2, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">In such a light emitting element as described in Non-Patent Document 2, a light emitting layer is preferably formed by using a bipolar organic compound which has an electron transporting property and a hole transporting property so that interaction caused at an interface is further suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">However, most organic compounds are monopolar materials having either a hole transporting property or an electron transporting property.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">Therefore, a bipolar organic compound having both an electron transporting property and a hole transporting property has been required to be developed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">In Patent Document 1, a bipolar quinoxaline derivative is described. However, since characteristics such as heat resistance are not sufficiently obtained yet, more various bipolar organic compounds have been required to be developed.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment Mode 2</heading>
<p id="p-0135" num="0139">One mode of a light emitting element using the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0140">A light emitting element of the invention has a plurality of layers between a pair of electrodes. The plurality of layers are stacked by combining layers which contain a substance having a high carrier injecting property and a substance having a high carrier transporting property so that a light emitting region is formed apart from the electrodes, that is, so that carries are recombined at a portion away from the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0141">In this embodiment mode, the light emitting element includes a first electrode <b>102</b>; a first layer <b>103</b>, a second layer <b>104</b>, a third layer <b>105</b>, and a fourth layer <b>106</b> which are stacked in this order over the first electrode <b>102</b>; and a second electrode <b>107</b> provided over the fourth layer <b>106</b>. In this embodiment mode, the first electrode <b>102</b> functions as an anode and the second electrode <b>107</b> functions as a cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0142">A substrate <b>101</b> is used to support the light emitting element. As the substrate <b>101</b>, for example, glass, plastic, or the like can be used. Other materials than those may also be used as long as the light emitting element can be supported in a manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0143">As the first electrode <b>102</b>, a metal, an alloy, a conductive compound, or a mixture thereof, each of which has a high work function (specifically, 4.0 eV or higher) is preferably used. Specifically, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium tin oxide containing silicon; indium zinc oxide (IZO) in which zinc oxide (ZnO) is mixed by 2 to 20 wt % into indium oxide; indium oxide containing 0.5 to 5 wt % of tungsten oxide and 0.1 to 1 wt % of zinc oxide (IWZO); or the like can be used. Although these conductive metal oxide films are generally formed by sputtering, it may be formed by applying a sol-gel method or the like. Alternatively, gold (Au), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), palladium (Pd), a nitride of a metal material (such as TiN), or the like can be used.</p>

Molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>x</sub>), vanadium oxide (VO<sub>x</sub>), ruthenium oxide (RuO<sub>x</sub>), tungsten oxide (WO<sub>x</sub>), manganese oxide (MnO<sub>x</sub>), or the like can be used. Alternatively, the first layer <b>103</b> can be formed of a phthalocyanine-based compound such as phthalocyanine (H<sub>2</sub>Pc) or copper phthalocyanine (CuPc); a high molecule such as poly(ethylene dioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT/PSS); or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0145">Alternatively, a composite material including an organic compound and an inorganic compound may be used for the first layer <b>103</b>. In particular, a composite material including an organic compound and an inorganic compound showing an electron-accepting property with respect to the organic compound is excellent in a hole injecting property and a hole transporting property since an electron is transferred between the organic compound and the inorganic compound and carrier density is increased. In that case, a material having an excellent hole transporting property is preferably used as the organic compound. Specifically, an aromatic amine-based organic compound or a carbazole-based organic compound is preferable. Alternatively, aromatic hydrocarbon may be used as the organic compound. As the inorganic compound, a substance showing an electron accepting property with respect to an organic compound may be used. Specifically, an oxide of a transition metal is preferable. For example, a metal oxide such as titanium oxide (TiO<sub>x</sub>), vanadium oxide (VO<sub>x</sub>), molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>x</sub>), tungsten oxide (WO<sub>x</sub>), rhenium oxide (ReO<sub>x</sub>), ruthenium oxide (RuO<sub>x</sub>), chromium oxide (CrO<sub>x</sub>), zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>x</sub>), hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>x</sub>), tantalum oxide (TaO<sub>x</sub>), silver oxide (AgO<sub>x</sub>), or manganese oxide (MnO<sub>x</sub>) can be used. In the case of using a composite material including an organic compound and an inorganic compound for the first layer <b>103</b>, the first layer <b>103</b> can have an ohmic contact with the first electrode <b>102</b>; therefore, a material of the first electrode can be selected regardless of work function.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0146">As a substance for forming the second layer <b>104</b>, a substance having a high hole transporting property, specifically, an aromatic amine-based (that is, one having a bond of benzene ring-nitrogen) compound is preferable. A material that is widely used includes 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl, derivatives thereof such as 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(1-napthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (hereinafter referred to as NPB), and star burst aromatic amine compounds such as 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris(N,N-diphenyl-amino)triphenylamine, and 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]triphenylamine. The substance described here are mainly a substance having a hole mobility of 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or higher. However, other materials than those may also be used as long as a substance has a higher hole transporting property than an electron transporting property. Note that the second layer <b>104</b> may be a single layer or a mixed-layer of the above substances, or may be formed by stacking two or more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0147">The third layer <b>105</b> is a layer including a light emitting substance. In this embodiment mode, the third layer <b>105</b> includes the quinoxaline derivative of the invention described in Embodiment Mode 1. The quinoxaline derivative of the invention can preferably be applied to a light emitting element as a light emitting substance since the quinoxaline derivative exhibits light emission of blue to blue green.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0148">The fourth layer <b>106</b> is formed of a substance having a high electron transporting property, for example, a metal complex having a quinoline skeleton or a benzoquinoline skeleton and the like, such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum (abbreviated to Alq), tris(5-methyl-8-quinolinolato)aluminum (abbreviated to Almq<sub>3</sub>), bis(10-hydroxybenzo[h]-quinolinato)beryllium (abbreviated to BeBq<sub>2</sub>), or bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato)-4-phenylphenolato-aluminum (abbreviated to BAlq). Alternatively, a metal complex having an oxazole-based or a triazole-based ligand, such as bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzoxazolato]zinc (abbreviated to Zn(BOX)<sub>2</sub>) or bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzothiazolato]zinc (abbreviated to Zn(BTZ)<sub>2</sub>) can be used. Alternatively, other than the metal complexes, 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (abbreviated to PBD), 1,3-bis[5-(p-tert-buthylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]benzene (abbreviated to OXD-7), 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviated to TAZ), 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-(4-ethylphenyl)-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviated to p-EtTAZ), bathophenanthroline (abbreviated to BPhen), bathocuproin (abbreviated to BCP), or the like can be used. The substances described here are mainly a substance having an electron mobility of 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or higher. However, other materials than those may also be used as long as a substance has a higher electron transporting property than a hole transporting property. Note that the fourth layer <b>106</b> may be a single layer or may be formed by stacking two or more layers including the above substances.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0149">The second electrode <b>107</b> can be formed of a metal, an alloy, a conductive compound, mixture of these, or the like which has a low work function (work function of 3.8 eV or lower). As a specific example of such a cathode material, an element belonging to Group 1 or Group 2 in the periodic table, that is, an alkali metal such as lithium (Li) or cesium (Cs), an alkaline earth metal such as magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), or strontium (Sr), an alloy containing any of these (such as MgAg or AlLi), a rare earth metal such as europium (Eu) or ytterbium (Yb), an alloy containing any of these, or the like can be cited. However, when a layer having a function of promoting electron injection is provided between the second electrode <b>107</b> and a light emitting layer and in contact with the second electrode <b>107</b>, various conductive materials such as Al, Ag, ITO, or ITO containing silicon can be used for the second electrode <b>107</b> regardless of the work function.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0150">For the layer having a function of promoting electron injection, a compound of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal, such as lithium fluoride (LiF), cesium fluoride (CsF), or calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>) can be used. Alternatively, a layer which includes a substance having an electron transporting property may be mixed with an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, an alkali metal compound, or an alkaline earth metal compound, for example, Alq containing lithium oxide (LiO<sub>x</sub>), magnesium nitride (MgO<sub>x</sub>), magnesium (Mg), or lithium (Li) can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0151">The first layer <b>103</b>, the second layer <b>104</b>, the third layer <b>105</b>, and the fourth layer <b>106</b> may be formed by, for example, various methods such as an ink jet method, a spin coating method, and the like as well as an evaporation method. Moreover, a different film forming method may be used for each electrode or each layer.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0152">In the light emitting element of the invention having the aforementioned structure, current flows due to a potential difference generated between the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> and holes and electrons are recombined in the third layer <b>105</b> which contains the substance having a high light emitting property, thereby light is emitted. That is, the structure is such that a light emitting region is formed in the third layer <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0153">Light is extracted to the outside through one or both of the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b>. Therefore, one or both of the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> is formed of a substance having light transmissivity. If only the first electrode <b>102</b> is formed of a substance having light transmissivity, light is extracted from the substrate side through the first electrode <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. If only the second electrode <b>107</b> is formed of a substance having light transmissivity, light is extracted from an opposite side of the substrate side through the second electrode <b>107</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. If both of the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> are formed of a substance having light transmissivity, light is extracted from both of the substrate side and the opposite side of the substrate side through the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0154">The structure of the layers provided between the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> is not limited to the aforementioned structure. Other structures than the aforementioned one may be applied as long as the structures are as follows: a light emitting region where holes and electrons are recombined is provided apart from the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> so that quenching due to approximation of the light emitting region and the metal is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0155">In other words, the stacked structure of the layers is not particularly limited, and a layer which includes a substance having a high electron transporting property, a substance having a high hole transporting property, a substance having a high electron injecting property, a substance having a high hole injecting property, a substance having a bipolar property (a substance having a high electron transporting property and a high hole transporting property), a hole blocking material, or the like may be freely combined with the quinoxaline derivative of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0156">A light emitting element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a structure in which a first layer <b>303</b> which includes a substance having a high electron transporting property, a second layer <b>304</b> which includes a light emitting substance, a third layer <b>305</b> which includes a substance having a high hole transporting property, a fourth layer <b>306</b> which includes a substance having a high hole injecting property, and a second electrode <b>307</b> functioning as an anode are stacked in this order over a first electrode <b>302</b> functioning as a cathode. A reference numeral <b>301</b> denotes a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0157">In this embodiment mode, the light emitting element is manufactured over the substrate made of glass, plastic, or the like. By manufacturing a plurality of such light emitting elements over one substrate, a passive light emitting device can be manufactured. Alternatively, for example, a thin film transistor (TFT) may be formed over a substrate made of glass, plastic, or the like, and the light emitting elements may be manufactured over an electrode electrically connected to the TFT. Thus, an active matrix light emitting device in which the driving of the light emitting element is controlled by the TFT can be manufactured. The structure of the TFT is not particularly limited. Either a staggered TFT or an inverted staggered TFT is applicable. Further, the crystallinity of a semiconductor used for the TFT is not particularly limited. Either an amorphous semiconductor or a crystalline semiconductor may be used. A driver circuit formed over a TFT array substrate may be formed by using one or both of an N-type TFT of and a P-type TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0158">The quinoxaline derivative of the invention can be used as a light emitting layer without including another light emitting substance as described in this embodiment mode since the quinoxaline derivative is bipolar and a light emitting material.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0159">Further, since the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is bipolar, a light emitting element in which a light emitting region is rarely located at an interface of stacked films, and which shows favorable characteristics with few changes in light emission spectrum and little decrease in light emission efficiency due to an interaction such as exciplex can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0160">Further, an amorphous film which includes few microcrystalline components can be obtained since microcrystalline components are hardly included during a film formation. That is, the film has a favorable quality; therefore, a light emitting element with few element defects such as a dielectric breakdown due to electric field concentration can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0161">Further, the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is a material which is bipolar and excellent in a carrier transporting property (an electron transporting property and a hole transporting property); therefore, when the quinoxaline derivative is used for a light emitting element, a driving voltage of the light emitting element can be reduced and thus the power consumption can be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0162">Further, by using the quinoxaline derivative of the invention, which has a high glass transition point, a light emitting element having high heat resistance can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0163">Further, the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is stabilized with respect to oxidizing reactions and reductive reactions occurring alternately. That is, the quinoxaline derivative is electrochemically stabilized. Therefore, by using the quinoxaline derivative of the invention for a light emitting element, a long-life light emitting element can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0164">It is to be noted that the quinoxaline derivative of the invention in a solution state exhibits light emission of blue to blue green in a short wavelength region, and the quinoxaline derivative in a solid state also exhibits light emission in a short wavelength region. This is explained as follows. In the quinoxaline derivative of the invention, not a planar condensed aromatic ring such as a naphthyl group or a fluorenyl group but a twisted biphenyl group is connected to an amino group. It is considered that the quinoxaline derivative hardly assembles due to the twist form of the biphenyl group in a solid state and light emission colors almost corresponds to each other between in a solid state and in a solution state. That is, the quinoxaline derivative of the invention has such a characteristic that a peak of light emission spectrum is almost the same between in a solution state and in a solid state; therefore, by using the quinoxaline derivative in a thin film state (solid state) for a light emitting element, light emission with a short wavelength can be obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0203" num="0207">It is to be noted that a light emitting element in which light emission is obtained from a triplet excitation state by adding the aforementioned organometallic complex, which is a phosphorescent substance, to the quinoxaline derivative of the invention has a low driving voltage and high current efficiency. Therefore, a light emitting element consuming low power can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0208">The quinoxaline derivative of the invention is a material which is bipolar and excellent in a carrier transporting property (an electron transporting property and a hole transporting property); therefore, when the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is used for a light emitting element, a driving voltage of the light emitting element can be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0209">Further, by using the quinoxaline derivative of the invention, which has a high glass transition point, a light emitting element having high heat resistance can be obtained</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0210">Further, the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is stabilized with respect to oxidizing reactions and reductive reactions occurring alternately. That is, the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is electrochemically stabilized. Therefore, by using the quinoxaline derivative of the invention for a light emitting element, a long-life light emitting element can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0211">Further, in particular, by applying a light emitting layer in which a specific organometallic complex expressed by the aforementioned general formula (101) is dispersed on the quinoxaline derivative of the invention, a long-life light emitting element consuming significantly low power can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0212">It is to be noted that the quinoxaline derivative of the invention in a solution state exhibits light emission of blue to blue green in a short wavelength region, and the quinoxaline derivative in a solid state also exhibits light emission in a short wave length region. This is explained as follows. In the quinoxaline derivative of the invention, not a planar condensed aromatic ring such as a naphthyl group or a fluorenyl group but a twisted biphenyl group is connected to an amino group. It is considered that the quinoxaline derivative hardly assembles due to the twist form of the biphenyl skeleton in a solid state and light emission colors almost corresponds to each other between in a solid state and in a solution state. That is, the quinoxaline derivative of the invention has such a characteristic that a peak of light emission spectrum is almost the same between in a solution state and in a solid state; therefore, by using the quinoxaline derivative in a thin film state (solid state) for a light emitting element, alternatives of a light emitting substance which is dispersed on the quinoxaline derivative are increased. Specifically, in the case of using a phosphorescent substance as a light emitting substance which is dispersed, a light emission spectrum of the phosphorescent substance preferably has a peak at 560 nm to 700 nm. Meanwhile, in the case of using a fluorescent substance, a light emission spectrum of the phosphorescent substance preferably has a peak at 500 nm to 700 nm, and more preferably, 500 nm to 600 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0213">It is to be noted that the structure described in Embodiment Mode 2 can be used for layers other than the third layer <b>105</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0210" num="0214">In this embodiment mode, a mode in which the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is used for an active layer of a vertical transistor (SIT) which is a kind of an organic semiconductor element, is described as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0215">The element has a structure in which a thin active layer <b>1202</b> including the quinoxaline derivative of the invention is sandwiched between a source electrode <b>1201</b> and a drain electrode <b>1203</b>, and a gate electrode <b>1204</b> is embedded in the active layer <b>1202</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The gate electrode <b>1204</b> is electrically connected to a unit for applying a gate voltage, and the source electrode <b>1201</b> and the drain electrode <b>1203</b> are electrically connected to a unit for controlling a source-drain voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0216">In such an element structure, when a voltage is applied between the source and the drain under the condition where a gate voltage is not applied, a current flows (be in an ON state). When a gate voltage is applied in this state, a depletion layer is generated on the periphery of the gate electrode <b>1204</b>, thereby a current does not flow (be in an OFF state). With the aforementioned mechanism, the element operates as a transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0217">In a vertical transistor, a material which has both a carrier transporting property and an excellent film quality is required for an active layer similarly to a light emitting element. The quinoxaline derivative of the invention is useful since it sufficiently meets the requirement.</p>

The light emitting device in this specification includes not only a light emitting device itself but also a light emitting device attached with an FPC or a PWB.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0221">Subsequently, a cross-sectional structure is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The driver circuit portion and the pixel portion are formed over an element substrate <b>610</b>. Here, the source side driver circuit <b>601</b> which is the driver circuit portion and one pixel in the pixel portion <b>602</b> are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0222">It is to be noted that a CMOS circuit, which is a combination of an n-channel TFT <b>623</b> and a p-channel TFT <b>624</b>, is formed as the source side driver circuit <b>601</b>. A TFT for forming the driver circuit may be formed using various circuits such as a PMOS circuit or an NMOS circuit. Although a driver integration type in which a driver circuit is formed over a substrate is described in this embodiment mode, a driver circuit is not necessarily formed over a substrate and can be formed outside a substrate. Further, crystallinity of a semiconductor used for a TFT is not particularly limited. Either an amorphous semiconductor or a crystalline semiconductor may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0223">The pixel portion <b>602</b> has a plurality of pixels, each of which includes a switching TFT <b>611</b>, a current control TFT <b>612</b>, and a first electrode <b>613</b> which is electrically connected to a drain of the current control TFT <b>612</b>. It is to be noted that an insulator <b>614</b> is formed so as to cover an end portion of the first electrode <b>613</b>.

<p id="p-0220" num="0224">The insulator <b>614</b> is formed so as to have a curved surface having curvature at an upper end portion or a lower end portion thereof in order to make the coverage favorable.

Either a negative type which becomes insoluble in an etchant by light irradiation or a positive type which becomes soluble in an etchant by light irradiation can be used as the insulator <b>614</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0225">A layer <b>616</b> including a light emitting substance and a second electrode <b>617</b> are formed over the first electrode <b>613</b>. Here, a material having a high work function is preferably used as a material for the first electrode <b>613</b> which serves as an anode. For example, the first electrode <b>613</b> can be formed by using stacked layers of a titanium nitride film and a film containing aluminum as its main component; a three-layer structure of a titanium nitride film, a film including aluminum as its main component, and another titanium nitride film; or the like as well as a single-layer film such as an ITO film, an indium tin oxide film containing silicon, an indium oxide film containing zinc oxide of 2 to 20 wt %, a titanium nitride film, a chromium film, a tungsten film, a Zn film, or a Pt film. When the first electrode <b>613</b> has a stacked layer structure, it can have low resistance as wiring and form a favorable ohmic contact. Further, the first electrode <b>613</b> can function as an anode.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0226">In addition, the layer <b>616</b> including a light emitting substance is formed by various methods such as an evaporation method using an evaporation mask, an ink-jet method, and a spin coating method.

Further, the layer <b>616</b> including a light emitting substance may include another material such as a low molecular-based material, a medium molecular material (including an oligomer and a dendrimer), or a high molecular-based material. In addition, as a material used for the layer including a light emitting substance, a single layer or stacked layers of an organic compound is generally used. However, the invention also includes a structure in which an inorganic compound is used for a part of a film made of the organic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0227">As a material used for the second electrode <b>617</b> which is formed over the layer <b>616</b> including a light emitting substance and serves as a cathode, a material having a low work function (Al, Mg, Li, Ca, or an alloy or a compound of these such as MgAg, MgIn, AlLi, LiF, or CaF<sub>2</sub>) is preferably used. In the case where light generated in the layer <b>616</b> including a light emitting substance is transmitted through the second electrode <b>617</b>, stacked layers of a metal thin film and a light transmissive conductive film (of ITO, indium oxide containing zinc oxide of 2 to 20 wt %, indium tin oxide containing silicon, zinc oxide (ZnO), or the like) are preferably used as the second electrode <b>617</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0228">By attaching the sealing substrate <b>604</b> to the element substrate <b>610</b> with the sealing material <b>605</b>, a light emitting element <b>618</b> is provided in the space <b>607</b> surrounded by the element substrate <b>610</b>, the sealing substrate <b>604</b>, and the sealing material <b>605</b>. It is to be noted that the space <b>607</b> is filled with a filler. There is also a case where the space <b>607</b> is filled with the sealing material <b>605</b> as well as an inert gas (nitrogen, argon, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0229">It is to be noted that an epoxy-based resin is preferably used as the sealing material <b>605</b>.

<p id="p-0226" num="0230">As described above, a light emitting device manufactured using the quinoxaline derivative of the invention can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0231">A light emitting device of the invention can have favorable characteristics since the quinoxaline derivative of the invention described in Embodiment Mode 1 is used for the light emitting device.
