<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ink tank and a recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an ink jet recording apparatus (hereinafter also referred to simply as a &#x201c;recording apparatus&#x201d;), a desired recording operation is performed by ejecting ink droplets to fly out from fine ejection orifices, which are formed in an ink jet recording head (hereinafter also referred to simply as a &#x201c;recording head&#x201d;), such that the ink droplets impact a recording medium. In an recording apparatus for recording prints which are put up outdoors, a pigment ink is used for the recording because prints recorded using a dye ink have poor resistance to light and weather.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pigment ink is prepared by dispersing pigment particles in a solvent. Therefore, when the ink is held in the same posture and state for a long time, the pigment particles tend to precipitate under the influence of gravity. Precipitation of the pigment particles in the pigment ink causes a density gradient in the direction of gravity such that the density of the pigment particles is relatively low in an upper part of the ink and relatively high in a lower part of the ink, as viewed in the direction of gravity. Because shades of the pigment ink depend on the density of the pigment particles, a part of the ink containing the pigment particles at a higher density provides a relatively dark (deep) color and a part of the ink containing the pigment particles at a lower density provides a relatively light (pale) color. Accordingly, a visually recognizable difference in shades occurs in comparison between a print recorded by using the pigment ink in the state where the pigment particles are precipitated and a print recorded by using the pigment ink in the state where the pigment particles are not precipitated and the pigment density is uniform. When a print is recorded using the pigment ink in the state where the pigment particles are precipitated, there is a possibility that color balance differs between a beginning portion and an ending portion in one page of print. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, a proposal for avoiding the precipitation of pigment particles has been made in which an ink is stirred by providing an ink stirring member within an ink tank.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an on-carriage ink tank disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-273043. FIG. <b>7</b> is a vertical sectional view of the disclosed on-carriage ink tank in a posture that an ink reservoir is mounted to an ink jet recording apparatus. Two swingable members <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> are disposed within the ink reservoir. Ink flows are generated, as indicated by arrows TA, inside the ink tank with those swingable members <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> swinging in response to movements of a carriage onto which the ink tank is mounted. The swingable member <b>100</b> generates a rising ink flow, and the swingable member <b>110</b> generates an ink flow advancing toward the swingable member <b>100</b> along a bottom surface of the ink reservoir. With such an arrangement, the ink residing near the bottom surface of the ink reservoir and containing the pigment component at a higher density is raised upwards from the bottom surface. As a result, the ink within the ink reservoir can be efficiently stirred.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a large-sized ink jet recording apparatus recently commercialized, an off-carriage ink tank having a large capacity of an ink reservoir is used to reduce the replacement frequency of the ink tank. To allow replacement of the ink tank even during recording, this type of ink jet recording apparatus is constructed such that a sub-tank capable of temporarily reserving ink is disposed inside the recording apparatus and the ink is supplied from the sub-tank to a recording head through an ink supply passage formed of a tube. In the ink jet recording apparatus thus constructed, pigment particles precipitate in the pigment ink reserved in the ink supply passage and the sub-tank as well. To cope with the precipitation of the pigment particles, the ink in the ink supply passage and the sub-tank is circulated to stir the ink, to thereby prevent the pigment particles from precipitating in the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an ink jet recording apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-55646. The ink jet recording apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes a sub-tank <b>2</b>, and a first ink supply passage <b>8</b> for circulating ink while bypassing an ink jet head. In the ink jet recording apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-55646, a circulation pump <b>9</b> disposed in the first ink supply passage <b>8</b> is operated to suck up the ink within the sub-tank <b>2</b> and to convey the ink along circulation routes in sequence, as indicated by arrows a, b, c and d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Thus, in the ink jet recording apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-55646, the ink in the first ink supply passage <b>8</b> and the ink in the sub-tank <b>2</b> can be stirred by returning a large volume of the ink to the sub-tank <b>2</b> at a high speed. As a result, pigment particles can be prevented from precipitating in the ink. Further, a magnet stirrer <b>15</b> is disposed within the sub-tank <b>2</b> to stir the ink in the sub-tank <b>2</b>, thereby further preventing precipitation of the pigment particles in the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the construction disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-273043 is limited in its application to the ink jet recording apparatus employing the on-carriage ink tank, and it cannot be applied to the case of stirring the ink reserved in the sub-tank which is fixedly mounted to a main body of the recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, the construction disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-55646 requires a passage for stirring the ink to be provided separately from an ink supply path for the recording operation. In other words, the passage arrangement is complicated, which increases the size and cost of the apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In relation to a recording apparatus of the type reserving a pigment ink in an ink tank fixed to a main body of the recording apparatus and supplying the pigment ink from the ink tank to a recording head, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides the ink tank and the recording apparatus which can hold uniform density of the pigment ink reserved in the ink tank fixed to the main body of the recording apparatus and which can record an image with high quality.</p>

Reference numeral <b>33</b> is a waste ink tank into which the ink discharged from the recording head <b>30</b> is recovered. The cap <b>31</b> and the waste ink tank <b>33</b> are connected to each other by a waste ink recovery passage <b>34</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The construction for supplying the ink from the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> within the ink tank <b>1</b> to the recording head <b>30</b> will be described below. The interior of the tank case <b>1000</b> is pressurized by operating the pressurizing pump <b>40</b> which is connected to the pressure supply connection port <b>1070</b>. The first ink reservoir <b>800</b> is in the form of a bag made of a flexible material. Therefore, when the interior of the tank case <b>1000</b> is pressurized, the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> is collapsed and the ink is supplied from the first ink reservoir <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The ink is supplied from the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> within the ink tank <b>1</b> to the apparatus main body <b>2</b> through the first ink delivery passage <b>410</b> and the ink supply connection port <b>1010</b>. Because the ink supply connection port <b>1010</b> of the ink tank <b>1</b> is connected to the first ink supply passage <b>22</b>, the ink supplied from the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> is temporarily reserved in the sub-tank <b>20</b>. The ink is supplied to the sub-tank <b>20</b> by opening the first valve <b>24</b> disposed in the first ink supply passage <b>22</b>. Because the ink can be temporarily reserved in the sub-tank <b>20</b> within the apparatus main body <b>2</b>, the ink tank <b>1</b> can be replaced while the recording operation is continued by using the recording head <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the ink is supplied from the sub-tank <b>20</b> to the recording head <b>30</b>, the first valve <b>24</b> is closed and the second valve <b>25</b> is opened. Thereafter, the interior of the sub-tank <b>20</b> is pressurized by using a pressuring and depressurizing pump <b>21</b> which is used as a pressure adjusting mechanism for adjusting the pressure within the sub-tank <b>20</b>. With such pressurization, the ink temporarily reserved in the sub-tank <b>20</b> is supplied to the recording head <b>30</b> through the second ink supply passage <b>23</b>. The ink that is not used in the recording and is discharged from the recording head (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;waste ink&#x201d;) is recovered by the cap <b>31</b> disposed opposite to the recording head <b>30</b>. The waste ink is then sucked by the suction pump <b>32</b> and reserved in the waste ink tank <b>33</b> through the waste ink recovery passage <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As suggested above, the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> and the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> are each in the form of a bag made of a flexible material. Accordingly, when the interior of the ink tank <b>1</b> is pressurized, the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> is contracted and the ink within the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> is supplied. Further, the ink reserved in the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> can be all used up. The second ink reservoir <b>900</b> can be constituted in such a small size that it is disposed inside the ink tank <b>1</b> without occupying an extra space during the distribution stage of the recording apparatus. In addition, the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> can be repeatedly expanded and contracted corresponding to a stirring operation (described later), whereby efficient stirring is ensured. A highly pliable polyethylene is preferably used as the flexible material. For example, the flexible material can be of a structure that a polyethylene film is sandwiched between a nylon film on the outer side and a polypropylene film on the inner side. Another selectable example is an aluminum laminated film including a layer of an aluminum foil to suppress evaporation of the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ink reserving capacity of the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> can be set equal to or smaller than the volume of the sub-tank <b>20</b>. The reason is that, if the ink in the sub-tank <b>20</b> can be powerfully sent to the second ink reservoir <b>900</b>, precipitation of pigment particles in the ink can be suppressed without returning all of the ink in amount corresponding to the volume of the sub-tank <b>20</b> for the purpose of stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the ink tank according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The first ink reservoir <b>800</b> and the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> are constituted by forming one flexible film into two bags. A first member <b>700</b> is provided with a first boat-shaped portion <b>710</b> and a second boat-shaped portion <b>720</b>. An enclosable ink reservoir can be formed by fusion-welding the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> to the first boat-shaped portion <b>710</b> and the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> to the second boat-shaped portion <b>720</b>, respectively. The interior of the tank case <b>1000</b> may be partitioned to form the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> and the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> separately from each other such that the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> is not affected by the pressure developed when the ink is supplied from the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> under pressurization. The first ink delivery passage <b>410</b>, the second ink delivery passage <b>420</b>, and the branch point <b>430</b> are formed by pressure-bonding a second member <b>730</b> and a third member <b>740</b> together, in each or either of which one or more grooves are formed. A storage medium <b>1040</b>, e.g., a semiconductor memory, may be disposed within the ink tank <b>1</b> such that, for example, an amount of reserved ink is memorized in the storage medium <b>1040</b> to confirm an ink amount in the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> and to notify a time at which the ink tank <b>1</b> is to be replaced. A rubber valve <b>1030</b> is fitted to the ink supply connection port <b>1010</b> so as to prevent the ink from leaking when the ink tank <b>1</b> is attached and detached. Moreover, the ink tank <b>1</b> is properly positioned relative to the apparatus main body <b>2</b> by using two axes which are defined by the pressure supply connection port <b>1070</b>, which can also serves as a positioning engagement portion, and a positioning engagement portion <b>1020</b>. Hence the ink tank <b>1</b> can be easily positioned in three-dimensional directions.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(Ink Stirring Operation)</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the ink reserved in the first ink supply passage <b>22</b> and the sub-tank <b>20</b> is left in the same state for a long time, the pigment particles in the ink precipitate. An ink stirring operation is performed to prevent the precipitation of the pigment particles. The ink stirring operation performed in an ink jet recording system according to the exemplary embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an explanatory view illustrating an operation of supplying ink to the sub-tank from the ink tank in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an explanatory view illustrating an operation of stirring the ink in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of stirring the ink in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, after the ink tank <b>1</b> is mounted to the apparatus main body <b>2</b>, the interior of the ink tank <b>1</b> is pressurized by the pressurizing pump <b>40</b> and the ink is supplied from the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> to the sub-tank <b>20</b>. Upon completion of the ink supply to the sub-tank <b>20</b>, the first valve <b>24</b> and the second valve <b>24</b> are closed in S<b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The interior of the sub-tank <b>20</b> is pressurized by the pressuring and depressurizing pump <b>21</b> in S<b>102</b>. The step of pressurizing the interior of the sub-tank <b>20</b> by the pressuring and depressurizing pump <b>21</b> is called a first step. In this state, the interior of the tank case <b>1000</b> is open to the atmosphere and no pressure is applied to the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> and the second ink reservoir <b>900</b>. Accordingly, the pressure inside the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> and the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> is held at the atmospheric pressure, while only the interior of the sub-tank <b>20</b> is pressurized by the pressuring and depressurizing pump <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the first valve <b>24</b> is opened as a second step in S<b>103</b>, the ink within the sub-tank <b>20</b> is sent to the ink supply connection port <b>1010</b> of the ink tank <b>1</b> through the first ink supply passage <b>22</b>. The ink sent to the ink tank <b>1</b> is further sent from the ink supply connection port <b>1010</b> to the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> through the first ink delivery passage <b>410</b> and the second ink delivery passage <b>420</b>. At that time, due to the presence of a pressure difference between the interior of the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> and the interior of the sub-tank <b>20</b>, the ink in the sub-tank <b>20</b> is caused to powerfully flow into the second ink reservoir <b>900</b>. Therefore, an ink flow is generated as indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> so that the precipitated pigment component is raised and the ink is stirred. With the provision of the one-way valve <b>400</b> in the first ink delivery passage <b>410</b>, the ink is prevented from flowing backwards into the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> even when the ink is powerfully returned from the sub-tank <b>20</b> to the second ink reservoir <b>900</b>. The one-way valve <b>400</b> disposed within the ink tank <b>1</b> in this exemplary embodiment is constituted by a valve member <b>350</b> and a compressed spring <b>380</b>. Stated another way, when the ink is sent from the sub-tank <b>20</b> to the second ink reservoir <b>900</b>, the ink is prevented from entering the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> because the valve member <b>350</b> is held in place by the compressed spring <b>380</b>. The ink flow directing from the sub-tank <b>20</b> to the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> loses its power due to the viscous resistance of the ink, for example, after the lapse of a certain time. A time taken until the power of the ink flow is lost is set in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After the lapse of a standby time set in S<b>104</b>, the interior of the sub-tank <b>20</b> is depressurized as a third step in S<b>105</b> by the pressuring and depressurizing pump <b>21</b>. Herein, the flow resistance of the second ink delivery passage <b>420</b> is set to be smaller than the sum of (flow resistance of a portion of the first ink delivery passage <b>410</b> between the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> and the branch point <b>430</b>)+(valve opening pressure of the one-way valve <b>400</b>). Therefore, the ink having been sent to the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> is supplied to the sub-tank <b>20</b> at an earlier timing than the ink reserved in the first ink reservoir <b>800</b>. After it is confirmed in S<b>106</b> that a setting time enough for the ink to be sent from the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> to the sub-tank <b>20</b> has lapsed, the first valve <b>24</b> is closed in S<b>107</b>. The ink stirring operation is then brought to an end.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By performing the ink stirring operation in accordance with the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as described above, it is possible to prevent degradation of image quality, which would be otherwise caused by precipitation of the pigment particles in the ink. However, when the stirring operation is not performed for a long time, there is a possibility that the pigment particles in the ink are not sufficiently stirred by one cycle of stirring operation. In this exemplary embodiment, therefore the stirring operation is controlled to be repeated plural times depending on a time lapsed from the previous cycle of stirring operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart for determining a count of stirring (i.e., the number of times of ink stirring) in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is assumed that the time lapsed from the previous cycle of stirring operation is T<b>0</b>, a predetermined lapsed time representing a threshold at which the stirring operation is estimated to be required is T<b>1</b>, and a predetermined lapsed time representing a threshold at which plural cycles of stirring operation are estimated to be required because the time lapsed from the previous cycle of stirring operation is long is T<b>2</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the time T<b>0</b> lapsed from the previous cycle of stirring operation is counted in S<b>201</b> by a timer (not shown), and the predetermined lapsed time T<b>1</b>, which represents the necessity of the stirring operation, is compared with T<b>0</b> in step S<b>202</b>. If T<b>0</b> is shorter (smaller) than T<b>1</b>, the processing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is brought to an end without performing the stirring operation. If T<b>0</b> is longer (larger) than T<b>1</b>, the processing advances to S<b>203</b>. In S<b>203</b>, T<b>2</b> is compared with T<b>0</b>. If T<b>0</b> is shorter (smaller) than T<b>2</b>, the processing advances to S<b>204</b>. If T<b>0</b> is longer (larger) than T<b>2</b>, the processing advances to S<b>205</b>. In each of S<b>204</b> and S<b>205</b>, a count N<b>0</b> of stirring can be set to a number which is required to resolve the precipitation of the pigment particles depending on the corresponding lapsed time. Specifically, N<b>0</b>=N<b>2</b> is set in S<b>204</b> and N<b>0</b>=N<b>1</b> is set in S<b>205</b>. N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> are determined based on the characteristics of the ink, the amount of ink reserved in the sub-tank, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In S<b>206</b>, N=0 is input as the count of stirring. The stirring operation is performed in S<b>207</b>, and N=N+1 is input in S<b>208</b>. In is determined in S<b>209</b> whether N reaches N<b>0</b>. If N does not reach N<b>0</b>, the processing returns to S<b>207</b> to perform the stirring operation. If N reaches N<b>0</b>, the processing advances to S<b>210</b> for resetting to N=0. The stirring operation is then brought to an end.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, as described above, the ink stirring operation can be performed by operating the pressuring and depressurizing pump <b>21</b>, which is associated with the sub-tank <b>20</b>, such that the ink is moved to powerfully reciprocate between the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> disposed within the ink tank <b>1</b> and the sub-tank <b>20</b>. As a result, the ink can be stirred without providing a passage which does not take part in the recording operation. Further, image quality can be prevented from degrading with the pigment particles precipitating in the ink, and the recording operation with higher reliability can be realized.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(In Distribution Stage of Ink Tank)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the ink tank is distributed through the market, the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> is filled with the ink. In such a state, it is advantageous that the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> is employed to serve as a buffer for the first ink reservoir <b>800</b>. More specifically, in the event that the ink within the first ink reservoir <b>800</b> overflows with volume expansion of the ink or air inside the first ink reservoir <b>800</b>, which may be caused due to changes in temperature and/or atmospheric pressure, the overflowed ink can be reserved in the second ink reservoir <b>900</b>. For that reason, the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> should not be fully filled with the ink when the ink tank is distributed. Stated another way, the ink tank having higher reliability can be provided by providing the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> within the ink tank and by utilizing the second ink reservoir <b>900</b> as a buffer when the ink tank is distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the ink stirring operation can be performed by causing the ink to be powerfully sent from the sub-tank to the second ink reservoir disposed within the ink tank by using the pressure adjusting mechanism, and the ink can be stirred without providing a passage which does not take part in the ink jet recording operation. It is hence possible to provide the ink tank and the recording apparatus, which can prevent image quality from degrading with the pigment particles precipitating in the ink, and which can perform the recording operation with higher reliability.</p>
