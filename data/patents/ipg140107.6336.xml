No. 09/472,080, filed Dec. 23, 1999, which claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60/168,094, filed Nov. 30, 1999; these related applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems and methods for authenticating and registering personal background data, including over networks and particularly the Internet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Misrepresentations by job applicants of their backgrounds put employers at risk of hiring persons lacking in training or experience that employers were counting on when the applicants were hired. Indirectly such misrepresentations, besides camouflaging the absence of training or experience, also are indicative of potentially unreliable employees. Employers also risk public embarrassment when an employee's misrepresentations are discovered, regardless of the employee's job performance. There have therefore arisen over time a variety of services providing background checking of applicants for employment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, access to verified personal background data is provided in the form of an electronic document that includes a data record having personal background data and corresponding verification information as well as an electronic authentication of the contents of the data record. The data record is associated with a unique identifier. The electronic document may be distributed over a communication network to a person providing the identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment there is provided a method of providing access to a candidate's verified personal background data. A data record relating to the candidate's personal background data is established in a digital storage medium. The data record is associated with a unique identifier and includes a set of potentially verifiable components based on information supplied by the candidate and a corresponding set of query results, the corresponding set including, with respect to each component, the result of a verification query to a third party. The identifier is communicated to the candidate, who may directly or indirectly provide the identifier to others. Upon receipt of the identifier from an outside user over a communication network, an electronic document including the data record and an electronic authentication of the contents of the data record is distributed to the outside user over the communication network. The electronic authentication is capable of revealing unauthorized modifications of the contents of the data record.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electronic document may be distributed in the form of an electronic mail message or electronic file. The electronic document may be distributed over the Internet or other communication network. The electronic authentication may be an electronic watermark or electronic certification. The set of components may include the candidate's r&#xe9;sum&#xe9; information, in which case the set of query results may include information verifying the candidate's r&#xe9;sum&#xe9; information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment there is provided a system for providing access to a candidate's verified personal background data. The system includes a storage arrangement on which is stored a database having a plurality of data records. Each data record relates to personal background data of a candidate. Each data record is associated with a unique identifier that is communicated to the candidate and includes a set of potentially verifiable components based on information supplied by a candidate and a corresponding set of query results, the corresponding set including, with respect to each component, the result of a verification query to a third party. The system also includes a process, running on a computer in communication with the digital storage medium, for selectively distributing, to an authorized person presenting an identifier received directly or indirectly from a candidate, over a communication network, an electronic document including the candidate's data record and an electronic authentication of the contents of the data record, the electronic authentication capable of revealing unauthorized modifications of the contents of the data record.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another embodiment there is provided a computer-readable medium having embodied therein an electronic document including a data record and an electronic authentication of the contents of the data record. The data record includes a set of potentially verifiable components based on information supplied by a candidate and a corresponding set of query results, the corresponding set including, with respect to each component, the result of a verification query to a third party. The electronic authentication is capable of revealing unauthorized modifications of the contents of the data record.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electronic authentication may be an electronic watermark or electronic certification. The set of components may include the candidate's r&#xe9;sum&#xe9; information, in which case the set of query results may include information verifying the candidate's r&#xe9;sum&#xe9; information.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a method in accordance with the present invention for authenticating a candidate's personal background data. In box <b>11</b>, there is established and stored a data record <b>14</b> that pertains to the personal background data. The data record has a unique identifier <b>143</b>. The data record also includes a set <b>141</b> of components of the candidate's personal background data.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each component of the set <b>141</b> is potentially verifiable. Examples of verifiable components of personal background data include present and previous employers of the candidate, dates of employment by each such employer, positions held at each employer and the dates such positions were held, names of persons who have agreed to serve as references for the candidate, and the dates they agreed to do so, the text of the references or recommendations, educational institutions from which the candidate was graduated, the degrees granted to such candidate, the dates on which such degrees were granted, branches of the armed forces in which the candidate served, periods of service in such branches, ranks held during such periods, type of discharge, military medals or honors, and so forth. What these components have in common is that they are objective; the components involve factual matters that are either correct or incorrect. Because the components are not affected by individual judgment, they are susceptible to verification by inquiry to the pertinent party, such as the employer or educational institution or branch of the armed forces.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The data record <b>141</b> also includes a corresponding set <b>142</b> of query results. The set <b>142</b> includes, with respect to each component, the result of a verification query to the pertinent third party. If, therefore, the component relates to the candidate's undergraduate degree, the verification query will be to the candidate's college, and the result will be a determination that the college did in fact (or did not) grant a degree to the candidate, and optionally in addition that the degree is indeed in the specified field, was indeed granted on the specified date, etc. These latter options illustrate that each query may optionally include one or more sub-queries.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The verifiable component set <b>141</b> may include the text of a reference that the candidate has ascribed to a recommending third party. In this case, there is generated a verification query to the recommending third party, and the query, in one embodiment, presents to the recommending third party the text of the reference. The query result set <b>142</b> therefore includes the determination that the recommending third party is indeed (or is not) the source of the reference. The query result set <b>142</b> also optionally includes the date that the recommending third party provided the reference.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In box <b>12</b> the identifier <b>143</b> is communicated to the candidate. In box <b>13</b>, access to the data record <b>14</b> is permitted when the identifier <b>143</b> is provided. In this manner, verifiable components of the personal background data appear in the data record with authenticated results, and the data record is accessible to those who have been given the identifier by the candidate. The candidate is therefore able to provide selective access to the data record.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, the candidate himself can provide access to his pre-authenticated background data, so that employers or others who are given access can trust the information they are given. Unlike conventional background-checking services, embodiments according to the invention do not require employers to conduct background checks on candidates. Rather, candidates themselves can provide employers with access to pre-authenticated background data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating generally a process flow associated with a further embodiment in accordance with the present invention. In this method, long-term storage <b>28</b> communicates with six processes, as indicated by the arrows; each of these processes is described in further detail below: registrant data-entry process <b>21</b>, verification process <b>22</b>, registrant-request process <b>23</b>, process <b>24</b> for outside requests on a registrant, process <b>25</b> for outside requests on a non-registrant, and process <b>26</b> for finding a registrant.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As will be described in further detail below, a registrant enters data in process <b>21</b>, and the data is communicated to long-term storage <b>28</b> for verification and storage. One typical registrant is a job candidate, but may also be, for example, a candidate for admission to a school or other institution, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. Another typical registrant is a person who is currently in a job, but would like to be able to be found easily based on verifiable data, should the person change jobs or locations in the future. Once the registrant has entered data through process <b>21</b>, the data is used for verification process <b>22</b>. The registrant may then request distribution of verification results, as in registrant-request process <b>23</b>. Also, an outside user may then request verification results, using process <b>24</b> for outside requests on a registrant. The outside user is typically an employer, but may also be a school or other institution that requires verification of personal background data. If an outside user requests verification of data on a person who is not a registrant, the method uses process <b>25</b>, for outside requests on non-registrants, to undertake a verification process, including verification process <b>22</b>, and to communicate data to long-term storage <b>28</b>. In process <b>26</b>, an outside user searches for a registrant using key data. Here, the outside user need not be an employer, but may be anyone who wishes to contact a person based on verified personal background data.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention. Remote computer <b>31</b> is connected via a network <b>32</b>, such as the Internet, to a host computer <b>34</b>, which may be a World Wide Web server. In the latter case, the host computer <b>34</b> provides HTML pages (or pages in other languages, as known to those of skill in the art), for access by remote computer <b>31</b> by means of which may be entered data, as described below. Processes running on remote computer <b>31</b> and host computer <b>34</b> enable a job candidate or other registrant to enter personal data, including a set of data components for verification. The processes then communicate this data over network <b>32</b> to host computer <b>34</b>, and store the data in a digital storage medium such as content storage <b>33</b>, which may be realized as a hard disk drive.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Host computer <b>34</b> is connected to a plurality of computers of third parties via network <b>32</b>, including, but not limited to, computers of employers (third party <b>35</b>), educational institutions (third party <b>36</b>), and military or other government institutions (third party <b>37</b>). Host computer <b>34</b> runs a process which communicates verification queries, based on the stored registrant's data, over network <b>32</b> to computers of the third parties, including third parties <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>37</b>. Separate data components may be communicated to different parties over network <b>32</b>. Thus, for example, a verifiable component that includes the data that a registrant attended a given university may be communicated to third party <b>36</b>, while a verifiable component that includes the data that a registrant attained a given military rank may be communicated to third party <b>37</b>. These parties' computers then run processes which communicate back query results to host computer <b>34</b>, via network <b>32</b>. A process running on host computer <b>34</b> stores the query results in a data record on digital storage medium <b>33</b>, associating query results separately with each corresponding verifiable component.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An outside user's remote computer <b>38</b> is connected over network <b>32</b> to host computer <b>34</b>. Processes running on computer <b>38</b> and host computer <b>34</b> enable the outside user to enter a verification request, including a set of components of personal background data for verification; this data is then communicated over network <b>32</b> to host computer <b>34</b>, which stores the request in a digital storage medium such as content storage <b>33</b>. Processes running on computer <b>34</b> determine whether the request is on a registrant or non-registrant. If it is on a registrant, the process retrieves the registrant's data record from digital storage medium <b>33</b>, and communicates its data to the outside user's remote computer <b>38</b>. If the request in on a non-registrant, the process performs the verification procedures described above for a registrant's request, and communicates the results to the outside user's remote computer <b>38</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 9B</figref> illustrate the logical flow of methods according to embodiments of the invention. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, these logical flows also illustrate the components of processes running on computers in systems according to embodiments of the invention. For example, they may illustrate the processes described above for the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in a fashion known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> show the process flow for the registrant data-entry process, summarized as process <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. At box <b>401</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the user of a website is shown a welcome screen (HTML page) that introduces the user to the site, and to the process for data-entry that will be described below. At box <b>402</b>, the registrant user is shown a description of the service options that the user may elect, including the benefits and prices of each. The user selects an initial service option at box <b>403</b>, and is shown an overview of the guided registration process in box <b>404</b>. At box <b>405</b>, the registrant user enters his or her basic contact information, and at box <b>406</b> enters payment information, such as a credit card number. At box <b>407</b>, upon receiving the registrant's information, the host computer assigns a unique alpha-numeric identifier to the file, for internal use only. At box <b>408</b>, the registrant enters, via a template, the personal background data that he or she wishes to verify; each background data component to be verified may be entered using a different template.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The registrant data-entry process continues in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The user is next shown, in box <b>409</b>, a template containing the data that he or she completed, to review and modify as necessary. An &#x201c;okay&#x201d; button near the template allows the registrant to skip to box <b>411</b> (below); otherwise, box <b>409</b> forms a loop with box <b>410</b>, in which the registrant is provided with an opportunity to make changes or corrections to the template data. The registrant is next provided with a yes/no decision on whether to submit the template data (box <b>411</b>), and (if yes) payment is authorized (in box <b>412</b>) based on the data that the user provided in box <b>406</b>. The unique identifier temporarily assigned to the registrant in box <b>407</b> is now assigned to the registrant (box <b>413</b>). In some embodiments, the registrant may now set a password, which gives access to his data record (box <b>414</b>). In box <b>415</b>, the registrant is shown a &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; message, and a summary explanation of the r&#xe9;sum&#xe9; verification process. At this point, the registrant's data file is sent to temporary storage, for later submission to the verification process described below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> explain in detail the verification process, which is summarized as process <b>22</b> in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Once the registrant has entered data, as described above, the verification process occurs. As shown in box <b>501</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the registrant's data file, created in box <b>409</b> above, is first retrieved from storage, in the format of a Master Verification Document (MVD). The MVD has spaces for outcomes of query requests of the verification process, for each pertinent background data component; and a tracking number for the MVD. A tracking number is assigned to the MVD in box <b>502</b>. The system reviews submitted data for completeness and errors, in box <b>503</b>. If there are none, the process continues with box <b>506</b>, below. If there are incomplete or flawed elements in the data record, as determined by pre-established standards programmed into the host computer, the system sends a query about the elements to the registrant (by e-mail, for example), along with a time limit for response (box <b>504</b>). If the time limit is exceeded for the registrant's response, the system proceeds with box <b>506</b>. In box <b>506</b>, the MVD data is divided by third party entities to be contacted, and sorted into those with whom verification can be attempted (for use in box <b>508</b>) and cannot be (for use in box <b>507</b>). For those entities with whom verification cannot be attempted, a proper code is entered on the MVD in a data component set aside for such purpose (box <b>507</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> continues the verification process. As described in box <b>508</b>, an electronic query is sent to third party entities with whom verification can be attempted. The query is associated with a precoded time limit for the third party entity to respond. If the third party responds within the time limit, the process continues with box <b>509</b>; otherwise with box <b>510</b>. In box <b>509</b>, the information received from the third party entity is coded and entered on the MVD. The responses, entered on the MVD, may be &#x201c;verified as reported,&#x201d; &#x201c;verified in part&#x201d; (with the portion verified noted), &#x201c;corrected&#x201d; (with the third party's correction noted), &#x201c;authenticity denied,&#x201d; or &#x201c;no response received on this item.&#x201d; Alternatively, the responses may be &#x201c;confirmed,&#x201d; &#x201c;claim is inaccurate,&#x201d; &#x201c;unwilling to confirm or deny,&#x201d; or &#x201c;unable to confirm or deny.&#x201d; In box <b>510</b>, if no response is received within the time limit, a second query for verification is sent to the third party. If the second query is answered, the process goes to box <b>509</b>. If not, the code &#x201c;no response to query&#x201d; is entered on the MVD. With the query process finished, a completed MVD may be sent to a recipient, as will be described below in connection with registrant-request process <b>23</b>, process <b>24</b> for outside requests on a registrant, process <b>25</b> for outside requests on a non-registrant, and process <b>26</b> for finding a registrant (box <b>511</b>). The completed MVD is stored in a data storage medium (box <b>512</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Note that, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> have illustrated an electronic query process, some verification may be done by other means, particularly when third parties do not provide the necessary electronic connections. Thus, some verification may be performed by telephone, mail, or facsimile, or other conventional communication techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show in detail the registrant-request process <b>23</b>, summarized in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the registrant first completes a request for distribution, noting what portions of his or her MVD are to be distributed, and to whom (box <b>601</b>). The MVD may be distributed to various third parties, including the types of third parties shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In one embodiment, the system allows the registrant to purchase, over the Internet or other network, electronic &#x201c;chits,&#x201d; each of which allow the registrant to send a given number of verified r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;s to third parties. In a further embodiment, the system generates a list of e-mail addresses for commonly-requested institutions, in order to aid the registrant in selecting third parties. Once the request for distribution is complete, the system verifies the registrant's identity by requiring the registrant to enter his unique identifier (from box <b>413</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), and password (from box <b>414</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The registrant is presented with service options and prices (box <b>603</b>); then the registrant selects a service option (including a choice of formats for distribution), specifies recipients, and provides transmission information (box <b>604</b>). Once the registrant has entered payment information and authorized payment (boxes <b>605</b> and <b>606</b>), the registrant's MVD is retrieved from storage (box <b>607</b>), and, in some embodiments, the registrant is given the opportunity to review the MVD before dissemination (box <b>608</b>). In other embodiments, the process continues with box <b>611</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the registrant is given the opportunity to review the MVD, then he or she is given the opportunity to have the MVD updated to reflect new or future information (box <b>609</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). If the update option is selected (as in box <b>610</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), the system, in one embodiment, repeats processes <b>506</b> through <b>510</b> and then the process continues with box <b>611</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>; in this case, information that has already been authenticated will remain present in the database, and new information will be added. Alternatively, the system may also give the registrant the opportunity to have the MVD updated at given intervals of time (e.g. every six months) or to have the MVD updated at registrant-determined intervals of time. In either case, the process continues with box <b>611</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. In box <b>611</b>, the MVD is disseminated as specified by the registrant in box <b>604</b>. A confirmation of MVD dissemination is e-mailed to the registrant in box <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the MVD is distributed, it may be distributed in the form of a certified, tamper-proof or tamper-revealing document, containing the data record. For example, the MVD may be distributed as a watermarked original document containing the data record. Alternatively, the MVD may be distributed as a notarized paper with a seal, or as an e-mail message or electronic file containing an electronic watermark or electronic certification. Electronic certification systems are available, for example, from RSA Security, Bedford, Mass., www.rsasecurity.com, including those using public-private key systems; the contents of this website are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In each case, the document is provided with a certification&#x2014;that is, marked or identified in a way that is indicative of authentication of the document, and in a way that is appropriate for the medium of the document (whether paper, electronic, or otherwise).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7C</figref> show the details of process <b>24</b> for outside requests on a registrant, summarized in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. First, in box <b>701</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, an outside requestor who wishes to receive verified background data information on a registrant completes a Notice of Request for Verification Materials on a Registrant, including the registrant's unique identifier. Next, the system verifies the registrant's identity via the registrant's unique identifier (from box <b>413</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>); if the identifier is not valid, the requestor is sent to process <b>25</b>, described below (box <b>702</b>). If the registrant's unique identifier is valid, the requestor is asked in box <b>703</b> to choose between accessing the registrant's MVD (which requires the MVD tracking number from box <b>502</b>), or entering specific data to be checked (in which case the process continues with box <b>705</b>). The system checks the validity of the MVD by its tracking number and checks the integrity of the file (box <b>704</b>). In box <b>705</b>, the system checks whether pertinent legal regulations require that the registrant be notified of the request, and notifies the registrant if it is required. Next, the requestor is notified that the MVD is available (box <b>706</b>). Service options and prices are presented, based on the outcomes of boxes <b>703</b> through <b>706</b> (box <b>707</b>), and the requestor selects a service option (including the data format for dissemination), and provides transmission information (box <b>708</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Continuing as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the requestor enters payment information (box <b>709</b>) and authorizes payment (box <b>710</b>). If the whole MVD is chosen to be distributed, dissemination to the requestor is completed, and the process goes to box <b>719</b>, below (box <b>711</b>). If a portion of the MVD is chosen to be distributed, the requestor indicates the selected portion, and then dissemination to the requestor is completed, and the process goes to box <b>719</b>. If any MVD data is unavailable, or is not chosen, the requestor first enters the data to be verified (box <b>713</b>) in a fashion similar to boxes <b>407</b> through <b>411</b>, above. A new record is created under the registrant's unique identifier (obtained from box <b>413</b>, above), a tracking number is assigned for this record (in a similar fashion to box <b>502</b>, above), and the requestor is notified that requested data are in the verification process. The verification process proceeds in a similar fashion to process <b>22</b> (described in detail above), and dissemination to the requestor is completed. The process continues with box <b>714</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In box <b>714</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the requestor is given a choice for a record to be maintained. If he or she chooses not to maintain a record, the temporary record is inactivated, and the process proceeds to box <b>719</b>. However, if he or she does choose to maintain a record, the service and price options are presented (box <b>715</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Continuing with box <b>716</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the requestor makes the choice described in box <b>714</b>, is presented with a payment option (box <b>717</b>) and authorizes payment (box <b>718</b>). The verification record is filed with the registrant's master file in a digital storage medium (box <b>719</b>). In one embodiment, the registrant is notified that an Outside Verification Request has been filed (box <b>720</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show the process for an outside request on a non-registrant, summarized as process <b>25</b> in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. First, a requestor completes a Notice of Request for Verification Materials on a non-registrant or without access to the registrant's unique identifier (box <b>801</b>). At this point, depending on the privacy laws of relevant jurisdictions, the system may not allow the requestor to have any access to information about the non-registrant. Where these conditions do not pertain, the requestor is presented with service options and prices (box <b>802</b>), selects a service option (including format for dissemination), and provides transmission information (box <b>803</b>). The requestor enters payment information (box <b>504</b>) and authorizes payment (box <b>805</b>). Next, the requestor enters the data to be verified, in a process similar to that of boxes <b>407</b> to <b>411</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> (box <b>806</b>) and a temporary unique identifier is assigned to the person whose background data will be verified (box <b>807</b>). The system next checks whether legal regulations require that the subject of the authentication be notified of the request, and notifies the subject if required. The verification process then proceeds, in a similar fashion to process <b>22</b> (box <b>809</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the requestor next receives the results of the verification process (box <b>810</b>). In one embodiment, the requestor is given the choice for a record to be maintained (box <b>811</b>). If the choice is not to maintain a record, the temporary record is inactivated and the process continues with box <b>719</b>. If a record will be maintained, the requestor is presented with service options and prices (box <b>812</b>), and indicates his choice (box <b>813</b>). The requestor is also presented with payment options (box <b>814</b>) and payment is authorized (box <b>815</b>). The verification record is filed under the subject person's unique identifier (box <b>816</b>) and the person's unique identifier is given to the requestor (box <b>817</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is an arrangement provided for searching a database of pre-authenticated background data. This embodiment facilitates interpersonal networking by enabling one to search through a database of personal background data that is authenticated, and enabling individuals to initiate registration with such a database. In this embodiment, the procedures described above for producing authenticated background data may typically be followed by numerous registrants. The result is a database of authenticated background data. Once such a database is created, members of the public, including employers, may cause a search of the database to be initiated. The searchers need not have the registrant's unique identifier. The search may use key words and topics of interest. The searchable database thus facilitates networking, by providing employers and others with the ability to initiate a search of a database of personal background data that is known to be authenticated, and by providing candidates with a forum where their background data can be found, and will not be discounted as potentially-dishonest.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternatively, the searchable database may be implemented as a database that is directly accessible over the Internet, including as a World Wide Web server accessible through an HTML-implemented, web-page search engine.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Key word search methods may be used with the searchable databases. See, for example, the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,799,304 (Miller, &#x201c;Information Evaluation&#x201d;); 5,649,186 (Ferguson, &#x201c;System and method for a computer-based dynamic information clipping service&#x201d;); 5,537,586 (Amram et al., &#x201c;Enhanced apparatus and methods for retrieving and selecting profiled textural information records from a database of defined category structures&#x201d;); 5,418,951 (Damashek, &#x201c;Method of retrieving documents that concern the same topic&#x201d;); and 5,384,703 (&#x201c;Withgott et al., &#x201c;Method and apparatus for summarizing documents according to theme&#x201d;), which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Such search methods may be used to determine classes of data records to view as search results.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Embodiments of the invention provide particular advantages for networking because they allow for searching of data records where only fragmentary information is known about a person. For example, suppose a famous pastry chef registered with a database in a fashion similar to those described above. His authenticated personal background data would then appear in a data record accessible to those who have been given its identifier. Additionally, however, embodiments of the invention allow persons who wish to find the pastry chef to search through a database of authenticated personal background data. The searchers need not be employers, but could be interested in contacting the pastry chef for other reasons. They might have only fragmentary information about the chef. For example, while the data record contained the pastry chef's full name, education, employment background, and history of awards, the searchers might only know that the chef worked at a given restaurant two years ago. Using key word search techniques, each verifiable component of the data records in the database could be searched to find matches for the searchers' request.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Once it filters the data, the system provides searchers with a way of contacting the person whose record has been found. This contact method is provided by the registrant when he registers, in a fashion similar to that described above, and may include an e-mail address. Alternatively, the system may inform the registrant that the named requestor is looking for someone, who may be the registrant, based on the set of data that the requestor has specified; thus leaving it to the registrant to contact the requestor if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an increasingly mobile world, the searchable database thus facilitates finding former colleagues, or members of other organizations, with skills or interests or characteristics that are being sought but on whom key data are now missing.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Note also that data records according to embodiments of the invention need not contain a complete record of a person's background data. Thus, for example, the pastry chef's data record might include only verifiable components related to his work at one restaurant, and not contain his educational background. In such a case, a search of the personal background database would only attempt to find a record based on the components that were present.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A searchable database embodiment is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. The process flow shown in these figures is a detailed version of process <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for finding a registrant.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">First, at step <b>901</b>, a requestor who wishes to find a party based on authenticated background data completes a Notice of Request for Identification of a Party, which may be implemented as a template-based form on an internet website. This Notice simply informs the system that the requestor wishes to find a party, as opposed to using any of the other features of the system that are described above.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described at step <b>902</b>, the requestor next fills out an initial template to indicate the kinds of data that the requestor has on the party. The system lists all of the kinds of data that it stores on registrants, next to a yes/no query on whether the user has that kind of information. If, for example, the requestor knows that the party worked at an office of a given corporation, in a given city, in a given position, during a given timeframe, the requestor would fill out the &#x201c;yes&#x201d; box next to the corporation, location, job position, and dates of employment fields.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At step <b>903</b>, the system determines whether any of the listed fields has a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; box checked next to it. If none do, then the system informs the requestor that the system is unable to perform a search based on the kinds of information that the requestor has on the subject of the request, and the process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If, however, it is determined that the requestor's information fits at least one of the fields of data in the database, the requestor is told that the process will continue, and the process continues with step <b>904</b>. In step <b>904</b>, the system presents the requestor with service options and prices. The options may include, for example, the textual format in which the search results will be disseminated, the means by which they will be distributed (e.g. by e-mail, fax, mail, etc.), and the number of reports which will be sent. The prices may vary based on the expense of the service options. The requestor selects a service option, and provides information necessary to transmit the search results (e.g. e-mail addresses, mail addresses, etc.) (step <b>905</b>). The requestor enters payment information and authorizes payment (steps <b>906</b> and <b>907</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At step <b>908</b>, the requestor is next presented with a Finder Template, which may be a web-page with a series of template fields for completion by the requestor. These fields are structured to elicit information from any of the fields of information in the database. For example, if the database has information on corporations that employed registrants, and dates that they did so, then there will be template fields corresponding to each of these types of information. Once the requestor has filled out the Finder Template, the system assigns a temporary identifier to the search (step <b>909</b>) and searches for registrants based on the profile provided in the requestor's Finder Template (step <b>910</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once the system has found data records of registrants, it checks the data records to see whether each registrant wishes to be notified of any search requests which identify his data record, and whether each registrant has asked to authorize distribution of any search results (step <b>911</b>). Such notification preferences are given by registrants when they register, in a manner similar to that described in the registration process above. If a registrant has chosen to be notified, the system notifies the registrant. If a registrant wishes to authorize distribution of results, the system sends a request for authorization to the registrant. Additionally, where pertinent laws require authorization in order to release background data, the system automatically sends a request for authorization to the registrant.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, if the system has found a record but a release is not granted, the requestor is notified that the subject party has not authorized release of the record, and the process is terminated (step <b>912</b>). If the system has found a record, and necessary authorization has been given, or if no authorization was required at all, the process continues with step <b>913</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Finally, in step <b>913</b>, the system distributes records to the requestor, in accordance with the service option which the requestor selected. In this way, the process flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> allows people to search for information in a database of pre-authenticated personal background data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be noted that the systems and methods described above should not be confused with systems and methods for verifying that a given holder of a set of data on a person is indeed that person. The latter systems and methods include, for example, fingerprinting. Rather, the systems and methods described above relate to authenticating personal background data, whether held by a job candidate or any other person, and also to structuring a database to provide access to authenticated personal background data.</p>
