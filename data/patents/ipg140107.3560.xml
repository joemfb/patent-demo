<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 USC &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0033694, filed on Apr. 12, 2011 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments relate to a termination circuit, and more particularly to a termination circuit for a HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) transmitter, a HDMI transmitter including the termination circuit, and a multimedia source apparatus including the HDMI transmitter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a compact audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed digital data. It is a digital alternative to consumer analog standards, such as radio frequency (RF) coaxial cable, composite video, S-Video, SCART, component video, D-Terminal, or VGA (also called D-sub or DE-15F). HDMI connects digital audio/video sources (such as set-top boxes, DVD players, Blu-ray Disc players, personal computers (PCs), video game consoles, AV receivers, tablet computers, and mobile phones) to compatible digital audio devices, computer monitors, video projectors, and digital televisions. HDMI, is a digital audio, video and control signal format defined by 7 of the largest consumer electronics manufacturers. HDMI 1.0 was released Dec. 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface with a maximum TMDS bandwidth of 4.9 Gbit/s and the Dual-Link could handle about 10 Gbps. HDMI 1.0 supports up to 3.96 Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1080 p/60 Hz or UXGA) and 8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.3 was released Jun. 22, 2006 and increased the single-link bandwidth to 340 MHz (10.2 Gbit/s). Thus, HDMI 1.3 doubles the maximum data rate from 5 to 10 Gbps, and the color depth is increased from 24 bit to 30, 36 or 48 bit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Data rate refers to total number of digital bits in a second for a given signal. The higher resolution, refresh rate, color depth, the higher the data rate. For cables, data rate is critical because a cable is a passive device that does not know the signal content. When the cable length increases, the image quality is perceived to be perfect by human eyes until a length corresponding to too much noise. After that length, the image is either not viewable or disappears all together. According to the HDMI standard, a HDMI transmitter transmits data using a driver having the open drain form. Thus, the HDMI transmitter operates using a voltage of about 3.3V provided by a HDMI receiver. In general, a driver having the open drain form has a very large output resistance on the order of kilo ohms or mega ohms. Therefore, as the data transmission speed increases, a signal reflection on the output resistance of an open drain driver of the HDMI transmitter increases such that signal integrity is degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The longer cables and un-known devices introduce the potential for communication error. The error rate overwhelms the built-in error correction technology used in digital transmission. The symptoms of communication error can range from no picture, jumping picture, snowy picture, wrong resolution and no audio. The display can tolerate a certain amount of error bits per second; the picture would still be perfect as long as the error rate is below that threshold. Once the error rate through the cable exceeds the capability of the display, signal recovery may fail altogether. Better termination of signal reflection allows for the use of less expensive and/or longer HDMI cables.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In various to exemplary embodiments, a termination circuit includes a bias unit and a termination resistor unit connected between a positive transmission pin and a negative transmission pin. The bias unit generates a bias voltage by selecting the higher voltage among a first voltage received through the positive transmission pin and a second voltage received through the negative transmission pin. The termination resistor unit is formed on a well region biased by the bias voltage, and conditionally provides a termination resistor (e.g., a fixed or variable predetermined termination resistance) between the positive transmission pin and the negative transmission pin in response to a termination resistor control signal.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a termination circuit according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The termination circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used for a HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the termination circuit <b>100</b> includes a bias unit <b>110</b> and a termination resistor unit <b>120</b>. The bias unit <b>110</b> is connected between a positive transmission pin TXP and a negative transmission pin TXN. The bias unit <b>110</b> receives a first voltage V<b>1</b> through the positive transmission pin TXP and a second voltage V<b>2</b> through the negative transmission pin TXN. The bias unit <b>110</b> generates a bias voltage Vbias by selecting the higher voltage among the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b>. Thus, the bias unit <b>110</b> selects the higher (i.e., highest) voltage selected from among the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b> and outputs the selected (higher) voltage as the bias voltage Vbias.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The termination resistor unit <b>120</b> includes a well region of a semiconductor material biased by the bias voltage Vbias. The termination resistor unit <b>120</b> is formed on the well region. The termination resistor unit <b>120</b> conditionally provides a termination resistance between the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN in response to a termination resistor control signal CON_ST.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The bias unit <b>110</b> and the termination resistor unit <b>120</b> are preferably both connected in parallel between the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The bias unit <b>110</b> and the termination resistor unit <b>120</b> need not include any power source and may operate using only the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b> as its power source.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Multimedia data may be transmitted through the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN in the form of a differential signal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The termination circuit <b>100</b> may be operated to meet the requirements of each of the current and future HDMI standards. Because, as data transmission speed increases, a signal reflection on the output resistance of an open drain driver of the HDMI transmitter increases, the HDMI standard allows connection of a termination resistor between the positive transmission pin and the negative transmission pin when the data transmission speed is greater than 1.65 Gbps (Giga bit per second).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The termination circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to exemplary embodiments may be used in a HDMI transmitter and conditionally provides a termination resistor (i.e., a termination resistance) between the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN in response to the termination resistor control signal CON_ST.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram of an example <b>110</b><i>a </i>of a bias unit <b>110</b> included in the termination circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>may include a first PMOS (P-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistor MP<b>1</b> and a second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b>. Gates and drains of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may be cross-coupled. Thus, the higher voltage among V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP and V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN (relative to node N<b>1</b>) will be selected and output at node N<b>1</b> as Vbias.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> may have its gate connected to the drain of the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b>, its drain connected to the positive transmission pin TXP, and its source connected to a first node N<b>1</b>. The second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may have its gate connected to the drain of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b>, its source connected to the first node N<b>1</b>, and its drain connected to the negative transmission pin TXN and the gate of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b>. Thus the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>provides the selected bias voltage Vbias at the first node N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may be formed on the same N-type well region of a semiconductor substrate. The N-type well region may be coupled to the first node N<b>1</b>. Therefore, the N-type well region on which the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> are formed may be biased by the bias voltage Vbias outputted at the first node N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Hereinafter, the operation of the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the HDMI standard, a HDMI transmitter operates using a voltage of about 3.3V received from a HDMI receiver through the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN. During a data transmission, the first voltage V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP and the second voltage V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN may be about 3.3V or about 2.7V, respectively. For example, when the HDMI transmitter transmits a data signal having a logic high level, the first voltage V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP may be about 3.3V and the second voltage V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN may be about 2.7V. Alternatively, when the HDMI transmitter transmits a data signal having a logic low level, the first voltage V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP may be about 2.7V and the second voltage V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN may be about 3.3V.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the first voltage V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP is about 3.3V and the second voltage V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN is about 2.7V, thus, the first voltage V<b>1</b> is higher than the second voltage V<b>2</b>, the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> may be turned ON and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may be turned OFF. Therefore, charges may be transferred to the first node N<b>1</b> through the positive transmission pin TXP and the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b>, and the charges may be accumulated in the N-type well region, on which the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> are formed, since the N-type well region is connected to the first node N<b>1</b>. As such, the N-type well region may be biased by the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>may output the first voltage V<b>1</b> at the first node N<b>1</b> as the bias voltage Vbias.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Alternatively, when the first voltage V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP is about 2.7V and the second voltage V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN is about 3.3V, thus, the second voltage V<b>2</b> is higher than the first voltage V<b>1</b>, the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> may be turned OFF and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may be turned ON. Therefore, charges may be transferred to the first node N<b>1</b> through the negative transmission pin TXN and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b>, and the charges may be accumulated in the N-type well region, on which the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> are formed, since the N-type well region is connected to the first node N<b>1</b>. As such, the N-type well region may be biased by the second voltage V<b>2</b> and the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>may output the second voltage V<b>2</b> at the first node N<b>1</b> as the bias voltage Vbias.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Therefore, the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>may selectively output the higher voltage among the first voltage V<b>1</b> received through the positive transmission pin TXP and the second voltage V<b>2</b> received through the negative transmission pin TXN as the bias voltage Vbias. In addition, the N-type well region on which the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> are formed may become biased by the higher voltage among the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b>, selected as the bias voltage Vbias.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sources of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> include a region doped with P+ impurities, and the higher voltage among the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b> is applied to the sources of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b>. Therefore, if the N-type well region is biased by a voltage lower than the highest voltage among the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b>, a forward voltage may be applied to a diode junction between the sources of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> and the N-type well region. As such, a leakage current may flow from the sources of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> to the N-type well region.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, as described above, the N-type well region is biased by the higher voltage among the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b>, e.g., the bias voltage Vbias. Therefore, the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>may prevent the leakage current effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Since the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> are series connected between the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN, the gate-source voltage and the gate-drain voltage of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> are lower than the voltage difference between the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN. As described above, since one of the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b> is about 3.3V and the other of the first voltage V<b>1</b> and the second voltage V<b>2</b> is about 2.7V, the voltage difference between the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN may be about 0.6V, such that the gate-source voltage and the gate-drain voltage of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may be lower than about 0.6V. Therefore, the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may have a voltage tolerance lower than about 3.3V without degrading reliability of the termination circuit <b>100</b>. For example, the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> may have a voltage tolerance of about 1.8V or less.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Comparing the bias unit <b>110</b><i>b </i>to the bias unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bias unit <b>110</b><i>b </i>may further include the first protection resistor Resd<b>1</b> and the second protection resistor Resd<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, one or the other of the first PMOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the second PMOS transistor MP<b>2</b> will be turned OFF during operation.

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a HDMI system <b>500</b> includes a HDMI transmitter <b>400</b>, a HDMI receiver <b>510</b> and a transmission line Z<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> included in the HDMI system <b>500</b> may be implemented as the HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN of the HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> are connected to the HDMI receiver <b>510</b> through the transmission line Z<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">According to the HDMI standard, the HDMI receiver <b>510</b> alternately provides a supply voltage AVcc of about 3.3V to the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN of the HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> through the transmission line Z<b>0</b>. The HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> may operate using the voltage of about 3.3V received through the positive transmission pin TXP and through the negative transmission pin TXN from the HDMI receiver <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The HDMI receiver <b>510</b> may include a termination resistor Rrx between the supply voltage AVcc and the transmission line Z<b>0</b> for decreasing a signal reflection on the HDMI receiver <b>510</b>. The termination resistor Rrx may have the same impedance as the transmission line Z<b>0</b>. For example, when an impedance of the transmission line Z<b>0</b> is 50 ohms, the termination resistor Rrx may have an impedance of 50 ohms.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> may receive the data signal D and the inverted data signal Db, which are to be transmitted to the HDMI receiver <b>510</b>, from an external device. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the data signal D may be provided to the gate of the fourth NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b> and the inverted data signal Db may be provided to the gate of the third NMOS transistor MM<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">When the data signal D is at a logic low level, the third NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b> is turned ON, such that the current may flow from the supply voltage AVcc of the HDMI receiver <b>510</b> to the ground voltage GND through the transmission line Z<b>0</b>, the positive transmission pin TXP and the third NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b>. Therefore, the first voltage V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP may be about 2.7V and lower than the supply voltage AVcc since the supply voltage AVcc may drop along the transmission line Z<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In addition, when the data signal D is at a logic low level, the fourth NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b> is turned OFF, such that substantially no current may flow from the supply voltage AVcc of the HDMI receiver <b>510</b> to the ground voltage GND through the transmission line Z<b>0</b>, the negative transmission pin TXN and the fourth NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b>. Therefore, the second voltage V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN may be substantially equal to the supply voltage AVcc, which is about 3.3V.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Alternatively, when the data signal D is at a logic high level, the third NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b> is turned OFF and the fourth NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b> may be turned ON. Therefore, the first voltage V<b>1</b> of the positive transmission pin TXP may be substantially equal to the supply voltage AVcc, which is about 3.3V, and the second voltage V<b>2</b> of the negative transmission pin TXN may be about 2.7V and lower than the supply voltage AVcc since the supply voltage AVcc may drop along the transmission line Z<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">A comparator <b>511</b> included in the HDMI receiver <b>510</b> may determine the logic level of the data signal D by comparing the voltage of a signal transmitted through the positive transmission pin TXP with the voltage of a signal transmitted through the negative transmission pin TXN.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">As described above, if the HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> does not include a termination resistor between the positive transmission pin TXP and the negative transmission pin TXN, as a data transmission speed increases, signal reflection on the HDMI transmitter <b>400</b> increases such that signal integrity is degraded. For this reason, the HDMI standard allows for a HDMI transmitter to couple a termination resistor between a positive transmission pin and a negative transmission pin when the data transmission speed is greater than 1.65 Gbps (Giga bit per second).</p>
