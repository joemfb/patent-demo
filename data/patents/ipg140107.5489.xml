<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The field relates to applications and operating systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Computers, netbooks, smartphones and other consumer electronics devices provide users various software applications. An operating system may utilize an application launcher to provide a starting point for the services or applications that are available to the end user on each device. For example, in some operating systems, the application launcher is a start menu. On many cell phones and smartphones, the initial &#x201c;start deck&#x201d; shows icons for launching the applications that complement the basic telephony functions. Even within many service-oriented websites, there is a home page or navigation bar that helps guide end users to the applications and services available from that site. On smartphones or computers, an application launcher might also be an application store from which applications are purchased for installation and later use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Device manufacturers and service providers have historically negotiated bundling arrangements with software vendors who would be willing to pay for placement of their applications on the application launchers of devices. For example, computer manufacturers get paid by security software vendors to bundle a trial version of security software on a computer, and wireless carriers get paid by interne search providers for placement on the start deck.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, these ways of placing applications are sub-optimal because device manufacturers must negotiate with each software and service vendor directly. The bundling arrangements are inefficient&#x2014;a fixed price is locked in for a long period of time (often 12-36 months). Smaller device vendors have a weaker negotiating position and cannot command the &#x201c;market clearing price&#x201d; for helping the software vendor acquire a new customer. As a result, the end user experience suffers because the choice of bundled options is not necessarily driven by what provides the best end-user experience. Also, as software evolves and end-user needs change over time, the bundled options and the bounties paid do not change. New entrants are unable to win placement on the start decks of devices that are in service, even if they are willing to pay a bounty for acquiring customers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments relate to systems and methods for providing applications. According to an embodiment, a method for providing applications may include determining a ranking for each of a plurality of applications based on an auction value of each corresponding application. In some cases, auction values may be determined by application provider bids. The method may also include determining a ranked placement of the applications based on the application rankings. The ranked placement may also be determined based on a combination of the application rankings, bid amounts and relevancy. The relevancy may be determined by tracking data such as installation and churn rates. The method may further include displaying the ranked placement according to a first user selection associated with the applications. The method may then include launching a selected application of the ranked placement in response to a second user selection.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another embodiment, a system for providing applications may include an application ranker configured to determine a ranking for each of a plurality of applications based on an auction value of each corresponding application. The system may also include an application placer configured to determine a ranked placement of the applications based on the application rankings. The ranked placement may also be determined based on a combination of the application rankings, bid amounts and relevancy.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those skilled in the art with access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the invention would be of significant utility.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An operating system may utilize an application launcher to provide a starting point for the services or applications that are available to the end user on each device. For example, in some operating systems, the application launcher is a start menu or a start deck. Device manufacturers and service providers have historically negotiated bundling arrangements with software vendors who would be willing to pay for placement of their applications on the devices. However, these ways of placing applications are sub-optimal and the end user experience suffers because the choice of bundled options is not necessarily driven by what provides the best end-user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The embodiments described below provide an auction-based approach to configuring application launchers. An auction-based approach to application launching provides a scalable, efficient, revenue-maximizing alternative that would yield the most relevant set of default services for end users. Such an auction-based approach increases relevancy and maximizes revenue produced from, for instance, ads placed next to keyword-based search results. An auction-based approach may be used to recommend the best application for each of the primary types of application services that might appear on an application launcher.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an architecture diagram of exemplary application launcher system <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment. Application launcher system <b>100</b>, or any combination of its components, may be part of or may be implemented with a computing device. Examples of computing devices include, but are not limited to, a computer, workstation, distributed computing system, computer cluster, embedded system, stand-alone electronic device, networked device, mobile device (e.g. mobile phone, smart phone, navigation device, tablet or mobile computing device), rack server, set-top box, internet-connected TVs, printers, consumer electronics devices or other type of computer system having at least one processor and memory. Such a computing device may include software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. Software may include one or more applications and an operating system. Hardware can include, but is not limited to, a processor, memory and user interface display.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Application launcher system <b>100</b> may include auction-based application launching system <b>110</b> coupled to application placement display device <b>120</b>. Application placement display device <b>120</b> may be a screen, monitor or other device for displaying an application start deck, start menu or other representations of applications. Launching system <b>110</b> may also be included on or part of device <b>120</b>. According to an embodiment, launching system <b>110</b> may include application ranker <b>112</b>, application placer <b>114</b> and application launcher <b>116</b>. In some cases, launching system <b>110</b> may also include application installer <b>118</b>. Application ranker <b>112</b>, application placer <b>114</b>, application launcher <b>116</b> and/or application installer <b>118</b> may be implemented using hardware, software, firmware, tangible computer readable or computer usable storage media having instructions stored thereon, or a combination thereof and may be implemented in one or more computer systems or other processing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an embodiment, application ranker <b>112</b> may be configured to rank applications based on an auction value of each corresponding application. There are different types of applications that may be ranked. Examples of important categories of applications include:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0021">internet search [Google&#x2122;, bing&#x2122;, Ask&#xae;, Yahoo!&#xae;, WolframAlpha&#xae;]</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0022">video streaming [YouTube, Hulu&#x2122;, Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS]</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0023">music streaming [Spotify&#x2122;, Pandora&#xae;, Real&#xae;]</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0024">webmail [Gmail&#x2122;, Hotmail&#xae;, Yahoo!&#xae;Mail]</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">Rather than having every device manufacturer negotiate with each service provider, manufacturers may place in each &#x201c;slot&#x201d; of the start deck in each category, an application using an auction-based approach, according to an embodiment. An auction-based approach may yield a &#x201c;default&#x201d; or recommended option for each category, along with a ranked placement of alternatives. For a brand new device, an application launcher might be populated with default options that are dynamically determined and ranked based on an auction value.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">Various factors may form an auction value. Such factors may include a bid price, which is the maximum amount that an application or service provider is willing to pay to &#x201c;acquire&#x201d; a customer. For instance, this payment may be made when an end user clicks through or selects an application for the first time. It is also possible for bids to include other arrangements or concepts other than maximum monetary amounts. For example, bids may include offering certain services or portions of an application to a user. Bids may involve advertisement negotiation. For example, known methods of internet advertising with keywords may be used to determine bids and auction values. Bids may also include subscription arrangements. In some cases, bids may relate to more specific requirements for placement, including temporary or timed placements. Bids for application placement may be collected before the first placement of the applications by the device provider. Bids may also be taken after the first placement of the applications. There may be certain periods of time that bids are taken. In some cases, bids may affect application placement after user input.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">Other factors may be used to determine an auction value. For example, clickthrough rate may be a factor. A clickthrough rate may indicate how often end users click through to the service when presented with the option. Churn rate is another factor. Churn rate indicates how often end users click on an icon or representation of an application category to find an alternate application for that category. Various other factors may be used to determine an auction value for purposes of ranking. Application ranker <b>112</b> will determine a ranking based on the auction values of the applications. This ranking may be adjusted by other data that may include, but is not limited to, click-through and churn rates.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">Application placer <b>114</b> may be configured to determine a placement of the applications based on the auction values. This placement may be a stack, a list, a circle or any other arrangement. In some cases, higher ranked applications may not necessarily receive a preferred placement due to a revenue generation strategy. According to a further embodiment, application launcher <b>116</b> may be configured to display or provide for display a determined application placement. The placement of applications may be displayed using, for example, application placement display device <b>120</b>. The ranked placement may also be determined based on a combination of the application rankings, bid amounts and relevancy. The relevancy may be determined by tracking data such as installation and churn rates.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">An example of application placement, as viewed by an end-user of device <b>120</b> (possibly a new device), is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents an example display view <b>200</b> of application categories. Display view <b>200</b> shows video streaming application 1 <b>202</b>, music streaming application 1 <b>204</b>, webmail application 1 <b>206</b> and social networking application 1 <b>208</b>. Each application is followed by a &#x201c;1&#x201d;, which in this case represents an initial ranking based on auction values. These highest ranked applications initially stand alone in this example as a recommended or preferred application for each application category. These application categories may also be arranged or placed based on auction values.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">Each category has an icon that may provide alternate applications for the category. For example, icon <b>212</b> may be used to show alternative applications for the category. When selected, icon <b>212</b> may provide a pull-down list of alternative applications for the selected category. In the example display view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, application placer <b>114</b> has the list sorted by rank from highest to lowest.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents an example display view <b>300</b> of a placement of ranked applications when icon <b>212</b> is selected in order to expand the alternatives to video streaming application 1 <b>202</b>. Video streaming applications 2, 3 and 4 are shown by blocks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>, respectively. These video streaming applications are placed according to their ranking. In this case, they are listed from top to bottom in descending order, with the alternative applications indented. Many other placements can be determined based on the application rankings, including lists, circle arrangements, animations, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">A user may select an application and the application may be launched. According to an embodiment, application launcher <b>116</b> may be configured to launch a selected application of the ranked placement in response to a user selection. In some cases, an application may not have yet been purchased or loaded. Application installer <b>118</b> may initiate installation of the selected application prior to launching the selected application. Application installer <b>118</b> may also initiate purchase of the selected application prior to initiating installation. In some cases, an application may be provided on a device for free, but without a subscription. Purchase of the application may also include purchase of a subscription. In some cases, purchase of an application may not involve an amount charged but may be a trial period. In other cases, the application may be free. In such cases, providers may earn revenue and/or provide revenue to another party based on later revenue. According to some embodiments, this later revenue may include advertisements, other clickthrough opportunities or any other means of providing a benefit to the provider of the application. Sometimes, an application may be free in order to benefit from developing a customer base. Purchase of an application is meant to include any action related to selection of the application that takes place for a user to obtain the services or benefit of the application.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">Applications may be presented to generate maximum revenue. Application placer <b>114</b> may be configured to determine how to place the applications in a manner designed to generate the most revenue, according to an embodiment. If an end user selected video streaming application 1, application launcher <b>116</b> or another component of launching system <b>110</b> may generate a billing value for the provider of video streaming application 1 for the clickthrough (i.e., &#x201c;user acquisition&#x201d;). Revenue may be generated based on actual user activity. Click behavior and advertisement behavior may also be used to consider billing values and default rankings. Different amounts may be billed based a combination of search results and user selection history.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">In another embodiment, if a user selects video streaming application 3 <b>304</b>, as shown in the example display view <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, video streaming application 3 <b>304</b> may replace video streaming application 1 as the top choice. This new placement of video streaming application 3 <b>502</b>, with expansion icon <b>512</b>, is shown in example display view <b>500</b>. Applications <b>504</b>-<b>508</b> in this placement have retained the positions they held as applications <b>204</b>-<b>208</b> in the first placement. Launching system <b>110</b> may retain and/or forward data showing that an end user chose to replace video streaming application 1 when it was offered as a &#x201c;recommended&#x201d; option. A recommended option may be placed in a top spot or a preferred location. In some cases, how long an application is installed may also be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">Compared to the current alternative of vendors negotiating long-term bundling arrangements with application vendors, the auction-based approach has several advantages. For example, auction-based application launching is more efficient. Device manufacturers can rely on an automated system for determining placement and collecting revenue for user acquisition. Bids for customer acquisition can be revised at any time and new entrants can participate. Revenue may be maximized by dynamically placing the services that are likely to generate the most revenue in front of end users. Smaller vendors get paid as much for user acquisition as larger vendors. End user experience is improved by factoring in the rates of adoption and churn in determining optimal placement of service options.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of exemplary method <b>600</b> for providing applications, according to an embodiment. While method <b>600</b> is described with respect to an embodiment of the present invention, method <b>600</b> is not meant to be limiting and may be used in other applications. In an example, method <b>600</b> may be used to provide applications using application launcher system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, method <b>600</b> is not meant to be limited to application launcher system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, exemplary method <b>600</b> begins at step <b>602</b> where a ranking is determined for each application based on an auction value. Various factors may be used to determine an auction value, such as a bid by an application provider. In some cases, lesser known applications may have an opportunity to become a preferred application based on a bid or user activity. According to a further embodiment, applications may be searched for on the device. Applications may also be searched for online or from one or more web application stores. Synchronized applications may also be involved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">In step <b>604</b>, a placement of the applications is determined based on the rankings. A first placement may appear as a list of application categories, with a recommended or preferred application shown for each application category, as shown, for example, in display view <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Each preferred or recommended application may present an opportunity to select alternative applications.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">In step <b>606</b>, a ranked placement may be displayed according to a user selection. For instance, an expansion of an application category may be requested. This user selection may involve clicking an icon next to a recommended application. The alternative applications may be displayed as ranked. For example, higher ranked applications may appear on top while lower ranked applications appear lower on the list. The placement determination of step <b>604</b> considers what can maximize revenue.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">In step <b>608</b>, an application selected from the ranked placement may be launched. In some cases, the application may need to be installed, purchased or subscribed to. Billing values may be generated in order to obtain revenue from the provider of the selected application. A new placement of the applications may be determined based on the user selection. Such a dynamic and automatic process increases flexibility and efficiency. Users have more freedom to choose applications that align with their individual wishes or requirements. Application and device providers are able to better maximize revenue.</p>
