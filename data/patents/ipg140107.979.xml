All subject matter set forth in provisional application Ser. No. 61/464,471 and 61/519,314 is hereby incorporated by reference into the present application as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to electric devices including electric vehicles and more particularly to a steering control and universal charger removably received within a socket in a dual motor vehicle. The universal charger may be utilized in a variety of electric devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Personal mobility vehicles may be characterized as either scooter type personal mobility vehicles or power wheelchair (power chair) type personal mobility vehicles. Each of the scooter type personal mobility vehicles and the power chair type personal mobility vehicles have certain advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A scooter type personal mobility vehicle typically comprises an elongated frame having front single or plural steering wheels and plural rear drive wheels. The front single or plural steering wheels are pivotably mounted on the front portion of the elongated frame. A handlebar is provided for pivoting the front single or plural steering wheels for steering the personal mobility vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The plural rear wheels are mounted on independent axially aligned shafts driven by a single electric motor though a differential gearbox. The electric motor is controlled by an electronic controller and a speed, braking and forward/reverse engager located on the handlebar of the scooter. The scooter type personal mobility vehicle is well suited for unconfined areas such as outside use due to the superior ride of the elongated wheelbase of the scooter. The elongated wheelbase provides more stability and a better ride for the scooter type personal mobility vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A power chair type personal mobility vehicle typically comprises a short frame having plural drive wheels and plural caster wheels. The plural drive wheels may be located in the front, center or the rear drive of the power chair type personal mobility vehicle. Plural caster wheels complement the plural drive wheels of the power chair type personal mobility vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The plural drive wheels are independently driven by plural electric motors. Each of the plural electric motors is independently controlled by a dual motor controller for independently driving the plural electric motors.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Typically, a joystick is mounted on an armrest of a power chair type personal mobility vehicle for controlling the first and second drive motors. The joystick operates both the steering as well as the speed, braking and forward/reverse movements of the power chair. The steering of the power chair is accomplished by a differential in speed between the plural independently driven electric motors including the reverse rotation of one of the electric motors relative to the other of the electric motors to turn the power chair. The power chair type personal mobility vehicle is well suited for confined areas such as inside use due to the short frame and the superior turning radius of the plural independently driven electric motors. The short wheelbase and the ability to reverse one motor relative to the other motor provides a reduced turning radius for the personal mobility vehicle for negotiating smaller confined spaces indoors.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The basic commands for driving both types of personal mobility vehicles are forward, backward; turn left or turn right; faster or slower; and stop. Unfortunately, the manipulation of a joystick of a power chair to control the multiple functions of steering, propulsion and braking is not intuitive or obvious to a new user or a cognitively impaired user. Many new users find it difficult to operate a power chair type personal mobility vehicle due to the lack of prior experience using a single interface joystick device that combines steering, turning, speed, braking and forward/reverse controls. In contrast, the manipulation of the handlebar in a scooter type personal mobility vehicle with independent drive controls is intuitively obvious to a new user. The intuitively obviousness is due to past experience operating tricycles, bicycles and automobiles with independent steering and drive controls.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, most power chairs and mobility scooters come with a small high frequency stand alone (off board) battery charger with output ratings from 1.5 to 6.0 amperes depending upon the size of the batteries installed on the vehicle. Approximately ninety percent (90%) of mobility vehicles are provided with a small lightweight high frequency battery charger kept off board of the devices. Millions of these mobility enhancing vehicles are used by the elderly and people with disabilities all over the world.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Charging the batteries of these vehicles is critical to maintain the function of the mobility vehicle and allow people to perform their daily activities utilizing the mobility vehicle. Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, Rehabilitation Professionals and other Medical Professionals require patients who live alone to demonstrably prove the patients are able to charge the batteries of electric vehicles prior to authorizing the mobility device for reimbursement or purchase by Medicare, Private Insurers and the Veterans Administration.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Successfully plugging in a small one-half inch round plug of a battery charger into a round socket located on a vertical wall on a joystick hand control on a power chair or on the battery box or plastic shroud of a mobility scooter may be difficult or impossible for most people with disabilities. Consequently, conscientious medical professionals do not authorize acquisition of these powered mobility vehicles for these disabled patients. Unfortunately, these immobile patients are often placed in a Nursing Home at great financial and emotional costs to the individual, simply because the immobile patients are unable to insert a battery charger power plug into a corresponding socket.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In my invention set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 8,132,634 filed Jul. 24, 2009, I disclose an electronic steering assembly for a dual motor vehicle having a handlebar rotatably mounted relative to a base for steering the dual motor vehicle through the rotational movement of the handlebar.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is an object of the present invention to improve upon my prior invention set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 8,132,634 by providing a movable hand control receivable at various locations of the motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is a further object of the present invention to an improved electrical connector which is easy for physically impaired persons to connect.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the invention is to provide a moveable steering control that is removably received within a socket in a dual motor vehicle for steering the dual motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another object of the invention is to provide a universal charger that is removably received within a socket in a dual motor vehicle for charging the dual motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another object of the invention is to provide a moveable steering control that is removably received within one of a plurality of sockets located about a dual motor vehicle for steering the dual motor vehicle from various locations about a dual motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another object of the invention is to provide a movable steering control incorporating an independent speed and forward-reverse controls that separates the physical movements necessary to steer the dual motor vehicle from the physical movements necessary to control the speed and forward-reverse control of the dual motor vehicle so the operation of the dual motor vehicle is intuitively obvious to a new user or a cognitively impaired user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object of the invention is to provide a movable hand control that is applicable to either a power chair type personal mobility vehicle or a scooter type personal mobility vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent objects of the present invention. These objects should be construed as being merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of the invention. Many other beneficial results can be obtained by modifying the invention within the scope of the invention. Accordingly other objects in a full understanding of the invention may be had by referring to the summary of the invention, the detailed description describing the preferred embodiment in addition to the scope of the invention defined by the claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Many physically challenged persons prefer to use a scooter type personal mobility vehicle instead of a power chair in spite of seating problems as is well known to those skilled in the art. In many instances this decision is made based on the intuitive simplicity of the scooter control system. However, the upper body strength required for turning prohibits some patients from utilizing the scooter. In use, the improved steering and control assembly <b>10</b> of the present invention enables an operator to electronically steer and turn the dual motor vehicle <b>5</b> with minimal effort unlike a scooter type personal mobility vehicle of the prior art requiring upper body strength to mechanically steer a single or plural wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As the handlebar <b>110</b> is turned, the only resistance is the resistance between the inside handlebar tube <b>120</b> and the outside tube <b>102</b> as previously shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Since the inside tube is mounted on a bearing (not shown) within the outer tube <b>102</b>, little to no force is required to steer and turn the dual motor vehicle <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Positioning the steering assembly <b>10</b> in the center of the vehicle enables the power chair user to achieve greater steering control and confidence with the steering controls in proximity to the rider within the line of sight of the occupant. Doorways, hallways and such narrow passageways are more easily navigated and can be aligned by the center position of the handlebar. The center-mounted steering assembly position is similar to a handlebar of a bicycle or the steering wheel of an automobile.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">When a person first learns to walk, ride a bike, or drive a car, the human brain processes the sensory feedback for balance and coordination in the cerebellum (National Institute on Aging, &#x201c;Inside the Human Brain: The Main Players&#x201d;, Nov. 25, 2008). In addition, according to the study, the cerebellum allows the person to move smoothly, maintain balance, and turn around without by reflex action. The cerebellum also involves with motor learning skills such as controlling a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Unlike a joystick which controls up to seven different functions and is offset from the line-of-sight of the occupant of the power chair, the improved steering control assembly <b>10</b> of the present invention can be intuitively operated, similar to steering a motor vehicle or a bicycle. Typical joystick controls utilized a single control element for controlling both direction and velocity. Using a single input element to control left and right turns, forward and reverse direction and speed has been determined to be especially difficult for the neurologically impaired and the elderly. These combined functions present an obstacle to learning proper control of the power chair. Some functions such as operating in reverse are counterintuitive, resulting in travel in a direction opposite to the intended direction. A few potential users find the steep learning curve impossible to overcome.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The improved steering and control assembly <b>10</b> of the present invention solves these problems. It minimizes the need for the brain of a patient to re-learn the process of driving a vehicle. This is especially true of elderly patients, who may find learning new tasks especially difficult. Neurologically impaired patients are able to control the power chair due to the intuitive nature of the control system. To drive the dual motor vehicle, the handlebar is turned to the steer dual motor vehicle in the desired travel direction. On a mid-wheel drive power chair, turning is completed in place, enabling direction change without forward movement or inadvertent collision with an object.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The steering and control assembly is operable with a single or both hands. The right side or left side control levers for speed, braking and forward/reverse can also be operated with just one or two fingers from either side.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">An additional benefit of the sturdy center handlebar structure is the safety it provides as a passive-restraint system and protection from accidental pedestrian contact. In busy pedestrian traffic, power chairs and wheelchairs are hard to see by pedestrians. Riders are concerned of personal injury to themselves or the pedestrian being hurt by falling onto the rider. The steering assembly increases rider comfort and security, since the handlebar can be grasped for support and provides added protection for the rider and others in crowds. The body postural positioning is symmetrical rather than the unbalanced position likely to be encountered by operation of armrest mounted joystick hand control.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The improved steering and control assembly <b>10</b> is less prone to accidental engagement or damage. The diaphragm of a joystick can be easily damaged and the joystick may be accidentally engaged when the joystick contacts or moves under a table or a desk. Operator injury such as broken fingers and hand injury often occurs when using a joystick and transiting confined spaces such as doorways and the like. The steering and control assembly is compact and portable, therefore it can be easily removed from the power chair to provide the user the comfort of traveling by airplane or motor vehicle while maintaining the security of the critical power chair controls.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The complexity of operating a joystick is substantially compounded for a walking attendant attempting to control the power chair when compared to a rider in a stationary seated position. The connector <b>146</b> allows the steering and control assembly <b>10</b> to be connected to multiple positions in front of the power chair or behind the power chair for an attendant. In crowds such as malls or sporting events many power chair users benefit from a caregiver or attendant to operate their vehicle, since the attendant will have a better view of oncoming pedestrians than the rider. The steering and control assembly <b>10</b> is less sensitive to slight inadvertent movements than the joystick and when installed behind the power chair rider for use by an attendant, overcomes the problems associated with attendant control of the power chair using a joystick.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Transferring a rider to or from a power chair may be more readily accomplished by simple removal of the steering and control handlebar system. Several operating and storage positions may be provided including in front, along either side or behind the seat. Retraction of the steering and control assembly <b>10</b> below the seat level and raising into the riding position may be accomplished with little effort. Alternatively, the steering and control assembly <b>10</b> can be mounted on a swivel off an armrest and be lowered and locked into place or may be small in size to be mounted at the end of an armrest.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">To drive the dual motor vehicle after turning to the desired direction of travel, the forward speed control lever <b>141</b> is gradually depressed enabling forward movement. Increasing the amount of depression of the forward speed control lever <b>141</b> increases the speed of the power chair up to the pre-set maximum speed. Operation of the forward speed control <b>141</b> is intuitive and stops the vehicle automatically on release, whereby a spring returns the forward speed control <b>141</b> to a neutral position. Many new power chair users previously operated a similar scooter-type driving control, a bicycle, or an automobile thereby virtually eliminating the time required to learning to operate the power chair.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Since the human brain controls activities like thinking, planning, and problem solving, as well as attention and movement in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (National Institute on Aging, &#x201c;Inside the Human Brain: The Main Players&#x201d;, last update Nov. 25, 2008), the command functions for regulating speed, braking and forward/reverse controls take place in a part of the brain other than the cerebellum where steering commands are processed. This theory may explain why separating the functions of steering and turning from the functions of speed, braking and forward/reverse direction, as established in the present invention are more intuitive and easier to use than joystick controls.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">To reverse direction of travel, the operator may choose to enable the reverse speed control lever <b>142</b> or turn the vehicle around in place by turning the handlebar. The drive controls also provide automatic three phase braking by releasing the speed control levers <b>141</b> or <b>142</b>. A spring returns speed control levers <b>141</b> or <b>142</b> to center and begins stopping the vehicle as the interface module <b>145</b> signals the dual motor controller <b>150</b>. Through the dual motor controller <b>150</b>, the current to the motors is reversed, establishing regenerative braking which provides a smooth slow down and current flow into the batteries. Dynamic braking then occurs to completely stop the vehicle, followed by the application of the parking brakes on each motor <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The parking brakes secure the vehicle even on inclines.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The steering and control assembly <b>10</b> includes a dashboard to house the interface command module <b>145</b>, the sensor <b>143</b> for speed, braking and forward/reverse, as well as standard and optional switches and gauges for the additional operations of the dual motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Prior to steering or operating the dual motor vehicle <b>5</b>, the operator is required to turn the vehicle on by depressing an on-off switch on the dashboard. Next, selection of the maximum speed for the present riding environment must be completed. The operator may select from various maximum speed ranges. Typically, indoor use requires a lower maximum speed settings while outdoor use permits higher maximum speeds. An LED indicator measures and monitors battery capacity in addition to providing fault monitoring via flash codes.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Optional controls for lights may be added to the power chair as desired. Other accessories such as elevating leg rests, seat lift actuators and other peripheral devices can be installed. Control of these accessories may be achieved through the dual motor controller <b>150</b> and switches on the dashboard or through the use of the speed control levers <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. The drive controls <b>140</b> may be separated from the steering assembly <b>10</b> and separately mounted at the end of an armrest, or in another position desired by the dual motor vehicle operator.</p>
