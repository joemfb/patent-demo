<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the construction of masonry &#x201c;cavity&#x201d; walls of the type that have an outer wall structure formed from masonry components set in mortar, and an inner wall structure that is separated from the outer wall structure by an air space cavity from which moisture is vented by weep vent passages formed through lower portions of the outer wall structure. More particularly, the present invention relates to the provision and use of a debris collection device for insertion into lower portions of the air space cavity of masonry cavity walls, the debris collection device providing improved drainage and air circulation while preventing the obstruction of drainage weep vent passages by wet and dry mortar droppings and sizable construction debris during and after construction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">So-called &#x201c;masonry cavity walls&#x201d; have outer wall structures formed from masonry elements such as bricks, concrete blocks, tiles, stones and the like that are set in mortar, and inner wall structures that are separated from the outer wall structures by a space of typically about one to about five inches. The space between the inner and outer wall structures is referred to as an &#x201c;air space cavity&#x201d; or, more simply, as a &#x201c;cavity.&#x201d; If the space between the inner and outer wall structures of a masonry cavity wall is two inches, the air space cavity is said to have a &#x201c;width&#x201d; of two inches. Masonry cavity walls typically have cavities that range in width from about one inch to about five inches, with a range of about one inch to about three inches being most common.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is well known, moisture tends to form in the air space cavity of a masonry cavity wall, and tends to collect in lowermost portions of the cavity. If collected moisture is allowed to remain within the air space cavity, damage may be caused as adjacent and nearby construction materials become damp. This damage may range from cosmetic discoloration to rot, disintegration and structural weakening that may require costly repair and replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Providing weep vent passages that extend through the outer wall structure, especially through lowermost portions of the outer wall structure, can do much to ventilate and to drain moisture from the air space cavity of a masonry wall. However, weep vent passages will not perform their intended function if they are obstructed, or if moisture is blocked from moving through lower and lowermost portions of the air space cavity to reach the weep vent passages.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To prevent mortar and construction debris from collecting in lowermost portions of masonry wall cavities where it may obstruct or block moisture from entering and discharging through weep vent passages intended to drain moisture from lowermost cavity portions, a variety of types of collectors and deflectors have been proposed for insertion into air space cavities.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">All numerical ranges disclosed in the specification and claims may be combined in any manner. It is to be understood that unless specifically stated otherwise, references to &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;the&#x201d; may include one or more than one, and that reference to an item in the singular may also include the item in the plural. All combinations specified in the claims may be combined in any manner.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a masonry wall assembly <b>10</b> of a building includes an outer wall <b>12</b>, an inner wall <b>14</b>, and a cavity <b>16</b> between the outer wall <b>12</b> and the inner wall <b>14</b> situated atop foundation <b>24</b>. The width &#x201c;W&#x201d; of the cavity is often between about one inch (2.5 cm) and about three inches (7.6 cm), but may be as narrow as about one inch or as wide as about five inches (12.7 cm). Mortar collection device <b>20</b> is positioned within the cavity <b>16</b>. The outer wall structure <b>12</b> typically is constructed of brick, concrete blocks, stone or other masonry elements laid in mortar in a conventional manner. A horizontal weep vent <b>22</b> is depicted at the lowermost course of brick. Other types of weep vent passages may be provided at other locations through the outer wall structure <b>12</b>, as is well known. The inner wall structure <b>14</b> typically is constructed of a wood framework (illustrated in part by a conventional two-by-four plate <b>32</b> covered on inner sides thereof by sheathing <b>25</b> and on outer sides thereof by drywall <b>28</b>. Membrane flashing or metal flashing <b>18</b> may be provided to line about the lower most ten inches (25.4 cm) of the inner wall structure. The flashing <b>18</b> may also line the bottom of the wall cavity <b>16</b>. Insulation <b>30</b> may be housed between the sheathing <b>25</b> and the drywall <b>28</b>. A weather barrier <b>26</b> may be positioned on the sheathing <b>25</b> facing the cavity <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is desirable to limit the amount of material placed within the cavity so as to maximize the air flow and moisture drainage, yet provide a sufficient barrier to falling mortar and debris that would otherwise collect near the weep vents and obstruct the discharge of moisture from the cavity. The mortar collection device of the present invention minimizes the amount of material placed within the cavity by providing a &#x201c;shell&#x201d; of water-permeable interconnected fibers for suspending any fallen mortar and debris.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first embodiment of the mortar collection device <b>20</b> includes a fibrous mat <b>42</b> constructed of a thin layer of monofilaments. The fibrous mat <b>42</b> forms a shell that includes a base <b>34</b> and keystone shaped extensions <b>36</b> projecting therefrom. The base <b>34</b> and each of the extensions <b>36</b> have a hollow, filament-free interior <b>33</b>. Between adjacent keystone extensions <b>36</b> are trapezoidal shaped channels <b>38</b>. The mortar collection device <b>20</b> is positioned within the cavity <b>16</b> so that the base <b>34</b> is at the bottom of the cavity with the extensions <b>36</b> extending upwardly. The extensions <b>36</b> are widest at the upper end <b>37</b>. At the upper end <b>37</b> of each extension <b>36</b> is formed an upper horizontal shelf for collecting and suspending fallen mortar and debris. The top of the base <b>34</b> forms a lower horizontal shelf <b>35</b> for collecting and suspending mortar and debris that may fall into channels <b>38</b> between the extensions <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">While the extensions <b>36</b> are illustrated as having a keystone shape, the extensions <b>36</b> may be formed into other shapes. Non-limiting examples of such extension shapes include &#x201c;X&#x201d; shaped, &#x201c;T&#x201d; shaped, chevron, and crenellated. The shape of the extensions is not limited, so long as at least one &#x201c;shelf&#x201d; is formed to suspend the mortar and debris above the weep vents. The shape of the mortar collection device may be obtained by die-cutting a sheet of the layered fibrous mats and/or providing a substrate having the desired shape onto which the filaments are extruded.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A fabric layer <b>40</b> may be adhered to the fibrous mat <b>42</b> on the open side of the mat <b>42</b>. In one embodiment, the mat <b>42</b> may include a rim <b>47</b> along the peripheral edge of the device <b>20</b>, to which the fabric layer <b>40</b> may be adhered. Within the wall cavity <b>16</b>, the fabric layer <b>40</b> faces the outer wall <b>12</b> and the outer surface of the fibrous mat <b>42</b> faces the inner wall <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, fibrous mat <b>42</b> has at least a portion thereof defined by polymer monofilaments <b>48</b> that twist and turn between junctures where adjacent filaments are connected so as to define open-space structures through which moisture can pass on its way to toward the weep vent passage openings. A contoured shell is formed from the mat by extruding the polymer monofilaments onto a substrate having the desired shape. The shell, made up of a thin layer of the randomly interesting filaments, defines an interior filament-free hollow. In one embodiment, the shell is defined substantially entirely by polymer monofilaments that twist and turn randomly between randomly located junctures where adjacent filaments are heat bonded so as to define a substantially rigid open-space shell that permits moisture to pass readily therethrough, but that catches sizable mortar droppings and construction debris and directs the droppings and debris into the channels <b>38</b> defined between the extensions <b>36</b>. Only a relatively few droppings of very small size, and only particle-sized construction debris are permitted to pass through the shell itself. The polymer monofilaments <b>48</b> may have an average diameter in the range from about 1 to about 4 mils, and in one embodiment from about 2 to about 3 mils.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The fibrous mat <b>20</b> is relatively rigid and capable of supporting not only its own weight but also the loads that are imposed on the mat when a typical amount of mortar droppings and occasional pieces of construction debris fall down through the cavities of masonry cavity walls and onto the collectors. The monofilaments <b>48</b> may be made of any suitably strong and mildew resistant polymeric material, including but not limited to polyethylenes, polypropylenes and other polyolefins; polyamides; polyester, polyvinylhalide (e.g., polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyltetrafluoride, polyvinyl chlorotrifluoride), polystyrene, polyvinylester (e.g., polyvinyl acetate, etc.) or a mixture of two or more thereof. The monofilaments <b>48</b> may be extruded onto a substrate having the desired structural profile to form contoured mat <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fabric layer <b>40</b> of the collection device <b>20</b> is preferably constructed of fiberglass or a similar material, even more preferably a material displaying resistance to environmental exposure (e.g., alkaline conditions, and the like). In one embodiment, the fabric layer <b>40</b> includes a fiberglass layer and a polymer coating. The fiberglass layer may be a woven layer. The fiberglass layer has a plurality of fiberglass strands extending parallel to one another in the machine direction, and a plurality of fiberglass strands extending parallel to one another in the cross-direction. The fiberglass strands intersect one another at angles of about 90&#xb0;. The strands may be referred to as yarns. The strands may be aligned in a side-by-side configuration or in an over/under configuration. The polymer coating provides a binding to hold the strands together in the fabric layer <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The fiberglass strands may each comprise a plurality of fiberglass filaments. The fiberglass filaments may be combined with filaments of another material, for example, a polymer such as polyester. The average diameter of the fiberglass strands may be in the range from about 10 to about 200 mils, and in one embodiment in the range from about 20 to about 40 mils. The number of fiberglass strands extending in the machine direction may be in the range from about 1 to about 20 strands per inch of fabric layer <b>40</b> as measured in the cross-direction, and in one embodiment in the range from about 6 to about 10 strands per inch, and in one embodiment about 7 or 8 strands per inch. The number of fiberglass strands extending in the cross-direction may be in the range from about 1 to about 20 strands per inch of fabric layer <b>40</b> as measured in the machine direction 4, and in one embodiment in the range from about 6 to about 10 strands per inch of fabric layer as measured in the machine direction 4, and in one embodiment about 7 or about 8 strands per inch.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another embodiment of the mortar collection device <b>20</b>, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, includes extensions <b>36</b> each having a notch <b>50</b> beginning at the wide end <b>37</b> and extending toward the base <b>34</b>. The base of the notch <b>50</b> forms an intermediate shelf <b>51</b> between the upper shelf <b>39</b> of the extension <b>36</b> and the lower shelf <b>35</b> of the base <b>34</b>. The notches <b>50</b> allow for additional air circulation and drainage within the cavity <b>16</b>, while providing a horizontal barrier for collecting falling mortar and debris and preventing blockage of the weep vents.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a further embodiment of the mortar collection device <b>20</b> includes keystone shaped extensions <b>36</b> having an undulating or wave-like profile. The mat <b>42</b> includes a plurality of extensions <b>36</b>, each extension having raised ridges <b>52</b> alternating with valleys <b>54</b>. The alternating ridges <b>52</b> and valleys <b>54</b> may extend the entire length of the extension <b>36</b> from the base <b>34</b> to the wide end <b>37</b> of the extension. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the alternating ridges <b>52</b> and valleys <b>54</b> may alternatively extend lengthwise from a midsection <b>41</b> of the extension <b>36</b> to the wide end <b>37</b> of the extension. In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the spaces created between the &#x201c;waves&#x201d; of the ridges and valleys act as a shelf to trap and suspend mortar and debris within masonry cavity above the weep vent passages.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, examples of various cross-sections of the extensions <b>36</b> of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are illustrated. The outer surface of one or more of the ridges <b>52</b> may be flat. The outer surface of one or more of the ridges <b>52</b> may be convex or domed shaped. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, all of the ridges <b>52</b> may have a flat outer surface <b>56</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, ridges <b>52</b> having a flat outer surface <b>56</b> may be alternated with ridges having a domed outer surface <b>58</b>. The pattern of ridges having a flat outer surface <b>56</b> and those having a domed outer surface <b>58</b> may be varied such that, for example, the ridges having a domed outer surface <b>58</b> may be every other ridge, or every fourth ridge, or every fifth ridge, and so on. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the outer surface of all of the ridges <b>52</b> have a domed outer surface <b>58</b>. A fabric layer <b>40</b> may be adhered to the mat <b>42</b> at the rear surface of the valleys <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ridges <b>52</b> of the extensions <b>36</b> of the mortar collection device face the inner wall structure <b>14</b>. The dome shaped top outer surface <b>58</b> of ridges <b>52</b> can accommodate irregularities in the masonry cavity <b>16</b>. The dome shaped outer surface <b>58</b> of the ridges <b>52</b> may be compressed against the inner wall <b>14</b> to press the fabric layer <b>40</b> toward the outer wall <b>12</b>, inhibiting the mortar from pushing into the cavity <b>16</b>. The mortar collection device <b>20</b>, while having an open structure that is relatively rigid and crush resistant, includes extensions <b>36</b> formed from a material which the is nonetheless capable of limited flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, another embodiment of the mortar collection device is illustrated. In this embodiment, the mortar collection device includes mat <b>42</b> with extensions <b>36</b> having a convex contour <b>60</b>. The contour <b>60</b> of the extensions <b>36</b> forms an upper shelf <b>44</b> and tapers near the base <b>34</b>. The outer surface of the base <b>34</b> is curved to form a hollow channel <b>45</b>, the upper surface of which forms a base shelf <b>46</b>. In this embodiment, the base <b>34</b> and extensions <b>36</b> are formed by extruding a thin layer of polymeric monofilaments onto a molding surface having a contoured surface so that when the mortar collection device is removed from the molding surface, the mortar collection device includes a thin &#x201c;shell&#x201d; of entangled polymeric monofilaments with an interior hollow <b>43</b> that is free of monofilaments. The body of the mortar collection device may have an overall maximum thickness dimension that is substantially the same as the width of the cavity between the inner and outer walls. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, when the mortar collection device is placed within the cavity <b>16</b>, the apexes of the convex extension <b>36</b> and of the convex base <b>34</b> contact the inner wall <b>14</b> of the wall cavity. In one embodiment, the mortar collection device <b>20</b> has a convex shape in a width direction and is compressible to accommodate wall variations in the masonry cavity of up to 0.5 inch (1.27 cm). The device may be compressible under a load similar to the weight of a 3 inch&#xd7;3 inch&#xd7;8 inch brick.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The thickness of the polymer monofilaments of the shell may be about 0.01 inch (0.25 mm) to about 0.125 inch (3.18 mm). In one embodiment, the thickness of the polymer monofilaments is greater than about 0.01 inch (0.25 mm). The thickness of the polymer monofilaments may be less than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, the quantity or thickness of the polymer filaments of the base is greater than the quantity or thickness of the polymer filaments of the extensions. In another embodiment, the quantity or thickness of the polymer filaments of the extensions is greater than the quantity or thickness of the polymer filaments of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, the total thickness of all of the &#x201c;shelves&#x201d; present in each extension is between about 0.01 to about 0.5 inch. Thus, the amount of material (filaments) within the cavity is limited. In one embodiment, for example, the total height of the mortar collection device is about 10 inches (25.4 cm), and of that total height, the shelves or horizontal obstructions within the cavity through which moisture flows and air circulates makes up only about 0.25 inch (0.635 cm) thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, the total volume of filaments in each extension is less than 10% based on the total volume of filaments and filament-free space occupied by the extension within the masonry cavity. In one embodiment, the total volume of filaments in the at least one extension is less than 5%, or less than 3% based on the total volume of filaments and filament-free space occupied by the extension within the masonry cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The base <b>34</b> and the extensions <b>36</b> of the mortar and debris collection device may include a planar peripheral rim <b>47</b> for bonding a fabric layer <b>40</b> to the device. In one embodiment, the width of the rim is about 0.25 inch (0.635 cm) to about 5.0 inches (12.7 cm).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the mortar collection device may include an interlocking element to prevent mortar and/or debris from collecting between adjacent devices. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a first mortar collection device <b>70</b> includes a forward key <b>74</b> at its outer edge and an adjacent second mortar collection device <b>72</b> includes a rearward key <b>76</b> at its outer edge. When the first mortar collection device <b>70</b> is placed within the cavity adjacent the second mortar collection device <b>72</b>, the forward key <b>74</b> aligns with the rearward key <b>76</b>, thus preventing a gap between the first and second mortar collection device in upper shelf <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, a first mortar collection device <b>70</b> includes a notch <b>73</b> in the base <b>34</b> at its outer edge. Adjacent second mortar collection device <b>72</b> includes a key <b>75</b> projecting from the outer edge of base <b>34</b>. When the first mortar collection device <b>70</b> is placed within the cavity adjacent the second mortar collection device <b>72</b>, the key <b>75</b> of the second mortar collection device is inserted into the notch <b>73</b> of the first mortar collection device, thus preventing a gap between the first and second mortar collection devices in lower shelf <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in one embodiment, the mortar collection device includes a plurality of extensions wherein each extension <b>36</b> comprises a trapezoidal frame <b>78</b> having an interior passage <b>80</b>. The frame <b>78</b> and the base <b>34</b> are formed from polymer monofilaments that twist and turn randomly between randomly located junctures where adjacent filaments are heat bonded so as to define substantially rigid open-space mat elements that permit moisture to pass readily therethrough.
