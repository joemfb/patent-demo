<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to gutters and, more particularly, to an apparatus that facilitates consistent lengthwise positioning of a gutter length relative to a roof margin during mounting thereof. The invention is also directed to a method of mounting a gutter using the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many different systems have been devised for mounting gutters on buildings. Commonly, the lengths of gutter are installed serially, end-to-end, beginning from one end of a fascia. Typically, the free end of the first placed gutter length at the end of the fascia extends lengthwise beyond the roof line to intercept the path of virtually all water that flows down the roof at that region. Installers have different preferences as to whether the free end of the gutter should be flush with the roof line in a lengthwise direction, or extend some distance therebeyond. The selection of the mounting method takes into consideration both function and aesthetics. Regardless of the lengthwise situation of the gutter end on the fascia, installers typically want consistency around the perimeter of a building structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore, installers have set the free end of the endmost gutter length using either an eyeballing technique or by measuring overhang, typically by using a tape measure or rule. As a result, the installer is left with only one hand to manipulate the gutter as positioning is effected. Aside from the inconvenience, the need to handle tools, fasteners, and the gutter length may compromise the installer's balance. This problem is contended with when the installer is situated either on a ladder or on the roof structure during the installation process. The inconvenience, and even potential danger, become more prevalent on multi-story units where installers are required to function potentially at significant heights.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In spite of the inconvenience, and even potential dangers associated with hanging particularly the initial endmost gutter lengths, the industry has used the above-mentioned, age old techniques of placing gutter lengths in a desired lengthwise position preparatory to attachment. There has been, and continues to be, a need for better techniques and tools for effecting gutter installation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one form, the invention is directed to the combination of a gutter piece and a gauging apparatus. The gutter piece has a length, a front, a rear, a bottom and a top. The gutter piece has an upwardly opening &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape, as viewed in cross-section taken transversely to the length of the gutter piece, for accumulating water and guiding accumulated water in a lengthwise direction. The gauging apparatus is operatively attached to the gutter piece and has a front and rear and a projecting portion to abut a surface on a structure to which the gutter piece is attached so as to thereby allow the gutter piece to be consistently aligned with the structure in a direction lengthwise of the gutter piece.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one form, the gauging apparatus is releasably operatively attached to the gutter piece.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one form, the gauging apparatus is operatively attached to the gutter piece without requiring any separate fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one form, there is a downwardly and/or forwardly opening U-shaped portion defining a receptacle at the front of the gutter piece. The gauging apparatus has a front leg that is directed into the receptacle with the gauging apparatus operatively attached.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one form, the gauging apparatus is one of: a) wedged; and b) spanning between spaced first and second parts of the gutter piece that are respectively at first and second locations spaced in a direction between the front and rear of the gutter piece.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one form, the gauging apparatus has a &#x201c;J&#x201d;-shaped portion with a base, a short leg, that is the front leg, and a longer leg. The longer leg connects to a first wall that extends rearwardly to the second location.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one form, the gauging apparatus is wedged into the receptacle so as to be maintained operatively attached through wedging forces produced between the gutter piece and gauging apparatus at the front of the gutter piece.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one form, the gutter piece has an upwardly facing ledge and the first wall is supported on the upwardly facing ledge at the second location.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one form, the gauging apparatus further includes a locating leg that has a length that projects in cantilever fashion from the first wall and defines the portion that projects to beyond the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape of the gutter piece.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one form, the locating leg projects vertically upwardly from the first wall.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one form, the locating leg has a substantially flat shape residing in a plane that is generally parallel to the length of the gutter piece.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one form, the gauging apparatus has a body with a single piece defining the locating leg, the first wall, and the J-shaped portion.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one form, the first wall has a substantially straight edge that abuts to the gutter piece along the length of the gutter piece.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one form, there is at least one locating mark on at least one of the gutter piece and gauging apparatus usable to facilitate consistent placement of the gutter piece and gauging apparatus in a predetermined lengthwise relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one form, there are a plurality of locating marks on one of the gutter piece and gauging apparatus usable to facilitate consistent placement of the gutter piece and gauging apparatus in first and second different pre-determined lengthwise relationships.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is a schematic representation of a gauging apparatus, according to the present invention, at <b>10</b>, used to facilitate consistent alignment of an elongate gutter piece <b>12</b> relative to a roof <b>14</b> on a structure <b>16</b>, which may take any form that supports the roof <b>14</b>. The schematic representation is intended to encompass virtually an unlimited number of variations of the structure <b>16</b>, the roof <b>14</b> thereon, and the gutter piece <b>12</b> that is used to accumulate and redirect water from the roof <b>14</b>. The precise nature of the gutter piece <b>12</b> is not critical to the present invention, nor is the manner in which it is attached to the structure <b>16</b> or cooperates with downspouts and/or other water diverting structure. Likewise, the gauging apparatus <b>10</b> is depicted schematically as it is contemplated that the gauging apparatus <b>10</b> may take virtually an unlimited number of forms, apart from those shown in the embodiments herein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the gauging apparatus <b>10</b> is shown schematically as it might interact with the gutter piece <b>12</b> and any part of the structure <b>16</b>, apart from the roof <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A typical gutter length/piece <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with a conventional hanger therefor at <b>18</b>. The depicted gutter piece <b>12</b> has an upwardly opening &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape, as viewed in cross section taken transversely to the length of the gutter piece <b>12</b>, which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> projects into the page. The &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape bounds a trough for water collection and controlled movement thereof. The gutter piece has a front at <b>20</b>, a rear at <b>22</b>, and a bottom at <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A rear wall <b>26</b> is substantially flat with a rearwardly facing surface <b>28</b> to abut to a surface on a fascia or wall <b>30</b> on the structure <b>16</b>. The rear wall <b>26</b> continues into a generally flat bottom wall <b>32</b> that in turn continues into a front wall <b>34</b> that angles upwardly and forwardly from the bottom wall <b>32</b>. The top region of the front wall <b>34</b> is bent to define a vertical portion <b>36</b> continuing into a horizontal portion <b>38</b>. The front wall <b>34</b> is reverse bent at the rear end of the horizontal portion <b>38</b> to define a cantilevered portion <b>40</b> that is angled downwardly and forwardly. The vertical, horizontal and angled portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> cooperatively produce a U-shaped portion of the gutter piece <b>12</b> that opens downwardly and/or forwardly and defines a receptacle <b>42</b> at the front of the gutter piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The hanger <b>18</b> has a J-shaped front portion at <b>44</b> that extends rearwardly to a U-shaped hanger component <b>46</b> with a downwardly opening receptacle <b>48</b> into which an upper edge <b>50</b> of the rear wall <b>26</b> of the gutter piece <b>12</b> is directed with the hanger <b>18</b> operatively placed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To operatively place the hanger <b>18</b>, the hanger is initially placed in the dotted line position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to allow the short leg <b>52</b> of the J-shaped portion <b>44</b> to be directed up to and into the receptacle <b>42</b>. the hanger <b>18</b> is then pivoted in the direction of the arrow <b>54</b> fully to the position wherein the upper edge <b>50</b> seats in the receptacle <b>48</b> to thereby consistently locate the hanger <b>18</b> relative to the gutter piece <b>12</b>. As this occurs, the J-shaped portion <b>44</b> wedges at the top region of the front wall <b>34</b>. More specifically, the &#x201c;J&#x201d; shape wedges between a location at the junction of the horizontal portion <b>38</b> and angled portion <b>40</b> and an angled portion <b>56</b> of the front wall <b>34</b>. The hanger <b>14</b> at the J-shaped portion <b>44</b> thereof and upper region of the front wall <b>34</b> deform slightly under a wedging force to establish a potentially firm connection of the hanger <b>18</b> to the front wall <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The hanger <b>18</b> has a width W parallel to the length of the gutter piece <b>12</b>. Substantially the entire width W at the J-shaped portions <b>44</b> engages the portions <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>56</b> on the gutter piece front wall <b>34</b> to afford a desired degree of stability, particularly with the wedging interaction of components as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The hanger <b>18</b> has a threaded base <b>58</b> integrated thereinto. An elongate, threaded fastener <b>60</b> is threaded into the base <b>58</b> and can be turned to advance in a rearward direction through the base <b>58</b> and rear wall <b>26</b> and into the fascia/wall <b>30</b> that supports the gutter piece <b>12</b>. The axis <b>62</b> of the fastener <b>60</b> is angled from horizontal to provide greater stability upon being directed into the fascia/wall <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one exemplary environment is shown for the inventive gauging apparatus <b>10</b>. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b> is shown on a building structure <b>16</b> with a roof <b>14</b> supported on fascia rafters <b>64</b>. Individual gutter pieces <b>12</b> are secured to an exposed, vertical surface <b>66</b> of the fascia <b>30</b>, as by using the aforementioned hangers <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The gauging apparatus <b>10</b> is utilized to facilitate consistent positioning of the gutter piece end <b>68</b> lengthwise relative to one edge <b>70</b> of the roof <b>14</b> where it overhangs the wall <b>72</b>. A modified form of gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; is utilized to strategically locate the gutter piece end <b>68</b>&#x2032; lengthwise relative to the opposite roof edge <b>70</b>&#x2032;. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; are essentially the same and are different only by reason of being left and right handed. The exemplary gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; will be described in detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, with the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; operatively attached to the gutter piece in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; has a body <b>74</b> that may be a single piece or made up of multiple, joined pieces. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; has a front <b>76</b> and rear <b>78</b>. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; has a J-shaped portion <b>80</b> at a front region thereof with a base <b>82</b>, a short/front leg <b>84</b>, and a longer leg <b>86</b>. The longer leg <b>86</b> is connected to a first wall <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; is designed to engage the gutter piece <b>12</b> at spaced first and second locations <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, respectively at the front and rear of the gutter piece <b>12</b>. It is possible, utilizing the design as described herein for the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;, that only the front connection between the gauging apparatus <b>10</b> and gutter piece <b>12</b> is required. In the depicted embodiment, the first wall <b>88</b> extends rearwardly fully to the second location <b>92</b> where it interacts with the gutter piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first wall <b>88</b> continues to a locating leg <b>94</b> that projects in cantilever fashion from the first wall <b>88</b>. In this embodiment, the locating leg <b>94</b> projects vertically upwardly from the first wall <b>88</b> out from the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape of the gutter piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this embodiment, the locating leg <b>94</b> has a substantially flat shape residing in a plane that is generally parallel to the length of the gutter piece <b>12</b>. The locating leg <b>94</b> has a vertical edge <b>96</b> located to abut the roof edge/surface <b>70</b>&#x2032; so as to thereby allow the gutter piece <b>12</b> to be consistently aligned with the structure <b>16</b> in a direction lengthwise of the gutter piece <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an end cap <b>97</b> is provided to define the lengthwise extremity/end <b>68</b>&#x2032; of the gutter piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The locating leg <b>94</b> represents one form of projecting component that, according to the invention, projects upwardly to beyond the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape of the gutter piece to abut to a surface/edge on the structure <b>16</b> to produce the consistent lengthwise alignment of the associated gutter piece <b>12</b>. It is conceivable that as an alternative to the depicted form of the locating leg <b>94</b>, a portion of the gauging apparatus <b>10</b> may project to beyond the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape with an edge or surface to engage another part of the structure <b>16</b>, such as the fascia or wall <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The interaction between the front of the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; and the front wall <b>34</b> of the gutter piece <b>12</b> is much the same as the interaction between the front of the hanger <b>18</b> and the front wall <b>34</b> of the gutter piece <b>12</b>. More specifically, the base <b>82</b> of the J-shaped portion <b>80</b> has a surface <b>98</b> that facially engages the angled front wall portion <b>56</b> over the full width W<b>1</b> of the J-shaped portion. This width may be on the order of 1-3 inches, but it is contemplated that it could be a lesser or greater dimension. The front/shorter leg <b>84</b> is directed into the receptacle <b>42</b> with the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; in the dotted line position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. By then pivoting the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; in the direction of the arrow <b>100</b>, the J-shaped portion is firmly wedged between the portions <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and angled portion <b>56</b>, all on the front wall <b>34</b> of the gutter piece <b>12</b>. As mentioned, the parts can be relatively configured so that this wedging action alone produces forces between the front of the gutter piece <b>12</b> and gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; adequate to maintain the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; operatively attached and prevent inadvertent shifting of the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; along the length of the gutter piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additional stability is optionally afforded by causing the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; to fully span between the front and rear walls <b>34</b>, <b>26</b> of the gutter piece <b>12</b>. This additional stability can be provided by wedging the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; between the front and rear gutter piece walls <b>34</b>, <b>26</b> or by simply causing the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; to abut the rear wall <b>26</b>, as described hereinbelow. The wedging/spanning locations are the aforementioned first and second locations <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, respectively at the front and rear of the gutter piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The rear wall <b>26</b> of the gutter piece <b>12</b> has an upwardly facing ledge <b>102</b> adjacent the top thereof. The first wall <b>88</b> on the engaging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be supported on this ledge <b>102</b> at the aforementioned second location <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first wall <b>88</b> is also shown with a substantially straight edge <b>104</b> that can abut to the rear wall <b>26</b> along the length of the edge <b>104</b> to provide added stability to the operatively attached gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; to avoid lengthwise sliding and/or skewing thereof relative to the length of the gutter piece <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With the configuration of parts as shown, it is possible to releasably operatively attach the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; to the gutter piece <b>12</b> through a simple manipulation of the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;, as described. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; can thus be releasably operatively attached without requiring any separate fasteners. Separate fasteners might be utilized to more positively secure the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;. The fasteners may be permanently installed or releasable. The former would be practical in the event the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; is to remain operatively attached after gutter installation. Suitable fasteners may take many different forms.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The generic depiction of the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; herein is intended to encompass any structure that can interact with a gutter piece, in virtually unlimited different ways, with or without fasteners, to be maintained releasably or permanently in an operatively attached relationship. While frictional securement is a preferred option, frictional holding is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The entire gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; is shown to be made from a single piece. As one example, the single piece may be shaped from a flat metal starting blank. Alternatively, the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; might be molded to the depicted shape. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be strategically cut off at various locations, as at <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, to eliminate sharp edges.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts the opposite-handed gauging apparatus <b>10</b> operatively attached to the gutter piece <b>12</b> and with an edge <b>96</b>&#x2032;, corresponding to the edge <b>96</b>, abutted to the roof edge/surface <b>70</b>. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;, as noted above, are essentially the same, with one being a mirror image of the other. Essentially, the first wall <b>88</b>&#x2032; extends lengthwise of the gutter piece <b>12</b> beyond the J-shaped portion <b>80</b>&#x2032; in an opposite lengthwise direction as compared to the J-shaped portion <b>80</b>. This situates the locating leg <b>94</b>&#x2032; lengthwise at the opposite lengthwise location.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a further modified form of gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2033; may have a universal construction that could be used at either end of the roof. The same J-shaped portion <b>80</b>&#x2033; may be employed with separate locating legs <b>94</b><i>a</i>&#x2033;, <b>94</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; incorporated. The locating legs <b>94</b><i>a</i>&#x2033;, <b>94</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; might have to be reconfigurable or repositionable so as not to interfere with the roof when not being utilized. Alternatively, one locating leg might be repositionable to be usable at both roof edge surfaces <b>70</b>, <b>70</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one or more locating marks <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be provided on the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; and/or gutter piece <b>12</b>. The invention contemplates that virtually an unlimited number of marks <b>110</b> may be provided on the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; to be alignable with either a mark or marks on the gutter piece <b>12</b> or some part of the gutter piece <b>12</b> or other part of the structure <b>16</b>. Likewise, a mark or marks <b>112</b> on the gutter piece <b>12</b> may be utilized to align either with a part of the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; and/or a mark or marks <b>110</b> thereon. Through the marks <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, consistent placement of the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be effected as it is operatively attached. The marks may be chosen and placed to allow a single, predetermined, lengthwise relationship to be established between the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; and gutter piece <b>12</b> and/or structure <b>16</b>. Alternatively, multiple, selectable, predetermined lengthwise relationships may be established through the selective alignment of the marks <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With the structure as described above, a gutter piece can be installed, as described in flow diagram form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As shown at block <b>114</b>, a gauging apparatus is provided, as described above. The gauging apparatus is attached, as shown at block <b>116</b>. With the gauging apparatus attached, the gutter piece can be moved to abut a surface on the roof and/or supporting structure as shown at block <b>118</b>. As shown at block <b>120</b>, the gutter piece, once operatively situated, can be secured to the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the method, the gauging apparatus can be separated from the gutter piece once the gutter piece is secured. It is conceivable that the gauging apparatus might be left in place on the gutter piece after securement.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The method also contemplates operatively attaching the gauging apparatus in any of potentially a plurality of predetermined positions that may be assisted by marks on the gauging apparatus, structure, and/or gutter. Of course, it is possible that a single predetermined location may be contemplated, in which case the gauging apparatus can be made accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref>, a further modified form of gauging apparatus, according to the invention, is shown at <b>10</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;. The gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; has particular utility in assisting the installation of separate gutter pieces <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>on a hipped roof <b>14</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;. The basic hipped roof construction has sloping ends and sides, with an exemplary sloping end and side <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, respectively, shown partially in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The end <b>130</b> terminates at a fascia surface <b>134</b> with the side <b>132</b> terminating at a fascia surface <b>136</b>. With the hipped roof, the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; is utilized to match angled ends of pieces <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>at a corner <b>138</b> where the fascia surfaces <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> meet, as opposed to consistently setting overhang.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For this purpose, the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; has the same basic components as the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;, to include a similarly formed J-shaped portion <b>80</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; at a front <b>76</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; thereon, with a longer leg <b>86</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; that blends into a corresponding first wall <b>88</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The primary distinction resides in the configuration of the locating leg <b>94</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; that extends substantially horizontally and rearwardly past the rear wall <b>26</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; of the exemplary gutter piece <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The edge <b>96</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; on the locating leg <b>94</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, corresponding to the edge <b>96</b>&#x2032;, is a horizontally extending edge that is abuttable to the fascia surface <b>134</b> to align the edge <b>140</b> of the rear wall <b>26</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; with the corner <b>138</b>. The gutter piece <b>12</b><i>b </i>is cut at an angle &#x3b8;, on the order of 45&#xb0;, between the edge <b>140</b> and a top extremity point <b>142</b>. As viewed in plan, the gutter piece <b>12</b><i>b </i>has a continuous edge <b>144</b> between the front <b>20</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and rear <b>22</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; of the gutter piece <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>

Alternatively, a universal construction can be devised, corresponding to that for the gauging apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Still other variations are contemplated, with each preferably having a locating leg with an associated edge, regardless of its orientation, that is abuttable to a surface/edge on a building structure, be it on the roof or elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With all embodiments, the particular dimensions of the gauging apparatus can be selected based upon the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It should also be pointed out that the exemplary gutter configuration should not be viewed as limiting. The inventive concept can be employed with, and adapted to, virtually a limitless number of different gutter shapes and constructions.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The foregoing disclosure of specific embodiments is intended to be illustrative of the broad concepts comprehended by the invention.</p>
