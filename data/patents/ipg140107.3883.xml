<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to surface-emitting lasers, surface-emitting laser arrays, optical scanning apparatuses, and image forming apparatus. More specifically, the present invention relates to a surface-emitting laser configured to emit light in a direction perpendicular to a substrate, a surface-emitting laser array including a plurality of the surface-emitting lasers, an optical scanning apparatus including the surface-emitting laser or the surface-emitting laser array, and an image forming apparatus including the optical scanning apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Surface-emitting lasers that emit light in a direction perpendicular to a substrate are the subject of intense research and development. Surface-emitting lasers have a lower threshold current for oscillation than edge-emitting lasers, and are capable of emitting a high-quality circular beam profile. Because a laser output can be obtained from the surface-emitting laser in a direction perpendicular to a substrate of the laser, a plurality of the surface-emitting lasers can be readily integrated two-dimensionally at high density. Potential applications of the surface-emitting laser include a light source for parallel optical interconnection and high-speed/high-resolution electrophotography systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, the surface-emitting laser has a confinement structure for improving current inflow efficiency. The confinement structure may be formed by selective oxidation of Al (aluminum), as discussed in Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2. Such a confinement structure may be hereafter referred to as an &#x201c;oxidized confinement structure&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Non-Patent Document 3 discusses a printer in which a VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting) array of a 780 nm band is used. Patent Document 1 discusses a surface-emitting laser in which a predetermined amount of a difference (&#x201c;detuning&#x201d;) is obtained between an oscillation wavelength which is determined by the length of a resonator and a peak gain wavelength which is determined by the composition of an active layer at a predetermined temperature. It is also discussed in Patent Document 1 that the oscillation wavelength corresponds to the peak gain wavelength in a temperature range above the predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2 discusses a multi-spot image forming apparatus having a multi-spot light source. When a surface-emitting laser is applied to an image forming apparatus such as a printer, a small diameter of the beam spot focused on a photosensitive material is desirable. Further, for high-speed writing, a large laser output is desirable. Namely, it is desirable to obtain a high output in a single fundamental transverse mode (single-mode) operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a printer system, for example, image quality is greatly affected by the behavior of the response waveform (&#x201c;optical waveform&#x201d;) of an optical output of a light source at the rise timing following the start of supply of a drive current, namely the changes in the optical output over time, such as the rise time. Such behavior includes the rise time. For example, image quality may decrease if the amount of light varies even slightly after the optical output has reached a certain amount in an initial period of the rise timing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This is due to the fact that it is an outline portion of an image that is formed at the rise or fall timing of the optical waveform. Particularly, if the light amount varies at the rise timing or in a duration of time following the time that can be substantially considered the rise timing, the image outline is obscured, thereby rendering the image visually unclear.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When it takes 300 &#x3bc;s to scan one line on an A4-sized sheet along its length, which is about 300 mm, a width of about 1 mm is scanned in 1 &#x3bc;s. It is generally said that the human eye is most sensitive to a change in image density within a width of 1 mm to 2 mm. Thus, if image density changes in a width of about 1 mm, that density change is well recognizable by the human eye, thus giving the viewer an impression of an obscured outline.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a graph of an optical waveform plotted when a surface-emitting laser having an oxidized confinement structure was driven under the pulse conditions of pulse width of 500 &#x3bc;s and a duty of 50% (pulse period: 1 ms). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when viewed in a relatively long time scale, the optical output exhibits a peak once immediately after rising, and then decreases and stabilizes. Such a change in the optical output is due to the self-heating of the surface-emitting laser and generally referred to as &#x201c;droop characteristics&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The droop characteristics illustrate a comparison of the optical output immediately after pulse application (i.e., immediately after the rise of the optical pulse) and the optical output 500 &#x3bc;s after pulse application, and quantify the influence of heat on optical output.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A detailed analysis conducted by the present inventors has revealed that, when the droop characteristics of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are viewed in a much shorter time scale by enlarging an initial portion of the optical waveform near the rise timing, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a change in the optical output is present that is different from the droop characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Specifically, the waveform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the optical output does not fully rise even after 100 ns and may be considered to have fully risen only after about 200 ns, after which the waveform gradually rises until about 1 &#x3bc;s. This phenomenon (characteristics) has never been reported as far as the present inventors are aware. The time scale illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is about 1 &#x3bc;s immediately after the application of a pulse (immediately after the rise of the optical pulse) and is very short compared to the time scale of the droop characteristics. Such characteristics in the short time span are referred to herein as &#x201c;negative droop characteristics&#x201d;. The negative droop characteristics are basically not observed in conventional edge-emitting lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A detailed analysis of the cause of the negative droop characteristics revealed that this phenomenon is due to a change in optical confinement in the lateral direction caused by the heating of the device, and a change in the light-emitting efficiency of the device.

These units of the laser printer <b>1000</b> are housed in a printer casing <b>1044</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0080">The communications control unit <b>1050</b> controls communications with an upper-level apparatus, such as a personal computer, via a network. The photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> is a cylindrical member on a surface of which a photosensitive layer is formed. The surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> provides a scanned surface. The photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> is configured to be rotated in a direction indicated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0081">The charging unit <b>1031</b>, the developing roller <b>1032</b>, the transfer charger <b>1033</b>, the neutralizing unit <b>1034</b>, and the cleaning unit <b>1035</b> are disposed near the scanned surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> in the order mentioned, along the rotating direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0082">The charging unit <b>1031</b> is configured to charge the scanned surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> uniformly. The optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> is configured to scan the charged scanned surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> with a beam of light modulated in accordance with image information supplied from the upper-level apparatus, thereby forming a latent image on the scanned surface that corresponds to the image information. The latent image is then transported in the direction of the developing roller <b>1032</b> as the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> rotates. The structure of the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> is described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0083">The toner cartridge <b>1036</b> stores a toner that is supplied to the developing roller <b>1032</b>. The developing roller <b>1032</b> is configured to cause the toner supplied from the toner cartridge <b>1036</b> to attach to the latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b>, thus producing a toner image. The toner image is then transported in the direction of the transfer charger <b>1033</b> as the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0084">The sheet-feeding tray <b>1038</b> stores sheets of a recording paper <b>1040</b>. A sheet-feeding roller <b>1037</b> is disposed near the sheet-feeding tray <b>1038</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0085">The transfer charger <b>1033</b> has applied a voltage of a polarity opposite to that of the toner so that the toner on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> can be electrically drawn to the recording paper <b>1040</b>.

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Optical Scanning Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">The optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> includes, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a deflector-side scanning lens <b>11</b><i>a</i>, an image-side scanning lens <b>11</b><i>b</i>; a polygon mirror <b>13</b>; a light source <b>14</b>; a coupling lens <b>15</b>; an aperture plate <b>16</b>; a cylindrical lens <b>17</b>; a reflecting mirror <b>18</b>; and a scan control unit (not illustrated). The various portions of the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> are attached to predetermined positions within an optical housing <b>30</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0090">The coupling lens <b>15</b> is configured to make the beam of light emitted by the light source <b>14</b> into a substantially parallel beam of light. The aperture plate <b>16</b> has an aperture portion configured to define a size of the beam of light that has passed through the coupling lens <b>15</b>. The cylindrical lens <b>17</b> is configured to focus the beam of light from the aperture portion of the aperture plate <b>16</b> near a deflecting/reflecting surface of the polygon mirror <b>13</b> via the reflecting mirror <b>18</b>, with respect to the sub-scan corresponding direction.</p>

The polygon mirror <b>13</b> is configured to deflect the light beam from the reflecting mirror <b>18</b> while rotating at a constant velocity about an axis parallel to the sub-scan corresponding direction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">The deflector-side scanning lens <b>11</b><i>a </i>is disposed on an optical path of the light beam deflected by the polygon mirror <b>13</b>. The image-side scanning lens <b>11</b><i>b </i>is disposed on an optical path of the light beam that has passed the deflector-side scanning lens <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The light beam that has passed through the image-side scanning lens <b>11</b><i>b </i>irradiates the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b>, forming an optical spot. The optical spot moves along the longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> as the polygon mirror <b>13</b> rotates, thus scanning the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b>. The direction of movement of the optical spot corresponds to the main-scan direction. The direction of rotation of the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> corresponds to the sub-scan direction.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0095">The surface-emitting laser <b>100</b> has an oscillation wavelength of a 780 nm band. The surface-emitting laser <b>100</b> includes a substrate <b>101</b>; a buffer layer <b>102</b>; a lower semiconductor DBR <b>103</b>; a lower spacer layer <b>104</b>; an active layer <b>105</b>; an upper spacer layer <b>106</b>; an upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b>; and a contact layer <b>109</b>. The substrate <b>101</b> may include a n-GaAs single crystal substrate having a mirror-polished surface. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the normal N to the mirror-polished surface (principal surface) is inclined with respect to the direction of a crystal orientation [1 0 0] by 15 degrees (&#x3b8;=15&#xb0;) toward a crystal orientation [1 1 1]A.

<p id="p-0092" num="0096">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the buffer layer <b>102</b> is stacked on the +Z side of the substrate <b>101</b> and comprises n-GaAs. The lower semiconductor DBR <b>103</b> is stacked on the +Z side of the buffer layer <b>102</b> and comprises 40.5 pairs of low-refractive index layers of n-Al<sub>0.9</sub>Ga<sub>0.1</sub>As and high-refractive index layers of n-Al<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>As. Between the refractive index layers, graded composition layers of thickness 20 nm are provided in which the composition is gradually varied from one composition to the other in order to reduce electric resistance.

The active layer <b>105</b> is stacked on the +Z side of the lower spacer layer <b>104</b> and has a multiple quantum well structure of GaInAsP/GaInP. The quantum-well layer comprises a mixed crystal of GaInP into which As is introduced in order to obtain an oscillation wavelength of the 780 nm band. The quantum-well layer may have a compression strain of 0.7%. The composition of the quantum-well layer is selected such that the oscillation wavelength at a CW oscillation threshold current in an edge LD (laser diode) structure is equal to the oscillation wavelength of the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>. Specifically, the PL (photoluminescence) wavelength is adjusted to be 770 nm in view of the difference (about 10 nm) from the edge LD oscillation wavelength. In this case, when the oscillation wavelength of the resonator is 780 nm, the temperature at which the threshold current is minimized (hereafter referred to as the &#x201c;threshold-current-minimizing temperature&#x201d;) is 25&#xb0; C., and the amount of detuning is 0 nm. The threshold-current-minimizing temperature may be set to be equal to or below 60&#xb0; C. by adjusting the PL wavelength of the active layer depending on the oscillation wavelength, the, which corresponds to an amount of detuning of 8.4 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0098">By introducing a tensile strain of 0.6% in the barrier layer, the bandgap is increased and a high degree of carrier confinement is realized while forming a strain-compensating structure for the quantum-well layer. The inclined substrate <b>101</b> and a strain active layer introduce optical anisotropy into the gain of the active layer <b>105</b>, so that the polarization direction can be aligned in a specific direction (such as the X-axis direction in the illustrated example).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">The upper spacer layer <b>106</b> is stacked on the +Z side of the active layer <b>105</b> and comprises a non-doped (Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>)<sub>0.5</sub>In<sub>0.5</sub>P layer. A resonator structure is formed by the lower spacer layer <b>104</b>, the active layer <b>105</b>, and the upper spacer layer <b>106</b>. The thickness of the resonator structure is set to be equal to the optical thickness of one wavelength. The active layer <b>105</b> is disposed at the center of the resonator structure corresponding to an anti-node of the standing wave distribution of an electric field so that a high probability of stimulated emission can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0100">The upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b> includes a first upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>1 </sub>and a second upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>2</sub>. The first upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>1 </sub>is stacked on the +Z side of the upper spacer layer <b>106</b> and includes a pair of a low-refractive index layer of p-(Al<sub>0.7</sub>Ga<sub>0.3</sub>)<sub>0.5</sub>In<sub>0.5</sub>P and a high-refractive index layer of p-(Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>)<sub>0.5</sub>In<sub>0.5</sub>P.

<p id="p-0097" num="0101">The first upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>1 </sub>has a greater bandgap energy than the AlGaAs layer and functions as a blocking layer for the electrons injected into the active region. Because the substrate <b>101</b> is inclined, defects such as hillocks in the AlGaInP material can be prevented and improved crystallinity can be obtained. Thus, the development of natural superlattice can be prevented, and decrease in bandgap energy can be prevented. Therefore, the first upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>1 </sub>can maintain a high bandgap energy, thus functioning as a suitable electron blocking layer.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">The second upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>2 </sub>is stacked on the +Z side of the first upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>1 </sub>and includes 24 pairs of low-refractive index layers of p-Al<sub>0.9</sub>Ga<sub>0.1</sub>As and high-refractive index layers of p-Al<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>As.

<p id="p-0099" num="0103">One of the low-refractive index layers in the second upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b><sub>2 </sub>includes a selectively oxidized layer <b>108</b> comprising p-AlAs and having a thickness of 34 nm. The inserted position of the selectively oxidized layer <b>108</b> corresponds to the third node from the active layer <b>105</b> in the standing wave distribution of an electric field. Thus, the portion that is heated due to the increase in resistance caused by current confinement can be located away from the active layer while maintaining a practical threshold current. Furthermore, thermal resistance can be reduced and localized heating at the central portion can be reduced. In addition, the influence of strain on the active layer due to the selective oxidation of the selectively oxidized layer <b>108</b> can be reduced, so that the service life of the device can be increased. The contact layer <b>109</b> is stacked on the +Z side of the upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b> and includes p-GaAs.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0104">In a layer (region A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b> near the resonator structure, the doping concentration of a p-type dopant is adjusted to be lower than in the other regions. Specifically, in the upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b>, the four pairs in a region adjacent the upper spacer layer <b>106</b> form a low-doping concentration region having a lower doping concentration than the remaining 20 pairs. More specifically, the doping concentration of the low-doping concentration region may be in a range of about 2.0 to 1.3&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>for the constant composition layers (refractive index layers) and portions corresponding to the anti-nodes of the standing wave distribution, and in a range of 2.0&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>to 4.0&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>for portions corresponding to the nodes of the standing wave distribution. For the remaining 20 pairs, the doping concentration in the constant composition layers (refractive index layers) and portions corresponding to the anti-nodes of the standing wave distribution is in a range of 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>to 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, and the doping concentration of portions corresponding to the nodes of the standing wave distribution is in a range of 4.0&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or more.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0105">The doping concentrations in the two kinds of the constant layers and the portions corresponding to the anti-nodes of the standing wave need not be the same and may be different within the aforementioned ranges. The doping concentrations in the two kinds of the constant layers and the portions corresponding to the anti-nodes and the nodes of the standing wave need not be the same in all of the periods of the low-concentration region but may vary from one period to another. Specifically, portions near the spacer layer of the low-doping concentration region that have greater optical standing wave intensities may have lower concentrations so that free carrier absorption can be effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0106">In plural layers (region B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the lower semiconductor DBR <b>103</b> near the resonator structure, the doping concentration of an n-type dopant is reduced compared to the other regions. Specifically, in the lower semiconductor DBR <b>103</b>, four pairs in a region adjacent the lower spacer layer <b>104</b> form a low-doping concentration region having a lower doping concentration than the remaining 36.5 pairs. More specifically, the doping concentration of the low-doping concentration region may be in a range of 3.0 to 7.5&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>for the constant composition layers (refractive index layers) and portions corresponding to the anti-nodes of the standing wave distribution, and the doping concentration of portions corresponding to the nodes of the standing wave distribution may be in a range of 3.0&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>to 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. For the remaining 36.5 pairs, the doping concentration in the constant composition layers (refractive index layers) and portions corresponding to the anti-nodes of the standing wave distribution may be in a range of 1.0 to 3.0&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, and the doping concentration in portions corresponding to the nodes of the standing wave distribution may be in a range of 1.0 to 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0107">Thus, as in the case of the upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b>, loss by free carrier absorption can be effectively reduced. The decrease in absorption loss enables a decrease in the oscillation threshold current and an increase in slope efficiency, so that the device drive current can be reduced. In other words, heat generation can be reduced by the decrease in required power.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0108">Next, a method of manufacturing the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b> is briefly described. As mentioned above, the substrate <b>101</b> on which the plural semiconductor layers are stacked may be referred to as a &#x201c;stacked body&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(1) The stacked body is fabricated by a crystal growing process such as metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0109">In the case of MOCVD, the Group III material may include trimethylaluminium (TMA), trimethylgalium (TMG), or trimethylindium (TMI), and the Group V material may include phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub>) or arsine (AsH<sub>3</sub>). The p-type dopant material may include tetrabromomethane (CBr<sub>4</sub>) or dimethylzinc (DMZn), and the n-type dopant material may include hydrogen selenide (H<sub>2</sub>Se).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(2) A square resist pattern whose sides are 25 &#x3bc;m in length is formed on the stacked body.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(3) A square column-shaped mesa structure (which may be simply referred to as a &#x201c;mesa&#x201d;) is formed by ECR etching using Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas and the resist pattern as a photomask such that an etched bottom is positioned within the lower spacer layer <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(4) The photomask is removed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0110">(5) The stacked body is thermally treated in water vapor atmosphere. Thereby, Al (aluminum) in the selectively oxidized layer <b>108</b> is selectively oxidized from the sides of the mesa, leaving a non-oxidized region <b>108</b><i>b </i>at the center of the mesa that is surrounded by an Al oxidized layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>). Thus, an oxidized confinement structure is formed that limits the passage of the light-emitting portion drive current to the center of the mesa. The non-oxidized region <b>108</b><i>b </i>provides a current passage region (current injection region). The current passage region may have a substantially square shape and a width of about 4 &#x3bc;m.
<br/>
(6) A protection layer <b>111</b> of SiN is formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. The protection layer <b>111</b> may have an optical thickness of &#x3bb;/4. Specifically, because the refractive index n of SiN is 1.86 and the oscillation wavelength &#x3bb; is 780 nm, the actual film thickness (=&#x3bb;/4n) may be set to be about 105 nm.
<br/>
(7) An etching mask M is prepared. The etching mask M is used for forming a window for a P-side electrode contact on top of the mesa where a laser light emitting surface is to be formed. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> which is an enlarged view of the mesa portion alone of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the mask M is formed to cover the sides of the mesa, a peripheral area of the top surface of the mesa, and two small regions, i.e., first and second small regions M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>. The first and the second small regions M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are opposed to each other with respect to a direction parallel to a desired polarization direction P (such as the X-axis direction) across a central portion of the top surface of the mesa. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the mask M may have measurements such that L<b>1</b> is 4.5 &#x3bc;m, L<b>2</b> is 4 &#x3bc;m, and c is 2.2 &#x3bc;m. The first and the second small regions M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> may be considered as parts of a ring having an external diameter of L<b>1</b>+2L<b>2</b> and an inner diameter of L<b>1</b>, which is divided in half by a line having the width c parallel to the Y-axis direction and extending through the center of the ring.
<br/>
(8) The protection layer <b>111</b> is etched by BHF in order to form the window for the P-side electrode contact.
<br/>
(9) The mask M is removed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>). In the following, the part of the protection layer <b>111</b> that remains within the first small region M<b>1</b> may be referred to as a &#x201c;transparent layer <b>111</b>A&#x201d;, and the part of the protection layer <b>111</b> that remains within the second small region may be referred to as a &#x201c;transparent layer <b>111</b>B&#x201d;.
<br/>
(10) A square resist pattern whose sides are 10 &#x3bc;m in length is formed in a region at the top of the mesa where the light-emitting portion is to be formed, and a p-side electrode material is vapor-deposited in the region. The p-side electrode material may include a multi-layer film of Cr/AuZn/Au or Ti/Pt/Au.
<br/>
(11) The electrode material vapor-deposited in the region for the light-emitting portion (emission region) is lifted off, thereby forming a p-side electrode <b>113</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>). A region surrounded by the p-side electrode <b>113</b> provides the emission region. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an enlarged view of the mesa portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. The shape of the emission region may be a square whose sides are L<b>4</b> (such as 10 &#x3bc;m) in length. In accordance with the present embodiment, the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B exist in the two small regions (corresponding to the first and the second small regions M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>) within the emission region. The transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B are transparent dielectric films of SiN that have an optical thickness of &#x3bb;/4. Thus, the reflectivity of the two small regions is less than that of the central portion of the emission region.
<br/>
(12) After the back side of the substrate <b>101</b> is polished to a predetermined thickness (such as 200 &#x3bc;m), an n-side electrode <b>114</b> is formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). The n-side electrode <b>114</b> may comprise a multi-layer film of AuGe/Ni/Au.
<br/>
(13) Annealing is performed to provide ohmic conduction between the p-side electrode <b>113</b> and the n-side electrode <b>114</b>, thereby forming a light-emitting portion.
<br/>
(14) Individual chips are cut out.

<p id="p-0107" num="0111">When a surface-emitting laser is supplied with a square-wave current pulse having a pulse period of 1 ms and a pulse width of 500 &#x3bc;s for a target optical output of 1.4 mW, a value calculated by the following expression (1) is referred to as a &#x201c;negative droop ratio (%)&#x201d;.

where P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are optical outputs 10 ns and 1 &#x3bc;s after the start of pulse supply, respectively.
</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0112">If the output increases over time, the value of the expression (1) becomes negative, which is indicative of the appearance of the &#x201c;negative droop characteristics&#x201d;. The appearance of the negative droop characteristics indicates that there is an opposite change in optical amount from the normal droop characteristics in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0113">An analysis of image quality of various images formed by plural surface-emitting lasers having different negative droop ratios indicated that, when the negative droop ratio is &#x2212;10% or more, the outline of an image outputted from the laser printer is at least partially obscured at high frequency when observed with the naked eye. In the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b> manufactured by the above-described method, the negative droop ratio was &#x2212;6%. The surface-emitting laser <b>100</b> also provided a single fundamental transverse mode output of 2 mW or more.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0114">The present inventors also conducted a detailed analysis of optical waveforms of conventional surface-emitting lasers having an oxidized confinement structure when driven at various square-wave current pulses. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an optical waveform in a case where the pulse period was 1 ms and the duty was 50%. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an optical waveform in a case where the pulse period was 100 ns and the duty was 50%. With regard to the optical waveform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, after the pulse rises, the optical output gradually increases, exhibiting the negative droop characteristics. Even after 60 ns, the optical output does not reach a target value (1.5 mW). On the other hand, in the case of the optical waveform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the output is stable after the rise of the pulse, exhibiting no negative droop characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0115">Thus, when the conventional surface-emitting lasers are supplied with square-wave current pulses having the same duty, i.e., the same amount of heat generated, the negative droop characteristics are observed when the pulse period is long and not when the pulse period is short.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0116">Different pulse periods may cause different temperature situations within the surface-emitting laser. Specifically, when the pulse period is long, both the time in which the laser is heated and the time in which the laser is cooled are long, so that the temperature within the surface-emitting laser varies greatly. On the other hand, when the pulse period is short, a continuous cooling time may not be sufficiently obtained and, as a result, the temperature variation inside the surface-emitting laser may be small, so that the laser can be stabilized at a relatively high average temperature. Thus, under the drive conditions such that the negative droop characteristics are observed, the internal temperature of the surface-emitting laser may fluctuate greatly. In other words, it can be considered that the negative droop characteristics are a phenomenon caused by the internal temperature of the surface-emitting laser.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0117">The oxidized layer of the oxidized confinement structure has a refractive index of about 1.6, which is less than the refractive index (about 3) of the surrounding semiconductor layer. Thus, inside the surface-emitting laser, there is a so-called built-in effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff in the transverse direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0118">The effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff causes an oscillation mode, such as the fundamental transverse mode, to be confined in the transverse direction. In this case, the spread of the oscillation mode in the transverse direction is determined by the magnitude of &#x394;neff. Namely, the greater the &#x394;neff, the smaller is the spread of the transverse direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0119">When a current (drive current) is injected into the surface-emitting laser, the current is concentrated in the mesa central portion. As a result, the temperature around the active layer of the mesa central portion locally increases due to the Joule heat or non-radiative recombination in the active layer region, for example, relative to the peripheral regions. Semiconductor material has such properties that as temperature rises, bandgap energy decreases and refractive index increases. Therefore, when there is a localized temperature increase in the mesa central portion, the refractive index of the central portion increases compared to the peripheral regions, resulting in a stronger optical confinement in the transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0120">When the built-in effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff is small as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, even if the temperature of the mesa central portion locally increases, the change in the effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff increases, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. As a result, the electric field intensity distribution with respect to the transverse direction of the oscillation mode (which may be hereafter referred to as a &#x201c;transverse mode distribution&#x201d;) greatly varies. In this case, the overlap between the gain region in which current injection is taking place and the transverse mode increases, so that the optical confinement in the transverse direction becomes stronger. As a result, the optical intensity in the gain region increases, the stimulated emission rate increases, and the threshold current decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0121">Thus, in a surface-emitting laser in which the built-in effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff is small and the optical confinement in the transverse direction at room temperature is insufficient, the threshold current is reduced by the increase in the internal temperature, thereby improving the I-L characteristics. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates the I-L characteristics that are predicted to be present at time t=t<sub>0 </sub>before the increase in the internal temperature, and the I-L characteristics that are predicted to be present at time t=t<sub>1 </sub>when the internal temperature has sufficiently risen after the application of pulse. As the temperature rises, the emission efficiency increases and the threshold current decreases. Thus, the I-L characteristics at t<b>1</b> are shifted toward the lower current side relative to the I-L characteristics at t<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a change in optical output upon pulse drive. Because the current value of the drive pulse is constant, the optical output at t<sub>1 </sub>is greater than the optical output at t<sub>0 </sub>as the I-L characteristics vary as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Thus, the optical output at the same drive current value increases over time, thus resulting in the appearance of the negative droop characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0123">On the other hand, when the built-in effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff is large as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, even when the temperature of the mesa central portion locally increases, the change in the effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff is small, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, so that the transverse mode distribution does not change much.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0124">Thus, when the built-in effective refractive index difference &#x394;neff is large and there is sufficiently large optical confinement in the transverse direction at room temperature, the transverse mode distribution is stabilized even when the internal temperature rises, so that the emission efficiency changes little. In this case, the optical output at the same drive current value is substantially constant over time, and the negative droop characteristics are not observed.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0125">The transverse mode distribution of a surface-emitting laser can be estimated by calculating an electric field intensity distribution using the following Helmholtz equations:</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0127">Because it is difficult to analytically solve the above expressions (2) and (3), normally a numerical analysis is performed by a computer using the finite element method. There are various solvers for the finite element method, and commercially available VCSEL simulators (such as Laser MOD from RSoft Design Group) may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0128">As an example, the fundamental transverse mode distribution of a 780 nm band surface-emitting laser is calculated. In the surface-emitting laser used for the calculation, the active layer has a triple quantum well structure of Al<sub>0.1</sub>2Ga<sub>0.88</sub>As/Al<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>As having a thickness of 8 nm/8 nm, and the spacer layers comprise Al<sub>0.6</sub>Ga<sub>0.4</sub>As. The lower semiconductor DBR comprises 40.5 pairs of Al<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>As (high-refractive index layers)/AlAs (low-refractive index layers). The upper semiconductor DBR comprises 24 pairs of Al<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>As (high-refractive index layers)/Al<sub>0.9</sub>Ga<sub>0.1</sub>As (low-refractive index layers).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0129">The surface-emitting laser has a columnar mesa shape having a diameter of 25 &#x3bc;m. Mesa etching is performed down to an interface between the lower semiconductor DBR and the lower spacer layer. The etched region is occupied by the atmosphere. Namely, the surface-emitting laser has a simple etched-mesa structure. The diameter of the non-mesa-etched portion of the lower semiconductor DBR is 35 &#x3bc;m, which is the maximum lateral width considered in the calculation. The material of the selectively oxidized layer is AlAs. The selectively oxidized layer is located in the low-refractive index layer having the optical thickness 3&#x3bb;/4 in the upper semiconductor DBR. More specifically, the position of the selectively oxidized layer corresponds to the third node of the standing wave distribution from the active layer.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0130">The calculation only determines the structurally determined inherent mode distribution without taking into consideration the gain of the active layer or absorption by semiconductor material. In the following, the oxidized layer of the oxidized confinement structure may be simply referred to as &#x201c;the oxidized layer&#x201d;. The diameter of the current passage region may be referred to as an &#x201c;oxidized confinement diameter&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates the result of calculation of the transverse mode distribution due to the self-heating of a surface-emitting laser structure having an oxidized confinement diameter of 4 &#x3bc;m and a thickness of the selectively oxidized layer of 20 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates the result of calculation of the transverse mode distribution due to the self-heating of a surface-emitting laser structure having an oxidized confinement diameter of 4 &#x3bc;m and a thickness of 30 nm of the selectively oxidized layer. Because it can be expected that the temperature of the current injection region of the active layer would significantly increase in an operated status, the calculation is performed by varying the temperature of the resonator structure. The temperatures indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> are the temperatures of a heated region indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The temperature of the other regions is 27&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates the case where the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is small and the optical confinement in the transverse direction is weak. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates the case where the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is large and the optical confinement is strong. It can be seen from these figures that when the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is small, the transverse mode distribution greatly changes depending on the self-heating of the laser. When there is the change in the transverse mode illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the negative droop characteristics appear. The influence of &#x394;neff on the negative droop characteristics has never been known and has been revealed for the first time by the analysis by the present inventors.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0133">Another factor causing a change in the efficiency of the surface-emitting laser due to heating is the amount of detuning. Next, the relationship between the amount of detuning and the negative droop characteristics is described.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0134">In an edge-emitting laser, because a resonator longitudinal mode densely exists, laser oscillation occurs at the peak gain wavelength &#x3bb;g. On the other hand, in a surface-emitting laser, normally the oscillation wavelength corresponds to a single wavelength, so that only the single longitudinal mode can exist in the reflecting band of the semiconductor DBR. Further, because laser oscillation occurs at the resonating wavelength &#x3bb;r, the emission characteristics of the surface-emitting laser depend on the relationship between the resonating wavelength &#x3bb;r and the peak gain wavelength &#x3bb;g of the active layer.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0135">The amount of detuning &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>is defined by the following expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub><i>=&#x3bb;r</i><sub>0</sub><i>&#x2212;&#x3bb;g</i>0&#x2003;&#x2003;(4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x3bb;r<sub>0 </sub>is the oscillation wavelength, and &#x3bb;g<sub>0 </sub>is the peak gain wavelength. The suffix &#x201c;0&#x201d; indicates a CW (Continuous Wave) operation below a threshold current at room temperature. Absence of the suffix &#x201c;0&#x201d; indicates other operations where, for example, the drive current is equal to or more than the threshold current.
</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> illustrates a case where &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3e;0. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> illustrates a case where &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0137">Because the oscillation wavelength is determined not by the peak gain wavelength but by the resonating wavelength, the laser characteristics of a surface-emitting laser is largely dependent on the sign of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>and its value. For example, the threshold current at room temperature tends to increase as the absolute value of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>increases.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0138">Generally, the oscillating (emission) efficiency of a surface-emitting laser is the highest when the resonating wavelength and the peak gain wavelength correspond to each other. The resonating wavelength and the peak gain wavelength both change in the longer-wavelength side as the temperature increases. In this case, the change in the resonating wavelength is caused by a change in the refractive index of the material of the resonator structure, while the change in the peak gain wavelength is caused by a change in the bandgap energy of the active layer material. However, the rate of change of the bandgap energy is greater than that of the refractive index by approximately an order of magnitude. The rate of change of the resonating wavelength due to temperature is about 0.05 nm/K, which is substantially negligible. Thus, it can be said that the emission characteristics upon temperature change are mainly determined by the amount of change in the peak gain wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0139">Thus, in a surface-emitting laser, when the internal temperature (active layer temperature) is increased by a change in injected current, for example, the absolute value of &#x394;&#x3bb; (degree of detuning) first decreases and then increases in the case of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3e;0 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>). In the case of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3e;0, when the threshold current is measured while the device temperature (ambient temperature) is increased from room temperature, the threshold current starts to decrease as the device temperature increases. The threshold current is minimized when the peak gain wavelength corresponds to the oscillation wavelength, and starts to increase as the temperature is further increased. Thus, the threshold-current-minimizing temperature (T_Ith_min) exists above room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0140">In the case of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>), as the internal temperature (active layer temperature) increases, the absolute value of &#x394;&#x3bb; simply increases. Therefore, when the threshold current is measured while the device temperature (ambient temperature) is increased from room temperature, the threshold current simply increases as the device temperature increases. In this case, the threshold-current-minimizing temperature (T_Ith_min) exists below room temperature. When the device temperature is decreased from room temperature, the peak gain wavelength &#x394;&#x3bb;g is shifted toward the shorter-wavelength side. Thus, when the threshold current is measured while the device temperature (ambient temperature) is decreased from room temperature, the threshold current starts to decrease and is minimized when the peak gain wavelength and the oscillation wavelength correspond to each other. When the temperature is further lowered, the threshold current starts to increase. Thus, in the case of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0, the threshold-current-minimizing temperature exists below room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the result of measuring the oscillation threshold currents of three lasers having different &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>(&#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0; &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x2248;0; and &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3e;0) while the device temperature (ambient temperature) was changed. The vertical axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows the oscillation threshold current (Ith) at the various temperatures that was normalized by the oscillation threshold current at room temperature of 25&#xb0; C. (Ith(25&#xb0; C.)). It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> that the threshold current is minimized at a temperature below room temperature in the case of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0, a temperature near room temperature in the case of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x2248;0, and a temperature above room temperature in the case of &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3e;0.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0142">In conventional surface-emitting lasers, &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>is set such that &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3e;0 so that the threshold current at high temperatures can be reduced, in order to prevent degradation of the emission characteristics in a high temperature and high output operating status. However, when the surface-emitting laser in which &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3e;0 is driven with a square-wave current pulse, the I-L characteristics are shifted to the lower current side as the internal temperature increases, resulting in a decrease in the threshold current. As a result, the optical output at the same drive current value increases over time; namely, the negative droop characteristics appear. On the other hand, when &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x3c;0, the I-L characteristics are shifted to the higher-current side as the internal temperature increases, so that the optical output does not increase; namely, the negative droop characteristics do not appear.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0143">In order to set &#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>to a desired value, the peak gain wavelength &#x3bb;g<sub>0 </sub>must be known. In an edge-emitting laser, because the oscillation wavelength corresponds to the peak gain wavelength, the peak gain wavelength can be known from the resonating wavelength. However, in the case of a surface-emitting laser, the oscillation wavelength is structurally determined, so that it is difficult to estimate the peak gain wavelength. Thus, either of the following two methods may be used: (1) an edge-emitting laser having the same active layer is fabricated, and the peak gain wavelength is estimated from the oscillation wavelength at room temperature; or (2) a double-hetero structure having the same active layer is fabricated, and the peak gain wavelength is estimated from the photoluminescence (PL) wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0144">For example, when the method (1) is employed, an edge-emitting laser of the oxide film stripe type having the same active layer structure, a stripe width of 40 &#x3bc;m, and a resonator length of 500 &#x3bc;m is fabricated, and the wavelength at the CW-oscillation threshold current at room temperature is used as the peak gain wavelength &#x3bb;g<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0145">When the method (2) is employed, because the wavelength during laser oscillation is shifted to the longer-wavelength side with respect to the PL wavelength, a proper adjustment is required. Such a wavelength shift may be due to the difference in the process of excitation, such as photoexcitation or current excitation, or the influence of heat generated by a current in the case of current excitation. Generally, the oscillation wavelength of an edge-emitting laser is longer than the PL wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>PL </sub>by about 10 nm. Thus, the amount of wavelength shift in this case is considered to be 10 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0146">Thus, with respect to the PL wavelength, the expression (4) may be modified into the following expression:</p>

Alternatively, the wavelength shift amount may be substituted by the aforementioned temperature at which the threshold current is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0149">By appropriately setting &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>such that device efficiency does not increase when the active layer temperature increases, the negative droop characteristics can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0150">Thus, the negative droop characteristics can be effectively controlled by appropriately setting the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer and the amount of detuning. However, increasing the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer to enhance the optical confinement in the transverse direction generally results in limiting the single-mode output. This is due to the fact that by increasing the optical confinement in the transverse direction, the high-order transverse mode is confined and oscillation tends to occur more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0151">When a surface-emitting laser is used as a light source not only for writing in an image forming apparatus but generally, it is desirable to increase the single-mode output as much as possible. Thus, in accordance with the present embodiment, oscillation of the high-order transverse mode is prevented by providing a high-reflectivity region of a transparent dielectric film and a low-reflectivity region on the emission surface of the surface-emitting laser. In this way, a high single-mode output can be obtained while the negative droop characteristics are effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0152">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a (theoretical) surface-emitting laser having a circular emission region <b>200</b>. A central portion of the emission region <b>200</b> is surrounded by a ring-shaped low-reflectivity region <b>111</b>. In the low-reflectivity region <b>111</b>, a transparent dielectric film (SiN) having an optical thickness of &#x3bb;/4 is formed. An oscillation mode distribution was calculated while varying an internal diameter L<b>1</b> of the low-reflectivity region <b>111</b>, with a width L<b>2</b> of the low-reflectivity region fixed to 3 &#x3bc;m. The calculation was based on the assumption that the diameter of the current passage region was 4.5 &#x3bc;m. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, for ease of description and understanding, parts corresponding to the parts of the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b> are designated with similar numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates the relationship between the internal diameter L<b>1</b> of the low-reflectivity region and the Q value in the high-order transverse mode based on the above calculation. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> that as the value of L<b>1</b> is increased from 1 &#x3bc;m, the Q value decreases greatly.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0154">In many surface-emitting lasers, the central portion mainly corresponds to the oscillation region of the fundamental transverse mode, and the high-order transverse mode has a partial mode distribution in a peripheral portion. The low-reflectivity region may be located at a position corresponding to a part of the oscillation region of the high-order transverse mode so that the reflectivity with respect to the high-order transverse mode can be selectively lowered. Namely, by overlapping the high-optical intensity portion in the high-order transverse mode on the low-reflectivity region, oscillation of the high-order transverse mode can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates the relationship between the internal diameter L<b>1</b> of the low-reflectivity region and an optical confinement coefficient in the transverse direction of the fundamental transverse mode determined by the above calculation. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> that the optical confinement effect in the transverse direction is strong when the value of L<b>1</b> is 5 &#x3bc;m or less, and the effect decreases as the value of L<b>1</b> increases beyond 5 &#x3bc;m. This shows that by providing plural low-reflectivity regions and providing optical anisotropy in the intervals of the low-reflectivity regions, optical anisotropy can be produced in the confinement effect in the transverse direction. As a result, the polarization component in a direction having a strong confinement effect can oscillate more easily than the polarization component in a direction having less confinement effect. In this way, the polarization direction can be controlled to be a direction having a strong confinement effect.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0156">In accordance with the present embodiment, the two low-reflectivity regions having a longitudinal direction in the Y-axis direction are disposed opposite to each other with respect to the X-axis direction. In this case, in the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction, optical anisotropy is produced in the confinement effect in the transverse direction, so that the optical confinement coefficient of the transverse direction in the Y-axis direction becomes smaller than in the X-axis direction. Thus, oscillation of light polarized in the Y-axis direction is prevented, so that oscillation occurs with the polarization aligned in the X-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates the relationship between L<b>1</b> and the single-mode output of a surface-emitting laser having a thickness of 32 nm of the selectively oxidized layer and an area of 25 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>of the current passage region. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates the relationship between L<b>1</b> and the negative droop ratio of the surface-emitting laser. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows that as the value of L<b>1</b> decreases, the single-mode output increases. This is believed to be due to the increase in the overlap between the low-reflectivity region and the oscillation region of the high-order mode as the value of L<b>1</b> decreases, resulting in a greater effect of preventing the high-order mode oscillation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the dashed-dotted line indicates the single-mode output (0.9 mW) of a surface-emitting laser in which the low-reflectivity region is not provided. By providing the low-reflectivity region, the single-mode output is greatly increased. The single-mode output is saturated when the value of L<b>1</b> is about 4 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows that as the value of L<b>1</b> decreases, the absolute value of the negative droop ratio increases in the negative region. This is due to the fact that as the value of L<b>1</b> decreases, the spatial overlap between the low-reflectivity region and the fundamental mode increases, resulting in an increase in the threshold current. The increase in the threshold current results in an increase in the operating current and the amount of heat generated.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0159">Thus, the internal diameter L<b>1</b> of the low-reflectivity region has an appropriate range of 4.0 &#x3bc;m to 5.0 &#x3bc;m where the single-mode output can be significantly increased without increasing the negative droop characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates the relationship between the interval c (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of the two low-reflectivity regions and the single-mode output of a surface-emitting laser of which the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is 32 nm and the oxidized confinement area is 25 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates the relationship between the interval c and the negative droop ratio of the surface-emitting laser.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> shows that as the value of c decreases, the single-mode output increases. This is due to the fact that as the value of c decreases, the overlap between the low-reflectivity region and the oscillation region of the high-order mode increases, resulting in a greater effect of preventing the oscillation of the high-order mode.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows that as the value of c decreases, the absolute value of the droop ratio increases in the negative region, although the degree of change is smaller than L<b>1</b>. From the viewpoint of single-mode output, a smaller value of c is desirable. However, if the value of c is too small, shape reproducibility during the manufacturing process or the stability of polarization direction and the like may be reduced. Thus, in view of reproducibility and the like, the value of c is preferably in a range from 1.7 &#x3bc;m to 2.7 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates the relationship between the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer and the negative droop ratio of a surface-emitting laser in which a low-reflectivity region of dielectric film (SiN) is provided in the emission region, and a surface-emitting laser in which no such low-reflectivity region is provided. The current passage region of the surface-emitting lasers is square in shape and has an area in a range from 16 to 28 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. The amount of detuning of the surface-emitting lasers is 0 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> shows that regardless of the presence of the low-reflectivity region, the absolute value of the droop ratio increases in the negative region as the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer becomes smaller. Namely, the negative droop characteristics become more noticeable. This is due to the fact that the decrease in the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer results in a decrease in optical confinement in the transverse direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> also shows that as the negative droop characteristics become more noticeable, variations of the negative droop characteristics also tend to increase. The dependency of the negative droop ratio on the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is substantially the same for the two surface-emitting lasers. Namely, the negative droop characteristics are basically determined by the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer and the amount of detuning. In order to obtain a clear image, the negative droop ratio needs to be controlled to be not greater than &#x2212;10%. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> shows that for a surface-emitting laser whose amount of detuning is 0 nm or more, the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer needs to be about 25 nm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> illustrates the relationship between the threshold-current-minimizing temperature and the negative droop ratio at 25&#xb0; C. and an output of 1.4 mW of surface-emitting lasers in which the low-reflectivity region of dielectric film (SiN) is provided in the emission region and having various thicknesses of the selectively oxidized layer, namely 30 nm, 32 nm, and 34 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0166">The amount of detuning is 0 nm in the surface-emitting laser in which the threshold-current-minimizing temperature is 25&#xb0; C. The amount of detuning increases by about 0.24 nm as the threshold-current-minimizing temperature increases by 1&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> shows that the greater the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer, the more are the negative droop characteristics reduced, as is also indicated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. As the threshold-current-minimizing temperature increases, the absolute value of the droop ratio increases in the negative direction. This is believed due to the fact that, in the surface-emitting laser in which the threshold-current-minimizing temperature is high, emission efficiency is improved by the increase in the internal temperature of the surface-emitting laser by current injection. This tendency is more pronounced as the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer becomes smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0168">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the negative droop ratio of &#x2212;10% or less is obtained when the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is 25 nm or more. This is because the amount of detuning of the surface-emitting laser illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is smaller than 0 nm. As can be seen from the tendency illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the appearance of the negative droop characteristics in response to an increase in the threshold-current-minimizing temperature tends to be more pronounced as the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer decreases. For example, this tendency is very pronounced in the case of the selectively oxidized layer having a thickness of 25 nm. The negative droop ratio of &#x2212;10% or less was obtained only in the surface-emitting lasers in which the threshold-current-minimizing temperature is 25&#xb0; C. or lower (i.e., the amount of detuning is 0 nm or less).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0169">Thus, while the negative droop characteristics can be effectively reduced by setting the threshold-current-minimizing temperature at a low value, a surface-emitting laser with such a temperature setting may experience an increase in the operating current during a high-temperature operation, resulting in poor temperature characteristics. Thus, for practical purposes, a proper balance needs to be achieved between the control of the negative droop characteristics and temperature characteristics. Specifically, in view of the temperature characteristics, the threshold-current-minimizing temperature should be 25&#xb0; C. or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0170">Such a demand may be addressed by increasing the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer. By so doing, the negative droop ratio approaches 0%, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, and the dependency on the threshold-current-minimizing temperature can also be reduced, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. Furthermore, the negative droop ratio of &#x2212;10% or less can be obtained even when the threshold-current-minimizing temperature is 25&#xb0; C. or higher (i.e., the amount of detuning is 0 nm or more). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> shows that as long as the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is 30 nm or more, the negative droop ratio of &#x2212;10% or less can be obtained even when the threshold-current-minimizing temperature is 60&#xb0; C. Thus, by increasing the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer, the negative droop characteristics can be controlled and the temperature characteristics can be improved. However, the single mode output, which is an important characteristic of the surface-emitting laser, may be limited.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates the relationship between the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer and the single-mode output of a surface-emitting laser in which a low-reflectivity region of dielectric film (SiN) is provided in the emission region, as well as a surface-emitting laser in which there is no such low-reflectivity region. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, regardless of the presence of the low-reflectivity region, the single-mode output tends to decrease as the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer increases. This is believed due to the fact that as the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer increases, optical confinement in the transverse direction by the oxidized layer increases, so that the high-order transverse mode is confined and oscillation tends to occur more easily. It can also be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> that the single-mode output decreases by about 0.1 mW for each 1 nm increase in the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0172">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, with regard to the surface-emitting laser having no low-reflectivity region, it can be estimated that a single-mode output of almost 2.5 mW would be obtained when the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is about 25 nm. However, when the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is decreased to 30 nm, the single-mode output is also decreased to about 1.5 mW. Thus, there is a trade-off between the negative droop characteristics and the single-mode output. Namely, an attempt to effectively control the negative droop characteristics leads to a decrease in the single-mode output. An attempt to obtain a high single-mode output leads to more pronounced negative droop characteristics. In order to reduce the effect of the negative droop characteristics even a little, the amount of detuning would have to be set such that the temperature characteristics of the surface-emitting laser are degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0173">Thus, in the surface-emitting laser having no low-reflectivity region, a balance must be achieved between the single-mode output and the negative droop characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0174">A high single-mode output is desirable not just in printer systems but also in other applications. In a printer system, a single-mode output of about 1 mW or more may be sufficient for practical purposes. A faster system can be realized by increasing the output, and there is always the increasing demand for faster printing speeds. Thus, it is desirable to realize a surface-emitting laser in which the negative droop characteristics are minimized and the single-mode output is maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0175">In accordance with the present embodiment, this trade-off problem is addressed by the surface-emitting laser in which a low-reflectivity region of a dielectric film is provided in the emission surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> shows that in the case of the surface-emitting laser having the low-reflectivity region of the dielectric film, a greater single-mode output is obtained by the function of the low-reflectivity region to control the oscillation of the high-order transverse mode than the surface-emitting laser having no such low-reflectivity region of dielectric film. For example, when the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is 30 nm or more, the negative droop characteristics can be effectively controlled in lasers in which the threshold-current-minimizing temperature is up to 60&#xb0; C. When the selectively oxidized layer has such a thickness, a single-mode output of 2.5 mW can be obtained in the surface-emitting laser having the low-reflectivity region of dielectric film, exhibiting an improvement of about 1 mW in output. What is important is that the single-mode control is achieved not by the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer but by the dielectric film. Namely, the dielectric film significantly reduces the dependency of the single-mode output on the thickness of the oxidized layer, so that a high single-mode output can be obtained even when the oxidized layer has a relatively large thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0176">Thus, the surface-emitting laser in accordance with the present embodiment can provide a higher single-mode output than a surface-emitting laser that has no low-reflectivity region of dielectric film at the same negative droop ratio (i.e., the same oxidized layer thickness). From a different perspective, in accordance with the present embodiment, the thickness of the oxidized layer can be increased compared to the surface-emitting laser having no low-reflectivity region of dielectric film at the same single-mode output. Thus, the threshold-current-minimizing temperature can be set to a higher value, which is preferable in terms of temperature characteristics. Thus, in accordance with the present embodiment, there is less of the trade-off problem mentioned above, so that a single-mode output of 1 mW or more, which is generally required in printer systems, can be easily obtained as long as the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer is 40 nm or less, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0177">Thus, a large single-mode output can be obtained while the negative droop characteristics are effectively controlled. As a result, a surface-emitting laser suitable for a printer system that has good temperature characteristics and that can achieve high image quality and print speed can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0178">As described above, in accordance with the present embodiment, the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b> includes the substrate <b>101</b> on which the buffer layer <b>102</b>, the lower semiconductor DBR <b>103</b>, the resonator structure including the active layer <b>105</b>, the upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b>, and the contact layer <b>109</b>, for example, are stacked. The upper semiconductor DBR <b>107</b> includes a confinement structure in which a current passage region is surrounded by an oxide that includes at least an oxide formed by the oxidation of a part of the selectively oxidized layer <b>108</b> that includes aluminum. In the emission region via which laser light is emitted, two small regions (first and second small regions) are provided in areas spaced apart from the central portion of the emission region. In the two small regions, the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B having an optical thickness of &#x3bb;/4 are formed. The transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B include an optically transparent dielectric film such that the reflectivity of the small regions is lower than the reflectivity of the central portion of the emission region. The thickness of the selectively oxidized layer may range from 30 nm to 34 nm, and the temperature at which the oscillation threshold current is minimized is 60&#xb0; C. or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0179">In this case, the negative droop ratio of &#x2212;10% or less and a very large single-mode output of 2 mW or more can be obtained at the same time. Thus, a large single-mode output can be realized while the negative droop characteristics are controlled regardless of the pulse period. When the target single-mode output is 1 mW or more, the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer may be in the range of 30 nm to 40 nm. The transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B have optical anisotropy with respect to two directions perpendicular to each other. Thus, optical anisotropy can be intentionally caused in the confinement effect on the laser light in the transverse direction, so that the stability in the polarization direction can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0180">The transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B have an optical thickness of &#x3bb;/4. When viewed from the direction of optical emission, the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B have the distance L<b>1</b> in the range of 4.0 &#x3bc;m to 5.0 &#x3bc;m and the width c in the range of 1.7 &#x3bc;m to 2.7 &#x3bc;m. Thus, the single-mode output can be increased and stability in the polarization direction can be improved while reproducibility is maintained and the negative droop characteristics are controlled. When a square-wave current pulse having a pulse period of 1 ms and a pulse width of 500 &#x3bc;s is supplied, the relationship (P<b>1</b>&#x2212;P<b>2</b>)/P<b>2</b>&#x2267;&#x2212;0.1 is satisfied, where P<b>1</b> is the optical output 10 ns after the start of pulse supply, and P<b>2</b> is the optical output 1 &#x3bc;s after the start of pulse supply. Thus, the negative droop characteristics can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0181">Because the light source <b>14</b> of the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> has the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>, the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> can perform a highly accurate optical scan operation. Thus, the laser printer <b>1000</b> including the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> can form a high-quality image.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0182">While in the foregoing embodiment, the protection layer <b>111</b> has been described as comprising SiN, the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment. Examples of the material of a dielectric film (dielectric layer) include SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, TiOx, AlOx, FCa, and FMg. Particularly, SiN has a dense film structure and is capable of effectively preventing the entry of water or oxygen, for example, when used as a surface protection film, thus contributing to a significant improvement in the reliability of the device. Further, an SiN film can be easily etched using a hydrogen fluoride solution and the like. Thus, SiN is a preferable example from the viewpoint of process controllability and long-term reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0183">Further, while in the foregoing embodiment the small regions have been described as being semi-circular in shape, the present invention is not limited to such embodiment. For example, the small regions may have other shapes, such as elliptical or rectangular shapes. While the material of the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B has been described as being the same as the material of the protection layer <b>111</b>, the is merely an example and the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B may be made of other materials. Similarly, while the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B have been described as having an optical thickness of &#x3bb;/4, this is merely an example. In another example, the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B may have an optical thickness of 3&#x3bb;/4, as in the case of the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. Namely, what is required is that the optical thickness of the transparent layers <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B be an odd multiple of &#x3bb;/4.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a cross section of the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>A taken in a plane parallel to the X-Z plane. In this case, the central portion of the emission region is covered with the protection layer <b>111</b> (dielectric film) having an optical thickness of 2&#x3bb;/4. The peripheral regions of the emission region except for the two small regions (first and second small regions) are also covered with the protection layer <b>111</b> (dielectric film) having the optical thickness of 2&#x3bb;/4.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0185">In the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>A, because the entire emission surface is covered with the protection layer <b>111</b> (dielectric film), oxidation or contamination of the emission surface can be prevented. Although the central portion of the emission region is also covered with the protection layer <b>111</b> (dielectric film), the optical characteristics similar to those obtained in the absence of the protection layer <b>111</b> (dielectric film) can be obtained without reduction in reflectivity because the optical thickness of the central region is an even multiple of &#x3bb;/2. Namely, what is required is that the optical thickness of the region whose reflectivity is desired to be reduced is an odd multiple of &#x3bb;/4 while the optical thickness of the other regions is an even multiple of &#x3bb;/4.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0186">Thus, a surface-emitting laser having high moisture resistance and that does not degrade easily over time can be obtained. Generally, an optical film having an optical thickness of an integer multiple of &#x3bb;/2 has little influence on reflectivity. Thus, the provision of the dielectric film having the optical thickness of an integer multiple of &#x3bb;/2 on the surface-emitting laser surface hardly affects the characteristics of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0187">Semiconductor materials have the problem of reacting with the oxygen and water in the atmosphere, resulting in corrosion. Corrosion may be prevented by mounting the surface-emitting laser in a hermetically sealed package filled with an inert gas, such as nitrogen. However, this may result in higher cost for the packaging or mounting. Also, complete hermetic sealing is difficult to achieve. Thus, improvement in corrosion resistance of the surface-emitting laser itself provides an advantage from the cost or mounting technology point of view. A dielectric film of SiN or SiO<sub>2 </sub>can be densely formed and has a significant effect in preventing the entry of oxygen or water. Thus, by providing a dielectric member of such material on the device surface, the entry of oxygen or water into the device and also the resultant corrosion of the device can be effectively prevented. In this case, there is little influence on reflectivity when the thickness of the dielectric film is set to be an integer multiple of &#x3bb;/2. The same effect can be obtained when the optical thickness of the dielectric film in the low-reflectivity region is an odd multiple of &#x3bb;/4. Thus, the device can be protected, the high-order mode can be controlled, and the polarization direction can be controlled at the same time by setting the film thickness (optical thickness) of the low-reflectivity region to be &#x3bb;/4 and the optical thickness of the dielectric film that covers the entire device as a protection film to be &#x3bb;/2. In this way, destruction of the device due to the absorption of moisture, for example, can be prevented, thus further improving the long-term reliability of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0188">In the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>A, which is a variation of the preceding embodiment, a dielectric film (first dielectric film) having an optical thickness of an odd multiple of &#x3bb;/4 is provided in a region away from the center of the emission region. Thereafter, a dielectric film (second dielectric film) having an optical thickness of &#x3bb;/2 is provided on the entire surface of the device. When the first and the second dielectric films are made of the same material, the reflectivity of the region in which the first and the second dielectric films are provided can be more effectively reduced. On the other hand, when the first and the second dielectric films are made of different materials, a refractive index difference may be caused in the interface of the first and the second dielectric films, so that the decrease in reflectivity may be hampered by the reflection on the interface. Particularly, when the refractive index of the first dielectric film which is located below is smaller, the influence of reflection at the interface increases. In the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>A, because the first and the second dielectric films are made of the same material, the reflectivity of the region away from the center of the emission region can be effectively reduced, so that the effect of controlling the high-order transverse mode can be effectively obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 37B</figref> illustrate a surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>B according to an embodiment of the present invention. In a central portion of the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>B, a high-reflectivity region having two transparent dielectric layers is provided. In a region away from the central region, a low-reflectivity region having a single dielectric layer is provided. The dielectric layers each have an optical thickness corresponding to an odd multiple of &#x3bb;/4 of the oscillation wavelength &#x3bb;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref> is a cross section taken along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0190">The central region comprises two kinds of dielectric material, namely SiO<sub>2 </sub>(lower layer <b>111</b>) and TiOx (upper layer <b>115</b>). The upper and lower layers are disposed on a contact layer <b>109</b>. In this case, it is necessary that the refractive index of the lower dielectric layer <b>111</b> be smaller than that of the upper dielectric layer <b>115</b>. Preferably, the refractive index of the lower dielectric layer <b>111</b> may be about 1.5, while the refractive index of the upper dielectric layer <b>115</b> may be about 2.5. In a region away from the center of the laser, only TiOx is stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0191">In this setting of the thickness of the dielectric layer, the central region has the same structure as that of a conventional multilayer film reflector, resulting in a high reflectivity. In the peripheral region away from the central region, there is the single layer of the dielectric layer having the thickness of &#x3bb;/4n. Because the refractive index of TiOx (upper layer <b>115</b>) is smaller than the refractive index of the semiconductor layer, the peripheral region has a lower reflectivity.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0192">Further, in the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>B, because the reflectivity of the central region is increased, a very large reflectivity difference can be obtained between the central region and the peripheral region. The high-order transverse mode often has a partial mode distribution in the peripheral region away from the central region of the device. Thus, in the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>B, reflectivity with respect to the high-order transverse mode can be selectively reduced, so that oscillation of the high-order transverse mode can be prevented and a large single-mode output can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0193">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A</figref>, <b>37</b>B, <b>38</b>A, and <b>38</b>B, a large single-mode output can be obtained even when the selectively oxidized layer has a large thickness by providing the low-reflectivity region in the region away from the center of the surface-emitting laser. Thus, the negative droop characteristics can be effectively reduced by increasing the thickness of the oxidized layer. Further, the threshold-current-minimizing temperature can be set to a high-temperature (such as 60&#xb0; C.). When it is necessary to control polarization, the separated dielectric shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0194">While in the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>B the second dielectric layer has a square outer shape, this is merely an example. In another embodiment, the outer shape of the second dielectric layer may include a circular shape. Similarly, the shape of the high-reflectivity region may be other than circular. Effects similar to those obtained by the present embodiment can be obtained if the single-mode output can be increased regardless of the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer. For example, besides providing the dielectric film in accordance with the present embodiment, the reflectivity of the region away from the center of the emission region can be selectively reduced by removing a portion of the semiconductor multilayer film reflector away from the center of the emission region by etching, so that the peripheral region has a reduced thickness. Alternatively, reflectivity of the peripheral region may be reduced by partially providing a semiconductor layer on the peripheral region away from the center of the emission region. Further alternatively, a surface-emitting laser having a anti-guiding structure referred to as the ARROW structure may be formed by forming a refractive index step in the transverse direction by processing the peripheral region of the semiconductor multilayer film reflector away from the emission region (see IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, VOL. 38, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2002 pp. 1599). This structure also prevents the oscillation of the high-order transverse mode.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0195">In any case, a high single-mode output can be obtained regardless of the thickness of the selectively oxidized layer. Thus, the negative droop characteristics can be reduced while a high single-mode output can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0196">The light source <b>14</b> may include a surface-emitting laser array <b>100</b>C illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, instead of the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>. The surface-emitting laser array <b>100</b>C includes plural (21 in the illustrated example) light-emitting portions disposed on the same substrate. In this case, the X-axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> corresponds to the main-scan-corresponding direction, and the Y-axis corresponds to the sub-scan corresponding direction. The plural light-emitting portions are disposed such that when all of the light-emitting portions were orthographically projected on an imaginary line extending along the Y-axis direction, the adjacent light-emitting portions are disposed at intervals of d<b>2</b>. Thus, the 21 light-emitting portions are two-dimensionally arranged. In the present disclosure, the &#x201c;interval of the light-emitting portions&#x201d; refers to the distance between the centers of two adjacent light-emitting portions. The number of the light-emitting portions is not limited to 21.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0197">Each of the light-emitting portions has a structure similar to the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> which is a cross section taken along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. The surface-emitting laser array <b>100</b>C may be manufactured by a process similar to that for the surface-emitting laser <b>100</b>. Thus, plural beams of laser light having a high single-mode output and a uniform polarization direction can be obtained from the light-emitting portions. Therefore, 21 circular optical spots having a high optical density and a very small size can be simultaneously formed on the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0198">The light-emitting portions of the surface-emitting laser array <b>100</b>C have the uniform interval d<b>2</b> in the orthogonal projection on the imaginary line extending along the sub-scan corresponding direction, the embodiment provides the same effect as if the light-emitting portions are arranged over the photosensitive drum <b>1030</b> at equal intervals in the sub-scan direction by adjusting the timing of turning on the light emitting portions.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0199">When the interval d<b>2</b> is 2.65 &#x3bc;m and the optical system of the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> has a magnifying power of 2, a high-density writing operation of 4800 dpi (dots per inch) can be performed. Obviously, higher densities and a higher-quality printing operation may be performed by increasing the number of the light-emitting portions disposed in the main-scan-corresponding direction, by further reducing the interval d<b>2</b> by narrowing the pitch d<b>1</b> in the sub-scan corresponding direction, or by decreasing the magnifying power of the optical system. A write interval in the main-scan direction can be easily controlled by adjusting the timing of turning on the light-emitting portions.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0200">In this case, the laser printer <b>1000</b> can perform a printing operation without lowering the print speed even when the write dot density is increased. Further, the print speed can be increased for the same write dot density. Because the surface-emitting laser according to the present embodiment has a high single-mode output while the negative droop characteristics are reduced, a high print speed and a high-resolution image quality can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0201">Because the polarization directions of the light beams from the light-emitting portions are stable and aligned, the laser printer <b>1000</b> can form a high-quality image stably. Preferably, adjacent light-emitting portions are electrically and spatially separated by grooves having a width of 5 &#x3bc;m or more. If the width is too narrow, it may become difficult to control the etching step during the manufacturing process. Preferably, the size of the mesa (i.e., the length of the sides) is 10 &#x3bc;m or more. If the size of the mesa is too small, heat may be trapped during an operation, thereby degrading the device characteristics. The surface-emitting laser array <b>100</b>C may include a one-dimensional arrangement of light-emitting portions similar to the light-emitting lasers <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0202">While the foregoing embodiment has been described with reference to the case where the normal to the principal surface of the substrate lies at an angle of 15&#xb0; toward the crystal orientation [1 1 1]A with respect to the crystal orientation [1 0 0], this is merely an example. It is only required that, when an inclined substrate is used, the normal to the principal surface of the substrate is inclined toward a direction of the crystal orientation &#x3c;1 1 1&#x3e; with respect to a direction of the crystal orientation &#x3c;1 0 0&#x3e;.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0203">While in the foregoing embodiment, the light-emitting portion has been described as having an oscillation wavelength of the 780 nm band, this is merely an example. In another embodiment, the light-emitting portion may have a different oscillation wavelength depending on the characteristics of the photosensitive material.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0204">The surface-emitting lasers according to the various embodiments of the present invention may be utilized for purposes other than an image forming apparatus. In such embodiments, the oscillation wavelength may include wavelengths from the 650 nm band, 850 nm band, 980 nm band, 1.3 &#x3bc;m band, or 1.5 &#x3bc;m band, depending on the particular purpose. The semiconductor material of the active layer may include a mixed crystal semiconductor material depending on the oscillation wavelength. For example, in the 650 nm band, an AlGaInP mixed crystal semiconductor material may be used. In the 980 nm band, an InGaAs mixed crystal semiconductor material may be used. In the 1.3 &#x3bc;m and the 1.5 &#x3bc;m band, a GaInNAs(Sb) mixed crystal semiconductor material may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0205">By selecting the material and structure of the reflecting mirrors depending on the oscillation wavelength, a light-emitting portion corresponding to the desired oscillation wavelength can be formed. For example, an AlGaInP mixed crystal may be used instead of an AlGaAs mixed crystal. Preferably, a combination of the low-refractive index layer and the high-refractive index layer is selected such that the combination is transparent to the oscillation wavelength and the refractive index difference between the low- and high-refractive index layers can be maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0206">While in the foregoing embodiments the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> has been described as being applied in a printer, the optical scanning apparatus <b>1010</b> may be applied to other types of image forming apparatuses, such as copy machines, FAX machines, or multifunction peripherals (MFP) incorporating multiple image forming functions.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0207">While the foregoing embodiments have been described with reference to the laser printer <b>1000</b> as an image forming apparatus, the present invention is not limited to such embodiments. For example, the present invention may be embodied in an image forming apparatus configured to irradiate a medium (such as a sheet of recording material) configured to emit a color upon laser irradiation with laser light directly.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0208">The image carrier may include a silver halide film. In this case, a latent image may be formed on the silver halide film by optical scanning. The latent image may be rendered visible and then printed onto a print paper by a process similar to the conventional silver halide photography process. Such an image forming apparatus may be configured as an optical plate-making apparatus, or an optical image rendering apparatus configured to render a CT scan image and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0209"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> illustrates a color printer <b>2000</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention having plural photosensitive drums. The color printer <b>2000</b> is a multi-color printer of the tandem type configured to form a full-color image by overlapping four colors of black (B), cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). The color printer <b>2000</b> includes photosensitive drums K<b>1</b>, C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, and Y<b>1</b>; charging units K<b>2</b>, C<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, and Y<b>2</b>; developing units K<b>4</b>, C<b>4</b>, M<b>4</b>, and Y<b>4</b>; cleaning units K<b>5</b>, C<b>5</b>, M<b>5</b>, and Y<b>5</b>; and transfer units K<b>6</b>, C<b>6</b>, M<b>6</b>, and Y<b>6</b> for the respective colors.

<p id="p-0206" num="0210">The photosensitive drums K<b>1</b>, C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, and Y<b>1</b> (each of which may be referred to as &#x201c;the photosensitive drum&#x201d;) are rotated in a direction indicated by the corresponding arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>.

The charging unit is configured to charge a surface of the photosensitive drum uniformly. The charged surface of the photosensitive drum is then irradiated with light emitted by the optical scanning apparatus <b>2010</b>, whereby a latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum.

Because the color printer <b>2000</b> includes the optical scanning apparatus <b>2010</b>, the color printer <b>2000</b> can provide effects similar to those of the laser printer <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0212">In the color printer <b>2000</b>, a color displacement may be caused by manufacturing or position errors of the components of the color printer <b>2000</b>.
