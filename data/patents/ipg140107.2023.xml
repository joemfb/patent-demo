<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system, that may be portable, for purifying liquid flowing gravitationally from a source/reservoir into a purified liquid receptacle is described. The system includes a housing with a generally horizontal filtering space. More than one liquid inlet disposed at a top portion of the filter is provided as well as one or more liquid outlets disposed at a bottom portion. The liquid flows in a generally lateral direction through the liquid treatment medium. Two or more first walls extending upwardly into the filtering space from a bottom wall thereof and ending with an apex are provided inside the device. One or more second walls downwardly extending into the filtering space from a top wall thereof are also provided. Each of the walls defines a closed path. The first and second walls jointly cause the liquid to flow in a curvilinear flow path from the inlet to the outlet. Apexes of the first walls may be defined such that each apex more distal along the liquid flow path is at a lower level than an apex of a first wall more proximal along the flow path. One or more venting ports may be formed at a top wall portion of the housing for releasing gas from the filter.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention concerns methods, devices and system for purifying liquid, particularly water.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Filtering devices and methods for filtering liquids, particularly such for filtering water to obtain potable water, are known. Examples are U.S. Pat. Nos. 789,968 and 1,090,283. Such filtering devices generally hold a filtering medium with reactants that can remove harmful or otherwise undesired substances from the filtered water.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO 2004/071961 discloses a water treatment device and method for treating water. The device includes a water-collecting chamber and a filtration chamber which includes a set of reactants that include a polycation, a polyanion and optionally other components. The filter includes upwardly extending and downward extending circular walls intercalated into the spaces between one another. The water flows through the filter by gravitational force. Another water-filtering device and method is disclosed in WO 2005/092798.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with the invention a novel purifying system is provided, for filtering liquid under gravitational flow, to be referred herein occasionally also as &#x201c;liquid filter&#x201d; or &#x201c;filter&#x201d;. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the liquid is water.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention provides a liquid purifying system for filtering a liquid from a source or reservoir into a purified liquid receptacle. In accordance with a preferred, albeit non-exclusive application, the system of the invention is applied for gravitationally filtering and purifying a liquid from a source or reservoir above the filter into a purified liquid receptacle below the filter The filter comprises a housing with a top and a bottom that contains a generally horizontally oriented filtering space that holds a liquid treatment medium.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It should be note that the terms &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; or &#x201c;horizontally oriented&#x201d; are given for convenience only for providing a frame of reference to describe relative position and orientation of the filter's components. During filtering of liquid in accordance with one of the embodiments of a filter for gravitational filtering, the &#x201c;top&#x201d; will face upwards, the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; downwards. However, in other modes of use and/or other embodiments, the orientation may be different, e.g. in the case of a filter in accordance with the teaching herein fitted at the bottom of portable potable water container which has a &#x201c;top&#x201d; upwards orientation during filtering and a &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; upwards orientation during use.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The housing of the filter is provided with one or more liquid inlets at a top portion of the filter and one or more liquid outlets at a bottom portion of the filter. The one or more liquid inlets and one or more liquid outlets are configured such that the liquid flows in a generally lateral direction through the liquid treatment medium, e.g. in a general radial direction from the one or more inlets at a top peripheral portion of the housing to a bottom outlet at about the center of a bottom portion of the housing, or from an inlet at a central top portion of the housing to one or more peripheral outlets at a bottom peripheral portion of the housing. The term &#x201c;generally lateral direction&#x201d; means to denote the fact that the flow, which as will be noted below has a curvilinear flow path and by virtue of the fact that it is gravitational, has typically also a general downward trend, has a general horizontal trend that is more pronounced than the vertical one. Upwardly extending into the filtering space from a bottom wall thereof are one or more first walls and downwardly extending into the filtering space from a top wall thereof are one or more second walls. Each of these walls defines a closed path, the first and second walls being configured so as to jointly cause the liquid flowing in a generally lateral direction from the one or more inlets to the one or more outlets to flow to assume a generally curvilinear flow path. The one or more first or second walls serve as barriers that do not permit the water to flow in a linear path, but rather assume a curvilinear one. In some embodiments of the invention the walls are configured such that at least one of the first or the second walls extend into the space formed between two adjacent opposite second or first walls, respectively. In accordance with an embodiment of the teaching herein the apexes of the first walls are such that each apex more distal along the liquid flow path is at a lower level than an apex of a first wall more proximal along the flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention the liquid inlet(s) is at the filter's periphery and the outlet(s) is at a central portion of a bottom wall of the filter. In accordance with this embodiment the liquid flows from the periphery in a generally radial, overall descending curvilinear flow path to the filters central outlet(s). In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the water inlet(s) is formed at a central part of the upper wall and the outlet(s) is defined at a bottom, peripheral portion of the filter. In accordance with this embodiment, the liquid flows in a generally radial, overall descending curvilinear flow path from the central water inlet(s) into the peripheral outlet(s).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with some preferred embodiments of the invention, the liquid inlet(s) and outlet(s) are arranged such that the liquid flows generally uniformly throughout the entire inner, filtering space of the filter, such that the entire filtering medium participates in the filtration process. For example, where the water inlet(s) is in the peripheral upper portion of the filter, the one or more water inlets are arranged so as to have a substantially uniform circumferential distribution in the filter's periphery. Similarly, where the water outlet is at a bottom peripheral portion of the filter, such one or more outlets are arranged so as to have a substantially uniform circumferential distribution at said periphery. For example, the water inlets may consists of a plurality of apertures equidistantly distributed along the periphery of the filter's top portion; may consist of a number (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8) of elongated, arced openings along the periphery of the filter's top portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the first and second walls are concentric, typically coaxial and essentially parallel to the filter's vertical axis. By an embodiment of the invention each of the first and second walls are circular.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Provided by the invention is also a liquid filter having a housing of a kind specified above and that comprises one or more venting ports formed at a top portion of the housing. Where the filter is of a kind having internal walls as specified, the venting ports are typically ports that open into space peripheral to a most peripheral second wall. Such ports vent air which may be entrapped within the filtering space which if not released, may impair the continuous filtering process. The venting ports are typically formed at level that is higher than the level of the liquid inlets. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the liquid inlet and the venting ports are linked by a wall portion that is sloped and ascends from said inlet to said port.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The system of the invention for the purpose of purifying water is particularly a device intended to yield potable water. In this case, the device may comprise a filter medium with reactants as known per se, for example those described in WO 2004/071961 and WO 2005/092798.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the liquid treatment medium may comprise components that release a beneficial substance to the potable water. Such a substance may be of a nutritional or health value or may have a water disinfecting activity. A specific example of such a substance is iodine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">By one embodiment of the invention, the purifying device comprises a porous substrate, typically disposed above the inlet of the filter, that release said beneficial substance into the water. For example, such substrate may be in the form of a mesh net, porous or fibrous material, etc. The water thus comes into contact with said substrate prior to egress to the filter space through said inlet. In accordance with one embodiment, provided is also a sorbing substrate for sorbing substance that may be released from said porous substrate into a source water reservoir. Such a sorbing substrate is typically disposed above the substance-releasing porous substrate and may, in the case of iodine, be activated carbon, porous or fibrous material, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the filtering space has a flow-delay chamber disposed in the flow path between the liquid inlet and the filtering space. The flow-delay chamber may include a flow bather in the form of one or more of a net, mesh, porous material, fibrous material or the like, or any combination thereof, within the chamber or at one or both ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Provided by the invention is also a purifying system for filtering and purifying water into potable water, having a housing of a kind specified above and comprising a polymeric substrate incorporating iodine and being capable of releasing it into the source water. Polymers that incorporate and can release iodine into a surrounding aqueous medium are generally known. Examples are polyamides such as Nylon 6, Nylon 6,6, Nylon 11 and natural proteins, polyurethanes made from diisocyanates and diols for example: segmented polymers made from toluene diisocyanate and short chain poly(ethylene glycol), polybutylene glycol and polycaprolactone, polyurea, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene imine, polyvinyl amine, chirosan, poly(vinyl pyridine) and other polymers and copolymers bearing amide and amine and urethane groups. Iodine may be included in such a polymer in an electrostatic and coordination complex form of neutral iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) or iodide anion (I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) with the amide, amine or urethane bonds where such a complex can reach 50% w/w of the carrier weight. Iodine is gradually released by solubilization to the water as a function of contact time, temperature, and iodine complexation process in the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Typically, a purifying system that includes an iodine-releasing polymer, also includes a component for subsequent absorption of iodine from the water. Such component is typically included in the filtering medium inside the filtering space.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also provided by the invention is a filter for filtering water into potable water, having a housing of a kind specified above and comprising a ceramic filtering device fitted for contact with the filtered water, typically at the water outlet(s) for absorption of heavy metals from the water.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with some embodiments of the invention the purifying system is configured for use in association with a portable potable water container. Such a container typically comprises a potable water reservoir with a sealable dispensing outlet; a purifying system as disclosed herein fitted at the base of the container such that outlet from the filter opens into the reservoir; and a water receptacle for receiving source water and feeding it into the liquid inlet. The container has a filtering position in which the container is inverted with its base being outwardly oriented for filtering of source water into potable water which is accumulated in the reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By an embodiment of the portable potable water container of the invention, the water receptacle is fitted on the top side of the filter and has a collapsed state in which it is compacted adjacent said top side and an extended state. For filtering of source water the receptacle is opened to the extended state. Typically, the potable water container according to this embodiment comprises a filter cover for fitting over the receptacle when in its collapsed state. Said cover then serves also as a base for said container. The fitting of the filter cover may be a screw-type fitting or any other convenient fitting mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the filter comprises an integral vent for venting the potable water reservoir. Said vent has at least one first opening that opens into the potable water reservoir and at least one second opening that opens to the exterior. In an embodiment of the invention where the filter is integrated with a portable potable water container, the at least one second outlet is typically sealable, e.g. by a O-ring that is compressed by the filter cover.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention also provides, by another aspect, a method for filtering and purifying source liquid, comprising inducing the liquid to flow through a filter medium generally lateral overall descending curvilinear flow path.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the following description a specific embodiment of the invention for filtering and purifying source water into potable water will be described. It should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this embodiment and the filter of the invention may be used for filtering and purifying any other liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference is first being made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing a filter device generally designated <b>100</b> including a casing <b>102</b> which, in this specific embodiment, is formed from an upper filter member <b>104</b> and a lower filter member <b>106</b> fitted together in a snap-type arrangement by means of peripheral snap and corresponding groove <b>108</b>. The two filter members jointly define a filtration space <b>110</b>. In use, filtration space <b>110</b> is filled with a filtration medium, which may comprise, as known per se, components such as resins, active carbon, etc., intended to remove nauseous or otherwise undesired substances from the medium. The constituents of the filter medium may be dictated by the quality of the source water, the desired quality of the potable water, and generally may be designed to meet acceptable or regulatory standards. Considerations for devising proper filter constituents are known per se.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The filter is designed for filtering water from a source above the filter into a potable water receptacle which may be placed below the filter. The filter comprises a series, two in this specific embodiment, of a first set of walls <b>112</b> which upwardly extend from the bottom wall <b>114</b> and a set of second walls <b>116</b> downwardly extending from the upper wall <b>118</b> of the filter. All the walls in this specific embodiment define a circular path, all the walls being parallel and coaxial. One or more water inlets <b>122</b> are formed in the peripheral upper portion and are typically arranged so as to permit relatively uniform water inlets throughout the entire periphery of the filter. This may be achieved by a plurality of openings equidistantly spaced in a circular array; or alternatively this may be achieved by one or a few annular openings in the top portion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The filter has a water outlet <b>124</b> at the central bottom portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">First walls <b>112</b> and second walls <b>116</b> are interlaced in a dovetailing manner such that one or more second walls are fitted into spaces between two adjacent first walls and vice versa. Thus, a generally lateral, overall descending, curvilinear flow path is defined between water inlet(s) <b>122</b> and water outlet <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first walls <b>112</b> have apexes such that each apex more distal along the flow path is at a lower level than the apex of a first wall more proximal in the flow path. This is an important characteristic to ensure relatively high throughput water filtering under gravitational force. The water flows through the filter in a curvilinear flow path represented by wavy arrow <b>130</b>. The water flows in a generally radial direction from inlets <b>122</b> to outlet <b>124</b>. The water flow through the filtration space <b>110</b>, at least through its main portion, has a generally lateral orientation with a slight downward trend, as represented by arrow <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The filter also includes one or more venting ports <b>134</b> for release of air which may be entrapped within the filter, as represented by dashed arrow <b>136</b>. The venting ports are typically in the form of elongated circumferential openings or a plurality of ports equidistantly spaced in a circular array.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another embodiment of a filter <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> functionally similar elements to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have been given like reference numerals shifted by <b>100</b>. Filter <b>200</b> includes a central water inlet <b>208</b> formed in the upper wall <b>218</b> and has one or more peripheral outlet(s) <b>224</b> in the peripheral part of bottom wall <b>214</b>. In this embodiment a generally lateral, overall descending, curvilinear flow path represented by arrow <b>230</b> is defined between inlet <b>208</b> and outlet(s) <b>224</b>. The general lateral and slightly downwardly trended path is represented by arrow <b>232</b>. The apexes of first walls <b>212</b> are allocated at a gradual decreasing level along the flow path, which in this embodiment is defined between the center to the periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is now being made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> showing a filter <b>100</b>, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, incorporated into a portable potable water container <b>300</b>. Filter <b>100</b> forms part of a filtering assembly <b>302</b> including, in addition to filter <b>100</b>, a water receptacle <b>304</b>, shown in a collapsed state, and a filter closure <b>306</b> fitted over the collapsed water receptacle <b>304</b>, typically in a screw-type engagement. Filter closure <b>306</b> has a flat bottom <b>308</b> which in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can serve as a supporting base for the container <b>300</b>. At the opposite end, potable container <b>300</b> has a dispensing outlet <b>310</b> sealed with a closure member <b>312</b> having a space <b>314</b> fitting over the neck <b>316</b> of dispensing opening <b>310</b> and adapted to engage and seal the opening, typically in a screw-type manner. The closure member <b>312</b> has side portions <b>318</b> which envelope the upper part <b>320</b> of the bottle. This closure member <b>312</b> is fitted to support the bottle when inverted for the purpose of filtering water as will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference is now being made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing the bottom portion of container <b>300</b> in an inverted manner with the filter <b>100</b> on top and with the source water receptacle <b>304</b>, which as can be seen in this figure has a bellows-type configuration, being extended into a fully open position defining an internal receptacle space <b>322</b> which can receive source water to be filtered and purified by filter <b>100</b>. As can be seen, water inlet(s) <b>122</b> are in flow communication with the receptacle space whereby water introduced into the receptacle space can pass through the filter, as represented by arrow <b>130</b>, into the potable container. Following such filtration, receptacle <b>304</b> can be collapsed, and the filter cover <b>308</b> can then be put in place into the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a filter of the kind of filter <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, incorporated into a tabletop water filtration device <b>500</b>. Device <b>500</b> is partitioned by a partition <b>502</b> into a source water receptacle <b>504</b> and a potable water reservoir <b>506</b> having a dispensing valve outlet <b>508</b>. Device <b>500</b> is fitted with support legs <b>509</b>. A vent <b>510</b> extends into the potable water reservoir <b>506</b> along a side wall of device <b>500</b> and permits the release of air while water is filtered into reservoir <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Source water receptacle <b>504</b> is covered by a cover <b>512</b> and when lifted, source water can be filled into receptacle <b>504</b> and can then be filtered through filter <b>100</b>, in a manner shown and described before, into potable water reservoir <b>506</b> for subsequent use.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Reference is now being made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, showing a filter device <b>600</b> having a casing <b>602</b> which, in a similar manner to the filter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is formed from two filter members including an upper filter member <b>604</b> and a lower filter member <b>606</b>, which are typically welded together, and jointly define a filtering space <b>610</b>. Filtering space <b>610</b> is filled, in use, with a filtration medium for filtering and removing toxic or otherwise harmful or undesirable substances from the water.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The filter device includes a pre-treatment arrangement <b>639</b> that includes a cover member <b>640</b>, a water treatment chamber <b>641</b> defined between cover member <b>640</b> and the upper wall <b>618</b>, holding a porous substrate <b>642</b> adapted to release iodine into the water. Porous substrate <b>642</b> may, for example, be in the form of a sponge which may be made out of polyurethane. The porous substrate has typically iodine sorbed therein and may be coated, for example by ethyl vinyl acetate coating, that is intended to provide some control of the release parameters and also to increase storage stability by inhibiting release of iodine during storage. The coating may, for example, be by spraying. The iodine has a disinfecting function in that it causes elimination of microorganisms from the water. Typically, the iodine will subsequently be absorbed by the filtration medium within filtering space <b>610</b>. As can be seen, cover member <b>640</b> has a plurality of openings <b>644</b> that permit water egress, which are typically covered by a fine net that permits water egress, on the one hand, and serves a number of functions, on the other hand, including filtering out particulate material and maintaining integrity of the porous substrate <b>642</b> kept below it. Filter device <b>600</b> also includes a filter status gauging device <b>650</b>, of the kind described in co-pending Patent Applications, Ser. Nos. 60/828,643 and 60/872,489, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Filter device <b>600</b> includes water inlets <b>622</b> in the form of annular openings throughout the periphery of the upper wall <b>618</b> to permit essentially uniform water inflow throughout the entire periphery of the filter. Annular openings <b>622</b> are also typically covered by a fine net. Filter device <b>600</b> also includes venting ports <b>634</b> for release of air-bubbles that may egress with the water. The venting ports <b>634</b> are formed at a level higher than the level of the water inlet <b>622</b> and are linked by a wall portion <b>635</b> that is sloped and ascending from the water inlet <b>622</b> to the venting ports <b>634</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Water inlets <b>622</b> open into a flow delay chamber <b>660</b>, defined at its bottom by a wall portion <b>662</b> including a circumferential opening <b>664</b> that is typically covered by a net element. In some embodiments of the invention, chamber <b>660</b> may be filled by a flow-delaying substrate, which may be porous substrate, fibrous substrate, a sponge, etc. In other embodiments, the flow-delaying function is embodied in the net that covers opening <b>664</b>. The flow delay chamber <b>660</b> functions to delay the water flow to allow time for the disinfecting action of iodine-releasing member <b>642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Included within the filtering space <b>610</b> are a first set of walls <b>612</b>A and <b>612</b>B, which are circular and concentric with the more peripheral wall <b>612</b>A having an apex, which is the higher elevation of the apex of wall <b>612</b>B, which surrounds water outlet <b>624</b>. The filtering space also includes a downwardly extending second wall <b>616</b>, the first and second walls jointly cause the water to assume a generally lateral albeit curvilinear flow path through the filter medium.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Fitted on circular wall <b>670</b>, downwardly extending from the bottom of the filter device <b>600</b>, around opening <b>624</b>, is a cap <b>672</b> that holds a ceramic filtering member <b>674</b> which, in accordance with a specific embodiment of the invention, is designed to filter out and thus remove metals, e.g. arsenic from the water. The filtering member <b>674</b> is porous, thus permitting water-flow therethrough. The bottom of cap <b>672</b> has large openings typically covered by a net to permit water flow therethrough. As can be seen, member <b>674</b> is pressed by cap <b>672</b> against O-rings <b>676</b>, accommodated in groove <b>678</b>, which provides a water-tight seal ensuring that water flows entirely through member <b>674</b>. Opening <b>624</b> is also typically covered by a net <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Reference is now being made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7D</figref>, which show a filter device <b>700</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. Filter <b>700</b> has a filter body <b>702</b> incorporating an integral venting arrangement <b>704</b> for venting a potable water reservoir (not shown) that is fitted to top face <b>706</b> of filter <b>700</b> (the face <b>706</b> is a top face in the state as shown herein; and becomes the bottom face of the filter when inverted during filtration). The filter includes a filter cover <b>708</b>, functionally similar to that of the filter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> that has a bottom face <b>709</b> on which the bottle (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>) can be made to stand when in its regular use mode (namely other than when filling water). The filter cover <b>708</b> has inward-facing threading <b>710</b> that engages with an outward-facing threading <b>712</b> on body <b>702</b>, and thus through turning can switch from a fully engaged or closed state, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, in which the upper rim <b>714</b> of cover <b>708</b> is tightly fitted against shoulder <b>716</b> and a partially opened state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> and a fully opened state (not shown) for filtering water. The filter cover <b>708</b> can accommodate a folded water receptacle (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>) in a manner similar to that of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Defined in filter body <b>702</b> is a filtering space <b>716</b> and included are water inlets <b>718</b>, venting ports <b>720</b>, flow delay chamber <b>722</b>, and a water outlet <b>724</b> fitted with a cap <b>726</b> that can hold a ceramic filtering member with a function similar to that of member <b>674</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. A pre-treatment arrangement <b>730</b> is provided having a similar function to pre-treatment arrangement <b>639</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Venting arrangement <b>707</b> has a main venting channel <b>734</b> with a first opening <b>736</b> that opens into the potable water reservoir (not shown) and a second opening <b>738</b> that can open to the exterior, as can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7C and 7D</figref>. An O-ring <b>740</b> has dual functions. On the one hand it serves to ensure a fluid-tight seal between the cover <b>708</b> and body <b>702</b> when in the closed state. On the other hand it serves a valve for second opening <b>738</b>. In the closed state O-ring <b>740</b> is compressed and seals opening <b>738</b>, as can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. When the cover is opened the O-ring <b>740</b> is relaxed and assumes a circular cross-sectional shape that permits air outflow, as represented by arrow <b>750</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, as a result of filling of the water reservoir with filtered, potable water.</p>
