<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-136045 filed on Jun. 15, 2010 including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a concave portion, a method for storing semiconductor device, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device and an apparatus manufacturing a semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since a semiconductor chip tends to change the properties thereof under the effect of temperature change or dusts, the chip is resin-shield and served for use. A step of resin sealing a semiconductor chip is performed by forming a semiconductor package by filling a resin in a die where a semiconductor chip is disposed and then pushing out the semiconductor package from the die by an ejector pin.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the step of sealing the semiconductor chip with the resin, resin burrs are sometimes formed to the periphery of an ejector pin trace formed in a semiconductor package. According to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei06(1994)-61284, it is described that an error is caused to an outer profile size of a semiconductor package. Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-073600 describes that the planarity of a semiconductor package becomes uneven in a baking step after resin sealing. They lead to failure of the quality of the semiconductor package. Then, it is extremely disadvantageous to perform operation of removing resin burrs after forming the semiconductor package in view of the operation steps. For solving the problems described above, there are techniques described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei06(1994)-61284 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-073600.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the techniques described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei06(1994)-61284 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-073600, a depression is formed at the periphery of a portion where an ejector pin presses the resin. It is described that the failure of the quality of the semiconductor package can be suppressed by forming resin burrs in the depression formed in the semiconductor package even without operation for removing the resin burrs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a case of storing semiconductor packages in stack, when resin burrs are present in the semiconductor package, flaws are formed to the surface of the semiconductor package to sometimes deteriorate the appearance on the surface of the semiconductor package. It may be considered to solve the problem by the techniques described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei06-61284 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-073600. On the other hand, decrease in the thickness is desired for the semiconductor package. The techniques described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei06-61284 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-073600 can be applied only to semiconductor packages having a thickness capable of ensuring the depth of the concave portion due to the trace of the ejector pin and the depth of the depression formed at the periphery of the trace of the ejector pin. Accordingly, this cannot be applied to a semiconductor package in which the thickness is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor device which includes:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">a semiconductor chip, and</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a lead frame where the semiconductor chip is mounted on a die pad, and</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a resin sealing the semiconductor chip and the die pad from an upper surface and a lower surface, and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">the resin has a first concave portion disposed at the surface, and a second concave portion situated inside the first concave portion in a plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the invention, the second concave portion disposed at the rearface of the semiconductor package is situated inside the first concave portion disposed at the surface of the semiconductor package in a plan view. Then, in a case of storing semiconductor packages in stack, resin burrs formed at the peripheral edge of the second concave portion disposed at the rearface of the semiconductor package situated on the upper side is situated inside the first concave portion of the semiconductor package on the lower side, the resin burrs are not in contact with the surface of the semiconductor package situated on the lower side. Accordingly, this can prevent flaws formed in the surface of the semiconductor package. Then, it may suffice that the semiconductor package has a thickness capable of ensuring the depth of the concave portion due to the trace of the ejector pin. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress deterioration of the appearance of the semiconductor package and decrease the thickness of the semiconductor package without performing an operation of removing the resin burrs after forming the semiconductor package.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of storing a semiconductor device in which the semiconductor device has a semiconductor chip, a lead frame where the semiconductor chip is mounted on a die pad, and a resin sealing the semiconductor chip and the die pad from an upper surface and a lower surface in which the resin has a first concave portion disposed at the surface and a second concave portion disposed at the rearface and situated inside the first concave portion in a plan view in which semiconductor devices are stacked to each other such that the second concave portion in the semiconductor device on the upper side is situated inside the first concave portion in the semiconductor device on the lower side in a plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing semiconductor device including the steps of arranging a lead frame where the semiconductor chip is mounted on a die pad in the cavity of a mold, filling a resin in the cavity and sealing the semiconductor chip and the die pad with the resin from an upper surface and a lower surface, and pushing out the lead frame from the die by a first ejector pin protruding from the upper surface of the cavity and a second ejector pin protruding from the bottom of the cavity, in which a portion of the second ejector pin pressing the resin is situated inside the portion of the first ejector pin pressing the resin in a plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor including a die for holding a lead frame where a semiconductor chip is mounted on a die pad in a cavity and sealing the semiconductor chip and the die pad with a resin from an upper surface and a lower surface, a first ejector pin protruding from the upper surface of the cavity, a second ejector pin protruding from the bottom of the cavity, in which a portion of the second ejector pin pressing the resin is situated inside a portion of the first ejector pin pressing the resin in a plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention, the appearance of the semiconductor package can be suppressed from being impaired and the semiconductor package can be decreased in the size even without performing an operation of removing the resin burrs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention is to be described by way of a preferred embodiment with reference to the drawings. Throughout the drawings, identical constituent elements carry the same reference numerals for which explanations are to be omitted optionally.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross sectional view showing a semiconductor package <b>100</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross section A-A&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to be described later. The semiconductor package <b>100</b> has a semiconductor chip <b>60</b>, a lead frame <b>50</b>, and a resin <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The semiconductor chip <b>60</b> is mounted on a die pad <b>52</b> of the lead frame <b>50</b>. The semiconductor chip <b>60</b> and the die pad <b>52</b> are sealed from an upper surface and a lower surface with the resin <b>10</b>. Lead terminals <b>54</b> extend to the outside of the resin <b>10</b>. The resin <b>10</b> has a concave portion <b>30</b> at an upper surface and a concave portion <b>40</b> at a rearface. The concave portion <b>30</b> is formed by an ejector pin <b>320</b> to be described later. The concave portion <b>40</b> is formed by an ejector <b>340</b> to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view showing the semiconductor package <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The concave portion <b>40</b> is situated inside the concave portion <b>30</b> in a plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view showing a method of storing the semiconductor package <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the method of the storing semiconductor package <b>100</b>, multiple semiconductor packages <b>100</b> are stored on the unit of frame where the lead frames <b>50</b> are contiguous with each other, and multiple frames are stored in stack. Further, the semiconductor packages <b>100</b> are stored in stack. As described above, the concave portion <b>40</b> is situated inside the concave portion <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the concave portion <b>40</b> disposed at the rearface of the semiconductor package is situated inside the concave portion <b>30</b> disposed at the surface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> on the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional view showing an apparatus for manufacturing the semiconductor package <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The manufacturing apparatus has an upper die <b>300</b>, a lower die <b>310</b>, an ejector pin <b>320</b>, and an ejector pin <b>340</b>. The upper die <b>300</b> and the lower die <b>310</b> are stacked to each other to form a cavity <b>360</b>. The upper die <b>300</b> has a through hole <b>370</b> above the cavity <b>360</b>. The lower die <b>310</b> has a through hole <b>380</b> below the cavity <b>360</b>. The ejector pin <b>320</b> can protrude from the inside of the through hole <b>370</b> to the inside of the cavity <b>360</b>. Further, the ejector pin <b>340</b> can protrude from the inside of the through hole <b>380</b> to the inside of the cavity <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross sectional view showing a method of manufacturing the semiconductor apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At first, a lead frame <b>50</b> in which a semiconductor chip <b>60</b> is mounted on a die pad <b>52</b> is disposed in a cavity <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Then, the inside of the cavity <b>60</b> is filled with a resin <b>10</b> in a state of slightly producing an ejector pin <b>320</b> from the upper surface of the cavity <b>360</b> and slight projecting an ejector pin <b>340</b> from the lower surface of the cavity <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Thus, the semiconductor package <b>100</b> is molded in the cavity <b>360</b>. In this case, a concave portion <b>30</b> is formed at the surface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> by the ejector pin <b>320</b> protruding from the upper surface of the cavity <b>360</b>. In the same manner, a concave portion <b>40</b> is formed at the rearface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> and the concave portion <b>30</b> is formed at the surface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> by the ejector pin <b>340</b> protruding from the lower surface of the cavity <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Then, the surface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> is pushed by the ejector pin <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). Thus, the semiconductor package <b>100</b> is separated from an upper die <b>300</b>. Further, the rearface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> is pushed by the ejector pin <b>340</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>). Thus, the semiconductor package <b>100</b> is separated from the lower die <b>310</b>. Resin burrs (not illustrated) are formed at the peripheral edge of the concave portion <b>30</b> and the concave portion <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the semiconductor package <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The cross sectional view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the semiconductor package <b>100</b> after bending lead terminals <b>54</b>. The lead terminals <b>54</b> of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> are bent toward a mounting surface upon mounting to a mounting substrate. That is, the rearface provided with the concave portion <b>40</b> is a mounting surface. Further, the surface provided with the concave portion <b>30</b> is a surface to be sealed and imprinted, at a portion not overlapping the concave portion <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The function and the effect of this embodiment are to be described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor package <b>200</b> according to a comparative example which corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. According to the comparative example, a concave portion <b>40</b> disposed to a semiconductor package <b>200</b> is not situates inside the concave portion <b>30</b> in a plan view. Therefore, when semiconductor packages <b>200</b> are stacked to each other, resin burrs formed at the peripheral edge of the concave portion <b>40</b> disposed at the rearface of the semiconductor package <b>200</b> situated on the upper side do not situate inside the concave portion <b>30</b> disposed at the surface of the semiconductor package <b>200</b> situated on the lower side and are in contact with the surface of the semiconductor package <b>200</b> situated on the lower side. This results in occurrence of flaws to the surface of the semiconductor package <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the contrary, according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the concave portion <b>40</b> formed in the semiconductor package <b>100</b> is situated inside the concave portion <b>30</b> in a plan view. Therefore, when the semiconductor packages <b>100</b> are stored being stacked to each other, resin burrs formed at the peripheral edge of the concave portion <b>40</b> disposed at the rearface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> situated on the upper side situate inside the concave portion <b>30</b> disposed at the surface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> situated on the lower side and are not in contact with the surface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> situated on the lower side. Accordingly, this can prevent flaws from being formed to the surface of the semiconductor package <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Then, it may suffice that the semiconductor package <b>100</b> has such a thickness as capable of ensuring the depth of the concave portion <b>30</b> and the concave portion <b>40</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the appearance from being impaired at the surface of the semiconductor package and decrease the thickness of the semiconductor package without performing the operation of removing the resin burrs after molding of the semiconductor package. Further, since the flaws can be suppressed from being formed at the surface of the semiconductor package as the surface to be sealed, the recognizability of information imprinted to the semiconductor package can be kept favorably. Further, it is not necessary to extend the concaved portion to more than the depression formed by the ejector pin, which can suppress narrowing of the surface to be imprinted.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been described with reference to the drawings, this is an example of the invention and various other constitutions than those described above can be adopted.</p>
