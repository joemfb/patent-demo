<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">When a vehicle electric power source is turned on, and when a target mode position is other than a parking (P)-mode position and a driving (D)-mode position or the target mode position is unfixed, a shift-by-wire electronic control unit (SBW-ECU) does not drive the actuator so that the current actual mode position is maintained. The SBW-ECU accepts only the driver's requirement for changing the mode position to the P-mode position or the D-mode position. When it is required to change the mode position to the P-mode position, a first position learning portion learns a first reference position. When it is required to change the mode position to the D-mode position, a second position learning portion learns a second reference position.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a shift-by-wire system which changes a shift gear of an automatic transmission for a vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a technical field of a vehicle control, a by-wire system has been implemented. The by-wire system has a by-wire control circuit which electrically controls actuators driving components of a vehicle according to a command of a driver of the vehicle. For example, a shift-by-wire system is well known. The shift-by-wire system changes a shift gear of an automatic transmission according to a command of a driver. The shift-by-wire system has an electric actuator which drives a gear mechanism of the automatic transmission to change the shift gear. The electric actuator has a high-speed motor and a reduction gear which reduces the speed of the motor. In a case that a brushless motor, such as a switched reluctance (SR) motor, is employed as the high-speed motor, an incremental type encoder is generally provided to the actuator to output pulse signals according to a rotational position of the motor. The encoder realizes an optimal magnetization energization control of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to drive the gear mechanism of the automatic transmission accurately, it is necessary to detect an absolute rotational position of an output shaft of the reduction gear and to drive the actuator based on the detected absolute rotational position. A linear output sensor or an absolute type encoder is provided at a vicinity of the output shaft to detect the absolute rotational position. Alternatively, a neutral switch is provided on the output shaft. Also, an absolute type encoder which can detect a lot of rotations can be provided on the motor to detect the absolute rotational position of the output shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a linear output sensor and an absolute type encoder have disadvantage in their reliability and durability. Even if the linear output sensor and the absolute type encoder can detect the rotational position of the output shaft, a rotational angle of the output shaft can not be detected. Thus, the linear output sensor and the absolute type encoder are not desirable for the shift-by-wire system in view of fail-safe. Further, the absolute type encoder has complicated structure and is expensive. Also, the linear output sensor is relatively expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent No. 4248290 (US-2006-0207373A1), which will be referred to as Patent Document 1 hereinafter, shows a shift-by-wire system in which a shift gear is changed between a parking (P)-mode position and non-parking (non-P)-mode position. In this shift-by-wire system, only an incremental type encoder for magnetization energization control of the motor is employed to learn a reference position corresponding to an absolute position of the output shaft of the actuator. Based on the learned reference position and a predetermined rotational quantity, the absolute value of the output shaft is established and detected. By employing the increment type encoder to detect the absolute position of the output shaft, manufacturing cost of the system can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, in the shift-by-wire system shown in Patent Document 1, when an electric power source of the vehicle is turned on, a reference position is learned, which corresponds to at least one of the P-mode position and the non-P-mode position. According to a vehicle condition, such as vehicle speed, of when the power source is turned on, it is determined which reference position of the P-mode position or the non-P-mode position is learned. Thereby, even when the electric power source is turned on immediately after the power source is momentarily turned off, the vehicle can be safely controlled under an ordinal control condition promptly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the shift-by-wire system shown in Patent Document 1, it is assumed that the automatic transmission has two mode positions (P-mode position and non-P-mode position). Thus, if this shift-by-wire system is applied to an automatic transmission having four mode positions, such as a parking (P)-mode position, a reverse (R)-mode position, a neutral (N)-mode position, and a drive (D)-mode position, it is likely that various problems will occur. For example, if the electric power source is momentarily turned off and then the power source is turned on when the actual mode position is the N-mode position, the mode position is brought into the D-mode position or the P-mode position by the learning control. Thus, the vehicle suddenly runs or stops, which may make the driver anxious. Also, if the electric power source is momentarily turned off and then the power source is turned on when the actual mode position is the R-mode position, the mode position is brought into the D-mode position or the P-mode position by the learning control. Thus, the vehicle suddenly runs forward or stops, which may make the driver anxious.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is made in view of the above matters, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a shift-by-wire system which can be safely recovered to a normal control condition even after an electric power supply of a vehicle is momentarily turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, a shift-by-wire system changes a mode position of the automatic transmission of a vehicle according to a signal of a shift selector manipulated by a driver of the vehicle. The shift-by-wire system is provided with an actuator, a detent plate, a detent spring and a control portion. The actuator includes an electric motor, an incremental type encoder outputting a pulse signal according to a rotation of the motor, and a reduction gear reducing the rotation of the motor and outputting the reduced rotation. The detent plate is connected to the reduction gear so as to be rotated by the actuator. Further, the detent plate has a first end concave portion, a second end concave portion, and a plurality of middle concave position. The first end concave portion is formed at one end of the detent plate in its rotational direction. The second end concave portion is formed at the other end of the detent plate in its rotational direction. The middle concave portions are formed between the first end concave portion and the second end concave portion. The detent spring has a regulating portion which can be engaged with one of the first end concave portion, the middle concave portions, and the second end concave portion to regulate a rotation of the detent plate so that the mode position of the automatic transmission is fixed. The control portion defines a target mode position based on the signal of the shift selector and drives the actuator so that the mode position of the automatic transmission is brought into the target mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first end concave portion corresponds to a parking-mode position of the automatic transmission. The first end concave portion has a first wall. The second end concave portion corresponds to a position for driving a vehicle forward and defines a second wall. The middle concave portions correspond to at least a reverse-mode position and a neutral-mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The control portion includes a first position learning portion and a second position learning portion. The first position learning portion drives the motor in a direction in which the regulating portion is brought into contact with the first wall, and learns a first reference position of the actuator corresponding to the parking-mode position when it is detected that a maximum value or a minimum value of a count number of the pulse signal outputted from the encoder does not change for a specified time period. The second position learning portion drives the motor in a direction in which the regulating portion is brought into contact with the second wall, and learns a second reference position of the actuator corresponding to the drive-mode position when it is detected that the maximum value or the minimum value of the count number of the pulse signal outputted from the encoder does not change for a specified time period.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rotational position of the actuator with respect to each mode position is computed based on previously stored specified values and the stored first and second reference positions. The actuator is driven to the computed rotational position, whereby the actual mode position is changed to the desired mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is the P-mode position and then the target mode position is the P-mode position when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. Usually, when the actual mode position is the P-mode position, it is assumed that the vehicle is stopped. Therefore, even though the learning of the first reference position is started after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the actual mode position is kept at the P-mode position, whereby the first reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is the D-mode position and then the target mode position is the D-mode position when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the second position learning portion learns the second reference position. When the actual mode position is the D-mode position, it is assumed that the vehicle is running. Thus, even though the learning of the second reference position is started after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the actual mode position is kept at the D-mode position, whereby the second reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is other than the P-mode position and the D-mode position, and then the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, if the target mode position is other than the P-mode position and the D-mode position or the target mode position is unfixed, the control portion does not drive the actuator <b>30</b> so that the current actual mode position is maintained. The control portion accepts only the driver's requirement for changing the mode position to the P-mode position or the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion. When it is required to change the mode position to the P-mode position, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. When it is required to change the mode position to the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion, the second position learning portion learns the second reference position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the above configuration, when the actual mode position of before the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off is other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion, the actual mode position of before the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off is maintained without learning the first reference position and the second reference position. Thus, in the automatic transmission, even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the N-mode position, the actual mode position is maintained at the N-mode position even after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on. Therefore, it can be avoided that an unintentional reverse torque is generated when the actual mode position is changed to the P-mode position through the R-mode position so as to learn the first reference position. It can be avoided that the parking lock mechanism is damaged or the vehicle is suddenly stopped due to a sudden mode position change into the P-mode position while the vehicle is running. When the second reference position is learned, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the unintentional forward torque is generated. Furthermore, when the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the R-mode position, the actual mode position is maintained at the R-mode position even after the vehicle electric power is turned on. Thus, it can be avoided that the vehicle is suddenly stopped when the actual mode position is changed to the P-mode position so as to learn the first reference position. Also, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the vehicle runs forward unintentionally.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described above, according to the shift-by-wire system of the present invention, even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the normal control can be safely recovered. Further, according to the present invention, since the incremental type encoder is employed to detect the rotational position of the actuator, the configuration of the system can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect of the present invention, the shift-by-wire system is provided with an actuator, a detent plate, a detent spring, a control portion and a torque control portion. The actuator includes an electric motor, an incremental type encoder outputting a pulse signal according to a rotation of the motor, and a reduction gear reducing the rotation of the motor and outputting the reduced rotation. The detent plate is connected to the reduction gear so as to be rotated by the actuator. Further, the detent plate has a first end concave portion, a second end concave portion, and a plurality of middle concave position. The first end concave portion is formed at one end of the detent plate in its rotational direction. The second end concave portion is formed at the other end of the detent plate in its rotational direction. The middle concave portions are formed between the first end concave portion and the second end concave portion. The detent spring has a regulating portion which can be engaged with one of the first end concave portion, the middle concave portions, and the second end concave portion to regulate a rotation of the detent plate so that the mode position of the automatic transmission is fixed. The control portion defines a target mode position based on the signal of the shift selector and drives the actuator so that the mode position of the automatic transmission is brought into the target mode position. The torque control portion can intercept or reduce the transmission of a driving torque to a wheel of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first end concave portion corresponds to a parking-mode position of the automatic transmission. The first end concave portion has a first wall. The second end concave portion corresponds to a position for driving a vehicle forward and defines a second wall. The second end concave portion has a second wall. The middle concave portions correspond to at least a reverse-mode position and a neutral-mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The control portion includes a first position learning portion, a second position learning portion and a power source determining portion. The first position learning portion drives the motor in a direction in which the regulating portion is brought into contact with the first wall, and learns a first reference position of the actuator corresponding to the parking-mode position when it is detected that a maximum value or a minimum value of a count number of the pulse signal outputted from the encoder does not change for a specified time period. The second position learning portion drives the motor in a direction in which the regulating portion is brought into contact with the second wall, and learns a second reference position of the actuator corresponding to the driving-mode position when it is detected that a maximum value or a minimum value of a count number of the pulse signal outputted from the encoder does not change for a specified time period.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The control portion computes a rotational position of the actuator with respect to each mode position based on the stored specified values and the stored first and second reference positions. The actuator is driven to the computed rotational position, whereby the actual mode position is changed to the desired mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The power source determining portion determines whether the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is intentionally turned on by a driver or the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is automatically turned on after momentarily turned off without respect to the driver's intension.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is intentionally turned on by a driver, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. Usually, when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is intentionally turned on, the actual mode position is the parking-mode position and it is assumed that the vehicle is stopped. Therefore, even though the learning of the first reference position is started after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the actual mode position is kept at the parking-mode position, whereby the first reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed. Further, in a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is unintentionally turned off while the actual mode position is other than the parking-mode range and then the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is intentionally turned on by a driver, even if the learning of the first reference position is started and the wheels are locked, there is no problem because the vehicle is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Meanwhile, when it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after momentarily turned off, the torque control portion intercepts the transmission of the driving torque and makes impossible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position. At least one of the first reference position and the second reference position is learned, subsequently the mode position is changed to the specified mode position and it is made possible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the above configuration, after the torque control portion intercepts or reduces the transmission of the driving torque and it is made impossible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position, the leaning of at least one of the first or the second reference position is executed. Thus, in the automatic transmission <b>20</b> having four mode positions, for example, if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the neutral-mode position, the driving torque transmission to the wheels is intercepted or reduced. Thus, it can be avoided that an unintentional reverse torque is generated when the actual mode position is changed to the P-mode position through the R-mode position so as to learn the first reference position. Further, when the second reference position is learned, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the unintentional forward torque is generated. Furthermore, when the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the reverse-mode position, the torque transmission to the wheels is intercepted or reduced, whereby it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the vehicle runs forward unintentionally.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As above, according to the shift-by-wire system of the present invention, even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentary turned off, the normal control can be safely recovered. Further, according to the present invention, since the incremental type encoder is employed to detect the rotational position of the actuator, the configuration of the system can be simplified.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control portion computes a rotational position of the actuator with respect to each mode position based on a previously stored specified value and the first reference position. Then, the actuator is driven so that its rotational position agrees with the computed rotational position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The power source determining portion determines whether a driver intentionally turns off an ignition switch and then turns on the ignition switch again or the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off without respect to the driver's intension and then automatically turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is intentionally turned on by a driver, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after momentarily turned off, the control portion indicates to the driver that the vehicle should be stopped and the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off when the mode position is changed.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, according to the present embodiment, in a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is the P-mode position and then the target mode position is the P-mode position when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. Usually, when the actual mode position is the P-mode position, it is assumed that the vehicle is stopped. Therefore, even though the learning of the first reference position is started after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the actual mode position is kept at the P-mode position, whereby the first reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, in a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is the D-mode position and then the target mode position is the D-mode position when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the second position learning portion learns the second reference position. Usually, when the actual mode position is the D-mode position, it is assumed that the vehicle is running. Therefore, even though the learning of the second reference position is started after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the actual mode position is kept at the D-mode position, whereby the second reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Further, when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off at the time when the actual mode position is other than the P-mode position or the D-mode position and then the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, and when the target mode position is other than the P-mode position and the D-mode position or the target mode position is unfixed, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> does not drive the actuator <b>30</b> so that the current actual mode position is maintained. The SBW-ECU <b>13</b> accepts only the driver's requirement for changing the mode position to the P-mode position or the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position). When it is required to change the mode position to the P-mode position, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. When it is required to change the mode position to the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position), the second position learning portion learns the second reference position.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to the above configuration, when the actual mode position of before the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off is other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position), or when the actual mode position is unfixed, the actual mode position of before the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off is maintained without learning the first reference position and the second reference position. Thus, in the automatic transmission <b>20</b> having four mode positions, for example, even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the N-mode position, the actual mode position is maintained at the N-mode position even after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, whereby following matters can be avoided. That is, it can be avoided that an unintentional reverse torque is generated when the actual mode position is changed to the P-mode position through the R-mode position so as to learn the first reference position. It can be avoided that the parking lock mechanism <b>70</b> is damaged or the vehicle is suddenly stopped due to a sudden mode position change into the P-mode position while the vehicle is running. When the second reference position is learned, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the unintentional forward torque is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Furthermore, when the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the R-mode position, the actual mode position is maintained at the R-mode position even after the vehicle electric power is turned on, whereby it can be avoided that the vehicle is suddenly stopped when the actual mode position is changed to the P-mode position so as to learn the first reference position. Also, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the vehicle runs forward unintentionally.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As described above, according to the shift-by-wire system <b>3</b> of the present embodiment, even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the normal control can be safely recovered. Further, according to the present embodiment, since the incremental type encoder <b>34</b> is employed to detect the rotational position of the actuator <b>30</b>, the configuration of the system <b>3</b> can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a notification portion which notifies the driver of the situation where the mode position can be changed into only the P-mode position or the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position). In a case that the target mode position is other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position) or the target mode position is unfixed when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the actual mode position can be changed into only the P-mode position or the mode position corresponding to the second concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position). At this time, since the notification portion notifies the driver of the situation where the mode position can be changed into only the P-mode position or the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position), it can be avoided that the driver is confused.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, when it is required to change the mode position into other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position), the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as the warning portion which notifies the driver of the situation where the mode position can not be changed into other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position). When the target mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on is other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position), or when the target mode position is unfixed, the actual mode position can be changed into only the P-mode position or the mode position corresponding to the second concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position). At this moment, if the drive requests to change the mode position into other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position), the warning portion notifies the driver of the situation where the mode position can not be changed into other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>64</b> (D-mode position), whereby it can be avoided that the driver is confused.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Also, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a memory portion and a target mode position establishing determining portion. The memory portion stores the condition of the actuator <b>30</b> and the actual mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off. In a case that the actuator <b>30</b> is at the stop condition when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the target mode position establishing portion sets the actual mode position stored in the memory portion as the target mode position. In a case that the actuator <b>30</b> is at the operated condition, the target mode position is established as &#x201c;unfixed&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to the present embodiment, since the target mode position establishing portion establishes the target mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on according to the condition of the actuator of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is different from the target mode position when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off while the mode position is changing.</p>

The first to the fourth middle concave portion <b>72</b> to <b>75</b> are positioned between the first end concave portion <b>71</b> and the second end concave portion <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">According to the present embodiment, the first end concave portion <b>71</b> is formed in such a manner as to correspond to the P-mode position of the automatic transmission <b>20</b>.

The first middle concave portion <b>72</b> is formed in such a manner as to correspond to the R-mode position of the automatic transmission <b>20</b>.

The second end concave portion <b>76</b> has a second wall <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As above, the automatic transmission <b>20</b> has the P-mode position, the R-mode position, the N-mode position, the D-mode position, the second-D-mode position, and the Low-D-mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the mode position is changed from the P-mode to the L-mode, the rotational direction of the reduction gear <b>33</b> is defined as a normal direction.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rotatable range of the detent plate <b>57</b> is between a position where the detent roller <b>53</b> is in contact with the first wall <b>77</b> and a position where the detent roller <b>53</b> is in contact with the second wall <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A processing for learning the first reference position and the second reference position is the same as the first embodiment. That is, according to the second embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> learns the first and the second reference position of the actuator <b>30</b>, whereby the rotational position of the actuator <b>30</b> with respect to each mode position (P-mode, R-mode, N-mode, D-mode, Second-D-mode, Low-D-mode) is computed based on the stored first and second specified values and the stored first and second reference positions. The actuator <b>30</b> is driven to the computed rotational position, whereby the actual mode position is changed to the desired mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, in a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is the P-mode position and then the target mode position is the P-mode position when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. Usually, when the actual mode position is the P-mode position, it is assumed that the vehicle is stopped. Therefore, even though the learning of the first reference position is started after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the actual mode position is kept at the P-mode position, whereby the first reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, in a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is the Low-D-mode position and then the target mode position is the Low-D-mode position when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the second position learning portion learns the second reference position. Usually, when the actual mode position is the L-D-mode position, it is assumed that the vehicle is running. Therefore, even though the learning of the second reference position is started after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the actual mode position is kept at the Low-D-mode position, whereby the second reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off while the actual mode position is other than the P-mode position and the Low-D-mode position, and then the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, if the target mode position is other than the P-mode position and the Low-D-mode position or the target mode position is unfixed, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> does not drive the actuator <b>30</b> so that the current actual mode position is maintained.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">According to the above configuration, when the actual mode position of before the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off is other than the P-mode position and the mode position corresponding to the second end concave portion <b>76</b> (Low-D-mode position), or when the actual mode position is unfixed, the actual mode position of before the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off is maintained without learning the first reference position and the second reference position. Thus, in the automatic transmission <b>20</b> having six mode positions, for example, even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the N-mode position, the actual mode position is maintained at the N-mode position even after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, whereby following matters can be avoided.

Furthermore, when the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the R-mode position, the actual mode position is maintained at the R-mode position even after the vehicle electric power is turned on, whereby it can be avoided that the vehicle is suddenly stopped when the actual mode position is changed to the P-mode position so as to learn the first reference position.

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">When the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off in step S<b>1109</b>, the processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is terminated. The case in which the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off includes: the first case in which a driver intentionally turns off an ignition switch; and a second case in which the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off without respect to the driver's intension. Even though the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off in step S<b>1109</b>, the condition of the actuator <b>30</b>, the actual mode position and the information about vehicle electric power source (VEPS) stored in the memory portion <b>15</b> in steps S<b>1106</b> to S<b>1108</b> are not erased.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As explained above, according to the present embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> learns the first and the second reference position of the actuator <b>30</b>, whereby the rotational position of the actuator <b>30</b> with respect to each mode position (P-mode, R-mode, N-mode, D-mode) is computed based on the stored first and second specified values and the stored first and second reference positions. The actuator <b>30</b> is driven to the computed rotational position, whereby the actual mode position is changed to the desired mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Also, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a power source determining portion which determines whether the first case in which a driver intentionally turns off an ignition switch and then turns on the ignition switch again or the second case in which the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off without respect to the driver's intension and then automatically turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is intentionally turned on by a driver, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. Usually, in this case, it is assumed that the actual mode position is the P-mode position and the vehicle is stopped. Therefore, even though the learning of the first reference position is started at this moment, the actual mode position is kept at the P-mode position, whereby the first reference position can be learned safely and the normal control condition can be executed. Further, in a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is unintentionally turned off while the actual mode position is other than the P-mode range and then the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is intentionally turned on by a driver, even if the learning of the first reference position is started and the wheels are locked, there is no problem because the vehicle is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">According to the present embodiment, the system is provided with a torque control portion which can intercept a transmission of a driving torque from the engine to the wheels. When it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after unintentionally turned off, the torque control portion intercepts the transmission of the driving torque and makes impossible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position. And then, the first or the second position learning portion learns the first or the second reference position, and the mode position is changed to the specified mode position. At the same time, the interception of the torque transmission is canceled so as to make possible to receive the requirement for changing the mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">According to the above configuration, after the torque control portion intercepts the transmission of the driving torque and it is made impossible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position, the leaning of the first or the second reference position is executed. In the automatic transmission <b>20</b> having four mode positions, for example, if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the N-mode position, the driving torque transmission to the wheels is intercepted. Thus, it can be avoided that an unintentional reverse torque is generated when the actual mode position is changed to the P-mode position through the R-mode position so as to learn the first reference position. Further, when the second reference position is learned, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the unintentional forward torque is generated. Furthermore, when the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the R-mode position, the torque transmission to the wheels is intercepted, whereby it can be avoided that the actual mode position is brought into the D-mode position and the vehicle runs forward unintentionally.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As described above, according to the shift-by-wire system of the present embodiment, even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the normal control can be safely recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a first notification portion which notifies the driver of the situation where it is impossible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position. When it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after unintentionally turned off, a requirement for changing the mode position is unacceptable. At this time, since the first notification portion notifies the driver of the situation where it is impossible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position, it can be avoided that the driver is confused.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a warning portion which notifies the driver of the situation where it is impossible to change the mode position. When it is determined that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after unintentionally turned off, a requirement for changing the mode position is unacceptable. At this time, since the warning portion notifies the driver of the situation where it is impossible to change the mode position, it can be avoided that the driver is confused.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a second notification portion which notifies the driver of the situation where it becomes possible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position. After learning of the first or the second reference position, the second notification portion notifies the driver of the situation where it becomes possible to receive a requirement for changing the mode position, whereby a driver can be relieved earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Also, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as the torque control portion which shifts the transmission gear to the neutral mode position. Since the transmission gear mechanism is utilized as the torque control portion, an increase in manufacturing cost is restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Also, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a memory portion and a target mode position establishing determining portion. The memory portion stores the condition of the actuator <b>30</b> and the actual mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off. In a case that the actuator <b>30</b> is at the stop condition when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the target mode position establishing portion sets the actual mode position stored in the memory portion as the target mode position. In a case that the actuator <b>30</b> is at the operated condition, the target mode position is established as &#x201c;unfixed&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In a case that the established target mode position is other than &#x201c;unfixed&#x201d;, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> set the target mode position as the specified mode position. Thereby, the specified mode position to which the mode position is changed after the momentarily tuning off can be established promptly. Even if the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off, the condition of the vehicle is recovered promptly to the condition of before momentarily turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Meanwhile, in a case that the established target mode position is &#x201c;unfixed&#x201d;, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> sets the target mode position as the specified mode position. Until the target mode position is fixed, the actuator <b>30</b> is not driven so that the current actual mode position is maintained. Thus, it can be avoided that the actual mode position is different from the target mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to the present embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> determines whether the first reference position is learned or the second reference position is learned based on the target mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on. In a case that the target mode position is the P-mode position, the first position learning portion learns the first reference position. Meanwhile, in a case that the target mode position is other than the P-mode position, the second position learning portion learns the second reference position.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">According to the above configuration, in a case that the target mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on is the P-mode position, the second reference position is not learned and the first reference position is learned. Thus, it can be avoided that the parking lock is suddenly released while the vehicle is parked in the P-mode position. In a case that the target mode position of when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on is the R-mode position, the first reference position is not learned and the second reference position is learned. Thus, it can be avoided that the wheels are suddenly locked while the vehicle is running in the R-mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As above, the first reference position and the second reference position can be safely learned.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Further according to the present embodiment, when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> determines the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after unintentionally turned off. At this time, if the target mode position is the D-mode position, the transmission of the driving torque to the wheel is not intercepted. In a case that the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is momentarily turned off while the actual mode position is the D-mode position, the transmission of the driving torque to the wheel is not intercepted. Thus, while the vehicle is running in the D-mode position, a momentary torque interception does not occur and the reference mode position can be learned.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In performing the above described learning processing of the reference position of the actuator <b>30</b>, the detent plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be also employed. The configuration of the detent plate is different from that in the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Other Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">A throttle valve which adjusts the intake air flow rate can be used as the torque control portion. The throttle valve can reduce the transmission of the driving torque to the wheels. In a case that the driving torque is generated by an electric driving motor (an electric vehicle, a hybrid vehicle), a control switch for supplying electricity to the driving motor can be used as the torque control portion.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the above embodiment, when the target mode position is the P-mode position, the first reference position is learned. When the target mode position is other than the P-mode position, the second reference position is learned. Meanwhile, based on the mode position other than the P-mode position, it can be determined whether the first reference position is learned or the second reference position is learned.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In the above embodiment, when the target mode position is the P-mode position, only the first reference position is learned. Meanwhile, in addition to the first reference position, the second reference position may be learned, whereby the actuator <b>30</b> can be controlled more precisely. Since the driving torque to the wheel is intercepted or reduced by the torque control portion when the target mode position is the P-mode position, the second reference position can be learned safely even when the actual mode position is the p-mode position. It should be noted that it is unsafe to learn the first reference position while the vehicle is running. Thus, the first reference position should be learned after it is confirmed that the vehicle is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">When the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on after the momentarily turned off, the torque control portion may always intercepts the torque transmission to learn the first reference position and the second reference position.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In a fourth embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> learns the reference rotational position of the actuator <b>30</b> which corresponds to the P-mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Also, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> can detect the actual mode position indirectly by performing a computation based on the reference rotational position, the specified rotational quantity and the count number of the pulse signals outputted from the encoder <b>34</b>. In the present embodiment, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> indicates the detected actual mode position on a display <b>47</b> through the integrated ECU <b>10</b>. Thus, the driver can recognize the current actual mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In the present embodiment, when the center of the detent roller <b>53</b> is positioned in each concave portion <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>, the actual mode position can be detected based on the rotational position of the motor <b>32</b>. The learning processing of the reference position of the actuator <b>30</b> will be described</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In the present embodiment, it is assumed that a first reference position is learned as the reference position of the actuator <b>30</b>. The first reference position corresponds to a rotational position at which the detent roller <b>53</b> is in contact with the first wall <b>65</b>. This position corresponds to the P-mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">When the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> performs a learning of the first reference position, the actuator <b>30</b> is driven in the reverse direction until the detent roller <b>53</b> is brought into contact with the first wall <b>65</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a learning processing of the reference position of the actuator <b>30</b> by the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In step S<b>2101</b>, the vehicle control system <b>1</b> is energized when the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on. The case in which the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned on includes: a first case in which a driver stops a vehicle and intentionally turns off an ignition switch and then turns on the ignition switch; and a second case in which the vehicle electric power is momentarily turned off without respect to the driver's intension and then automatically turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In step S<b>2102</b>, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> determines whether it is the first case or the second case.

The SBW-ECU <b>13</b> and the memory portion <b>15</b> function as a power source determining portion. The processing for storing the information about vehicle electric power source (VEPS) condition will be described later in step S<b>2107</b>.</p>

Before the procedure proceeds to step S<b>2103</b> or S<b>2111</b>, the information about vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is erased.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In step S<b>2103</b>, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> executes an initial driving control of the actuator <b>30</b>, whereby the rotation of the actuator <b>30</b> is appropriately controlled. Then, the procedure proceeds to step S<b>2104</b> in which the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as a first position learning portion which learns a first reference position of the actuator <b>30</b>. Then, the procedure proceeds to step S<b>2105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In step S<b>2105</b>, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> executes a normal control of the shift-by-wire system <b>3</b> (actuator <b>30</b>).

Then, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> drives the actuator <b>30</b> so that the position of the actuator <b>30</b> is brought into the computed position. In the above normal control, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> functions as the target mode position determining portion which determines the target mode position based on the signal from the selector sensor <b>46</b>, a brake signal and a signal from the vehicle speed sensor <b>24</b>, and controls the actuator <b>30</b> so that the mode position of the automatic transmission <b>20</b> agrees with the determined target mode position.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In step S<b>2111</b>, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> and the integrated ECU <b>10</b> indicate to the driver through the display <b>47</b> that when the mode position is changed, the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) should be turned on after a vehicle is stopped and the vehicle electric power source (VEPS) is turned off once.

<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In step S<b>2111</b>, if the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> determines, based on the signal from the selector sensor <b>46</b>, that the driver requires to change the mode position, the driver is notified that it is unacceptable to change the mode position by means of the speaker <b>48</b> or the display <b>47</b>. It should be noted that the SBW-ECU <b>13</b>, the integrated ECU <b>10</b>, the speaker <b>48</b> and the display <b>47</b> function as a warning portion of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In S<b>2112</b>, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> determines whether a driver intentionally turns off the vehicle electric power source. Specifically, it is determined whether the driver stops a vehicle and turns off an ignition switch. When the answer is YES in step S<b>2112</b>, the procedure proceeds to step S<b>2113</b>. When the answer is NO in step S<b>2112</b>, the procedure goes back to step S<b>2111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In step S<b>2113</b>, the SBW-ECU <b>13</b> rotates the actuator <b>30</b> in a reverse direction until the count value of the pulse signals from the encoder <b>34</b> does no vary for a specified time period, whereby the actual mode position is changed into the P-mode position.</p>
