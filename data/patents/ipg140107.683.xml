<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to cooling systems and devices for use in connection with engines and similar heat-generating devices and, in particular, to a remote cooling system and arrangement for use in connection with charge-air cooled engines.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional charge-air cooling systems and arrangements used in connection with high horsepower engines include a two-stage system, where charge-air is cycled through a block mounted air-to-water charge-air cooler, and water is then cooled by a radiator. Such charge-air cooling systems are constructed as an integral part of the engine itself, as a packaged component from the engine manufacturer. Accordingly, such systems are not capable of deconstruction and use in connection with other applications and cooling systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ever increasing emission restrictions from the Environmental Protection Agency have forced manufacturers to design engines having reduced fossil fuel emissions, such as nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons, while increasing fuel economy. In order to stay ahead of emissions legislation while meeting performance expectations of their customers, engine designers have began using air-to-air charge cooling. Presently-designed engines, such as Tier II engines in the vehicle industry, utilize air-to-air charge-air cooling for inlet air from a turbocharger.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Outside of the vehicle manufacturing and production industry, engines are used in a variety of applications and fields. Certain engine installations, such as in the power generation industry, require remote and non-integral cooling systems. For example, such remote cooling systems are necessary when the engine is located within a building or structure, such as a basement, enclosed room or other structure, for preventing the engine from exposure to the environmental elements. In such an application, the use of a single-stage air-to-air cooling system, such as with Tier II or the newer Tier III type engines, is not possible, as it would require that the heat from the charge-air be transferred into the enclosed structure. Such a situation would not be practical, since the enclosed area would become heated, and this heat would require removal by some other means.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the enclosed structure application, another option would be to pipe or transfer the charge-air to the air-to-air charge-air cooling system. In this manner, the heat would be transferred to the environment exterior to the enclosed structure. However, such an arrangement is neither efficient nor practical. In particular, such a system would increase the internal air pressure drop and, thus, reduce the performance and efficiency of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to these limitations, the higher performance engines, such as the Tier II type of engine, cannot be used in the enclosed structure environment. Accordingly, the use of engines within the enclosed structure environment requires the use of traditional charge-air cooling systems that include a two-stage system wherein the cooling components are constructed as an integral part of the engine itself as a packaged component from the engine manufacturer. In addition to lower engine performance levels, these systems have additional disadvantages as discussed above.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cooling system that overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art. It is another object of the present invention to provide a cooling system for use in connection with an air-to-air charge-air engine. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a cooling system for use in connection with an engine installation, where the cooling system is remote from and not integral with the engine. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a cooling system that is useful in connection with an engine or other heat-generating device that is positioned in an enclosed structure. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a remote cooling system that does not significantly reduce efficiency or heat an internal environment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a cooling system for use in connection with a heat-generating device, such as a charge-air engine and the like. In particular, the cooling system of the present invention utilizes a high-efficiency local air-to-water charge-air cooling device that is located a predetermined distance from the engine and uses a secondary water loop to remove heat via a remote cooling device to an external environment. Such a unique arrangement provides a high performance engine that is generally cooled via an air-to-air charge-air (aftercooled) system to be utilized in an installation wherein the engine is located in an enclosed environment that would require a remote cooling system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structures and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. As used in the specification and the claims, the singular form of &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For purposes of the description hereinafter, spatial or directional terms shall relate to the invention as it is oriented in the drawing FIGS. However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative variations, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific components illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the invention. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics related to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The embodiment of the invention is a cooling system for use in connection with a variety of heat generating devices, such as a charge-air engine, that is typically cooled by an air-to-air cooling system, including a high performance/low emission Tier II or Tier III engine, but wherein the engine is in an enclosed environment and thus an air-to-air cooling system would be impractical for cooling the engine. As shown in the drawings, the embodiment of the invention includes a charge-air cooling device and a remote secondary cooling device, such as a radiator device, to cool and remove the heat generated by the engine. Neither the charge-air cooling device nor the secondary cooling device is attached to or integral with the engine; however, the charge-air cooling device and the secondary cooling device both effectively and efficiently cool the engine and transfer the heat from the engine to an outside environment.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, which show an overall remote cooling system, generally indicated as <b>10</b>, coupled with an engine <b>12</b>, such as a charge-air cooled engine, for cooling the turbocharged compressed air exiting the engine <b>12</b>. The cooling system <b>10</b> includes a charge-air cooler <b>14</b> located a predetermined distance from the engine. The charge-air cooler <b>14</b> is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> differ only in the number of side fins <b>49</b> on the charge-air cooler <b>14</b>. The number of side fins <b>49</b> can vary depending upon the internal pressure seen by the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> as the fins <b>49</b> act to increase the stiffness of the side member thereby increasing the durability of the charge-air cooler <b>14</b>. For example, less internal pressure would require fewer side fins <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The charge-air cooler comprises a fluid receiver, generally indicated as <b>16</b>, which receives turbocharged air from the engine <b>12</b>. This fluid receiver <b>16</b> comprises tubing <b>18</b>, as is well known in the art, coupled between an inlet <b>20</b> in the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> and an outlet <b>22</b> in the engine <b>12</b>. A heat exchanger <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is provided for cooling the turbocharged air received from the fluid receiver <b>16</b>. This heat exchanger <b>24</b> is in the form of an air-to-water heat exchanger discussed in detail below. A fluid return member, generally indicated as <b>26</b>, is provided for returning the cooled air to the engine <b>12</b>. This fluid return member <b>26</b> comprises tubing <b>28</b>, as is well known in the art, coupled between an outlet <b>30</b> in the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> and an inlet <b>32</b> in the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A secondary cooling device, such as a radiator <b>34</b>, provides heat transfer from the heat exchanger <b>24</b>, within the charge-air cooler <b>14</b>, to an external environment. The radiator <b>34</b> is mounted a predetermined distance from the charge-air cooler <b>14</b>, such as for example, outside of the enclosed environment on a roof <b>47</b> of the building as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Conventional tubing may be provided for cycling the heated liquid into the radiator via a tube <b>36</b> and a cooled liquid via a tube <b>38</b> back into the charge-air cooler <b>14</b>. An outlet <b>37</b> is provided in the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> for feeding the heated liquid out of the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> into tube <b>36</b> and an inlet <b>39</b> is provided in the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> for receiving the cooled liquid therein. An auxiliary pump <b>40</b> may be provided for pumping cooled liquid from the radiator <b>34</b> to the charge-air cooler <b>14</b>. The radiator <b>34</b> may further include means, such as tubing <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, for cycling jacket water coolant through the engine <b>12</b>. An engine pump <b>46</b> may be provided for pumping jacket water coolant from the radiator <b>34</b> to the engine <b>12</b>. An independent fluid pump can be used in a radiator aftercooled circuit to maintain the required gallons per minute for the charge-air cooling device <b>14</b>. This arrangement is used when the engine pump <b>46</b> is not present. The charge-air cooling device <b>14</b> and radiator <b>34</b> are sized, shaped and operated to maintain the appropriate cooling and flow requirements of the heat-generating device or the engine <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As discussed above, the present invention is directed to a remote cooling system that can be used to cool engines which are located in an enclosed environment. The invention is particularly suitable for use with engines that are typically cooled using an air-to-air cooling system, but because the engines are being positioned in an enclosed environment, air-to-air cooling of the engine is not feasible. For that reason, an air-to-water cooling system is being used to cool these types of engines. The air-to-water cooling system is not mounted directly on the engine block, but rather is a separate unit that is positioned a predetermined distance from the engine. An example of this design is shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> wherein the engine <b>12</b> is mounted on a sub-base <b>48</b> and the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> is mounted on this sub-base <b>48</b> at a predetermined distance away from the engine <b>12</b>. In another preferred and non-limiting embodiment, the charge-air cooling device can be mounted within 5 feet of the engine, within 20 feet of the engine or at whatever distance is necessary for a particular environment as long as the appropriate pressure drop requirements are maintained, which is typically no greater than 1 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>, which show the details of the charge-air cooler <b>14</b> for use with the remote cooling system <b>10</b>. The charge-air cooler <b>14</b> includes an air-to-water heat exchanger <b>24</b> that is discussed in further detail below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the heat exchanger <b>24</b> with a header <b>54</b> removed to show the plurality of tubes <b>50</b> for the air-to-water cooling system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A first preferred technique for attaching these tubes <b>50</b> to fins <b>52</b> of the heat exchanger <b>24</b> is by a mechanical attachment wherein the individual tubes <b>50</b> are mechanically expanded or balled into the fins <b>52</b> having similar hole geometry to provide the tube-to-fin connection. The ends of the tubes <b>50</b> may also be mechanically attached to the header <b>54</b> in this same manner. This expansion technique for constructing a heat exchanger is discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,151 to Young et al.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A second preferred technique for attaching the tubes <b>50</b> to the fins <b>52</b> of the heat exchanger <b>24</b> and for attaching the ends of the tubes <b>50</b> to the header <b>54</b> is a technique known as a CUPROBRAZE&#x2122; technique. CUPROBRAZE&#x2122; is a manufacturing process that is used to braze copper and brass at temperatures that are generally lower than normal brazing operations but do not exceed the softening temperatures of the components being joined. This process involves depositing a braze paste on the tubes or fins, which are then assembled and heated to a suitable brazing temperature. The paste used as the brazing compound is known as OKC 600, as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,294 to Rissanen and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,429,794 and 6,264,764 to Kamf et al. This compound contains binders and a metal braze alloy based on the CuSnNiP system, for example, about 75% copper, about 15% tin, about 5% nickel, and about 5% phosphorus. Other compounds and methods are being developed for use with the CUPROBRAZE&#x2122; technique. These compounds are the subject of U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,032,808 and 6,997,371 to Shabtay and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0283967 and 2006/0249559 to Panthofer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is noted that the heat exchanger <b>24</b> of the present invention is not limited to the tube-to-fin and tube-to-header attachment techniques discussed above. Other types of attachment techniques may be utilized for attachment of the tubes to the fins and the headers such as welding, soldering, adhesive and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">During the construction of the heat exchanging means <b>24</b> of the invention, it was determined that when utilizing the CUPROBRAZE&#x2122; process, it was necessary to add a small percentage of iron to the copper alloy tube to make it &#x201c;anneal resistant&#x201d;. In the application of the CUPROBRAZE&#x2122; process as it pertains to this invention, it is necessary to anneal the tube to get it to properly form into the correct shape and mechanically roll to the joint. It was found that the grain size of the material had to be increased at the tube end so that it did not &#x201c;work harden&#x201d; during transforming and prematurely fail due to cyclic fatigue in the end user application or during testing.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The air-to-water heat exchanger <b>24</b> can include a fin core constructed according to any known structure including a serpentine, square wave, corrugated fin or oval tube arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The air-to-water heat exchanger <b>24</b> can be constructed according to a first embodiment wherein the plurality of tubes <b>50</b> can be configured in a staggered arrangement, as shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This design is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 7,003,879 to Smith et al. This design enables an increase in the airflow around the tubes <b>50</b> and increases a web <b>56</b> in the header <b>54</b> around the tubes <b>50</b>. In this design the plurality of tubes <b>50</b> having an end configuration is arranged in a predetermined staggered array. The header <b>54</b> is provided with a predetermined number of openings <b>60</b> disposed in the predetermined staggered array corresponding to the plurality of tubes <b>50</b>. The header <b>54</b> is formed by identifying a direction of airflow, determining at least one of a row pitch and a tube pitch of the predetermined number of openings, and aligning at least one of the row pitch and the tube pitch with respect to the airflow. The plurality of tubes <b>50</b> is arranged such that the row pitch and tube pitch are spaced substantially identical. A securing system is provided for securing an end of each of the plurality of tubes <b>50</b> within a corresponding opening <b>60</b> in the header <b>54</b>. This securing system can be any process, e.g., mechanical, CUPROBRAZE&#x2122;, solder, and the like, as discussed in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A second embodiment for constructing the air-to-water heat exchanger <b>24</b> is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,036,570 to Korth et al. In this technique, an &#x201c;end-to-end&#x201d; or &#x201c;tube touching&#x201d; position of the tubes is used for the row spacing. This arrangement is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this technique, core structure of the heat exchanger comprises a plurality of tubes <b>50</b> having a predetermined end configuration, a header <b>54</b> having a number of openings <b>60</b> corresponding to the plurality of tubes such that the openings <b>60</b> are disposed in an end-to-end array and wherein the predetermined end configurations touch, and a securing system for securing an end of each of the plurality of tubes <b>50</b> into a corresponding one of the each of the openings <b>60</b> in the header <b>54</b>. This securing system can comprise any of the processes discussed in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although the invention has been described in detail for the purpose of illustration based on what is currently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but on the contrary, is intended to cover modifications and equivalent arrangements that are within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, it is to be understood that the present invention contemplates that, to the extent possible, one or more features of any embodiment can be combined with one or more features of any other embodiment.</p>
