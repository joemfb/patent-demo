<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to improved processes for preparing alkaloids. The processes generally avoid the isolation of intermediate compounds produced in the multi-step synthesis of the alkaloid.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Alkaloids are important pharmaceuticals that typically are used as analgesics or drug/alcohol cessation agents. Production of alkaloids generally proceeds through a number of synthetic steps, where each step requires isolation of the intermediate before the next synthetic step can be performed. Isolation becomes necessary for a number of reasons, including because byproducts of the reaction interfere with later synthetic steps which may lower the yield or halt the reaction altogether. Moreover, isolation of intermediates itself is an extra synthetic step that can lower the yield and efficiency of the total synthesis. The multi-step nature of the syntheses of the alkaloids described has limited their availability for commercial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need for routes to key alkaloids which do not require the isolation of intermediates.</p>

(a) Formation of a Compound Comprising Formula (V) from the Compound Comprising Formula (I)
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0050">In the first step of the process, the compound comprising Formula (I) is contacted with a ring forming agent to form a compound comprising Formula (V) through five-membered ring formation. Ring formation of the compound comprising Formula (I) forms a 4,5-epoxy ring in the core structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0051">(i) Reaction Mixture</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0052">The ring formation reaction comprises a ring forming agent chosen from orthoester reagents such as orthoformates or orthoacetates. Orthoformate compounds are of the general structure CH(OR<sup>17</sup>)<sub>3 </sub>and orthoacetates are of the general formula CCH<sub>3</sub>(OR<sup>17</sup>)<sub>3</sub>, wherein R<sup>17 </sup>groups are selected from hydrocarbyl groups. In an exemplary embodiment, R<sup>17 </sup>groups are independently chosen from methyl and ethyl. In another exemplary embodiment, the ring forming agent is trimethyl orthoformate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0053">The molar ratio of the compound comprising Formula (I) to the orthoester can and will vary. In some embodiments, the ratio of the compound comprising Formula (I) to the orthoester ranges from about 1:0.9 to about 1:4. In other embodiments, the ratio of the compound comprising Formula (I) to the orthoester is about 1:0.9, or about 1:1, or about 1:1.5, or about 1:2, or about 1:2.5, or about 1:3, or about 1:3.5. In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of the compound comprising Formula (I) to the orthoester is about 1:2.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0054">(ii) Proton Donor</p>
