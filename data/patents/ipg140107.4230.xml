<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to circuit boards, and particularly to a multilayer circuit board with an even current distribution and a higher current transmission efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical circuit board usually includes a plurality of conductive layers made of copper foil and a plurality of vias defined in the conductive layer to electrically connect the conductive layers. A voltage regulator module can provide electrical power to the circuit board by a plurality of power supply elements such as output choke coils. The power supply elements outputs current to an electronic element, such as a processor mounted to the circuit board by the vias and the conductive layers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the distribution of the vias arranged on the circuit board is irregular, current flowing through each via is different, that is the current distribution of the circuit board is uneven. Thus, the circuit board may be damaged by overheating in the areas with more current and have a shorter lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, because some vias have lower current flowing through them, the total number of the vias arranged on the circuit board may be needed to be large to enable the current transmission, which may increase impedance of the circuit board and lead to a lower current transmission efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a circuit board <b>100</b>, according to an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. The circuit board <b>100</b> includes an outer conductive layer <b>10</b>, a plurality of inner conductive layers <b>20</b>, a plurality of groups of vias <b>30</b>, a plurality of power supply elements <b>40</b>, and an electronic element <b>50</b>. The power supply elements <b>40</b> and the electronic element <b>50</b> are mounted to the circuit board <b>100</b>. The power supply elements <b>40</b> provide electrical power to the electronic element <b>50</b> through the conductive layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> and the vias <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The outer conductive layer <b>10</b> and the inner conductive layers <b>20</b> may be signal layers or power supply layers. The outer conductive layer <b>10</b> and the inner conductive layers <b>20</b> are metal, in this exemplary embodiment, the outer conductive layer <b>10</b> and the inner conductive layers <b>20</b> are copper foil layers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the vias <b>30</b> are defined through the outer conductive layer <b>10</b> and the inner conductive layers <b>20</b>. Each via <b>30</b> includes a through hole <b>31</b> and a conductive inner wall <b>33</b>. The conductive inner wall <b>33</b> is plated on an inner surface of each through hole <b>31</b>. Thus, the outer conductive layer <b>10</b> and the inner conductive layers <b>20</b> can be electrically connected by the conducive inner walls <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this exemplary embodiment, each group of vias <b>30</b> is arranged surrounding each power supply element <b>40</b> forming a current flowing region <b>60</b>. A shape of the current flowing region <b>60</b> corresponds to a profile of the power supply element <b>40</b>. In exemplary embodiment, the current flowing region <b>60</b> is rectangular. When the power supply elements <b>40</b> provide electrical power to the electronic element <b>50</b>, current is output into the current flowing region <b>60</b>. Then a first portion of the output current flows to the inner conductive layers <b>20</b> through the vias <b>30</b> to be input to the electronic element <b>50</b>, and a second portion of the output current flows into the electronic element <b>50</b> through the outer conductive layer <b>10</b>. Thus, the power supply elements <b>40</b> can provide electrical power to the electronic element <b>50</b> by the outer conductive layer <b>10</b>, the inner conductive layers <b>20</b>, and the vias <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The number of each group of vias <b>30</b> surrounded each power supply element <b>40</b> can be changed according to a value of the current output from each power supply element <b>40</b> and a maximum value of the current flowing through each via <b>30</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, when the value of the current output from each power supply element <b>200</b> is about 40 A, and the maximum current flowing through each via <b>30</b> is about 2.5 A, the number of each group of vias <b>30</b> is about twenty.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an exemplary embodiment, the electronic element <b>50</b> is a processor. A plurality of component holes <b>51</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is defined in the circuit board <b>100</b> corresponding to the electronic element <b>50</b>. Pins (not shown) of the electronic element <b>50</b> can be received in the component holes <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The structure of each component hole <b>51</b> is substantially similar to the vias <b>30</b>. The electronic element <b>50</b> is electrically connected to the conductive layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> by the component holes <b>51</b>. Therefore, the first portion of the current flowing through the inner conductive layers <b>20</b>, and the second portion of the current flowing through outer conductive layer <b>10</b> is converged at the component holes <b>51</b> on the outer conductive layer <b>10</b> and input into the electronic element <b>50</b> through the outer conductive layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The groups of vias <b>30</b> arranged surrounding each power supply element <b>40</b> have a regular distribution, and current flowing through each via has almost the same value. Thus, the circuit board can have even current distribution. In addition, because each via <b>30</b> is effectively used, the total number of the vias <b>30</b> can be reduced to obtain higher current transmission efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is believed that the exemplary embodiments and their advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments of the disclosure.</p>
