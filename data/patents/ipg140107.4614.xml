<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A transmitting apparatus and method transmits different modulated signals from a plurality of antennas, and employs a configuration that includes a modulation section that obtains a modulated signal by performing signal point mapping of transmit bits using a signal point arrangement that is divided into a plurality of signal point sets on the IQ plane, whereby the minimum distance between signal points within a signal point set is smaller than the minimum signal point distance between signal point sets; and an antenna that transmits a modulated signal obtained by the modulation section. A signal point generating apparatus generates a first and second symbols to be transmitted by first and second antennas, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a receiving apparatus that receives and demodulates modulated signals transmitted simultaneously from a plurality of antennas and a transmitting apparatus that transmits modulated signals simultaneously from a plurality of antennas.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hitherto, the technology disclosed in Non-Patent Document 1 has been known as a demodulation method using a plurality of antennas. The contents disclosed in this Non-Patent Document 1 are briefly described below using an accompanying drawing.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Radio section <b>6</b> executes predetermined radio processing such as frequency conversion and amplification on transmit signal A baseband signal <b>4</b> and transmit signal B baseband signal <b>5</b>, thereby obtaining a transmit signal A modulated signal <b>7</b> and transmit signal B modulated signal <b>8</b>, and supplies these signals to an antenna <b>9</b> and antenna <b>10</b> respectively.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">However, with the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, if 16QAM is performed by modulated signal generation section <b>3</b>, for example, when MLD is performed by maximum likelihood detection section <b>19</b>, it is necessary to find the Euclidian distances between 16&#xd7;16=256 candidate signal points and a received signal. Furthermore, if 64QAM is performed by modulated signal generation section <b>3</b>, when MLD is performed by maximum likelihood detection section <b>19</b>, it is necessary to find the Euclidian distances between 64&#xd7;64=4096 candidate signal points and a received signal. When detection is performed by means of such computations, while good reception quality (bit error rate performances) can certainly be achieved, there is a problem in that the computational complexity is large because of the large number of computations. As described above, this problem becomes more pronounced as the modulation M-ary number increases.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a receiving apparatus that can demodulate a plurality of modulated signals transmitted from a plurality of antennas with a comparatively small computational complexity and good bit error rate performances. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a transmitting apparatus that forms a transmit signal such that a received signal with good bit error rate performances can be obtained on the receiving side with a comparatively small computational complexity.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">A receiving apparatus of the present invention receives modulated signals transmitted from a transmitting apparatus that transmits different modulated signals from a plurality of antennas; and employs a configuration that includes: a channel fluctuation estimation section that finds a channel estimate of each modulated signal; a partial bit demodulation section that demodulates only some bits of a modulated signal using a detection method different from likelihood detection; a signal point reduction section that reduces the number of candidate signal points using demodulated partial bits and a channel estimate; and a likelihood detection section that performs likelihood detection using a reduced number of candidate signal points and a received baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">According to this configuration, since demodulation of only some bits is performed by the partial bit demodulation section using a detection method different from likelihood detection, partial bits can be obtained with a small amount of computation. Also, likelihood detection is performed by the likelihood detection section using a reduced number of candidate signal points so that the remaining bits can be found with a high degree of precision using a small amount of computation. As likelihood detection is performed on a partial basis in this way, a received digital signal with good bit error rate performances can be obtained while reducing the number of computations for finding Euclidian distances.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">A transmitting apparatus of the present invention transmits different modulated signals from a plurality of antennas, and employs a configuration that includes: a modulation section that obtains a modulated signal by performing signal point mapping of transmit bits using a signal point arrangement that is divided into a plurality of signal point sets on the IQ plane, and whereby the minimum distance between signal points within a signal point set is smaller than the minimum signal point distance between signal point sets; and an antenna that transmits a modulated signal obtained by the modulation section.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">According to this configuration, a bit common to signal points within a signal set can be determined easily and accurately on the receiving side. Thus, an extremely convenient transmit signal can be formed for a receiving apparatus for which demodulation of only some bits (partial bits) of a modulated signal is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">According to the present invention, a receiving apparatus can be realized that can demodulate a plurality of modulated signals transmitted from a plurality of antennas with a comparatively small computational complexity and good bit error rate performances. Also, a transmitting apparatus can be realized that forms a transmit signal such that a received signal with good bit error rate performances can be obtained on the receiving side with a comparatively small computational complexity.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> show the signal point arrangements and bit assignments of modulated signal A and modulated signal B when 16QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) is performed by modulation sections <b>102</b> and <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows the signal point arrangement and bit assignments of modulated signal A, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows the signal point arrangement and bit assignments of modulated signal B. For both modulated signal A and modulated signal B, 4 bits are assigned to one symbol. In this embodiment, for the sake of explanation, the 4 bits assigned to one symbol of modulated signal A are designated (Sa<b>0</b>, Sa<b>1</b>, Sa<b>2</b>, Sa<b>3</b>), and the 4 bits assigned to one symbol of modulated signal B are designated (Sb<b>0</b>, Sb<b>1</b>, Sb<b>2</b>, Sb<b>3</b>). That is to say, (Sa<b>0</b>, Sa<b>1</b>, Sa<b>2</b>, Sa<b>3</b>) and (Sb<b>0</b>, Sb<b>1</b>, Sb<b>2</b>, Sb<b>3</b>) can each have 16 values from (0, 0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1, 1).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">When modulated signal A and modulated signal B are 16QAM signals as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, there are 16&#xd7;16=256 signal points in a multiplexed received signal. Estimated signal points for these 256 signal points in the I-Q plane can be obtained from modulated signal A channel fluctuation signal <b>308</b> and modulated signal B channel fluctuation signal <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. An example of this signal point arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">Black dots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> indicate <b>256</b> estimated signal points. Reference code <b>701</b> indicates a signal point of despread baseband signal <b>306</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At this time, modulated signal A and modulated signal B decoding and detection can be performed by finding the signal point distances between the 256 estimated signal points and despread-baseband-signal signal point <b>701</b>, and seeking the estimated signal point with the smallest distance value. For example, reference code <b>702</b> indicates an estimated signal point for which (Sa<b>0</b>, Sa<b>1</b>, Sa<b>2</b>, Sa<b>3</b>, Sb<b>0</b>, Sb<b>1</b>, Sb<b>2</b>, Sb<b>3</b>) is (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), and in the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, reception point <b>701</b> is at the smallest distance from estimated signal point <b>702</b> among the 256 estimated signal points, enabling (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) to be obtained as the detection result.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">A drawback with performing detection in this way is that it is necessary to find the signal point distances between a reception point and all 256 estimated signal points, and therefore the computational complexity is extremely large. However, an advantage is that good reception quality (data with good bit error rate performances) can be obtained. On the other hand, a detection method in which the inverse matrix computation of the relational expression of Equation (1) is performed enables the computational complexity to be reduced, but has a drawback of poor bit error rate performances.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">Receiving apparatus <b>300</b> of this embodiment is configured based on the features of both these methods, enabling receive data of high quality (with good bit error rate performances) to be obtained with a small computational complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the detailed configuration of signal processing section <b>321</b>, which is a feature of receiving apparatus <b>300</b> of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">A separation section <b>507</b> has modulated signal A channel fluctuation signals <b>308</b> and <b>318</b>, modulated signal B channel fluctuation signals <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, and despread baseband signals <b>306</b> and <b>316</b> as input, and obtains estimated signals of transmit signals Txa(t) and Txb(t) by performing the inverse matrix computation of Equation (1). Separation section <b>507</b> sends thus obtained modulated signal A estimated baseband signal <b>508</b> to partial bit determination section <b>509</b>, and also sends modulated signal B estimated baseband signal <b>511</b> to partial bit determination section <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">Here, separation section <b>507</b> and partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> make up partial bit demodulation section <b>550</b> that demodulates only some bits of modulated signals A and B using a detection method different from likelihood detection. In this embodiment, a case is described in which Equation (1) inverse matrix computation is performed by separation section <b>507</b>, but a received signal in which a plurality of modulated signals are mixed together may also be separated into modulated signals A and B by performing MMSE computation, for example, the essential point being that only some bits of modulated signals A and B are demodulated using a detection method different from likelihood detection.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">The operation of partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> will now be explained. Partial bit determination section <b>509</b> and partial bit determination section <b>512</b> perform similar operations, with only the signals processed being different, and therefore the operation of partial bit determination section <b>509</b> for modulated signal A will be described here. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows the arrangement of the coordinates of the 16 signal points (symbols) of 16QAM. As can be seen, the 4 bits (Sa<b>0</b>, Sa<b>1</b>, Sa<b>2</b>, Sa<b>3</b>) making up one modulated signal A symbol can have a value from (0, 0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1, 1) according to the signal point location.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">Partial bit determination section <b>509</b> has modulated signal A estimated baseband signal <b>508</b> as input, determines Sa<b>0</b>=1 when modulated signal A estimated baseband signal <b>508</b> is present in area <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, Sa<b>0</b>=0 when present in area <b>2</b>, Sa<b>2</b>=1 when present in area <b>3</b>, Sa<b>2</b>=0 when present in area <b>4</b>, and Sa<b>3</b>=1 when present in area <b>5</b>, and outputs this information as modulated signal A determined partial bit information <b>510</b>. Partial bit determination section <b>512</b> has modulated signal B estimated baseband signal <b>511</b> as input, performs the same kind of operation as described above, and outputs modulated signal B determined partial bit information <b>513</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">The reason for setting the areas that determine 1 bit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is that 1 bit set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> from among Sa<b>0</b>, Sb<b>1</b>, Sa<b>2</b>, and Sa<b>3</b> has a higher probability of being correct than the remaining 3 bits. Therefore, if this 1 bit is determined, there is a low probability of degradation of reception quality in subsequent detection.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">Next, the operation of signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> will be explained. Signal point reduction section <b>514</b> has modulated signal A channel fluctuation estimation signal <b>318</b>, modulated signal B channel fluctuation estimation signal <b>320</b>, modulated signal A determined partial bit information <b>510</b>, and modulated signal B determined partial hit information <b>513</b> as input. If signal point reduction were not performed here, 256 signal point candidate points would be found from modulated signal A channel fluctuation estimation signal <b>318</b> and modulated signal B channel fluctuation estimation signal <b>320</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, in this embodiment, by using modulated signal A determined partial bit information <b>510</b> and modulated signal B determined partial bit information <b>513</b>, as described above, from bit-by-bit determination information (a total of 2 bits), only 8&#x2212;2=6 bits (64 signal points) are undetermined of the 8 bits (256 signal points).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">For example, assume that Sa<b>0</b>=1 information is input to signal point reduction section <b>514</b> as modulated signal A determined partial bit information <b>510</b>, and Sb<b>0</b>=0 information is input to signal point reduction section <b>514</b> as modulated signal B determined partial bit information <b>513</b>. Signal point reduction section <b>514</b> then eliminates signal points that do not have Sa<b>0</b>=1 and Sb<b>0</b>=0 values from among the 256 signal points (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). By this means, the number of candidate signal points can be reduced to 64, and signal point reduction section <b>514</b> outputs information of these 64 signal points as post-reduction signal point information <b>515</b>. Signal point reduction section <b>516</b> has modulated signal A channel fluctuation signal <b>308</b>, modulated signal B channel fluctuation signal <b>310</b>, modulated signal A determined partial bit information <b>510</b>, and modulated signal B determined partial bit information <b>513</b> as input, performs the same kind of operation as described above, and outputs post-reduction signal point information <b>517</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">A likelihood detection section <b>518</b> has despread baseband signals <b>306</b> and <b>316</b>, and post-reduction signal point information <b>515</b> and <b>517</b>, as input. Then the state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is obtained from post-reduction signal point information <b>515</b> and despread baseband signal <b>316</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, despread baseband signal <b>316</b> is the signal point indicated by reference code <b>701</b>, and post-reduction signal point information <b>515</b> comprises the 64 signal points indicated by black dots. Likelihood detection section <b>518</b> then finds the signal point distances between the 64 candidate signal points and despread-baseband-signal signal point <b>701</b>. That is to say, likelihood detection section <b>518</b> finds a branch metric. This is named branch metric X. Similarly, likelihood detection section <b>518</b> finds the signal point distances between the 64 candidate signal points and despread-baseband-signal signal point <b>701</b> from post-reduction signal point information <b>517</b> and despread baseband signal <b>306</b>. That is to say, likelihood detection section <b>518</b> finds a branch metric. This is named branch metric Y.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">Then likelihood detection section <b>518</b> finds the 8-bit sequence with the highest likelihood using branch metric X and branch metric Y, and outputs this as modulated signal A digital signal <b>322</b> and modulated signal B digital signal <b>323</b>. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, likelihood detection section <b>518</b> separates and outputs (in parallel) modulated signal A and modulated signal B digital signals <b>322</b> and <b>323</b>, but modulated signal A and modulated signal B digital signals may also be bundled and output (in series) as a single digital signal.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">Thus, according to this embodiment, by providing partial bit demodulation section <b>550</b> that determines partial bits from among a plurality of bits that make up one symbol of each modulated signal using a detection method different from likelihood detection, signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> that reduce the number of candidate signal points using the determined partial hits, and likelihood detection section <b>518</b> that obtains received digital signals <b>322</b> and <b>323</b> by performing likelihood detection based on the Euclidian distances between reduced candidate signal points and a reception point, a receiving apparatus <b>300</b> can be realized that enables bit error rate performances to be effectively improved with a comparatively small computational complexity. That is to say, as a reduced number of candidate signal points are used by likelihood detection section <b>518</b>, the number of computations for finding Euclidian distances is reduced, enabling the computational complexity to be decreased. Also, as partial bits found based on inverse matrix computation results are only bits unlikely to be erroneous, degradation of bit error rate performances due to inverse matrix computation can be greatly suppressed compared with a case in which likelihood decoding of all bits is performed based on inverse matrix computation results.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">(i) Another Sample Configuration of a Partial Bit Determination Section</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">In the above embodiment, a case has been described in which a reduction in the number of candidate signal points of a total of 2 bits is performed by signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> respectively by having bit determination performed one bit at a time by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b>. Here, a method and configuration will be described whereby a reduction in the number of candidate signal points of a total of 4 bits is performed by signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> respectively by having bit determination performed 2 bits at a time by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> show an example of a determination method for determining 2 bits by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Partial bit determination section <b>509</b> and partial bit determination section <b>512</b> perform similar operations, with only the signals processed being different, and therefore the operation of partial bit determination section <b>509</b> for modulated signal A will be described here. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows the arrangement of the coordinates of the 16 signal points (symbols) of 16QAM. As can be seen, the 4 bits (Sa<b>0</b>, Sa<b>1</b>, Sa<b>2</b>, Sa<b>3</b>) making up one modulated signal A symbol can have any value from (0, 0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1, 1) according to the signal point location.</p>

Partial bit determination section <b>512</b> has modulated signal B estimated baseband signal <b>511</b> as input, performs the same kind of operation as described above, and outputs modulated signal B determined partial bit information <b>513</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">The reason for setting the areas that determine 2 bits as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is that 2 bits set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> from among Sa<b>0</b>, Sb<b>1</b>, Sa<b>2</b>, and Sa<b>3</b> have a higher probability of being correct than the remaining 2 bits. Therefore, if these 2 bits are determined, there is a low probability of degradation of reception quality in subsequent detection.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">Signal point reduction section <b>514</b> performs candidate signal point reduction by carrying out the same kind of operations as described above. At this time, since modulated signal B determined partial bit information <b>513</b> is composed of 2 bits, only 8&#x2212;4=4 bits (16 signal points) are undetermined of the 8 bits (256 signal points). By this means, the number of candidate signal points can be reduced to 16. Information of these 16 signal points forms post-reduction signal point information. Therefore, branch metric calculation can be further reduced in likelihood detection section <b>518</b>, and the computational complexity can be further decreased. However, as the number of bits determined by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> increases, reception quality degrades.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0105">In this embodiment, a method of signal point arrangement in the I-Q plane is described that simplifies division in the case of 2-bit partial determination and greatly improves reception quality compared with Embodiment 1.

<p id="p-0106" num="0106">The general configurations of a transmitting apparatus and receiving apparatus are similar to those in Embodiment 1. Embodiment 2 differs from Embodiment 1 in the configuration of the modulation sections of the transmitting apparatus, and the configuration of the partial bit determination sections and signal point reduction sections of the receiving apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> shows a sample signal point arrangement by a transmitting apparatus of this embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows the partial bit determination method used by a receiving apparatus of this embodiment. That is to say, the kind of signal point mapping shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> is performed by modulation sections <b>102</b> and <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and modulation sections <b>1102</b> and <b>1112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Also, partial bits are determined by partial hit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by performing the kind of area division shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1513</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a modulation section of this embodiment takes 4 signal points as 1 set, and performs modulation processing (mapping) so that the distances between the 4 signal points in 1 set are small, but distances between sets are large. Also, a modulation section makes the distances between the 4 signal points in 1 set equal, and also makes the distances between sets equal. In this way, a modulation section arranges signal points so that an area can easily be divided into first through fourth quadrants.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">By this means, 2 bits that are common within a set composed of 4 signal points can easily be demodulated on the receiving side. That is to say, since distances between signal points in a set are small and signal point distances between sets are large, the set (quadrant) in which a reception point is included can be determined easily and accurately, enabling 2-bit partial determination to be performed easily and accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">Specifically, when a received baseband signal is present in area <b>1</b> in the I-Q plane shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the 2 bits Sa<b>0</b>=1 and Sa<b>2</b>=1 common to the 4 signal points of area <b>1</b> are determined to be partial bits; when a received baseband signal is present in area <b>2</b>, the 2 bits Sa<b>0</b>=0 and Sa<b>2</b>=1 common to the 4 signal points of area <b>2</b> are determined to be partial bits; when a received baseband signal is present in area <b>3</b>, the 2 bits Sa<b>0</b>=0 and Sa<b>2</b>=0 common to the 4 signal points of area <b>3</b> are determined to be partial bits; and when a received baseband signal is present in area <b>4</b>, the 2 bits Sa<b>0</b>=1 and Sa<b>2</b>=0 common to the 4 signal points of area <b>4</b> are determined to be partial bits.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">Partial bit determination section <b>509</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> outputs information of these determined 2 bits as modulated signal A determined partial bit information <b>510</b>. The same kind of processing is also performed for modulated signal B by partial bit determination section <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">Using the 4-bit information determined by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b>, signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> reduce the 256 candidate signal points to 16 candidate signal points as described above in Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">Thus, according to this embodiment, in modulation sections <b>102</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>1102</b>, and <b>1112</b> of transmitting apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>1100</b>, by performing signal point mapping of transmit bits whereby signal points are divided into a plurality of signal point sets on the IQ plane, and the minimum distance between signal points in a signal point set is made smaller than the minimum signal point distance between signal point sets, an effect can be obtained of enabling partial bit determination to be performed easily and accurately on the receiving side.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">In addition, by making the distances between the 4 signal points in 1 set equal, and also making the distances between sets equal, the ratio of maximum transmit power to average transmit power is reduced. By this means, the linear amplifier requirements of the transmitting power amplifier are lessened, and an effect of enabling power consumption to be reduced is also obtained. The same is also true when this embodiment is applied to a 64-value modulation method.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0115">In Embodiment 1 and this embodiment, a case has been described in which the signal point arrangements of modulated signal A and modulated signal B are the same, but similar effects can also be obtained when the signal point arrangements of modulated signal A and modulated signal B are different.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0116">For example, on the transmitting side, the modulated signal A signal point arrangement may be set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, while the modulated signal B signal point arrangement is set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. Then, on the receiving side, a total of 3 bits are determined by determining 2 bits by means of partial bit determination section <b>509</b> for modulated signal A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and determining 1 bit by means of partial bit determination section <b>512</b> for modulated signal B. Signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> then reduce the 256 candidate signal points to 32 signal points using this determined 3-bit partial bit information.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0117">A method is also possible whereby only modulated signal A partial bits are determined on the receiving side. The configuration of signal processing section <b>321</b> for implementing this method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In this example, modulated signal A signal points are arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> for ease of partial bit determination. Partial bit determination section <b>509</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> performs partial bit determination of 2 bits of modulated signal A based on the criteria in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>. Signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> reduce the 256 candidate signal points to 64 candidate signal points using the determined 2 bits. Likelihood detection section <b>518</b> performs likelihood detection by finding the Euclidian distances between the 64 signal points and a received baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0118">Determining only partial bits for one modulated signal in this way enables the configuration of the partial bit determination section to be simplified, allowing the computational complexity to be reduced accordingly. This kind of configuration is particularly effective when a signal point arrangement is used whereby partial bit determination is easier for one modulated signal than for the other.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0119" num="0119">In this embodiment, an actual signal point arrangement method and partial bit determination method when using 64-value M-ary modulation as the modulation method are described. The general configurations of a transmitting apparatus and receiving apparatus are similar to those in Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2, except that the modulation method is changed from modulation which has 16 signal points to modulation which has 64 signal points.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the 64QAM signal point arrangement in the I-Q plane. A receiving apparatus of this embodiment, 1 bit is determined by each of partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by performing area division so that the bit with the lowest probability of being erroneous among 6 bits is determined. Then the number of candidate signal points is reduced to 1024 by reducing 2-bit signal points from 64&#xd7;64=4096 candidate signal points by signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b>. Likelihood detection section <b>518</b> performs likelihood detection by finding the Euclidian distances between each of the 1024 candidate signal points and a reception point.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0121">Also, in the receiving apparatus, if area division is performed by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> so that 2 bits are determined, and the respective 2-bit partial bits are determined, the number of candidate signal points can be reduced to 256. If area division is performed so that 3 bits are determined, and the respective 3-bit partial bits are determined, the number of candidate signal points can be reduced to 64. Furthermore, if area division is performed so that 4 bits are determined, and the respective 4-bit partial bits are determined, the number of candidate signal points can be reduced to 16. Thus, the greater the number of bits determined by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> is made, the smaller the number of candidate signal points for performing likelihood detection can be made, enabling the amount of computation to be reduced. However, drawbacks are that the greater the number of bits determined by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> is made, the more bit error rate performances degrade, and, as with 16QAM in Embodiment 1, the more complicated area division becomes.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0122">Thus, in this embodiment, the kind of signal point arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is proposed as a more desirable 64-value M-ary modulation signal point arrangement. The basic concept of the signal point arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is the same as that described in Embodiment 2. That is to say, modulation processing (mapping) is performed whereby signal points are divided into a plurality of sets, and the minimum Euclidian distance between sets is made greater than the minimum Euclidian distance between signal points within a set.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">Specifically, 16 signal points are taken as 1 set, and modulation processing (mapping) is performed so that the distances between the 16 signal points are small, but distances between sets are large. Also, a modulation section makes the distances between the 16 signal points in 1 set equal, and also makes the distances between sets equal. In this way, a modulation section arranges signal points so that an area can easily be divided into first through fourth quadrants.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0124">By this means, 2 bits that are common within a set composed of 16 signal points can easily be demodulated on the receiving side. That is to say, since distances between signal points in a set are small and signal point distances between sets are large, the set (quadrant) in which a reception point is included can be determined easily and accurately, enabling 2-bit partial determination to be performed easily and accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0125">In this embodiment, the signal point arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is proposed as another desirable signal point arrangement for 64-value M-ary modulation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a 64-value M-ary modulation signal point arrangement suitable for determining 4-bit partial bits for each modulated signal. The basic concept of this signal point arrangement, as in the case described above, is that modulation processing (mapping) is performed whereby signal points are divided into a plurality of sets, and the minimum Euclidian distance between sets is made greater than the minimum Euclidian distance between signal points within a set.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0126">Specifically, 4 signal points are taken as 1 set, and modulation processing (mapping) is performed so that the distances between the 4 signal points within 1 set are small, but distances between sets are large. In this way, signal points are arranged so that an area can easily be divided into areas <b>1</b> through <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0127">By this means, 4 bits that are common within a set composed of 16 signal points can easily be demodulated on the receiving side. That is to say, since distances between signal points in a set are small and signal point distances between sets are large, the set (area <b>1</b> to <b>16</b>) in which a reception point is included can be determined easily and accurately, enabling 4-bit partial determination to be performed easily and accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0128">Thus, according to this embodiment, when different 64-value M-ary modulation signals are transmitted from a plurality of antennas, by performing modulation (mapping) processing whereby signal points of 64 values are divided into a plurality of sets, and the minimum Euclidian distance between sets is made larger than the minimum Euclidian distance between signal points in a set, easy and accurate partial bit determination processing and signal point reduction processing can be performed on the receiving side, enabling a received signal with good bit error rate performances to be obtained on the receiving side with a comparatively small computational complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0129">As also explained with regard to Embodiment 2, the method of this embodiment is not limited to a case in which the signal point arrangements of modulated signal A and modulated signal B are the same, and may also be implemented even in a case in which modulated signal A and modulated signal B signal points are arranged differently, and the number of partial bits determined for modulated signal A and modulated signal B are different.</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0141">First, the squares, for example, of the Euclidian distances between the 16 signal points of post-reduction signal point information <b>515</b> and the despread baseband signals are found.

<p id="p-0144" num="0144">(Step ST<b>3</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0145">Lastly, the values of the squares of the Euclidian distances of the 240 signal points other than the 16 signal points for which the square of the Euclidian distance has actually been found are all taken to be Dmax. In this example, the values from D(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) to D(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) are all taken to be Dmax. That is to say, since the Euclidian distances to the 240 signal points other than the 16 signal points for which the square of the Euclidian distance has actually been found can be considered to be greater than the maximum value of the squares of the Euclidian distances of the 16 signal points, Dmax, the squares of the Euclidian distances of these signal points are uniformly set to Dmax. By this means, the squares of the Euclidian distances of 256 points can easily be obtained by making effective use of the squares of the Euclidian distances of 16 signal points.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0146">Then soft decision value calculation section <b>2001</b> outputs the value of the square of the Euclidian distances of these 256 points (branch metric) as soft decision value signal <b>2002</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0148">Thus, according to signal processing section <b>2000</b>, a soft decision value can easily be obtained for all candidate signal points by obtaining soft decision values for all candidate signal points by calculating only the Euclidian distances between reduced candidate signal points and a reception point, and setting all the Euclidian distances between other signal points and the reception point as maximum value Dmax of the aforementioned found Euclidian distances.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0166">Implementing error correction coding in partial bit units in this way enables reception quality to be greatly improved. That is to say, if there is an error in partial hit determination, an erroneous signal point is selected during signal point reduction, and therefore the probability of an error occurring in determination of the remaining bits is extremely high. In contrast, in this embodiment, the implementation of error correction coding in partial bit units enables the possibility of being able to decode partial bits correctly to be increased, enabling the possibility of selecting an erroneous signal point during signal point reduction to be decreased.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0185">In this embodiment, the implementation of trellis coding modulation on the transmitting side is proposed. A case in which 16QAM is used as the modulation method will be described here by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0186">The general configuration of a transmitting apparatus is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the transmit signal frame configurations are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The general configuration of a receiving apparatus is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and the detailed configuration of signal processing section <b>321</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0188" num="0188">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, reference codes <b>2701</b>, <b>2702</b>, and <b>2703</b> denote shift registers and reference codes <b>2704</b> and <b>2705</b> denote exclusive OR circuits, and b<b>0</b>, b<b>1</b>, b<b>2</b>, and b<b>3</b> are generated from inputs a<b>0</b>, a<b>1</b>, and a<b>2</b>. A baseband signal generation section <b>2706</b> has b<b>0</b>, b<b>1</b>, b<b>2</b>, and b<b>3</b> as input, and obtains a baseband signal <b>2707</b> by performing 16QAM mapping.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0189">The operation of a receiving apparatus will now be described. As described above, the characteristic operation of a receiving apparatus of the present invention lies in partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Since similar operations are performed by partial bit determination section <b>509</b> and partial bit determination section <b>512</b>, the operation of partial bit determination section <b>509</b> will mainly be described here.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0190">Partial bit determination section <b>509</b> has modulated signal A estimated baseband signal <b>508</b> as input, determines coding related bits&#x2014;that is, b<b>0</b>, b<b>1</b>, and b<b>2</b> in FIG. <b>28</b>&#x2014;by performing Viterbi decoding, for example, and outputs this information as modulated signal A determined partial bit information <b>510</b>. Similarly, partial bit determination section <b>512</b> outputs modulated signal B determined partial bit information <b>513</b> (3-bit information).</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0191">Signal point reduction sections <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> perform signal point reduction.

<p id="p-0208" num="0208">Partial bit determination of partial bit determination sections <b>509</b>, <b>512</b>, and <b>3208</b> can be performed by using the methods in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> above, for example, when the modulation method is 16QAM. In the case of QPSK, partial bit determination can be implemented by performing the kind of area division shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, for example. Here, an implementation method in the case of 3 antennas will be described taking a case in which the modulation method is 16QAM, and 2 of 4 bits are determined as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0209">When three 16QAM signals transmitted simultaneously from different antennas are received, 16&#xd7;16&#xd7;16=4096 candidate signal points exist. As 2 bits are determined for each of modulated signals A, B, and C by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b>, <b>512</b>, and <b>3208</b>, the 4096 signal points are reduced to 4096/4/4/4=64 candidate signal points. Thus, in likelihood detection section <b>3212</b>, branch metrics between 64 candidate signal points and despread baseband signals are found, and by performing narrowing-down to one candidate signal point and detection, modulated signal A, modulated signal B, and modulated signal C digital signals <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, and <b>3213</b> are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0210">By thus also performing partial bit determination, reducing the number of candidate signal points using determined partial bits, and performing likelihood determination using the reduced candidate signal points even when there are 3 transmitting antennas, 3 receiving antennas, and 3 transmit modulated signals, in the same way as when there are 2, transmitting antennas, 2 receiving antennas, and 2 transmit modulated signals, received digital signals <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, and <b>3213</b> of good reception quality can be obtained with a comparatively small amount of computation.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0211">Next, the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> will be described. Signal processing section <b>3117</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, in which parts corresponding to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> are assigned the same codes as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, has a control section <b>3301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0212">Control section <b>3301</b> has modulated signal A channel fluctuation signals <b>308</b>, <b>318</b>, and <b>3112</b>, modulated signal B channel fluctuation signals <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>3114</b>, and modulated signal C channel fluctuation signals <b>3102</b>, <b>3104</b>, and <b>3116</b> as input, and estimates, for example, the received field strength of modulated signal A, the received field strength of modulated signal B, and the received field strength of modulated signal C. Control section <b>3301</b> then outputs control information <b>3302</b> such that partial bit determination is not performed for only the modulated signal with the lowest field strength.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0213">Assume, for example, that the received field strength of modulated signal A is the lowest. In this case, modulated signal A partial bit determination section <b>509</b> is controlled so as not to perform bit determination. That is to say, determined bits are 0 bits. On the other hand, modulated signal B partial bit determination section <b>512</b> and modulated signal C partial bit determination section <b>3208</b> are each controlled so as to perform 2-bit determination. Then signal point reduction sections <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, and <b>3210</b> reduce the 4096 candidate signal points to 4096/4/4=256 candidate signal points using 0 modulated signal A determined bits (that is to say, no bits have been determined), 2 modulated signal B determined bits, and 2 modulated signal C determined hits. In likelihood detection section <b>3212</b>, branch metrics between 256 candidate signal points and despread baseband signals are found, and by performing narrowing-down to one candidate signal point and detection, modulated signal A, modulated signal B, and modulated signal C digital signals <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, and <b>3213</b> are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0214">By selecting which modulated signals' partial bits are used for signal point reduction in this way, received digital signals with significantly better bit error rate performances can be obtained than in a case in which partial bits of all modulated signals are simply used for signal point reduction (as in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0215">That is to say, when candidate signal point reduction is performed simply by using the results of partial bit determination for all modulated signals, the probability of error of partial bit determination results for a modulated signal of low reception quality (in the case of this embodiment, received field strength) increases, and in line with this, the probability of not being able to perform candidate signal point reduction accurately also increases. As a result, there is a risk of degradation of the bit error rate performances of the final received digital signals. Taking this into consideration, in this embodiment signal point reduction is performed using only partial bit determination results of modulated signals that have good reception quality.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0216">Thus, according to this embodiment, by providing a control section <b>3301</b> that controls which modulated signals' partial bits are used for candidate signal point reduction by signal point reduction sections <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, and <b>3210</b> based on the reception quality of each modulated signal, received digital signals <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, and <b>3213</b> with significantly better bit error rate performances can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0217">In this embodiment, a case in which received field strength is used as a reception quality parameter has been described as an example, but this is not a limitation, and it is also possible, for example, to find the carrier power to noise power ratio of each modulated signal after inverse matrix computation or MMSE computation, and use this as a reception quality parameter for each modulated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0218">Also, in this embodiment an example has been described in which partial bits are determined for only two modulated signals, but the present invention can be similarly implemented by determining partial bits for only one modulated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0219">Furthermore, the number of bits determined as partial bits may be varied according to a reception quality priority order. For example, compatibility between good bit error rate performances and a small computation scale can be achieved by having 2 bits determined by the modulated signal A partial bit determination section, 1 bit determined by the modulated signal B partial bit determination section, and 0 bits determined by the modulated signal C partial bit determination section when the relationship &#x201c;modulated signal A received field strength&#x3e;modulated signal B received field strength&#x3e;modulated signal C received field strength&#x201d; holds true.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0220">That is to say, if the number of partial bits used in each modulated signal is controlled by control section <b>3301</b> in signal point reduction by signal point reduction sections <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, and <b>3210</b> based on the reception quality of each modulated signal, received digital signals <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, and <b>3213</b> with significantly better bit error rate performances can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0221">In this embodiment, a case has been described in which 16QAM is used as the modulation method, but the same kind of effect can also be obtained when a different modulation method is used.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0222">Also, in this embodiment, a case in which the number of transmitting antennas is 3, the number of receiving antennas is 3, and the number of transmit modulated signals is 3 has been described as an example, but this embodiment can be widely applied to cases with n transmitting antennas, n receiving antennas, and n transmit signals (where n&#x2267;2). For example, in a case in which the number of transmitting antennas is 2, the number of receiving antennas is 2, and the number of transmit modulated signals is 2, if modulated signal A received field strength&#x3e;modulated signal B received field strength, determination may be carried out whereby <b>2</b> partial bits are determined for modulated signal A, 1-bit or 0-bit partial determination is performed for modulated signal B, and the remaining bits are then included by performing likelihood determination.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0223">Furthermore, in this embodiment, a case in which coding is not performed has been described as an example, but the same kind of effect can also be obtained by using the determination method of this embodiment when error correction coding is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0224">A method may also be used whereby modulated signal A, modulated signal B, and modulated signal C received digital signals <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, and <b>3213</b> are obtained by determining partial bits of modulated signal A and modulated signal B and obtaining branch metric BM<sub>AB </sub>from candidate signal points reduced using these partial bits, determining partial bits of modulated signal A and modulated signal C and obtaining branch metric BM<sub>AC </sub>from candidate signal points reduced using these partial bits, and determining partial bits of modulated signal B and modulated signal C and obtaining branch metric BM<sub>BC </sub>from candidate signal points reduced using these partial bits, and performing determination using these branch metrics BM<sub>AB</sub>, BM<sub>AC</sub>, and BM<sub>BC</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0225">As a result of performing a simulation, it was found that the method described in this embodiment, whereby partial bits used in candidate signal point reduction by signal point reduction sections are controlled according to the reception quality of each modulated signal, enables received digital signals <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, and <b>3213</b> with extremely good bit error rate performances to be obtained especially when MMSE is performed by separation section <b>3201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Embodiment 8</heading>
<p id="p-0226" num="0226">In above Embodiment 1, a 1-bit partial determination method when the modulation method is 16QAM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) was described, but in this embodiment, a 1-bit partial determination method will be described that enables significantly better bit error rate performances to be obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0228" num="0228">In a 1-bit partial bit determination method of this embodiment, first, the Euclidian distances between received-signal signal point <b>3417</b> and 16QAM signal points <b>3401</b> through <b>3416</b> are found, the 16QAM signal point with the minimum Euclidian distance is found, and the 4 bits indicated by that signal point are found.

In step ST<b>5</b>, the maximum Euclidian distance is detected from among the minimum Euclidian distances of each inverted bit detected in step ST<b>4</b>. In step ST<b>6</b>, the bit corresponding to the maximum Euclidian distance detected in step ST<b>5</b> is taken as the bit with the highest reliability within bit string (1, 1, 1, 1) represented by candidate signal point <b>3407</b> detected in step ST<b>1</b>, and this is adopted as a partial bit.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0239">That is to say, in step ST<b>2</b> through step ST<b>6</b>, the bit with the highest reliability within a bit string represented by a candidate signal point detected in step ST<b>1</b> is determined. Then processing ends in step ST<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0240">Thus, according to this embodiment, 1 bit with an extremely low probability of being erroneous can be determined by: detecting a candidate signal point for which the Euclidian distance from a modulated signal reception point is a minimum; inverting the bits contained in the bit string corresponding to the detected candidate signal point one at a time; searching, for each inverted bit, for a plurality of candidate signal points containing the inverted bit; detecting, for each inverted bit, the minimum Euclidian distance between the reception point and the aforementioned found plurality of candidate signal points; detecting the maximum Euclidian distance among the minimum Euclidian distances of each aforementioned inverted bit; and determining the bit corresponding to the detected maximum Euclidian distance to be a partial bit.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0241">If this kind of 1-bit determination algorithm is here executed by partial bit determination sections <b>509</b> and <b>512</b>, a partial bit (1 bit) with an extremely low probability of being erroneous can be determined, enabling the bit error rate performances of a finally obtained received digital signal to be improved. The 1-bit determination algorithm of this embodiment is not limited to a case in which a receiving apparatus with a configuration described in an above embodiment is used, and can be widely applied to cases in which it is wished to select the bit with the lowest probability of being erroneous within a bit string represented by a signal point.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0242">In this embodiment, 16QAM has been described as an example, but 1 bit can also be similarly determined when a different modulation method is used. Also, this embodiment can be similarly implemented when the squares of Euclidian distances are found instead of Euclidian distances.</p>

<p id="p-0243" num="0243">In the above embodiments, cases have mainly been described, by way of example, in which the present invention is applied to spread spectrum communication scheme and OFDM scheme. But the present invention is not limited to these cases, and similar effects can also be obtained when a single-carrier system or a multicarrier system other than OFDM, or a system combining use of a multicarrier system and spread spectrum communication scheme with MIMO transmission applied therein, is used.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0244">Also, although cases in which modulation which has 16 signal points is used as the modulation method have mainly been described, similar effects can also be obtained when M-ary modulation other than modulation which has 16 signal points is used. That is to say, in the above embodiments, partial bits have been found as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> when a modulation signal which has 16 signal points is received, but this is not a limitation. The same kind of effects as in the above-described embodiments can be obtained when, in the case of an m-value modulation method that transmits in bits in 1 symbol, for example, m bits are reduced to m-k bits based on k (k&#x3c;m) bits found by means of partial bit determination (that is, the number of candidate signal points is reduced), and likelihood detection is performed for the reduced candidate signal points. Furthermore, the area division method used when finding partial bits is not limited to the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, and a different division method can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0245">In the above embodiments, cases have mainly been described in which inverse matrix computations are performed in determining partial bits, but the partial bit determination method is not limited to this, and, essentially, the same kind of effects as in the above-described embodiments can be obtained as long as partial bits are found by means of a detection method different from likelihood detection and a detection method involving a smaller amount of computation than likelihood decoding, since the amount of computation can be reduced compared with a case in which all bits are found by means of likelihood detection.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0246">Furthermore, in the above embodiments, a case has generally been described, by way of example, in which the number of transmitting antennas is 2, the number of receiving antennas is 2, and the number of transmit modulated signals is 2, but the present invention is not limited to this case, and can also be applied to an apparatus with n transmitting antennas, n receiving antennas, and n transmit signals (where n&#x2267;3). Moreover, the present invention can also be applied to an apparatus aimed at improving the degree of separation and/or reception quality by using more receiving antennas than transmitting antennas and transmit signals, and performing combining or selection diversity when performing separation and signal point reduction.</p>

<p id="p-0249" num="0249">According to this configuration, since demodulation of only some bits is performed by the partial bit demodulation section using a detection method different from likelihood detection, partial bits can be obtained with a small amount of computation. Also, since likelihood detection is performed by the likelihood detection section using a reduced number of candidate signal points, the remaining bits can be found with a high degree of precision using a small amount of computation. As likelihood detection is performed on a partial basis in this way, received digital signals with good bit error rate performances can be obtained while reducing the number of computations for finding Euclidian distances.</p>
