<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an information device capable of displaying a plurality of windows on a screen, and to a method for displaying a plurality of windows on a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, information devices are widely used, which include a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a memory device for storing various programs, an input device such as a keyboard or a pointing device, and an image display device. These information devices have improved in their processing capabilities, allowing a plurality of programs to run concurrently. As a result, it is common to display the calculation results of programs in reduced-size windows (hereinafter, &#x201c;reduced windows&#x201d;) on the screen of the image display device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The operability of such information devices has been improved as follows. For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. H10-198329 discloses a technique for maximizing a reduced window to fill the entire display screen or reducing the maximized window to the original size by allowing the user to specify a region of a window. The user can specify a region of the window, for example, by positioning the pointer of a pointing device such as a mouse within the region and by clicking the button of the pointing device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 2006-277648 discloses a technique in which when the user chooses to maximize one of a plurality of reduced windows on a display screen, the other reduced windows are minimized to a predetermined size, and the chosen window is enlarged to the region created by the minimization.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Maximizing one window to fill the entire display screen, however, causes operability problems such as that the other windows are hidden behind the maximized window or that it is impossible to open a new window.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The recent increase in size of image display devices has enabled the display of a larger number of reduced windows so as to improve the operability. At the same time, however, when one window is enlarged by minimizing the other windows, the minimized windows decrease their visibility, thus degrading the operability of the image display devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The information device of the present invention, which displays a window capable of changing its display position and its display size on a screen, includes: a controller for controlling the display position and the display size of a window; a semi-maximization instruction receiving part for receiving instructions for semi-maximizing the window; a semi-maximization region setting part for setting a plurality of display regions in which the window can be semi-maximized; and a display region determination part for determining the display region in which the window is semi-maximized, from the plurality of display regions. When the semi-maximization instruction receiving part receives the instructions for semi-maximizing the window, the controller allows the window to be displayed in the entire area of the display region determined by the display region determination part from the plurality of display regions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This structure allows a reduced window to be efficiently enlarged and displayed in a predetermined region, thus improving visibility and operability when displaying a window on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the information device, the display region determination part may determine the display region in which the window is semi-maximized, based on the display position of a reduced window before being semi-maximized. This structure improves operability when enlarging and displaying a reduced window in a predetermined region.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The information device may further include a region setting receiving part for receiving instructions for setting the plurality of display regions, and the semi-maximization region setting part may set the plurality of display regions based on the instructions received by the region setting receiving part. This structure allows the user to arbitrarily set the display regions in which a reduced window can be enlarged to a semi-maximized size, thus further improving the operability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the information device, the display region determination part may include a preferred region receiving part for receiving instructions on the association between the application running in the window and the display region in which the window is semi-maximized; and the display region determination part may determine the display region in which the window is semi-maximized, by placing priority on the instructions received by the preferred region receiving part. This structure allows the user to determine the display region in which a reduced window is enlarged to a semi-maximized size according to the application, thus further improving the operability.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The information device may further include a region selection receiving part for receiving instructions for selecting the display region in which the window is semi-maximized, and the display region determination part may determine the display region in which the window is semi-maximized, based on the instructions received by the region selection receiving part. This structure allows the user to arbitrarily determine the display region in which a reduced window is enlarged to a semi-maximized size, thus improving the operability.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The information device may perform a multi-step enlarging process including: first semi-maximization in which the window is enlarged and displayed in the entire area of one of the plurality of display regions that is determined by the display region determination part; and second semi-maximization in which the window is enlarged and displayed in the entire area of at least two adjacent ones of the plurality of display regions. This structure enables enlarging a display region sequentially by first semi-maximization, second semi-maximization, and so on when displaying a reduced window, thus further improving the visibility and operability.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method of the present invention for displaying a window capable of changing its display position and its display size on a screen, wherein upon receiving instructions for semi-maximizing a reduced window, the reduced window is semi-maximized and displayed in the entire area of one of a plurality of display regions predetermined based on the display position of the reduced window.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This structure allows a reduced window to be efficiently enlarged and displayed in a predetermined region, thus improving visibility and operability when displaying a window on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the window display method of the present invention, the display region in which the window is semi-maximized may be determined based on the predetermined association of an application running in the window and the display region to be semi-maximized of the window. This structure allows determining the display region in which a reduced window is enlarged to a semi-maximized size according to the application, thus further improving the operability.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the window display method of the present invention, a multi-step enlarging process may be performed, which includes: first semi-maximization in which the window is enlarged and displayed in the entire area of one of the plurality of display regions; and second semi-maximization in which the window is enlarged and displayed in the entire area of at least two of the plurality of display regions. This structure enables enlarging a display region sequentially by first semi-maximization, second semi-maximization, and so on when displaying a reduced window, thus further improving the visibility and operability.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Embodiments of the information device of the present invention will be described as follows with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of information device <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Information device <b>1</b> includes display part <b>2</b>, controller <b>3</b>, user interface <b>4</b>, semi-maximization instruction receiving part <b>5</b>, semi-maximization cancel instruction receiving part <b>6</b>, window semi-maximization process part <b>7</b>, and window information storage part <b>8</b>. Display part <b>2</b> displays images on its screen. Controller <b>3</b> controls the display position, the display size, and other information of a window displayed on the screen. User interface <b>4</b> receives input from the user of information device <b>1</b>. Semi-maximization instruction receiving part <b>5</b> receives instructions for semi-maximizing a reduced window, of the instructions that user interface <b>4</b> has received from the user. Semi-maximization cancel instruction receiving part <b>6</b> receives instructions for cancelling the semi-maximization, of the instructions that user interface <b>4</b> has received from the user. Window semi-maximization process part <b>7</b> performs processes required to display a window in a semi-maximized size. Window information storage part <b>8</b> stores information about the windows. The semi-maximization of a reduced window indicates the changing of the display position and the display size of the reduced window, but does not include the enlargement of the reduced window to the maximized size, which will be described later. The operation of semi-maximization will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Display part <b>2</b> is composed of a common image display device such as an LCD (liquid crystal display) or an organic EL (Electroluminescence) display. Display part <b>2</b> displays the calculation results of the programs running on information device <b>1</b>. Display part <b>2</b> may be integrated into information device <b>1</b>, or it is possible to provide an image display device outside information device <b>1</b> and to use it as display part <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">User interface <b>4</b>, which is composed of a common information input device such as a mouse, other pointing device, or a keyboard, transmits inputs of instructions, information, and the like from the user to information device <b>1</b>. User interface <b>4</b> may be formed by integrating display part <b>2</b> with a general touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Window information storage part <b>8</b> includes position information part <b>13</b>, size information part <b>14</b>, and return value information part <b>15</b>. Position information part <b>13</b> stores information on the display position of a window which is on the screen of display part <b>2</b>. Size information part <b>14</b> stores information on the display size of a window which is on the screen. Return value information part <b>15</b> stores information on the original display position and the original display size that a window had before being semi-maximized. This speeds up the response to instructions for cancelling the semi-maximization after the position and size of the window is once semi-maximized, thereby speeding up the reduction of the window to its original position and size.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Window semi-maximization process part <b>7</b> includes window position determination part <b>9</b>, semi-maximization region setting part <b>10</b>, display region determination part <b>11</b>, and window size changing part <b>12</b>. Window position determination part <b>9</b> determines the display position of a reduced window based on the information stored in position information part <b>13</b>. Semi-maximization region setting part <b>10</b> stores information on semi-maximization regions. Display region determination part <b>11</b> determines the display region in which a window is semi-maximized. Window size changing part <b>12</b> changes information on the display position and the display size of a window.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In information device <b>1</b>, first of all, semi-maximization instruction receiving part <b>5</b> receives instructions for semi-maximizing a reduced window Then, display region determination part <b>11</b> determines the display region in which the reduced window is semi-maximized, based on information obtained from window position determination part <b>9</b> and semi-maximization region setting part <b>10</b>. Window size changing part <b>12</b> changes the information on the display position and the display size of the reduced window so as to enlarge the window to the entire area of the display region determined by display region determination part <b>11</b>. Controller <b>3</b> allows displaying the window that has been enlarged to the entire area of the display region determined by display region determination part <b>11</b>, based on the information received from window size changing part <b>12</b>. In other words, controller <b>3</b> controls display part <b>2</b> to display the window in a semi-maximized size.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When semi-maximization cancel instruction receiving part <b>6</b> receives instructions for cancelling the semi-maximization, window size changing part <b>12</b> reads the original information of the window stored in return value information part <b>15</b>. Controller <b>3</b> reduces the window to the original display position and the original display size based on the original information read by window size changing part <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Window information storage part <b>8</b> may be configured to store information on the display position and the display size of a semi-maximized window. This structure allows controller <b>3</b> to return a window maximized to the entire screen of display part <b>2</b> to a window semi-maximized to have the original display position and the original display size. This is because upon receiving the instructions for returning the maximized window to the original semi-maximized size, controller <b>3</b> operates based on the information stored in window information storage part <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">These blocks may be composed of either electronic circuits or programs designed to run on a microcomputer so as to operate in the same way as the electronic circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A window display configuration in the present embodiment will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a reduced-window display configuration in information device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C show changes in the window display configuration in information device <b>1</b>. In order to distinguish from reduced window <b>16</b>, a window in a semi-maximized size and a window in a maximized size are referred to as a &#x201c;semi-maximized window&#x201d; and a &#x201c;maximized window&#x201d;, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C show a reduced-window display configuration, a semi-maximized-window display configuration, and a maximized-window display configuration, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reduced window <b>16</b> is a window located in the display region of display part <b>2</b> in order to display the calculation results of an application. Reduced window <b>16</b> includes title display region <b>17</b> above the region in which the calculation results of an application are displayed. Title display region <b>17</b> includes semi-maximize button <b>18</b> and semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b>. Title display region <b>17</b>, semi-maximize button <b>18</b>, and semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> are also displayed in semi-maximized window <b>19</b> and maximized window <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the screen of display part <b>2</b> is divided into two regions: first semi-maximization region <b>24</b> and second semi-maximization region <b>25</b>, which correspond to the left and right halves, respectively, of the screen. Each of reduced window <b>16</b>, semi-maximized window <b>19</b>, and maximized window <b>20</b> includes a vertical and/or horizontal scrollbar to scroll through the information; however, the scrollbars are not illustrated for simplification in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and other drawings described below.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The following is a description of changes in the window display configuration. Assume, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, that the user presses semi-maximize button <b>18</b> via user interface <b>4</b>, for example, by clicking a pointing device when reduced window <b>16</b> is on the screen of display part <b>2</b>. Reduced window <b>16</b> is enlarged and displayed in the entire area of either first semi-maximization region <b>24</b> or second semi-maximization region <b>25</b>. In other words, reduced window <b>16</b> is semi-maximized to become semi-maximized window <b>19</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, reduced window <b>16</b> is semi-maximized in first semi-maximization region <b>24</b>. The determination as to which of semi-maximization regions <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> reduced window <b>16</b> is semi-maximized in is determined based on the display position of reduced window <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Assume, on the other hand, that the user presses semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> via user interface <b>4</b> when semi-maximized window <b>19</b> is on the screen. Semi-maximized window <b>19</b> is reduced to reduced window <b>16</b> with the original size as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Assume that the user again presses semi-maximize button <b>18</b> via user interface <b>4</b> when semi-maximized window <b>19</b> is on the screen. Semi-maximized window <b>19</b> is enlarged and displayed on the entire screen of display part <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Thus, semi-maximized window <b>19</b> is maximized to become maximized window <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Assume that the user presses semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> via user interface <b>4</b> when maximized window <b>20</b> is on the screen. Maximized window <b>20</b> is reduced to semi-maximized window <b>19</b> with the original size as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">There are cases where reduced window <b>16</b> has a larger window size than a semi-maximized window. For example, reduced window <b>16</b> may be displayed as large as the entire screen of display part <b>2</b>. In such cases, a reduced window, when semi-maximized, appears to be smaller than the semi-maximized window. That is, a reduced window, when semi-maximized, has a smaller window size than the semi-maximized window. In the present embodiment, the terms &#x201c;reduced window&#x201d;, &#x201c;semi-maximized window&#x201d;, and &#x201c;maximized window&#x201d; are also applied in such cases.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3A</figref> each show a dashed boarder line in the middle of the screen of display part <b>2</b>. The boarder line is not actually displayed on the screen but is shown only to clarify the boundary between first semi-maximization region <b>24</b> and second semi-maximization region <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, both semi-maximize button <b>18</b> and semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> are displayed. Alternatively, it is possible not to display semi-maximize button <b>18</b> in a maximized window because it is unnecessary to define the operation to semi-maximize a maximized window. Similarly, it is possible not to display semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> in reduced window <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The operation to switch the window display configuration in the present embodiment will be described using flowcharts as follows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing an operation of information device <b>1</b> when the user presses semi-maximize button <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart showing an operation of information device <b>1</b> when the user presses semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The operation of information device <b>1</b> when the user presses semi-maximize button <b>18</b> will be described as follows with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Assume that the user presses semi-maximize button <b>18</b> via user interface <b>4</b> when a window is on the screen. Semi-maximization instruction receiving part <b>5</b> receives the &#x201c;instructions for semi-maximizing a window&#x201d; provided by pressing semi-maximize button <b>18</b> (Step S<b>1</b>). The instructions for semi-maximizing a window can be provided by the user moving the pointer of the pointing device to semi-maximize button <b>18</b> on the screen of display part <b>2</b> and clicking the click button of the pointing device provided as user interface <b>4</b>. The present invention is not limited to this; for example, it is possible to assign a function key on a keyboard provided as user interface <b>4</b> to semi-maximize a window.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then, semi-maximization instruction receiving part <b>5</b> transmits a signal indicating the reception of the &#x201c;instructions for semi-maximizing a window&#x201d; to window size changing part <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In response to this, window information storage part <b>8</b> transmits the position information of the currently displayed window stored in position information part <b>13</b> to window position determination part <b>9</b> (Step S<b>2</b>). When, for example, reduced window <b>16</b> is on the screen, window information storage part <b>8</b> transmits the position information of reduced window <b>16</b>. Return value information part <b>15</b> stores information on the display position and information on the display size of the currently displayed window.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Then, window position determination part <b>9</b> determines the display position of the currently displayed window on the screen of display part <b>2</b> from its position information received from window information storage part <b>8</b> (Step S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the currently displayed window is not a semi-maximized window, that is, if the currently displayed window is reduced window <b>16</b> (NO in Step S<b>4</b>), display region determination part <b>11</b> determines the display region in which semi-maximized window <b>19</b> is displayed. The display region is determined based on the determination result of window position determination part <b>9</b> and the information on the semi-maximization regions held by semi-maximization region setting part <b>10</b>. Then, window size changing part <b>12</b> changes the information on the semi-maximization of the currently displayed window. Controller <b>3</b> semi-maximizes the currently displayed window based on the information received from window size changing part <b>12</b> (Step S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, when window position determination part <b>9</b> determines that the center of gravity of reduced window <b>16</b> is in first semi-maximization region <b>24</b>, display region determination part <b>11</b> determines to semi-maximize reduced window <b>16</b> in first semi-maximization region <b>24</b>. Window size changing part <b>12</b> changes the information so that the currently displayed window is enlarged to fill the entire first semi-maximization region <b>24</b>. Reduced window <b>16</b>, which is a square in the present embodiment, may be a polygon, oblong, or any other planar shape to implement the present invention. The term &#x201c;center of gravity&#x201d; here means a point generally defined as the center of gravity of a planar shape. In the case of a square as in the present embodiment, the point represents the arithmetic mean of the coordinates of the intersection of two diagonals of the square. In the case of a polygon, the point represents the arithmetic mean of the coordinates of the apexes of the polygon. In other words, the point represents the center of the window on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In Step <b>5</b>, the information on the display position and the information on the display size of the semi-maximized window are stored in window information storage part <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the currently displayed window is a semi-maximized window, that is, when the currently displayed window is semi-maximized window <b>19</b> (YES in Step S<b>4</b>), window size changing part <b>12</b> changes the information on the maximization of the currently displayed window. Controller <b>3</b> maximizes the currently displayed window based on the information received from window size changing part <b>12</b> (Step S<b>6</b>). At the same time, the region information indicating the display region in which semi-maximized window <b>19</b> was semi-maximized is stored to window information storage part <b>8</b>. The reason for this storage is to store the region in which maximized window <b>20</b>, when returned to semi-maximized window <b>19</b>, is displayed as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The determination in Step S<b>4</b> is performed in window size changing part <b>12</b>. This is because window size changing part <b>12</b>, which manages the information on the size of a currently displayed window, can easily determine whether the currently displayed window is reduced window <b>16</b>, semi-maximized window <b>19</b>, or maximized window <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the present embodiment, information device <b>1</b> operates based on this flowchart so as to semi-maximize reduced window <b>16</b> and to maximize semi-maximized window <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the operation of information device <b>1</b> when the user presses semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Assume that the user presses semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> via user interface <b>4</b> to cancel semi-maximization when a window is on the screen. Semi-maximization cancel instruction receiving part <b>6</b> receives &#x201c;instructions for cancelling the semi-maximization&#x201d; provided by pressing semi-maximize cancel button <b>21</b> (Step S<b>10</b>). The method for providing instructions for cancelling the semi-maximization is not described because it is the same as the method for providing instructions for the semi-maximization described above.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Semi-maximization cancel instruction receiving part <b>6</b> transmits a signal indicating the reception of the &#x201c;instructions for cancelling the semi-maximization&#x201d; to window size changing part <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Window size changing part <b>12</b> reads the position information and the size information from position information part <b>13</b> and size information part <b>14</b>, respectively, included in window information storage part <b>8</b>. Then, window size changing part <b>12</b> determines whether the currently displayed window is either maximized window <b>20</b> or semi-maximized window <b>19</b> (Step S<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the currently displayed window is not maximized window <b>20</b>, that is, when the currently displayed window is semi-maximized window <b>19</b> (NO in Step S<b>11</b>), the original information of the currently displayed window stored in return value information part <b>15</b> is read out and transmitted to window size changing part <b>12</b>. As a result, window size changing part <b>12</b> changes the information on the reduction of the currently displayed window. Controller <b>3</b> allows display part <b>2</b> to display the currently displayed window as reduced window <b>16</b> with the original display position and original display size based on the information received from window size changing part <b>12</b> (Step S<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the currently displayed window is, on the other hand, maximized window <b>20</b> (YES in Step S<b>11</b>), window semi-maximization process part <b>7</b> acquires the region information required to semi-maximize the window from window information storage part <b>8</b>. Window size changing part <b>12</b> changes the information on the semi-maximization of the currently displayed window.

In the present embodiment, the position of center of gravity G can be calculated by noting that reduced window <b>16</b> is a square. In other words, the position of center of gravity G of reduced window <b>16</b> can be calculated by adding the coordinates of the four corners of the outer periphery of reduced window <b>16</b> and striking an average. Then, display region determination part <b>11</b> determines whether the center of gravity G is either in first semi-maximization region <b>24</b> or in second semi-maximization region <b>25</b>, and determines that the region having the center of gravity G is the display region in which the window is semi-maximized.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">When the application running in reduced window <b>16</b> is not associated with the display region in which reduced window <b>16</b> is semi-maximized, reduced window <b>16</b> can be semi-maximized in the display region that is determined based on the display position of reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>s shown in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The present embodiment shows the case where one reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>or <b>16</b><i>b </i>is semi-maximized as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>; however, the present invention is not limited to the semi-maximization of one window. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an example of semi-maximizing a plurality of independent reduced windows controlled by different applications, the different applications being in association with semi-maximization regions in the information device according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, reduced windows <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are displayed as separate reduced windows controlled by two applications; one of reduced windows <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>is semi-maximized first and then the other is semi-maximized. In this example, the semi-maximization performed in association with an application is in preference to the semi-maximization performed based on the position.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">More specifically, as shown in the upper drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, reduced windows <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are displayed, in which different applications are running. An application for creating documents is running in reduced window <b>16</b><i>a</i>, and an application for creating drawings is running in reduced window <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Under such display conditions, if the user presses semi-maximize button <b>18</b> of reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>in which an application for creating documents is running, reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>is semi-maximized in first semi-maximization region <b>24</b> as shown in the bottom left drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. As a result, semi-maximized window <b>39</b> is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">If, on the other hand, the user presses semi-maximize button <b>18</b> of reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>in which an application for creating drawings is running, as shown in the bottom right drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>is semi-maximized in second semi-maximization region <b>25</b>. As a result, semi-maximized window <b>19</b> is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The display region in which a window is semi-maximized is determined based on the aforementioned association received by preferred region receiving part <b>23</b>. Reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>controlled by an application for creating documents is displayed as semi-maximized window <b>39</b> on the left half of the screen of display part <b>2</b>, and reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>controlled by an application for creating drawings is displayed as semi-maximized window <b>19</b> on the right half of the screen. This allows the user to create or edit documents on semi-maximized window <b>39</b> while referring to the drawings on semi-maximized window <b>19</b>, or to create or edit drawings on semi-maximized window <b>19</b> in accordance with the documents on semi-maximized window <b>39</b>. This further improves visibility and operability of information device <b>32</b> in which a plurality of applications are running.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As described in the present embodiment, it is common for users to create or edit documents displayed on the left, while referring to drawings displayed on the right. Alternatively, however, the documents and the drawings may be left-right reversed or arranged in upper and lower parts according to the user preference.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the present embodiment, reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>controlled by an application for creating documents is semi-maximized first, and then reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>controlled by an application for creating drawings is semi-maximized. Alternatively, when semi-maximize button <b>18</b> of reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>is seen behind reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>as shown in the upper drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the user can press semi-maximize button <b>18</b> of reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>so as to display semi-maximized window <b>19</b> on the right half of the screen of display part <b>2</b> before semi-maximizing reduced window <b>16</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the bottom left drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, reduced window <b>16</b><i>a </i>is semi-maximized to become semi-maximized window <b>39</b> shown on the screen of display part <b>2</b>. In the case where both reduced windows <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are semi-maximized, it is possible to display reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>over semi-maximized window <b>39</b> so as to prevent semi-maximize button <b>18</b> of reduced window <b>16</b><i>b </i>from being hidden behind semi-maximized window <b>39</b>. This simplifies the process of semi-maximizing reduced windows <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>to semi-maximized windows <b>39</b> and <b>19</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Such changes in display configurations can be made by changing the settings in window semi-maximization process part <b>7</b> or window information storage part <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Although two reduced windows are displayed in the present embodiment, the present invention can be applied to cases in which three or more reduced windows are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The window display method of the present invention can be applied not only to information devices, which are described in the embodiments of the present invention, but also to other electronic devices such as information terminals and portable information devices.</p>
