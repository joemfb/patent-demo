<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A front tow extended saddle is disclosed. The saddle allows a first towing truck to mount a second truck, facing forward, behind the first truck, in order to tow the second truck to a distant location. The saddle allows the towed truck to face forward during transport, thus allowing for the normal loads and stresses of movement on the towed truck. This configuration is preferable to movement with the towed truck facing-rearward, in which the typical aerodynamic surfaces of a large truck act as a drag during transport, imposing high wind loads and unusual stresses. The front tow extended saddle is also designed to minimize the required vertical rise on the towed truck, which also avoids additional stresses during loading and unloading onto the towing truck.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to towed motor vehicle transportation and tools for assisting in towing of vehicles from one location to another location.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The economy of the United States, if not of the world, depends to a great extent on fleets of large trucks for the distribution of goods, such as foods, consumer products, durable goods, and even industrial equipment. There are many manufacturers of such trucks, which concern primarily, but are not limited to, class 7 or class 8 over-the-road trucks. Once these trucks are manufactured, they require shipment or transportation either to the carrier or other company for whom the truck was made, or to a dealer who sells or leases these trucks. The most obvious method to transport these trucks is by driving them directly to their destination. This method has disadvantages, at least because each truck requires a driver, who must be paid for his or her services and for whom return transportation must be arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to overcome the necessity of a driver for delivering each truck, a variety of techniques have been devised to use a first truck that will carry or tow one or more additional trucks to the desired destination. One example is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,555,214. This patent discloses a tow bar that attaches to the fifth wheel of both the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle. The towed vehicle is towed in a rear-ward fashion behind the front vehicle. Using this technique, the towed vehicle is exposed to the full force of the air that is encountered during the tow. Any aerodynamic surfaces of the towed vehicle will be subjected to reverse stresses, i.e., the wind will impose loads on the truck at 180&#xb0; from the direction expected during the design of the truck. Thus, the roof cap, side fairings, and any additional fairings, such as side and chassis fairings, should be braced or buttressed for the trip. This adds additional cost to the delivery of the truck. In addition, it is not clear that, even using both fifth wheels, the towed truck will have sufficient freedom of movement to be able to rotate slightly during turns.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another technique is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,867,468. This patent discloses a decking bar that mounts to the truck chassis in front of and above the front axle of the towed vehicle. The decking bar has a relatively uniform cross section with differently-shaped end portions and is also relatively short. Using this technique, the towed truck is lifted vertically and is not drawn close in a horizontal direction. In order to minimize the vertical lift, the decking bar is mounted above the front axle of the towed truck, which is then suspended by mounting the decking bar to the chassis of the towed truck.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another technique is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,873,593. This patent discloses a piggyback truck transport system. Using this system, a first towing truck mounts a second towed truck on its rear portion. The towed truck is lifted a substantial distance in a vertical direction, putting a stress on the truck and also putting the combination load at risk for violating a vertical height limit. The towed truck is lifted a substantial distance because its front wheels rest on the rear of the towing truck, thus elevating the towed truck a considerable distance. This height may limit the route which is taken in delivering the trucks. The height may be lessened by removing the front tires of the towed vehicles, which also adds to the delivery expense.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Trucks may also be transported with equipment and a method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,051. This patent discloses a method in which a first truck tows a second, rear-facing truck, using a special beam assembly. In this method, a boom saddle is used in conjunction with the fifth wheel of the towing truck and the fifth wheel or a support mount of the towed vehicle. The special provisions of the boom saddle allow for lateral and vertical movement of the beam assembly. While this method works well, it continues to have the disadvantage of towing a vehicle that faces rear-ward. Thus, the structure of the towed vehicle must be braced or buttressed during towing, adding to the cost of the tow. In addition, the extra wind resistance of the open rear portion of the truck detracts significantly from fuel economy during a long tow, such as from a manufacturer to a customer or dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention provides better equipment and a better method for towing trucks. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While the invention will be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, there is no intent to limit it to those embodiments. On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments of the present invention are highly useful in transporting trucks and other vehicles, including new trucks, from one location to another. While embodiments are most useful in this application, they may also be used to transport other vehicles, such as used cars or trucks, from one dealer to another.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As noted above, embodiments of the front tow extended saddle are aimed at safe and economical delivery of vehicles. Accordingly, vehicles towed with the present embodiments and the present method face forward, their normal direction of travel. In this way, there are no additional side loads or wind loads placed on the vehicles. For instance, many highway class 7 and class 8 vehicle have very large aerodynamic cab features, e.g., large fairings designed to deflect the winds encountered in high speed driving. When a truck with these large surface features is towed while facing rear-ward, the beneficial effect of these features is lost. Instead, the aerodynamic features may almost be said to act as a thrust-reverser, since the wind is caught in the rear of the cab. The features and fairings may not be designed for these reversed loads. Thus, in many cases, cabs must be reinforced and buttressed to prevent damage from rear-facing tows at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the front tow extended saddle is intended to be as low-profile as possible, in the sense of minimizing the height of the towed vehicle. Minimizing the height assures the safest travel over highways that cross bridges, ramps, and other overpasses. In addition, minimizing the height also minimizes the stress to which the vehicle or truck is subjected when it is hoisted or lifted into position for the tow. Finally, the front tow extended saddle is intended to function in as economical a manner as possible. The saddle is designed with minimal vertical rise and maximum support of the towed load. One embodiment is preferably configured so that it may be folded into itself for easiest transport when it is not being used. This embodiment is preferably equipped with pivots (sleeves) and locking pins to secure the saddle in place. Other embodiments may be bolted, welded or otherwise configured in a permanent configuration that is not able to be folded into itself.</p>

The left and right sides, rails, of each portion are preferably made from hollow rectangular tubing, such as 2&#xbe;&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2033; hollow structural sections (HSS), made from &#xbc;&#x2033; plate. Other sizes and thicknesses may be used. In this embodiment, rear portion <b>11</b> is necessarily wider than the other portions so that rear portion <b>11</b> may support the frame rails of the towed truck. The sides of rear portion <b>11</b> may be secured with cross members <b>18</b> as shown. Cross members <b>18</b> preferably do not interfere with clearances for mounting rear portion <b>11</b> to the towed vehicle. The cross members may be secured to the left and right sides by welding or other structural assembly method. In one embodiment, the rails of rear portion <b>11</b> are about 48 to 56 inches long and are spaced apart about 30-32 inches (inner distance). As may also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, rear and front portions <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> are parallel to each other, while each of rear, middle, and front portions <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> is on a different plane.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Middle portion <b>12</b> is also preferably made from left and right sides of hollow rectangular tubing, secured to each other by cross member <b>12</b><i>a</i>, preferably by welding. Middle portion <b>12</b> may be narrower than rear portion <b>11</b>, and may be wider than front portion <b>13</b>. In one embodiment, the rails of middle portion <b>12</b> are about 36-40 inches long and are spaced apart to that their outer width (distance on the outer sides of the rails) is slightly less than the inner distance between the rails of the rear portion.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Front portion <b>13</b> is narrower yet than middle section <b>12</b>, and front portion <b>13</b> includes left and right sides made from hollow structural sections as described above. The sides are secured to each other by cross members <b>19</b>. In one embodiment, the rails of front portion <b>13</b> are about 34-38 inches long and are separated such that the outer distance between the rails is just less than the inner distance of the rails of middle portion <b>12</b>. The hollow tubing used for the rails in some embodiments is about 6 inches high and about 2&#xbe; inches wide. In these embodiments, each successive pair of rails is about 5&#xbd; inches, or a little more clearance for easier handling, narrower or wider than the next pair. The front portion also includes a mount <b>14</b> for securing to the towing vehicle. In this embodiment, the rear, middle, and front portions are preferably rigidly assembled to each other by welding. Other methods, such as fasteners, may also be used. Mount <b>14</b> includes a king pin for directly mounting to a fifth wheel of the towing vehicle, also allowing for rotation of the extended saddle with respect to the towing vehicle. A small amount of rotation is desirable in order to allow the towed vehicle to more easily accomplish turns during the towing procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Rear portion <b>11</b> of front tow extended saddle <b>10</b> mounts the towed truck using security assemblies that attach to the towed truck frame and axle security assemblies that attach to the front axle(s) of the towed truck. Accordingly, the left and right side rails of rear portion <b>11</b> include a plurality of mounting holes <b>17</b>. The placement of the holes allows the user to select the most appropriate pattern for mounting to a particular vehicle. It is understood that the embodiments described herein are applicable to class 7 and 8 over-the-road trucks, although other vehicles may also be towed using these embodiments. These trucks may vary in their configurations, i.e., a standard front axle, placed about 40&#x2033; from the front of the truck, or a set-back axle, 43-46&#x2033; from the front. The axle itself may be a standard axle, with an I-beam cross section, or may be a Henderickson axle, with a cross section shaped more like a square. The positions of the lower security assemblies, attaching to the frame, and the axle security assemblies, attaching to the axle, should be horizontally adjustable with respect to rear portion <b>11</b> to accommodate these differences.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another embodiment of a front tow extended saddle is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>. In this embodiment, economy of operation is emphasized, because the front tow extended saddle <b>30</b> is made foldable or collapsible by incorporating pivots between the three portions, rear portion <b>31</b>, middle portion <b>32</b>, and front portion <b>33</b>. Rear portion <b>31</b> is preferably made from hollow structural sections, such as hollow square tubing, the left and right sides preferably secured with at least one cross member <b>43</b>, the cross member placed so that it does not interfere with placement of the lower security assemblies <b>36</b> or axle security assemblies <b>35</b>, which may be similar to those described above. Rear portion <b>31</b> mounts the axle security assemblies and lower security assemblies using a plurality of mounting apertures <b>37</b>. The security assemblies are preferably mounted to rear portion <b>31</b> using the apertures and bolts (not shown). There are also apertures for insertion of locking pins <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Middle portion <b>32</b> is pivotally secured to rear portion <b>31</b> by a pivoting sleeve <b>38</b> and is collapsibly secured by locking pins <b>40</b>. Middle portion <b>32</b> is pivotally secured to front portion <b>33</b> by a pivoting sleeve <b>39</b> and is collapsibly secured by locking pins <b>41</b>. In addition to the pivoting sleeve, each pivot may also include a solid pivot pin within the sleeve to insure the strength of the pivot during towing operations. The front tow extended saddle is secured by locking pins <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> when the saddle is intended for towing a truck. In the extended position, front and rear portions <b>33</b>, <b>31</b> are preferably parallel, i.e., parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the tow is complete, saddle <b>30</b> may be collapsed or folded by removing the locking pins and using the pivoting sleeves to fold the saddle into a much smaller space for a return trip. For instance, if two trucks are being delivered, one towing and one towed, the front tow extended saddle may be returned in a pick-up truck or much smaller vehicle, rather than waiting for a return trip by a large truck. Because of the much smaller volume of the folded saddle, it is possible to return several of the folded saddles in a single return trip, by either a large truck or a smaller truck capable of handling the load.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For this reason, in a preferred embodiment, the outer width of the middle portion is less than an inner width of the rear portion, and the outer width of the front portion is less than an inner width of the middle portion. In other embodiments, there may be only a single collapsible or pivoting joint, e.g., there may be an embodiment in which an inner width of the middle portion is less than an outer width of the front portion, and there is only a forward pivoting junction between the middle and front portions. There may also be another embodiment in which an outer width of the middle portion is less than an inner width of the rear portion and there is only a single pivoting point, a rear pivoting junction between the rear and middle portions.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the preferred embodiment, the left and right rails of middle portion <b>32</b> are joined by cross member <b>46</b>, and the left and right rails include a plurality of apertures for insertion of locking pins <b>41</b>. Front portion <b>33</b> includes left and right rails or sides that are secured to each other with cross members <b>44</b>. Front portion <b>33</b> also includes mount <b>34</b> for mounting to the towing vehicle. Mount <b>44</b> in this embodiment is an I-beam configuration for mounting via J-claws into a saddle mount, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,109,642, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, as though each page and figure of the '642 patent were set forth in full in this patent. The saddle mount is preferably secured to the towing truck and the front tow extended saddle is then secured to the saddle mount. The extended front tow saddle mount may have a fifth wheel pin or a king pin for direct insertion into a fifth wheel, and also allowing for rotation. A small amount of rotation is desirable in order to allow the towed vehicle to more easily accomplish turns and maneuvering during the towing procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The front tow extended saddle is secured to the frame of the truck with preferably at least four lower security assemblies. As is well known, truck frames include large, long C-shaped steel members, known generally as channels. The towed truck is mounted to the saddle by two lower security assemblies mounted to a channel on the left side of the truck and two lower security assemblies mounted to a channel on the right side of the truck. A lower security assembly <b>16</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The assembly includes a central structural portion <b>51</b>, preferably a main hollow structural section <b>51</b> and a peripheral flange <b>52</b>. Flange <b>52</b> may be mounted to main section <b>51</b> by welding and by webs <b>54</b>. Webs <b>54</b> are preferably sufficiently wide to reinforce the joint and sufficiently narrow so as not to interfere when a user tightens the nuts around the threaded portions of two U-bolts <b>50</b>. Flange <b>52</b> includes apertures <b>53</b>. U-bolts <b>50</b> are mounted around the truck channel and are extended through apertures <b>53</b>, and are then tightened with the nuts, vertically securing assembly <b>16</b> to the rear portion of the front tow extended saddle. Assembly <b>16</b> is locked into place horizontally to the rear portion by pins inserted through apertures <b>57</b> in the security assembly and apertures <b>17</b>, <b>37</b>, in the front tow extended saddles <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>90</b>. Axle security assemblies <b>15</b> are similar in structure to the lower security assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some instances, it is difficult to place a U-bolt around a channel or frame of the vehicle to be towed. This may occur because of lack of clearance or merely awkward placement of engine components <b>55</b> in the engine compartment. In these instances, it may be convenient to use additional clamps and straight bolts, in place of the normal, straight-forward U-bolts, in addition to a lower security assembly. One such situation is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Security assembly <b>60</b> includes a lower frame clamp <b>61</b>, an optional top frame clamp <b>62</b>, lower security assembly <b>16</b>, first and second bolts <b>67</b>, <b>68</b>, and securing nuts <b>69</b>. In use, the user places lower frame clamp <b>61</b> around truck frame channel <b>56</b>. As may be seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>, assembly <b>60</b> will preferably include two top frame clamps, a single lower frame clamp <b>61</b>, two first and second bolts <b>67</b>, <b>68</b>, with their nuts, and a single lower security assembly <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this embodiment, viewed from the front of the towed vehicle (not shown), lower frame clamp <b>61</b> is mounted on the left side of the towed vehicle and the frame clamp is open on the left side, allowing the lower flange of channel <b>56</b> to enter clamp <b>61</b>. Mounted on the same open, left side is top frame clamp <b>62</b>, which is mounted to a convenient structural hard point, such as a top frame rail flange. Top frame clamp <b>62</b> is then secured to lower frame clamp <b>61</b> and lower security assembly <b>15</b> by longer bolt <b>67</b> and nut <b>69</b>. On the other side, lower frame clamp <b>61</b> is secured to lower security assembly <b>15</b> by shorter bolt <b>68</b> and nut <b>69</b>. The assemblies are preferably mounted so that frame <b>56</b> cannot escape lower frame clamp <b>61</b> during the normal stresses and loads encountered during a relatively high-speed tow over a long distance.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Top frame clamp <b>62</b> and lower frame clamp <b>61</b> are shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>b </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>b</i>, and are further explained here. Top clamp <b>62</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>b</i>, is intended to mount to a structural point and help secure the towed vehicle. Clamp <b>62</b> is a single structural piece that includes a top portion <b>63</b>, a lower bolt-mounting portion <b>64</b>, and reinforcing webs <b>66</b>. There is also an aperture <b>65</b> for a bolt to pass through. Top portion <b>63</b> is rounded to form about a 180&#xb0; curve preferably having a 1&#xbd; inch diameter. Lower frame clamp <b>61</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>b</i>, is also a single structural piece that is preferably, but not necessarily made from several components. Mounting plate <b>81</b> is made from a rectangular piece of steel, shorter in the direction of truck travel, as shown, and includes apertures <b>82</b> for bolts. Clamp lower jaw <b>83</b> is preferably integral with or welded or otherwise secured to mounting plate <b>81</b>. Lower jaw <b>83</b> is also preferably integral with jaw web <b>84</b> and upper jaw <b>85</b>, leaving area <b>86</b> open for engaging a frame member of a truck.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">One method of using the front tow extended saddle includes a way to preserve the dimensional integrity of the truck frame elements, typically made with a C-channel cross-section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The method uses an inner frame spacer block assembly <b>70</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>, to reinforce the truck frame elements. A spacer block <b>71</b> is preferably about 8-10 inches in height, depending on the distance between the inner flange surfaces of the channel, and may be about 2 inches square to 4 inches square, or may alternately have a rectangular cross section. Other heights and cross sections may be used. The spacer block is preferably threaded on its inner surface to accommodate an expansion bolt <b>75</b> for adjusting an overall height of the assembly. Bolt <b>75</b> preferably has an expansion pad <b>73</b> on its upper surface to spread the load that is imposed when the spacer block assembly is inserted between flanges and tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Optionally, there may also be an expansion pad <b>72</b> on the opposite side of spacer block <b>71</b>. The spacer block assembly is placed between the flanges and the height adjusted by threading bolt <b>75</b> further into or out of block <b>71</b>. When the height adjustment is correct, expansion adjustment nut <b>74</b> is tightened. One or more inner frame spacer block assemblies may be used to preserve the dimensional integrity of the truck frame components, such as channels. The inner frame spacer block assembly may also be used with structural members having cross section of different shapes, such as I-beams.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is understood that the front tow extended saddle described herein may have many embodiments and may be used in many ways. Another embodiment of a front tow extended saddle is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. In this embodiment, front tow extended saddle <b>90</b> is equipped with two offset axle security assemblies <b>97</b>. This embodiment is used for applications in which symmetrical axle security members <b>15</b>, described above, will not fit the truck for which a front tow is desired. Extended saddle <b>90</b> includes rear portion <b>91</b>, middle portion <b>92</b>, and front portion <b>93</b>. Middle portion <b>92</b> is preferably pivotally mounted to rear portion <b>91</b> and front portion <b>93</b> by pivot pins <b>94</b>, <b>95</b>, as described above. Lower security assemblies <b>96</b> are used to secure rear portion <b>91</b> to the truck frame, each using two inverted U-bolts and nuts, as are offset axle security assemblies <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each offset axle security member <b>97</b> includes a mounting portion <b>97</b><i>a</i>, flange <b>98</b>, apertures <b>99</b>, and a reinforcing web <b>97</b><i>c</i>. Inner portion <b>97</b><i>b </i>of flange <b>98</b> includes apertures <b>97</b><i>d </i>for the mounting U-bolts. Mounting portion <b>97</b><i>a </i>is preferably made from hollow square or rectangular tubing and, similar to the other security assemblies, has inner dimensions that allow security member <b>97</b> to slide along the rails of rear portion <b>91</b>. Flange <b>98</b> is preferably welded or otherwise rigidly secured to mounting portion <b>97</b><i>a</i>, as is reinforcing web <b>97</b><i>c</i>. Web <b>97</b><i>c </i>is preferably &#xbc;&#x2033; steel plate and is wide enough to act as an excellent reinforcing member, and narrow enough so as not to interfere with tightening the nuts on the U-bolts. It is understood that the lower security members and the axle security members may take on a number of forms in the embodiments of the front tow extended saddle, not all of which are depicted herein simply because of their multiplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref> depict a use for the front tow extended saddle <b>10</b>. A first truck T<b>1</b>, a towing truck, is preferably equipped with a fifth wheel <b>101</b> or a saddle mount <b>110</b> as described above. If the towing truck has a fifth wheel, a fifth wheel pin <b>105</b> on the front tow extended saddle is mounted to the fifth wheel <b>101</b>, allowing for rotation during transport. If the towing truck does not have a fifth wheel, saddle mount <b>110</b> may be mounted on the towing truck to connect the front tow extended saddle. Saddle mount <b>110</b> includes a saddle body <b>112</b>, a saddle head surface plate <b>114</b>, a saddle head <b>116</b>, kingpin <b>118</b>, and J-claws <b>120</b> for grasping the mounting portion <b>14</b> of front tow extended saddle <b>10</b>. The rear portion of front tow extended saddle <b>10</b> is then attached to towed truck T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Embodiments are not limited to a single towed truck, since more than one truck may be towed, so long as the total length limitation for a combination of towing and towed vehicles, currently 97 feet, is not exceeded. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the front tow extended saddle <b>10</b> allows for adjusting the distance between the towed vehicle and the towing vehicle, allowing a somewhat greater distance between the vehicles than the prior art. In either embodiment, with a fifth wheel or a saddle mount, the front axle of the truck being towed, and thus the front wheels, are lifted off the ground only about 8-12 inches, thus minimizing any height increase of the vehicle being towed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, a fourth embodiment of a front tow saddle <b>200</b> of the present invention comprises a forward portion <b>210</b>, vertical portion <b>300</b>, and rear portion <b>500</b>. Forward portion <b>210</b> comprises left and right rails <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, respectively, and one or more horizontal cross members <b>216</b> which are preferably fashioned from rectangular cross-section tubing. The cross members are preferably bolted to the left and right rails. At the front end of forward assembly <b>210</b> is a front plate bracket <b>218</b> bolted to the left and right rails. Front plate bracket <b>218</b> includes an aperture <b>220</b> for connecting the saddle to a towing vehicle via a king pin as is known in the art. Front plate bracket <b>218</b> may also optionally include a bracket panel <b>222</b> which can house a GPS tracking device or similar useful articles.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Powertrain bracket <b>224</b> is connected to the left rail <b>212</b> through the front plate bracket <b>218</b>. Powertrain bracket <b>224</b> includes an aperture <b>226</b> through which pass the electrical wiring and air brake tubing for providing electrical power and braking capacity to the towed vehicle(s). These connections pass through a similar aperture <b>228</b> toward the front of forward left rail <b>212</b> so that the connections may run back along the inside of left rail <b>212</b>, down the vertical portion <b>300</b> and back along the rear portion <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Another novel feature of the improved saddle, incorporated preferably into the forward portion, is a security chamber <b>230</b>. Security chamber <b>230</b> comprises a chamber bracket <b>232</b>, and a lid <b>234</b> connected to bracket <b>232</b> along forward edges <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, respectively. The bracket is designed so that it can be bolted to the inside of left and right rails <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. Depending on the size desired for the security chamber, it can be sized so that it surrounds one or more of the cross members <b>216</b>. Lid <b>234</b> and bracket <b>232</b> also preferably comprise locking tabs <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>, respectively, so that a lock can be provided to secure lid <b>234</b> and bracket <b>232</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Yet another novel feature of the fourth embodiment is a fender tarp to protect the towed vehicle from dirt or damage from road debris, insects and the like that are kicked up by the wheels of the towing vehicle. Toward the forward end of front assembly <b>210</b>, hollow tube <b>250</b> passes through holes <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> in the left and right rails, respectively, and extends several feet horizontally beyond each rail. A corresponding tube <b>260</b> passes and extends through holes <b>262</b> and <b>264</b> toward the rear of forward portion <b>210</b>. And a third tube <b>270</b> passes and extends through holes <b>272</b> and <b>274</b> toward the lower area of vertical portion <b>300</b>. Alternatively, each of tubes <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> and <b>270</b> can comprise multiple tube segments which are bolted to the outer sides of the rails through means known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, left and right fender tarps <b>280</b> and <b>290</b> are disposed on the left and right sides, respectively, of saddle <b>200</b>. Tarps <b>280</b> and <b>290</b> each are provided with an eyehole formation so as to be anchored on tube <b>250</b>. The tarps then pass over tube <b>260</b> and extend downward where they are anchored on tube <b>270</b>. One or both of the anchor ends of tarps <b>280</b> and <b>290</b> are preferably provided with adjustment means known in the art, such as a sewn bungee cord, so that the tarps can be adjusted, loosened or tightened as necessary to accommodate differences in the towing or towed vehicle, or the length of the saddle.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, vertical portion <b>300</b> comprises left and right side panels <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, rear panel <b>330</b> and front panel <b>340</b>. The side panels <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> are affixed to left and right front rails <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, respectively, by a plurality of huck bolts <b>350</b>. Huck bolts are known in the art as a type of bolt that uses special equipment (not shown) to both insert and remove the bolt, in the removal process shearing off and destroying the bolt. The use of huck bolts provides a more secure attachment of the vertical assembly to the front member than standard bolts, yet allows for the two assemblies to be detached reasonably quickly if necessary, unlike welding. Thus, the vertical portion is semi-detachably fixed to the forward portion.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Rear panel <b>330</b> is also attached to side panels <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> through huck bolts, as is front panel <b>340</b>. Front panel <b>340</b> has a lower height than the other panels of vertical assembly <b>300</b> in order to allow clearance for forward portion <b>210</b>.</p>
