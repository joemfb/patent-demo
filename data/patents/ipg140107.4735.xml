<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to hearing prostheses, and more particularly, to a hearing prosthesis having an on-board fitting system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hearing loss, which may be due to many different causes, is generally of two types: conductive and sensorineural. Sensorineural hearing loss is due to the absence or destruction of the hair cells in the cochlea that transduce sound signals into nerve impulses. Conductive hearing loss occurs when the normal mechanical pathways that provide sound to hair cells in the cochlea are impeded, for example, by damage to the ossicular chain or ear canal. However, individuals suffering from conductive hearing loss may retain some form of residual hearing because the hair cells in the cochlea may remain undamaged.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of hearing prostheses provide therapeutic benefits to individuals suffering from conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. For example, electrically-stimulating hearing prostheses such as auditory brain implants (also referred to as ABIs or auditory brain stimulators) and cochlear implants (also commonly referred to as cochlear prostheses, cochlear devices, cochlear implant devices), provide a person having sensorineural hearing loss with the ability to perceive sound. Such electrically stimulating hearing prostheses bypass the hair cells of the cochlea and deliver an electrical stimulation signal directly to the cochlea, the auditory nerve or the brain.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another type of hearing prosthesis, referred to as an acoustic hearing aid or simply hearing aid, provides a person having conductive hearing loss with the ability to perceive sound. Acoustic hearing aids deliver amplified acoustic sounds to the ear canal of a recipient. The amplified sounds are relayed to the cochlea via the ossicular chain, resulting in motion of the cochlea fluid that is perceived by the undamaged hair cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another type of hearing prostheses, often generally referred to as mechanical stimulators, mechanically stimulate a recipient. Some mechanical stimulators, such as middle ear implants or direct acoustic stimulators, directly stimulate the middle ear or the oval or round windows of the cochlea. Other prostheses referred to as bone conduction devices indirectly deliver mechanical stimulation to the cochlea by vibrating the recipient's skull.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The effectiveness of a hearing prosthesis depends not only on the prosthesis itself, but also on the success with which the prosthesis is configured for the individual recipient. Configuring hearing prosthesis for a recipient, also referred to as &#x201c;fitting,&#x201d; &#x201c;programming&#x201d; or &#x201c;mapping,&#x201d; (collectively and generally referred to as &#x201c;fitting&#x201d; herein) has traditionally been considered to be a relatively complex process. Typically, a clinician, audiologist or other medical practitioner (generally and collectively referred to as &#x201c;audiologist&#x201d; herein) uses interactive software and computer hardware to create individualized programs, commands, data, settings, parameters, instructions, and/or other information (generally and collectively referred to as &#x201c;fitting data&#x201d; herein) that are used by the prosthesis to generate the electrical, mechanical and/or acoustic stimulation signals.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of the present invention, a hearing prosthesis is provided. The hearing prosthesis comprises an external component having a physically integrated input interface comprising: operational control interface having one or more interface elements; a fitting control interface having one or more interface elements, wherein at least one of the fitting control interface elements comprises an operational control interface element; a sound processor configured to process received sounds based on predefined fitting data; and an on-board fitting system configured to set the fitting data in response to control inputs received via the fitting control interface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for fitting a hearing prosthesis to a recipient, the prosthesis comprising a sound processor and an external component having an integrated user interface and an on-board fitting system. The method comprises: receiving a control input via the user interface to initiate the on-board fitting system; receiving replies to output indications provided by the on-board fitting system via the user interface to set fitting data; and receiving a control input via the user interface to deactivate the on-board fitting system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a still other embodiment of the present invention, a hearing prosthesis configured to operate in a sound processing mode and a fitting mode is provided. The hearing prosthesis comprises: an external component having an integrated user interface configured to receive user selections of real-time operational parameters of the hearing prosthesis when the hearing prosthesis is in the sound processing mode, and wherein the user interface is configured to receive selections of fitting data when the hearing prosthesis is in the fitting mode; a sound processor configured to process received sounds based on predefined fitting data; and an on-board fitting system configured to set the fitting data in response to control inputs received via the integrated user interface.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Aspects of the present invention are generally directed to a hearing prosthesis having an on-board fitting system controllable via a user interface integrated in an external component of the prosthesis. Implementation of embodiments of the present invention allows fitting of the prosthesis to a recipient via the on-board system without the use of external fitting equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Because the need for external equipment is eliminated, the cost and/or complexity of fitting hearing prostheses implementing embodiments of the present invention is typically less than fitting a conventional hearing prosthesis. In addition, embodiments of the present invention allow fitting to be performed in circumstances in which computerized software and/or clinical support is unavailable. Additional benefits of embodiments of the present invention may vary depending on the particular implementation. For example, some embodiments provide an intuitive and/or simplified fitting procedure conducive to performance by a non-audiologist. In other circumstances, embodiments of the present invention provide a secondary fitting procedure that may support or supplement external fitting equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hearing prostheses in accordance with embodiments of the present invention have several operational states or modes. In one operational state or mode, referred to herein as the fitting mode, the hearing prosthesis is fit to an individual recipient by adjusting or generating fitting data. That is, during the fitting mode, data that is used to process sound, generate stimulation signals, etc., are determined and stored in the prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another operational state or mode, referred to herein as the sound processing mode, the hearing prosthesis delivers stimulation in response to a detected sound. When in the sound processing mode, the prosthesis processes sound and generates stimulation signals in accordance with stored fitting data. While in the sound processing mode, hearing prostheses commonly provide a recipient with the ability to adjust, select or otherwise control real-time operational parameters, such as volume, while the prosthesis is in the sound processing mode. An operational control user interface is provided for such real-time adjustment of operational parameters. Oftentimes, the operational control interface is at least in part physically integrated into the external component of the hearing prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As previously noted, a hearing prosthesis in accordance with embodiments of the present invention also includes a fitting control user interface. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the fitting control interface is separate from the operational control interface; that is, the two interfaces do not share the same interface elements. In other embodiments, one or more of the same interface elements are utilized in both the fitting control interface and the operational control interface. In specific embodiments, all interface elements of the operational control interface are also shared by the fitting control interface.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As previously noted, a number of different hearing prostheses have been developed to rehabilitate a recipient's hearing. The different prostheses may have different configurations and may comprise combinations of internal (implantable) and external components, or solely external or internal components. Of particular interest are prostheses comprising one or more external components. One such prosthesis having an external component is a bone conduction device that, as noted above, indirectly delivers mechanical stimulation to a recipient's cochlea by vibrating the recipient's skull. For ease of description, embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to an exemplary hearing prosthesis, a bone conduction device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary bone conduction device <b>100</b> attached to a recipient. The exemplary recipient of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has an outer ear <b>101</b>, a middle ear <b>102</b> and an inner ear <b>103</b>. However, it would be appreciated that other recipient's may have missing or deformed middle or outer ears.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a fully functional human ear, outer ear <b>101</b> comprises an auricle <b>105</b> and an ear canal <b>106</b>. A sound wave or acoustic pressure <b>107</b> is collected by auricle <b>105</b> and channeled into and through ear canal <b>106</b>. Disposed across the distal end of ear canal <b>106</b> is a tympanic membrane <b>104</b> which vibrates in response to acoustic wave <b>107</b>. This vibration is coupled to oval window or fenestra ovalis <b>110</b> through three bones of middle ear <b>102</b>, collectively referred to as the ossicles <b>111</b> and comprising the malleus <b>112</b>, the incus <b>113</b> and the stapes <b>114</b>. Bones <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> of middle ear <b>102</b> serve to filter and amplify acoustic wave <b>107</b>, causing oval window <b>110</b> to articulate, or vibrate. Such vibration sets up waves of fluid motion within cochlea <b>139</b>. Such fluid motion, in turn, activates tiny hair cells (not shown) that line the inside of cochlea <b>139</b>. Activation of the hair cells causes appropriate nerve impulses to be transferred through spiral ganglion cells (not shown) to auditory nerve <b>116</b> and ultimately to the brain (not shown), where they are perceived as sound.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates the positioning of bone conduction device <b>100</b> relative to outer ear <b>101</b>, middle ear <b>102</b> and inner ear <b>103</b> of a recipient of device <b>100</b>. As shown, bone conduction device <b>100</b> is positioned behind outer ear <b>101</b> of the recipient and comprises a housing <b>120</b>. A sound input element <b>126</b> is positioned in or on housing <b>120</b> and is configured to receive sound signals. Sound input element <b>126</b> may comprise, for example, a microphone, telecoil, etc. It should be appreciated that bone conduction device <b>100</b> may comprise more than one sound input device.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described below, bone conduction device <b>100</b> comprises a sound processor, a transducer that outputs vibration, and/or one or more other components which facilitate operation of the device. Bone conduction device <b>100</b> operates by converting sound signals <b>107</b> received by microphone <b>126</b> into electrical signals. These electrical signals are converted by the sound processor into control signals for use by the transducer. The transducer vibrates in response to such control signals, which in turn causes vibration of the recipient's skull.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Bone conduction device <b>100</b> further includes a coupling <b>140</b> configured to attach the device to the recipient. Coupling <b>140</b> is attached to an anchor system (not shown) implanted in the recipient. An exemplary anchor system (also referred to as a fixation system) may include a percutaneous abutment fixed to the recipient's skull bone <b>136</b>. The abutment extends from bone <b>136</b> through muscle <b>134</b>, fat <b>128</b> and skin <b>132</b> so that coupling <b>140</b> may be attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a functional block diagram of embodiments of bone conduction device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As noted, device <b>100</b> may operate in a sound processing mode and a fitting mode. In the sound processing mode, sound input element <b>126</b> receives a sound signal <b>107</b> and converts it into one or more electrical signals <b>240</b> indicative of the received sound signal. Signals <b>240</b> are processed by a sound processor <b>202</b>, and converted to transducer drive signals <b>212</b>. Drive signals <b>212</b> cause actuation of transducer <b>208</b> that results in vibration of the recipient's skull.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As previously noted, fitting of a bone conduction device for a recipient may be performed using an on-board fitting system and a user interface integrated into the device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a high level flowchart illustrating operations performed during an exemplary fitting process <b>478</b> to fit device <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to a recipient. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a detailed flowchart illustrating one specific embodiment of process <b>478</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown, on-board fitting process begins at step <b>480</b> where a control input initiating the on-board fitting system is received via the integrated user interface. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in step <b>480</b> the recipient initiates on-board fitting process by simultaneously pressing and holding buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b>. The pressing of buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> is schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> by circles <b>570</b>A, <b>570</b>B and <b>570</b>C surrounding each button in the top view of device <b>300</b>. In certain embodiments, fitting process <b>478</b> is initiated by pressing buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> for approximately three seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the recipient presses buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b>, visual indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> display a series of flashes verifying the initiation. In one embodiment, the series of flashes comprise a single long flash from each indicator <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, followed a series of short flashes alternating between the indicators. These flashes are schematically shown by the lines extending from indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> in the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the on-board fitting process is initiated, at step <b>482</b>, the recipient sets one or more fitting data parameters for device <b>300</b> by variously pressing buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> in a predetermined manner. More specifically, as described further below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the system receives recipient replies to a series of output indications provided by on-board fitting system via visual indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b>. After the fitting data parameters are selected, the device receives an indication to deactivate the on-board fitting system at block <b>484</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In certain embodiments, on-board fitting system <b>210</b> may be deactivated in substantially the same manner as it is initiated at step <b>480</b>. Specifically, as shown in the top view of device <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref>, the recipient presses and holds buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> for three seconds. This causes visual indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> to stop flashing, thereby providing an indication that the on-board fitting system was deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As noted above, the recipient sets one or more fitting data parameters during step <b>482</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates one exemplary set of processes that may be implemented during step <b>482</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The exemplary processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> start at step <b>486</b>, where the devices receives an indication of which side of the head bone conduction device <b>300</b> is to be worn. That is, at step <b>486</b> the recipient sets a fitting parameter corresponding to the side of the head on which the recipient will wear device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step <b>486</b>, the recipient selects the desired side of the head by pressing one of the buttons <b>314</b> or <b>310</b>. In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the recipient selects the left side of the head by pressing button <b>314</b>, causing visual indicator <b>316</b> to illuminate. In contrast, the recipient may select the right side of the head by pressing button <b>310</b>. This causes visual indicator <b>318</b> to illuminate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The side fitting data parameter is used by bone conduction device <b>300</b> to, among other things, to set the directionality of the device. For example, bone conduction device <b>300</b> may include one microphone that, when the device is worn by the recipient, faces forward and a microphone that faces backward. In one embodiment, the sound processor only processes sound from the microphone that faces forward (as that is the most likely direction from which someone will talk to the recipient). Accordingly, by setting the side fitting data parameter, one of the two microphones will be disabled, depending on which side of the recipient the bone conduction device is to be used. In an alternate embodiment, the sound processor may process sound received by both microphones. In such embodiments, the sound process may apply weighting factors to the sound received by each of the microphones, depending upon the side fitting parameter selected by the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The selection of the side of head in accordance with embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in a variety of manners. In one exemplary embodiment, the selection is through actuation of a switch disposed on the bone conduction device.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, after the desired side parameter is selected, the user stores the parameter by pressing program button <b>312</b>. This causes both visual indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> to each output two flashes followed by a series of short, alternating flashes, thereby allow the recipient to confirm the parameter was stored.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Following confirmation that the selected side fitting data parameter has been stored, the process advances to step <b>488</b> where the device receives an adjustment of a gain curve fitting data parameter of device <b>300</b>. In other words, the recipient may adjust gain curves that will be utilized by the device to convert sound signals into skull vibrations. In certain embodiments, a default value for a gain curve fitting data parameter is provided, and the recipient may increase the gain 5 dB above the default value, or alternatively, decrease the gain 5 dB below the default value.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph illustrating a default gain curve <b>601</b> extending across a range of sound frequencies generated by the bone conduction device <b>300</b> based on a default gain curve fitting data parameter. Adjusting the gain curve fitting data parameter at step <b>488</b> to increase the gain of the gain curve increases the gain by 5 dB across the depicted frequencies, thereby resulting in curve <b>602</b>. Adjusting the gain curve fitting data parameter at step <b>488</b> to decrease the gain decreases the gain by 5 dB across the depicted frequencies, thereby resulting in curve <b>603</b>. It will be appreciated that adjustment of the gain curve by 5 dB is illustrative and that in some embodiments the gain curve may be adjusted upwards and/or downwards in other increments.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the gain curve fitting data parameter may alternatively be adjusted to decrease the gain from the default gain curve <b>601</b> by pressing button <b>310</b>. This will cause visual indicator <b>316</b> to illuminate. In contrast, the recipient may adjust the gain curve fitting data parameter to increase the gain from the default gain curve <b>601</b> by pressing button <b>314</b>. This causes visual indicator <b>318</b> to illuminate. To return to the default gain curve fitting data parameter setting, the recipient simultaneously presses buttons <b>314</b> and <b>310</b>, thereby causing both indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> to illuminate.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, the user stores the gain curve fitting data parameter by pressing program control <b>312</b>. This causes visual indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> to each output two flashes followed by a series of short, alternating flashes, thereby allowing the recipient to confirm the parameter has been stored.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one alternative embodiment, a recipient may press buttons <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> for a period of time to effect the desired change in the gain curve fitting data parameter. For example, the recipient may press button <b>310</b> for a period of two seconds to adjust the gain curve fitting data parameter to decrease the gain curve by two increments (e.g., from gain curve <b>602</b> to gain curve <b>603</b>). Alternatively, the recipient may press button <b>310</b> two separate times to adjust the gain curve fitting data parameter to decrease the gain curve by the same two increments.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Returning to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, after setting the gain curve fitting data parameter, the gain curve may be further adjusted by optionally receiving a selection of a low cut fitting data parameter at step <b>490</b>. That is, the recipient may cause the device to operate in a low cut mode, or in default mode. In the low cut mode, the gain of the device is attenuated in the lower frequencies as compared to the default mode.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph illustrating a gain curve <b>701</b> over a range of sound frequencies in a default mode of bone conduction device <b>300</b>, and a gain curve <b>702</b> over that same range of frequencies when the bone conduction device is operating in the low cut mode. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when in the low cut mode, the gain of the lower frequencies is reduced by as much as 9 dB as compared to the default settings. However, in low cut mode, the gain in the mid to high range frequencies is substantially the same as in the default mode, with a slight downward deviation at the high frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, the default mode is selected by pressing button <b>310</b>. This will cause visual indicator <b>316</b> to illuminate. In contrast, the recipient may change the low cut fitting data parameters by pressing button <b>314</b>, to select the low cut mode. This causes visual indicator <b>318</b> to illuminate. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>, the recipient stores the selected low cut fitting data parameters by pressing button <b>312</b>. This causes visual indicators to each output two flashes followed by a series of short, alternating flashes, which allow the recipient to confirm the low cut fitting data parameters have been stored, and that the bone conduction device <b>300</b> will operate in the low cut mode or the default mode when in the sound processing operational mode.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, at step <b>492</b> the device may receive a selection of the status of visual indicators <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> prior to completion of the fitting process <b>478</b>. Specifically, the recipient may select an indication fitting data parameter such that output interface <b>324</b> will not provide indications to the recipient following completion of fitting process <b>478</b>. Alternatively, the recipient may select an indication fitting data parameter such that output interface <b>324</b> will provide indications after completion of fitting process <b>478</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref>, the indication fitting data parameter is set to turn off LEDs <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> and/or speaker <b>321</b> by pressing button <b>310</b>. This will cause visual indicator <b>316</b> to illuminate. In contrast, the recipient may set the indication fitting data parameter to an on configuration by pressing button <b>314</b>. This causes visual indicator <b>318</b> to illuminate. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref>, the user stores the selected indication fitting data parameter by pressing program control <b>312</b>. This causes visual indicators to each output two flashes followed by a series of short, alternating flashes, thereby allowing the recipient to confirm the mode has been stored. Following storage of this final parameter, the fitting process returns to block <b>484</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> for deactivation of the on-board fitting system. In alternative embodiments, the recipient has the option to re-perform steps <b>486</b>-<b>492</b> to change any of the selected parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As previously noted, the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> are merely illustrative. As such, one or more these may be omitted and/or other fitting steps may be included. For example, in certain embodiments the fitting data includes the selection of a functionality parameter. In these embodiments, the on-board fitting system turns on or off certain functionality, such as beamforming, power saving operations, etc., based on a user input.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In certain embodiments of the present invention, following completion of fitting process <b>478</b>, bone conduction device <b>300</b> may be placed into a tamper proof or key lock mode. The key lock mode locks the controls of bone conduction device <b>300</b> so that pressing buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and/or <b>314</b> will have no effect. Depending on the embodiment, the key lock mode may or may not be part of the fitting process. That is, in some embodiments, to enter the key lock mode, the on-board fitting system must be activated, while in other embodiments the key lock mode may be initiated at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5K</figref>, to enter the key lock mode, the recipient simultaneously presses buttons <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> for five seconds. After the five seconds have elapsed, the buttons of the bone conduction device will be locked, and, as such, pressing buttons <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> will have no effect. Once the keys are locked, visual indicator <b>316</b> will flash three short flashes.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref>, to exit the key lock mode, the recipient again simultaneously presses buttons <b>310</b> and <b>314</b> for five seconds. Once the buttons are unlocked, visual indicator <b>318</b> will flash three short flashes.</p>
