<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage application under 35 USC 371 of International Application No. PCT/AU2009/001447, filed Nov. 6, 2009, which claims the priority of Australian Application No. 2008-905769, filed Nov. 7, 2008, the contents of which prior applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mounting for a replaceable tool as well as mounted replaceable tools and methods of operation of machines such as ground-engaging or surface mining machines. An example of surface mining machines concerns such machines typically having rotating drums with projecting replaceable picks which are operated to break-up and convey ore at a mining location for collection into trucks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is not confined to arrangements applicable only to such surface mining machines but the application to these machines will be given by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically a surface mining machine has a rotatable drum having pick holders welded to the drum periphery at spaced locations and each adapted to receive a replaceable pick. The pick typically has a bulbous head with hard-surfacing and a cylindrical mounting shaft which is intended to be a sliding fit in a receiving aperture in a pick holder. A spring clip surrounds a reduced diameter mid-portion of the shaft and resiliently retains the pick in the holder. In one arrangement the pick is designed to rotate in use but, due to the ingress of particulate material and general wear and tear, such rotation may cease thereby causing accelerated wear to the pick and also the holder.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Whereas the pick is typically installed with a suitable mallet, it is arranged to be removed by pressure to a rear end-face of the shaft applied through a jack. Due to wear and tear, removal may be problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since such surface mining machines represent a very high capital investment, machine downtime for servicing of worn parts is a critical economic factor. It has been found that typically the tool holders will need regular replacement and typically the tool holders are welded to the drum and have angled apertures relative the drum radial direction for mounting the shaft of a pick. The downtime required to cut-off worn tool holders and weld on replacement holders is considerable and requires significant on-site skill and appropriate equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to providing a system which is aimed at reducing downtime for replacing worn components and may be implemented in various embodiments offering various advantages. Whereas one embodiment is to suit surface mining machines as described above, other embodiments can suit other machines and other pick or tool designs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect the invention consists in a mounting for a replaceable tool on a ground-engaging machine, the mounting having a tool holder having an aperture extending into a body portion of the tool holder for receiving a projecting mounting portion of the tool, the tool holder having an inter-engagement structure for mechanically engaging with a base having a complementary structure, the base being adapted to be fixed to the machine, and the mounting further having retaining means for cooperating with the holder and the tool when installed to retain the holder on the base.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the tool is designed to rotate about the axis of the projecting mounting portion and the aperture is of circular cross-section and is such that the tool can normally rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments the retainer is adapted to interengage with the base in addition to the holder and the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention may also be defined as subsisting in the tool holder with its retainer and the base and may further extend to the combination of components when the tool is installed. Thus in another aspect, the invention consists in a tool mount for use on a ground engaging machine, the tool mount comprising a tool, a tool holder, a retainer and a base, the base being adapted to be secured to a ground engaging machine adapted to rotate about its axis, the tool having an axis substantially parallel to the axis of the machine, the tool holder having an aperture therethrough for receiving a projecting shaft portion of the tool for mounting the tool and the tool holder having a shaped body portion adapted to interengage in a correspondingly shaped body portion of the base whereby the tool holder is movable in the axial direction but restrained from movement transverse to the axial direction by the retainer when installed, the tool holder having a portion for receiving the retainer, the retainer having a recess for receiving therein an end portion of the projection from the tool and the tool thereby being mounted to be rotatable around the axis but normally to be retained in engagement in the aperture and the recess, the retainer further having an inter-engagement structure for engaging with a complementary inter-engagement structure of the base and of the tool holder whereby the tool holder is restrained from axial movement upon installation of the retainer, the retainer, tool holder and base cooperating to define a recess defined between an axially facing end wall of the base whereby a pressure exerting element can be inserted into the recess between the end wall and the end of the projection shaft of the tool so that, on activation the pressure exerting element, the tool is axially displaced out of engagement with the retainer and the tool holder, whereby the tool may be replaced after a period of servicing when it is worn and thereby as necessary permitting a removal of the retainer and tool holder and their replacement if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Conveniently the wear tool can be in the form of a bulbous hard-surfaced head and a mounting shaft of circular cross-section adapted to be push-fitted into a corresponding aperture extending through the holder with a friction arrangement to permit the shaft to rotate relative to the holder but to be retained in the holder in a manner removable by the application of axial force on the shaft through a suitable tool.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, broadly the invention is directed to a method of operating a ground-engaging machine comprising fixing a base as described in the first aspect of the invention above to an element of the machine which is to be moved when used, fixing a tool holder on the base by inter-engaging of complementary parts and using a retainer and a tool to cooperate with the holder to secure the holder on the base and thereby mount the tool for operational use, and periodically replacing each tool and as required the corresponding holder and, if required, the associated retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An important embodiment of the invention may be defined as consisting in a mounting for a replaceable tool on a ground engaging machine, the mounting having a base to be attached to the machine and profiled for inter-fitting with a tool holder having an aperture for receiving a projecting mounting portion of the tool and extending along the axis of the mounting portion and away from a ground-engaging head; the base having engagement elements for interengagement under by relative movement in a direction along the axis, with a tool holder which is arranged to receive a retainer inserted into a transverse direction to the axis, the base having interengagement means to co-operate with corresponding elements of the retainer to prevent relative movement in an axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The holder may be arranged to be installed on the base by motion in a direction parallel to the axis of the aperture (in which the tool projection i to extend) and the retainer may be configured to be installed in a direction normal to the axis to align its recess with the aperture of the holder whereby, when the tool is installed, its projection extends through the aperture and the recess and the engagement elements respectively of the holder and the base resist lateral relative displacement transverse to the defined axis and the cooperating further engagement elements of the retainer and the base prevent relative motion parallel with the axis.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The retainer and the base may be profiled to provide a part cylindrical cavity having an end-wall spaced from and confronting an end-face of the projection of the tool when installed, whereby a jack may be inserted to provide pressure to remove a worn tool and to permit its replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The arrangement in a preferred embodiment is that once the tool has been removed, no more than simple hand tools are needed to eject the retainer from its installed position thereby permitting simple removal of the holder.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the invention lend themselves to a simple and speedy replacement of worn components and in particular, a replaceable tool holder. By having a component separate from the base and retained by a simple retainer, various advantages can be achieved. For example, different metals may be used for different components and if desired, for example, the holder could have its aperture defined by a specially selected metal sleeve for wear resistant purposes. These factors will be appreciated to have great significance when the harsh environment of the mining operation is considered with wear and tear caused by vibration, corrosion, impact and ingress of fine particles.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The embodiment of the drawings is adapted to be mounted on a cylindrical drum of a surface mining machine where the ore to be broken up is engaged by suitable tools having a hard faced surface such as the tools in the form of a pick <b>10</b> shown in the drawings. The illustrated pick is known in the present art and comprises a head <b>12</b> having a hard facing, a base <b>14</b> and a mounting shaft <b>16</b> of circular cross section and comprising cylindrical front and rear shaft portions <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> with an intermediate shaft portion <b>22</b> of reduced diameter accommodating a spring steel circlip <b>24</b>. The shaft <b>16</b> is a sliding fit in a cylindrical aperture <b>26</b> of a tool holder so that the shaft is rotatable within the aperture <b>26</b> yet the spring clip <b>24</b> frictionally retains the pick <b>10</b> from falling out of the aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tool holder <b>28</b> is adapted to be mounted on a base <b>30</b> and secured in position by a retainer <b>32</b> in combination with the shaft <b>16</b> of the pick. The base <b>30</b> has a cylindrically curved bottom surface <b>34</b> for engaging on the surface of a rotating drum of the ground mining machine and it is adapted to be welded thereto. The base <b>30</b> in the present embodiment is generally not susceptible to significant wear and therefore should have a long working life. The base <b>30</b> has front and rear walls <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> and a major cavity <b>40</b> for accommodating the tool holder <b>28</b> with, at the rear end, a half cylindrical rear cavity <b>42</b> having a transverse rear wall <b>44</b> for accommodating a pick ejection jack which operates between the wall <b>44</b> and the confronting rear face <b>20</b>A of the rear shaft portion <b>20</b> of the pick <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows more clearly the lower portion of the cavity <b>40</b> which accommodates a generally T-shaped base portion <b>46</b> of the tool holder <b>28</b>. The base portion <b>46</b> comprises a reduced-thickness intermediate portion <b>46</b>A and a curved T-shaped head <b>46</b>B. As well shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the tool holder has an upper cradle-shaped extension <b>47</b> with a rearward extension providing on each side, a shouldered recess <b>52</b> for accommodating respective engagement feet <b>53</b> of the retainer <b>32</b>, which has inner faces <b>55</b> contoured to match the cylindrical profile of the cradle-shaped portion <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The retainer <b>32</b> has a circular cross-sectional aperture <b>54</b> in which the shaft portion <b>20</b> is a sliding fit, but can rotate with the spring clip <b>24</b> also retaining the shaft portion in the retainer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the base <b>30</b> is welded to the drum of the machine, a pick <b>10</b> can readily be installed by firstly displacing the tool holder <b>28</b> axially relative to its aperture <b>26</b> so that the cradle <b>47</b> and base portion <b>46</b> securely engage in a complimentary structure of the base, thereby preventing the holder <b>28</b> moving normal to the axis.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the retainer <b>32</b> is installed, the feet <b>53</b> engage in corresponding slots <b>58</b> in the side walls of the base <b>30</b> and the arcuate front engagement element <b>50</b> of the retainer <b>32</b> engages into corresponding side slots <b>48</b> in the tool holder <b>28</b>. Thus there is restriction to axial movement of the parts relative to one another. Finally inter engagement is achieved by insertion of the shaft <b>16</b> of the pick <b>10</b> through the aperture <b>26</b> in the holder <b>28</b> and through the aperture <b>54</b> in the retainer <b>32</b>. Thus the components are held relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">However, disassembly and replacement of worn parts (typically the pick <b>10</b> and the holder <b>28</b>) can be easily accomplished by inserting a screw jack between an end face <b>20</b>A of the shaft <b>16</b> and the transverse rear wall <b>44</b> in the base. Activation of the screw jack presses the pick axially and outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Plainly different materials can readily be used for the different components. The base <b>30</b> needs to be of a weldable grade of steel but other grades can be used for the other components. For example white iron might be used for the tool holder <b>28</b> so it may have great durability and resistance to wear.</p>
