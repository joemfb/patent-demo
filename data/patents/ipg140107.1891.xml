<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A delivery system for use with a prosthetic heart valve having a stent frame to which a valve structure is attached includes a shaft assembly including a distal end, an intermediate portion, and a first coupling structure disposed near the distal end and configured to be coupled to a distal end of the prosthetic heart valve via a first tether. A sheath assembly defines a lumen sized to slidably receive the shaft assembly. The delivery system is configured to transition from a loaded state in which the sheath assembly encompasses the prosthetic heart valve to a deployed state in which the sheath assembly is withdrawn from the prosthetic heart valve. The first coupling structure is configured to be manipulated in a first direction to provide a controlled expansion or contraction of the distal end of the prosthetic heart valve.</p>

No. 61/326,310, filed Apr. 21, 2010, entitled &#x201c;Transcatheter Prosthetic Heart Valve Delivery System and Method With Controlled Expansion of Prosthetic Heart Valve&#x201d;, and bearing Attorney Docket No. P0035343.00/M190.376.101; the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for percutaneous implantation of a heart valve prosthesis. More particularly, it relates to delivery systems and methods for transcatheter implantation of a stented prosthetic heart valve.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heart valves, such as the mitral, tricuspid, aortic, and pulmonary valves, are sometimes damaged by disease or by aging, resulting in problems with the proper functioning of the valve. Heart valve problems generally take one of two forms: stenosis in which a valve does not open completely or the opening is too small, resulting in restricted blood flow; or insufficiency in which blood leaks backward across a valve when it should be closed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Heart valve replacement has become a routine surgical procedure for patients suffering from valve regurgitation or stenotic calcification of the leaflets. Conventionally, the vast majority of valve replacements entail full stenotomy in placing the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass. Traditional open surgery inflicts significant patient trauma and discomfort, requires extensive recuperation times, and may result in life-threatening complications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address these concerns, within the last decade, efforts have been made to perform cardiac valve replacements using minimally-invasive techniques. In these methods, laparoscopic instruments are employed to make small openings through the patient's ribs to provide access to the heart. While considerable effort has been devoted to such techniques, widespread acceptance has been limited by the clinician's ability to access only certain regions of the heart using laparoscopic instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Still other efforts have been focused upon percutaneous transcatheter (or transluminal) delivery of replacement cardiac valves to solve the problems presented by traditional open surgery and minimally-invasive surgical methods. In such methods, a valve prosthesis is compacted for delivery in a catheter and then advanced, for example through an opening in the femoral artery and through the descending aorta to the heart, where the prosthesis is then deployed in the valve annulus (e.g., the aortic valve annulus).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various types and configurations of prosthetic heart valves are used in percutaneous valve procedures to replace diseased natural human heart valves. The actual shape and configuration of any particular prosthetic heart valve is dependent to some extent upon the valve being replaced (i.e., mitral valve, tricuspid valve, aortic valve, or pulmonary valve). In general, prosthetic heart valve designs attempt to replicate the function of the valve being replaced and thus will include valve leaflet-like structures used with either bioprostheses or mechanical heart valve prostheses. If bioprostheses are selected, the replacement valves may include a valved vein segment or pericardial manufactured tissue valve that is mounted in some manner within an expandable stent frame to make a valved stent. In order to prepare such a valve for percutaneous implantation, one type of valved stent can be initially provided in an expanded or uncrimped condition, then crimped or compressed around a balloon portion of a catheter until it is close to the diameter of the catheter. In other percutaneous implantation systems, the stent frame of the valved stent can be made of a self-expanding material. With these systems, the valved stent is crimped down to a desired size and held in that compressed state with a sheath, for example. Retracting the sheath from this valved stent allows the stent to expand to a larger diameter, such as when the valved stent is in a desired position within a patient. With either of these types of percutaneous stent delivery systems, conventional sewing of the prosthetic heart valve to the patient's native tissue is typically not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is imperative that the stented heart valve prosthesis be accurately located relative to the native annulus prior to full deployment from the catheter. Successful implantation requires that the transcatheter prosthetic heart valve intimately lodge and seal against the native annulus. A self-expanding transcatheter heart valve must have a high radial force when expanding to properly anchor itself in the anatomy of the heart. If the prosthetic is incorrectly positioned relative to the native annulus, serious complications can result as the deployed device will leak and even may dislodge from the implantation site. Greatly complicating this effort is the fact that once the heart valve prosthesis (e.g., a self-deploying stent) is deployed from the catheter, it is exceedingly difficult to re-collapse or &#x201c;recapture&#x201d; the prosthetic with conventional delivery tools (e.g., an outer sheath or catheter). This same concern does not arise in the context of other vascular stents; with these procedures, if the target site was &#x201c;missed,&#x201d; another stent is simply deployed to &#x201c;make-up&#x201d; the difference. In short, recapturing a deployed or partially deployed stent-based device is unique to transcatheter heart valves.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While imaging technology can be employed as part of the implantation procedure to assist a clinician in better evaluating a location of the transcatheter prosthetic heart valve immediately prior to deployment, in many instances, this evaluation alone is insufficient. Instead, clinicians desire the ability to partially deploy the prosthesis and then evaluate a position relative to the native annulus prior to full deployment. While in theory the &#x201c;re-capturing&#x201d; of a partially deployed stented prosthetic heart valve is straight forward, in actual practice, the constraints presented by the implantation site and the stented heart valve itself render the technique exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In light of the above, although there have been advances in percutaneous valve replacement techniques and devices, there is a continued desired to provide different delivery systems for delivering and repositioning cardiac replacement valves, and in particular self-expanding stented prosthetic heart valves, to an implantation site in a minimally invasive and percutaneous manner. There is also a continuing desire to be able to provide a more controlled deployment of replacement valves, and to be able to reposition and/or retract the valves once they have been deployed or partially deployed in order to ensure optimal placement of the valves within the patient.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> are diagrams illustrating a system <b>100</b> for delivering a transcatheter prosthetic heart valve to an implantation site according to one embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment, the system <b>100</b> includes a shaft assembly <b>110</b> and a sheath assembly <b>106</b>. The shaft assembly <b>110</b> includes a handle device <b>112</b>, a carrier shaft <b>120</b>, a connector shaft <b>115</b>, a nose cone <b>102</b>, a coupling structure <b>126</b>, and a sleeve <b>124</b>. The connector shaft <b>115</b> interconnects the carrier shaft <b>120</b> and the nose cone <b>102</b>, and in some constructions has a reduced-sized diameter to permit placement of a prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> over the connector shaft <b>115</b>. The nose cone <b>102</b> is disposed at the distal end of the shaft assembly <b>110</b>. Though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, a guide wire lumen can be formed through the shafts <b>115</b> and <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Carrier shaft <b>120</b> is sized to be slidably received within the sheath assembly <b>106</b>, and is configured in the illustrated embodiment for releasable coupling with the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>. The carrier shaft <b>120</b> forms or includes a coupling device <b>117</b>. The coupling device <b>117</b> is configured to selectively retain a proximal portion of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>. The coupling device <b>117</b> is configured to releasably mount the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> to the shaft assembly <b>110</b> when the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is forced to a collapsed state within the sheath assembly <b>106</b>. In this collapsed state, then, the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> will longitudinally move with movement of the shaft assembly <b>110</b>. The sheath assembly <b>106</b> is configured to permit deployment of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> from the loaded state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. The delivery system <b>100</b> is configured to transition from the loaded state in which the sheath assembly <b>106</b> encompasses the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> to a deployed state in which the sheath assembly <b>106</b> is withdrawn from the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sleeve <b>124</b> and the coupling structure <b>126</b> are disposed near the distal end of the shaft assembly <b>110</b>. The sleeve <b>124</b> and the coupling structure <b>126</b> are attached to a proximal end of the nose cone <b>102</b>, and extend proximally from the proximal end of the nose cone <b>102</b> toward the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the coupling structure <b>126</b> is a coil spring. In one embodiment, the sleeve <b>124</b> is a transparent tube and covers at least a portion of the coupling structure <b>126</b>. The distal end of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is releasably coupled to the coupling structure <b>126</b> via a tether <b>122</b>, such as a suture. In one embodiment, the tether <b>122</b> includes a first portion that forms a loop, which is attached to the distal end of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>, and a second portion, which is attached to the coupling structure <b>126</b>. The coupling structure <b>126</b> is configured to be rotated to provide a controlled expansion and contraction of the distal end of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, a clinician rotates the handle device <b>112</b> in a desired direction (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise), which causes a corresponding rotation of the shaft assembly <b>110</b>, including the coupling structure <b>126</b>. The coupling structure <b>126</b> is also configured to be longitudinally translated to provide a controlled expansion and contraction of the distal end of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, a clinician longitudinally translates the handle device <b>112</b> in a desired direction (e.g., in a proximal direction or in a distal direction), which causes a corresponding longitudinally translation of the shaft assembly <b>110</b>, including the coupling structure <b>126</b>. The sleeve <b>124</b> helps to guide the tether <b>122</b> during the expansion and contraction of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The nose cone <b>102</b> can assume a variety of forms, and is generally constructed to facilitate atraumatic placement of the delivery system <b>100</b> through a patient's vasculature and heart. The handle device <b>112</b> is mounted or connected to a proximal end of the carrier shaft <b>120</b>, and provides a convenient surface for grasping by a clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sheath assembly <b>106</b> generally includes a sheath <b>104</b> and a handle device <b>108</b>. The sheath <b>104</b> can be of a conventional catheter-like configuration (e.g., biocompatible polymer with or without an encapsulated wire braiding). In some constructions, the sheath <b>104</b> can further incorporate various steering features. Regardless, the sheath <b>104</b> is generally compliant, and is able to traverse the tortuous pathways associated with transcatheter heart valve implantation. The handle device <b>108</b> can assume a wide variety of forms, and is generally mounted or connected to a proximal end of the sheath <b>104</b>. The sheath <b>104</b> defines a lumen sized to slidably receive the carrier shaft <b>120</b>, as well as the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> in the collapsed state.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The delivery system <b>100</b> is operable to deliver or implant the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> as described in further detail below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate the system <b>100</b> loaded with the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> prior to deployment. In particular, the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is connected to the carrier shaft <b>120</b>, for example via the coupling device <b>117</b>, and is radially constrained within the sheath <b>104</b>. The delivery system <b>100</b> is configured to be operable to transition from a loaded state in which the sheath <b>104</b> encompasses the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> to a deployed state in which the sheath <b>104</b> is withdrawn from the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> to permit the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> to self-expand to a natural arrangement and release from the delivery system <b>100</b>, as described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The loaded delivery system <b>100</b> is advanced toward the implantation target site, for example in a retrograde manner through a cut-down to the femoral artery and into the patient's descending aorta. The delivery system <b>100</b> is then advanced, under fluoroscopic guidance, over the aortic arch, through the ascending aorta, and midway across the defective aortic valve (for aortic replacement). After positioning of the delivery system <b>100</b>, the sheath <b>104</b> is partially retracted relative to the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. For example, the handle device <b>108</b> provided with the sheath assembly <b>106</b> is retracted toward the handle device <b>112</b> of the shaft assembly <b>110</b>. As shown, a distal region <b>130</b> of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is thus exteriorly exposed relative to the sheath <b>104</b>, and begins to self-expand and self-deploy. However, the self-expansion of the distal region <b>130</b> of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is controllably restrained in one embodiment by coupling structure <b>126</b> and tether <b>122</b>. The prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is allowed to gradually self-expand by rotating coupling structure <b>126</b> in a first direction (e.g., in a clockwise direction) via the handle device <b>112</b>. As the coupling structure <b>126</b> is rotated in the first direction, the end portion of the tether <b>122</b> attached to the coupling structure <b>126</b> moves in the proximal direction, which loosens the loop portion of the tether <b>122</b> attached to the distal end of the valve <b>114</b>, and allows the distal end of the valve <b>114</b> to self-expand.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">This proximal retraction of the sheath <b>104</b> and controlled expansion of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> continues, with a continually increasing length of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> being exposed and thus partially deployed, until the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is fully deployed at the native heart valve. In one embodiment, continued rotation of the coupling structure <b>126</b> in the first direction causes the tether <b>122</b> to eventually slide off the proximal end of the coupling structure and thereby be released from the coupling structure <b>126</b>. In this embodiment, the tether <b>122</b> remains attached to the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>. In another embodiment, the tether <b>122</b> is configured to remain attached to the coupling structure <b>126</b> and is configured to be released from the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Prior to full deployment, the position of the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> relative to the implant site may also be evaluated when it is in a partially deployed state, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In the event the clinician believes, based upon the above evaluation, that the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> should be repositioned relative to the implant site, the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is first contracted or &#x201c;resheathed&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The resheathing process according to one embodiment involves rotating coupling structure <b>126</b> in a second direction (e.g., in a counterclockwise direction) opposite the first direction via the handle device <b>112</b>. As the coupling structure <b>126</b> is rotated in the second direction, the end portion of the tether <b>122</b> attached to the coupling structure <b>126</b> is pulled and moves in the distal direction, which reduces the size of the loop portion of the tether <b>122</b> attached to the distal end of the valve <b>114</b>, and contracts the distal end of the valve <b>114</b>. The sheath <b>104</b> is then advanced distally relative to the shaft assembly <b>110</b>, and thus relative to the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b>. Distal movement of the sheath <b>104</b> continues until the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is fully resheathed within the sheath <b>104</b>. Once the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> is resheathed or recaptured, the system <b>100</b> can be repositioned relative to the implantation site, and the process repeated until the clinician is comfortable with the achieved positioning. Alternatively, the resheathed prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> can be removed from the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The delivery system <b>100</b> is useful with a variety of different configurations of a stented prosthetic heart valve. In general terms, the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> includes a stent frame maintaining a valve structure (tissue or synthetic), with the stent frame having a normal, expanded state and collapsible to a collapsed state for loading within the system <b>100</b>. The stent frame can be constructed to self-deploy or self-expand when released from the delivery system <b>100</b>, or a separate expansion member can be provided (e.g., an expansion balloon). For example, the prosthetic heart valve <b>114</b> can be a prosthetic sold under the trade name CoreValve&#xae; available from Medtronic CoreValve, LLC. Other non-limiting examples of transcatheter heart valve prostheses useful with the system <b>100</b> are described in U.S. Publication Nos. 2006/0265056; 2007/0239266; and 2007/0239269; the teachings of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
