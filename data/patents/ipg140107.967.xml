<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Stovetop fires are among the more prevalent of resident fire hazards and smoke detectors are among the most prevalent and economical forms of residential fire alarms. Automatic stovetop fire extinguishers can prevent property damage and even personal injury; however, these stovetop fire extinguishers may also limit smoke emissions and the subsequent detection of smoke. While an initial fire may be efficiently subdued by an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher, it is often desirable to alert present and future occupants of a fire hazardous condition. A sound based fire alarm system and method are described herein, which detects a sound burst emitted upon deployment of an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher and triggers a continuous fire alarm to alert occupants of a potentially fire hazardous condition. Alarm signals can be audible, visual, or both. The system may be a stand alone system and use battery power for affordability and ease of installation. The method described herein enables the ready and automatic extinguishment of a stovetop fire, while alerting those in the surrounding area or those in adjacent dwellings of a fire situation.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fire alarm system and method, and more particularly to a sound based fire detection and fire alarm system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional fire alarm systems are frequently part of a conventional home security system. Security sensors include motion detectors, while conventional fire sensors include smoke detectors and heat detectors. The home security system typically has a control panel, which receives sensor input and sends sensor commands. In addition to sensors, the home security system may comprise various warning lights, horns, bells and the like. These home fire and security systems add significant costs to the home and may be found in large homes or higher priced homes. Surveillance and monitoring service may also be incorporated into a fire and security system at an additional recurring service expense.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional self contained smoke detectors are less expensive the systems referenced supra and are common in residential dwellings and may be required for insurance purposes. These battery operated units detect smoke via various means and provide a loud alert for occupants when smoke is detected. Smoke detectors are often positioned away from the cooking area to avoid nuisance alarms. Other conventional fire detectors sense heat but are less common. Commercial buildings may use self contained smoke detectors, a fire and security system, or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Stovetop fires, in particular, are a well known residential and commercial hazard. An unattended stovetop fire, for example a grease fire, can cause damage to nearby appliances and cabinets. Worse, stovetop fires can lead to structural damage or personal injury. Because the propensity for stovetop fires is so pervasive, an efficient means of automatic fire suppression is desired. Even if a stovetop fire is attended, an automatic extinguishing method may be more effective and expedient compared to manual means.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are a number of conventional fire extinguishing systems, to include automatic stovetop fire extinguishers. Conventional fire extinguishers include, for example, the automatic stovetop fire extinguisher taught by Williams, U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,075. The unit can be readily mounted over a stovetop and upon detection of flames, the extinguisher releases a fire suppressant. While release of fire suppressant may extinguish a current fire, a smoke alarm, as a consequence, may not be triggered to alert occupants of the present deployment of fire suppressant and any potential for subsequent additional fires. To avoid an unwarranted smoke alarm trigger, the conventional smoke alarm in a typical residence is not placed near the cooking area. This typical proximity may decrease the likelihood of the smoke detector triggering upon activation of a distant automatic stovetop fire extinguisher.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be desirable to provide an automatic fire extinguisher and fire alarm system which suppressed any present flames while alerting building occupants of the hazardous situation. Depending on the applicable fire code, the building environment, and building residents themselves, a fire system may be required to have both extinguishment and alert functions. As, an example, it may desirable or required by fire codes to alert the neighboring apartments or dorm rooms of a fire hazard condition in an adjacent dwelling. For a multitude of situations, it would be desirable to provide an efficient and economical stovetop fire extinguisher and fire alert system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an audible fire alarm upon deployment of an automatic fire extinguisher. Aspects of the present invention provide below are neither exhaustive nor exclusive.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention, as defined by the claims, may be better understood by reference to the following detailed description. The description is meant to be read with reference to the figures contained herein. This detailed description relates to examples of the claimed subject matter for illustrative purposes, and is in no way meant to limit the scope of the invention. The specific aspects and embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a sound based fire alarm system employed near a stovetop, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. An automatic stovetop fire extinguisher <b>102</b> is mounted above a stovetop <b>105</b>. Mounted on a nearby wall is a sound based fire alarm unit <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a block diagram of a sound based fire alarm system <b>110</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The sound based fire alarm system <b>110</b> comprises a sensor <b>112</b>, sensor circuitry <b>120</b>, control circuitry <b>140</b>, alarm circuitry <b>160</b>, and an alarm indicator <b>180</b>. In the particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the alarm indicator <b>180</b> is provided by a speaker. Additional and/or alternative alarm indicators are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, sensor <b>112</b> is a microphone. Different embodiments of the present invention employ different microphone types. A measurement, or condenser, microphone provides an output signal corresponding to the sound pressure level of the sensed signal. The present invention may be readily employed with an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher <b>102</b>, for example a STOVETOP FIRESTOP (Williams-Pyro, Inc., Fort Worth, Tex., U.S.A). As described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/240,081, referenced above, a near 140 decibel burst is emitted upon ignition of the black powder substitute propellant comprised in a STOVETOP FIRESTOP fire suppressor. By placing a sound based fire alarm <b>110</b> in the vicinity of automatic fire suppressor <b>102</b>, sensor <b>112</b> will sense the near 140 decibel burst if the automatic fire extinguisher deploys. Distinction of ambient sounds from the sound burst generated by the automatic stovetop fire extinguisher is performed before triggering of the sound based fire alarm, which provides a continuous alarm signal to occupants.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternate embodiment a diffuse field measurement microphone, which measures sound waves from all directions, is employed as the sound sensor <b>112</b>. A desirable diffuse field microphone, for use in the present invention, has a dynamic range comparable to the signature power spectral density of the fire suppressor's sound emission. According to an exemplary embodiment, the microphone has a maximum sound pressure level of at least 150 decibels and a frequency response spanning the narrow bandwidth of the fire suppressor's sound emission frequency, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. In yet another embodiment, a near field microphone is employed in a sound based fire alarm system. Near field microphones are particularly suited for embodiments which enable mounting of the sound based alarm <b>110</b>, or just the sensor <b>112</b>, near the stovetop area <b>106</b>, and more particularly, near the stovetop fire extinguisher <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of a sound based fire alarm system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Sound sensor <b>212</b>, microphone, is electrically connected to sensor circuitry <b>220</b>. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a battery power supply is provided within sensor circuitry <b>220</b>. Battery power supply <b>222</b> provides a number of desirable aspects, which include a stand alone system, affordability and ready incorporation into an existing automatic stovetop fire suppression system. Sensor circuitry <b>220</b> includes a filter <b>224</b> and may include an amplifier <b>223</b>. In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, sensor circuitry <b>220</b> and sensor <b>212</b> are contained in a same housing. In alternate embodiments, amplification and filtering of sound waves may be accomplished using circuitry within a microphone housing. In still another embodiment, a microphone sensor <b>212</b> is accessorized with a digital signal output proportional to a sound pressure level in decibels or nepers. The output of the sensor circuitry is electrically connected to control circuitry <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Control circuitry <b>240</b> determines the presence of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher from the output of the sensor circuitry <b>220</b>. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, logic circuitry <b>241</b>, a microcontroller <b>242</b>, or a combination of both can be used to detect the sound emission of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher. Any of a number of signal characteristics may be assessed and compared to a threshold value corresponding to the audio signal generated upon deployment of an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a condenser instrument microphone is mounted beneath an over the stovetop microwave <b>103</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, near an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher <b>102</b>. A decibel reading in excess of 110 decibels at a frequency greater than 2.5 kHz meets threshold requirements for determination of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher. In still another embodiment, a sound pressure level in excess of 125 decibels at any frequency for a duration of at least 5 milliseconds will exceed threshold requirements and determine the presence of a sonic signal from an activated stovetop fire extinguisher. The above sonic characteristics for determination of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher are exemplary. These sound characteristic quantities described above, as measured near a stovetop, may avoid false determinations of an activated stovetop fire extinguisher as compared to sounds sensed from background noises.<sup>1 </sup>A microphone signal picked up during activation of an automatic stovetop fire suppressor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and is further described below with reference to the same.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in still other embodiments, when a control panel for a fire and security system is present, the output of the control circuitry may interface directly with an existing control panel <b>243</b>. Communication <b>245</b> may be conducted, for example, by an RS485 cable. In still other embodiments, the control circuitry <b>240</b> comprises a transceiver <b>247</b>, and a wireless radio frequency trigger signal is transmitted via a transceiver in the control circuitry and received at the control panel via a receiver <b>248</b>, as shown for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Control circuitry <b>240</b> can be housed within a sensor circuitry housing and may be driven from a common battery supply <b>222</b> or from its own battery supply <b>249</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Control circuitry <b>240</b> connects to alarm circuitry <b>260</b>, which in turn drives a fire alarm to generate a continuous alarm signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a block diagram of a sound based fire alarm with a number of alarm circuitries <b>360</b>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Sound sensor <b>312</b> is electrically connected to sensor circuitry <b>320</b>, which connects to control circuitry <b>340</b>. The output of the control circuitry <b>340</b> is electrically coupled <b>359</b> to an alarm circuitry <b>360</b>-<b>2</b>, which in turn drives an alarm <b>380</b>. Each of the circuitries, <b>320</b>, <b>340</b>, <b>360</b> may be housed in a same housing, in individual housings, or in some combination. Similarly the sensor <b>312</b> and alarm, for example <b>380</b>, may be housed with its respective circuitry or separately, as needed or as desired. In still other embodiments at least one alarm circuitry and alarm device are remote from the control circuitry and/or the sensor circuitry. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the control circuitry may connect to different alarm types <b>380</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>380</b>-<b>4</b>, where each alarm has its own alarm circuitry <b>360</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>360</b>-<b>4</b>. Alarm devices may include a smoke detector <b>380</b>-<b>3</b>, a buzzer <b>380</b>-<b>1</b>, a piezoelectric buzzer <b>380</b>-<b>4</b>, a speaker <b>380</b>-<b>2</b>, or a strobe light, not shown. Each alarm circuitry may comprise a battery power supply <b>363</b> supporting an independent stand alone system. Different embodiments of a sound based fire alarm <b>310</b> may comprise any combination of alarm devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, a tone generator <b>362</b>-<b>2</b> provides the alarm signal which is amplified and drives speaker <b>380</b>-<b>2</b>. A commercially available microprocessor-based digital tone generator may be employed, or a simpler transistor-transistor logic (TTL) timer-based tone generator may be employed. For some applications, such as a multi-resident or multi-dwelling building, a digital multi-tone tone generator, such as PRONOR NV's Digital Multi-tone Tone Generator V-9927A (PRONOR NV, Gent, Belgium) may be employed. In other embodiments, a sound generator integrated circuitry <b>363</b>-<b>2</b>, an 8/10 W amplifier <b>364</b>-<b>2</b>, and an 8 ohm speaker <b>380</b>-<b>2</b> can provide the alarm circuitry and alarm device, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As appreciated by one of ordinary skill, a single 9 volt battery may be used to supply 9 volts across a speaker or piezoelectric buzzer, while a diode combination or voltage regulator can drop the 9 volts to 5 or less volts across, for example, a programmable interface controller (PIC).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In still another embodiment, a smoke detector is incorporated as the alarm device <b>380</b>-<b>3</b>. An alarm circuitry <b>360</b>-<b>3</b>, which drives the smoke detector, will tap into the smoke detector circuitry in parallel with the smoke detection circuitry, ionizing or photoelectric, and will leave the smoke detection function intact. In alternate embodiments, the smoke detector is dedicated to the sound based fire alarm system and the smoke detection is disabled. A buzzer <b>380</b>-<b>1</b>, or piezoelectric buzzer <b>380</b>-<b>4</b>, may also be used as an alarm device in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. A miniature ceramic buzzer can provide 80 decibels at 10 cm, while a larger one inch diameter piezoelectric buzzer can provide 108 decibel continuous alarm at only 50 mA for voltages between 5 and 15 VDC. A piezo transducer, piezoelectric buzzer, will produce high volume when driven near its resonant frequency. A suitable driver circuitry <b>363</b> for a piezoelectric transducer <b>380</b>-<b>4</b> may comprise, for example, a 555 astable timer. Piezo transducers require a small current, usually less than 10 mA, so they can be connected directly to the outputs of many integrated circuitry chips, without amplification. As discussed above, alarm circuitry <b>360</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>360</b>-<b>4</b> may include a battery and may also comprise a programmable interface controller (PIC). Alarm circuitry <b>360</b>-<b>4</b> is shown comprising a battery <b>363</b> and a driver circuitry <b>362</b>. Any and all alarm circuitries may comprise a battery and/or drive circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block diagram of a sound based audible fire alarm system applied in a building in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, wherein wireless communication across UL rated stand alone smoke detectors is utilized. Sound sensor <b>412</b> senses local sounds, sensor circuitry <b>420</b> processes the received signals, and control circuitry <b>440</b> determines the presence of a deployed automatic stovetop fire extinguisher. Upon determination of a deployed stovetop fire extinguisher, a trigger signal <b>459</b> is broadcast via a wireless transmitter <b>447</b>. At remote locations, antennas <b>447</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>447</b>-<b>3</b> receive the transmitted signal and activate corresponding smoke detectors <b>480</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>480</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>3</b> via respective alarm circuitries <b>460</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>460</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>3</b>. The mode of communication, for example, radio frequency or Bluetooth, can vary as distance and power requirements dictate or as desired. In yet another embodiment, antenna <b>447</b> sends out a trigger signal <b>459</b> and each remote antenna <b>447</b>-<b>1</b>, may not only receive the trigger signal but also transmit a trigger signal <b>459</b>-<b>2</b> for reception by additional remote smoke detectors. In the latter embodiment, alarm circuitries are modified to forward a trigger signal as well as tap into the smoke detector circuitry to activate the alarm. By hopping from smoke detector to smoke detector, a greater area can be incorporated into the sound based fire alarm system. This embodiment may be particularly well suited in a multi-dwelling setting, such as a dormitory.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Some embodiments of the present invention may be readily incorporated into an existing smoke detector system. For example, in one embodiment, an alarm circuitry may have its own housing <b>260</b> and 9 volt battery supply. Such housing may be easily mounted near a smoke detector and connections with the same easily made.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an automatic stovetop fire suppressor <b>402</b> above a stove <b>405</b>, with a sound based fire alarm nearby and smoke detectors upstairs and down the hall. More particularly a sound sensor <b>412</b>, a sensor circuitry <b>420</b>, and a control circuitry <b>440</b> are in proximity to the stovetop <b>405</b>. Remote smoke detectors <b>480</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>480</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>480</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>3</b> are shown with RF transceivers and alarm circuitries <b>460</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>460</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>460</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>3</b> connected there to respective smoke detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary method of a sound based fire alarm, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. An automatic stovetop fire extinguisher, STOVETOP FIRESTOP, is mounted above a stovetop <b>510</b>. A microphone is positioned in the stovetop area <b>515</b> to sense local sounds <b>520</b>. Sensed signals are output to a sensor circuitry <b>530</b>, which processes the sensed signals <b>535</b> by, for example high pass filtering and digitizing. Processed signals are output to a control circuitry <b>540</b>. A comparison is made between attributes of processed signals and respective threshold values <b>545</b>. If the signal does not exceed threshold <b>547</b>, sensing of stovetop sounds continues <b>520</b>. If the signal exceeds threshold values <b>547</b>, which correspond to the sound burst emitted upon deployment of the stovetop fire extinguisher, then a trigger signal is sent to an alarm circuitry <b>550</b>. The alarm circuitry drives the connected alarm to produce a continuous alarm signal <b>555</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternate embodiment, if the signal exceeds threshold values <b>547</b>, which correspond to the sound burst emitted upon deployment of the stovetop fire extinguisher, then a trigger signal is sent to a control panel <b>560</b>. In turn, the control panel activates connected continuous alarms. In an alternate embodiment, if the signal exceeds threshold values <b>547</b>, which correspond to the sound burst emitted upon deployment of the stovetop fire extinguisher, then a trigger signal is broadcast to remote alarm circuitries <b>580</b>. Remote alarm circuitries receive the trigger signal <b>585</b> and activate their respective smoke detectors <b>590</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a digital recording of a high decibel burst, generated upon activation of an automatic stovetop fire extinguisher, STOVETOP FIRESTOP. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows output voltage from a microphone, which is sensing the audible blast of an activating STOVETOP FIRESTOP automatic stovetop fire suppressor, as a function of time <b>640</b>. Shown on the vertical axis, microphone output <b>621</b> is shown in volts <b>620</b>, with time <b>631</b> on the horizontal axis in seconds <b>630</b>. The vertical axis spans &#x2212;1.2 to 0.8 volts <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>. The signal was sampled at 44.1 kHz and is shown from blast onset <b>632</b> for an 11.5 millisecond time span. The horizontal axis spans the time from blast onset, 0, <b>632</b> to just over 11 milliseconds <b>634</b>. As can be seen from the recording <b>640</b>, the blast drops off to one-half peak power between 6.5 and 7.5 milliseconds. The recorded signal appears to contain high frequency noise.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows an exemplary recording of the audible emission of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> filtered by a four point moving average. The raw microphone output voltage sampled at 44.1 kHz is shown filtered with a 4 point moving average, for a lowpass filtering near 5.5 kHz. Filtered microphone output <b>721</b> is shown in volts <b>720</b> as a function of sequential samples (n) <b>730</b> at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, every 2.27&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>seconds. The time span of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> <b>734</b> is equal to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <b>634</b>, with samples being taken at 44.1 kHz. Likewise the output voltage spans a similar range from &#x2212;1.0 volts <b>722</b> to 1.0 volts <b>724</b>. From the low pass filtered microphone output as a function of time expressed in sequential samples (n) <b>740</b>, a fundamental frequency of the audible stovetop fire extinguisher blast begins to appear.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a power spectral density for a recording of an audible blast of a stovetop fire extinguisher in accordance with the present invention. Using raw voltage data, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and a hamming window, a power spectral density was calculated and plotted. Microphone output volts squared as a function of frequency was calculated. The resulting power, volts-squared, was then normalized to a maximum of 1. The normalized power is shown as a function of frequency <b>750</b>. Normalized microphone output power <b>760</b> varies from 0 <b>762</b> to 1.0 <b>764</b>, shown on the vertical axis. Frequency, shown on the horizontal axis is shown as a decimal fraction of n, where n equals 44.1 kHz <b>770</b>. The power spectrum is shown from 0 hertz, 0n, 772 to 0.5n corresponding to 22.05 kHz <b>774</b>. The resulting function <b>750</b> shows the largest contribution to signal power has a bandwidth centered at approximately 3.8 kHz with a bandwidth of approximately 700 Hz. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a band pass filter <b>224</b> with cutoffs at 2.5 kHz to 5.0 kHz is applied to the sensed signal in the sensor circuitry <b>220</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, sensor circuitry <b>220</b> comprises a band pass filter with cutoffs at 3.2 kHz and 4.2 kHz. And in accordance with another embodiment, filtered signals may be amplified <b>222</b> before being output to a control circuitry <b>240</b>.</p>
