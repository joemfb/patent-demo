<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage application that claims priority under 35 USC &#xa7;&#xa7;365 and 371 to PCT/NO2008/000324 filed Sep. 12, 2008, which claims priority to NO 20074711, filed Sep. 14, 2007.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for fire extinguishing, comprising a fire retardant cloth, which is arranged to cover objects upon a fire or the beginnings of a fire, to put out or prevent the fire from developing. The invention also relates to a method for the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fires that start at home are a great problem. In industrial kitchens and in business premises, there are defective, automatic fire extinguishing systems that are set off when the fire alarm goes off, with the possible overhead sprinkler system or the like being triggered. However, this is a problem in kitchens, as it is often cooking oil, fats or the like that is the cause of the fire and an overhead sprinkler system will make the situation worse. In most homes, automatic fire extinguishing systems are missing. Estimated numbers indicate that about 40% of all house fires start by dry out on a stove. In Norway alone, about 12% of all lethal house fires start by a dry out.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a fire extinguishing system for use in the home in particular, or also in industrial kitchens as an added safety and which can simply be fitted afterwards without changing the stove or other appliances and which can be placed, for example, immediately above the stove. The system can be automatic.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This is achieved by a device according to the present invention. The invention will be able to save lives in that a number of house fires can be considerably reduced. The invention will also save assets for the same reason. Insurance companies and the public authorities will thus be able to save items of value which in turn everybody will benefit from.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The device according to the invention shall be cheap to produce, simple to fit and thereby be very commercially saleable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above mentioned aims are achieved with a device as described herein in that the fire retardant cloth is mounted in a release mechanism arranged to release the fire retardant cloth, in such a way that the cloth covers said objects, upon detection of the fire or development of the fire.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The release mechanism can be connected to a control unit, said control unit being preferably coupled to sensors for detection of fire or heat, such as a flame sensor, a smoke sensor, a temperature sensor, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The fire retardant cloth, in the main, is rolled up onto a roller in the release mechanism, and the release mechanism can further comprises at least one drive roller over which a free end of the fire retardant cloth lies in an inactive state, wherein said roller is arranged to roll out and/or throw out said cloth. Adjacent the drive roller, a second roller can be arranged, having an opposite direction of rotation, in where the free end of the fire retardant cloth is placed between said rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the fire retardant cloth can comprise a weight element at said free end, when in inactivate state said free end extends out between the first and the second roller.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The release mechanism can comprise a spring and/or a rod arranged to force said rollers against each other and a lid can cover the release mechanism when this is inactive.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The release mechanism is preferably placed above a stove, or it can be integrated with equipment placed above a stove, such as a ventilation system and where a coupling box is connected between the stove and energy supply and which, on a signal from the control unit, is arranged to cut off the energy supply upon the detection of a fire or beginnings of a fire.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention also relates to a method to extinguish a fire or the beginnings of a fire on a stove, with a fire retardant cloth being placed over pans or the like on the stove, where there is a fire or the beginnings of a fire, to extinguish or prevent a fire developing, by placing a release mechanism having a rolled up fire retardant cloth over the stove, and upon detection of fire or the beginnings of fire, to roll out and/or throw out the fire retardant cloth, so that the cloth is placed over the stove.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An alternative embodiment, is described herein in that the fire retardant cloth is placed folded double over the stove, with the free end of the cloth comprising a weight element, so that said free end is rolled out and is placed at a rear area of the stove, and to roll/throw out the fire retardant cloth towards the forward area of the stove, and furthermore roll out the cloth so that the cloth lies down at the rear area again, with the help of the release mechanism.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention relates to a device for fire extinguishing, comprising a fire retardant cloth arranged to be placed over objects where there is a fire or the beginnings of a fire, such as pans or the like, on a stove. Such cloths are readily available and are characterised in that they are very resistant to high temperatures and direct flames. However, most of the fire retardant cloths are used in halls or tents, possibly as loose cloths that can be placed over a fireplace.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With the present invention, a self-releasing and automatic fire extinguishing system can be provided with the help of such a fire retardant cloth. However, the system also can be released by being activated by a user. The device can, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, be arranged over a stove <b>40</b> and comprise a release mechanism <b>10</b> for a fire retardant cloth <b>12</b>. The release mechanism <b>10</b> is, for example, connected to a control unit <b>50</b> which in turn is connected to a number of sensors, such as a temperature sensor <b>44</b>, a smoke sensor <b>46</b>, a flame sensor <b>48</b>, etc, such that the control unit <b>50</b>, after having analysed the signals from the sensors, is arranged to send a signal to the release mechanism <b>10</b> about releasing the fire retardant cloth <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, the control unit <b>50</b> can be arranged to send a signal to a connecting box <b>42</b>, coupled between the stove <b>40</b> and the electricity supply about cutting off the electricity supply upon detection of a fire or the beginnings of a fire. If the stove is a gas stove or the like, the connecting box can, in a corresponding way, be arranged to cut the energy supply to the stove.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a release mechanism <b>10</b> according to the invention, but other release mechanisms arranged to release, eject, roll out, etc, the fire retardant cloth are possible. The release mechanism <b>10</b> in the embodiment shown is placed above a stove, but the release mechanism can also be integrated with appliances placed over a stove such as a ventilation system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the release mechanism comprises a wall anchorage <b>16</b> to which two end plates <b>22</b> (only one being shown in the figure) are mounted approximately perpendicular to the wall anchorage <b>16</b>, to support a roller <b>14</b> onto which the fire retardant cloth <b>12</b> is rolled up. At least one drive roller <b>18</b> is arranged in front of the roller <b>14</b> with the fire retardant cloth <b>16</b>. A further drive roller <b>20</b> with a direction of rotation opposite to the drive roller <b>18</b> is preferably placed over the drive roller <b>18</b>. The release mechanism <b>10</b> can further comprise a spring <b>24</b> and a rod <b>26</b> to pull said rollers <b>18</b>,<b>20</b> against each other. Furthermore, said rollers <b>18</b>,<b>20</b> can comprise a friction covering <b>28</b>,<b>30</b> arranged around at least parts of the rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref> show release of the release mechanism <b>10</b> according to the invention. A stove <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, on which a pan <b>41</b> is placed. The pan <b>41</b> has dried out and a fire has consequently started in the pan. One or more of the sensors in the control unit <b>50</b> register the beginnings of the fire and the control unit sends thereafter a signal to the release mechanism <b>10</b> to release the fire retardant cloth <b>12</b>. The control unit <b>50</b> sends a corresponding signal to the connecting box <b>42</b> to cut the electricity supply or the energy source, such as gas, in the use of a gas stove. At the release of the fire retardant cloth <b>12</b>, the drive roller <b>18</b> starts to roll out the cloth <b>12</b>. The drive roller <b>18</b> is coupled to an associated drive unit (not shown). If an upper roller <b>20</b> is used, this also contributes to the rolling out of the cloth, in which the upper roller <b>20</b> can be pressed towards the lower drive roller <b>18</b> with the help of the spring <b>24</b> and the rod <b>26</b>. The drive roller <b>18</b> can alternatively be mounted on top.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the rolling out of the cloth <b>12</b>, the free end of the cloth will first move towards the rear edge of the stove because of the weight element <b>12</b><i>a</i>, where the free end with the weight element settles, and the cloth is thereafter rolled/thrown out over the stove with the associated pan(s), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. By continued rolling out of the cloth, it will lie at the rear area of the stove again so that a double layer of fire retardant cloth <b>12</b> is placed over the stove <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 10</figref> show, corresponding to the above, the rolling out of the cloth <b>12</b> from the release mechanism <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the release mechanism <b>10</b> in an inactive state, where the free end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the cloth, with the weight element, lies extending out between the rollers <b>18</b>,<b>20</b>. As shown in the figure, the release mechanism <b>10</b> can be covered by a lid <b>32</b> which is opened when the release mechanism is triggered.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">By varying the speed of the drive roller <b>18</b> of the release mechanism, the release of the cloth <b>12</b> can be regulated. At start up, the drive roller <b>18</b> can, for example, roll the cloth out relatively slowly so that the free end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the cloth with the weight element lies down at the rear area of the stove as mentioned. Thereafter, the speed can be increased so that the cloth <b>12</b> is &#x201c;thrown out&#x201d; over the stove, whereupon the speed can be reduced to roll the cloth <b>12</b> back to the rear area of the stove. By regulating the speed, the release mechanisms can thus be adjusted to different application areas.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fire retardant cloth <b>12</b> is shown in the figures rolled onto a roller <b>14</b>. However, the cloth <b>12</b> can also be mounted in the release mechanism <b>10</b> in other ways, for example the cloth <b>12</b> can lie folded or pleated, or in another way.</p>
