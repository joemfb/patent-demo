<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods of transferring a label from substrates to fusion proteins with a protein part specifically designed to accept the label, to novel specific substrates, and to novel proteins accepting the label of specific substrates suitable in such methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">There is a constant need for improved labelling techniques which would allow one to specifically label a protein of interest in order to isolate and/or track such protein of interest under in vitro or in vivo conditions. One particular method is disclosed in WO 02/083937 describing a method for detecting and/or manipulating a protein of interest wherein the protein is fused to O<sup>6</sup>-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) and the AGT fusion protein contacted with a specific AGT substrate carrying a label, whereby the label is transferred to the fusion protein. The AGT fusion protein is then detected and optionally further manipulated using the label. Several mutants of wild type AGT were shown to be better suitable than wild type AGT (WO 2004/031404; Juillerat, A. et al., Chem. Biol. 10:313-317, 2003; Gronemeyer, T. et al., Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 19:309-316, 2006) in such a labelling method, and a wide range of substituted benzylguanines and related heteroarylmethylguanine compounds were described for use in transferring a label to the fusion proteins comprising AGT and AGT mutants (WO 2004/031405).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Simple O<sup>2</sup>-benzyl-cytosines are known. Freccero, M. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125:3544-3553, 2003, obtained O<sup>2</sup>-o-hydroxybenzyl cytosine on reaction of cytosine with o-quinone methide. Ward, A. D. and Baker, B. R., J. Med. Chem. 20:88-92, 1977, describe O<sup>2</sup>-benzyl cytosine obtained from 2-chloro-4-aminopyridmidine and the sodium salt of benzyl alcohol.</p>

Sel. 19:309-316, 2006) was used. <sup>N</sup>AGT exhibits approximately 50-fold higher activity towards benzylguanine derivatives than wild-type <sup>wt</sup>AGT (Juillerat, A. et al., Chem. Biol. 10:313-317, 2003) and had itself been obtained by directed evolution using phage display and a benzylguanine substrate. Codons for residues Tyr114, Lys131, Ser135, Val148, Gly156, Gly157, Glu159 were randomized via saturation mutagenesis. Transformation in phagemid pAK100 resulted in a mutant AGT library of 10<sup>7 </sup>independent clones. For the selection, the phage library was incubated with BCFL, a benzylcytosine carrying fluorescein (compound 5) as a substrate to label the mutants reacting with benzylcytosine. This allowed for the subsequent enrichment of the corresponding phages by using magnetic beads covered with anti-fluorescein antibodies. After 6 rounds of selection for activity against BCFL, clones ACT1 to clone ACT8 were analyzed by DNA sequencing (Table 1, amino acids shown in one-letter code). In subsequent tests it became obvious that proteins from clone ACT1 to clone ACT8 showed only limited stability against denaturation by 4 M urea. To improve this the same library was re-screened. The protein from the best isolated clone is listed as ACT9 and showed good stability in 4 M urea, but limited reactivity towards benzylcytosine. Subsequently ACT10 was obtained by error prone PCR of DNA encoding ACT9 followed by subsequent phage selection resulting in further modification of residues Met60Ile, Ala121Val and Leu153Ser as the ACT variant with high reactivity and high stability against denaturation by urea. The clones are expressed and the proteins purified as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0081">Cyclic substructures in a linker R<sub>2 </sub>reduce the molecular flexibility as measured by the number of rotatable bonds within R<sub>2</sub>, which leads to a better membrane permeation rate, important for all in vivo labelling applications.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">A linker R<sub>2 </sub>is preferably a straight chain alkylene group with 1 to 25 carbon atoms or a straight chain polyethylene glycol group with 4 to 100 ethyleneoxy units, optionally attached to the group R<sub>1 </sub>by a &#x2014;CH&#x2550;CH&#x2014; or &#x2014;C&#x2261;C&#x2014; group.

<p id="p-0089" num="0090">The label L of the substrate can be chosen by those skilled in the art dependent on the application for which the fusion protein is intended. Labels are such that the labelled fusion protein carrying label L is easily detected or separated from its environment. Other labels considered are those which are capable of sensing and inducing changes in the environment of the labelled fusion protein and/or the substrate, or labels which aid in manipulating the fusion protein by the physical and/or chemical properties of the substrate and specifically introduced into the fusion protein. A label as understood in the context of the invention is a substituent different from hydrogen or from standard functional groups, in particular different from hydrogen, hydroxy, amino, halogen, carboxylate, carboxamide, carboxylic ester, nitrile, cyanate, isocyanate, sulfonate, sulfonamide, sulfonic ester, aldehyde, ketone, ether, and thioether substituent.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">Examples of a label include a spectroscopic probe such as a fluorophore or a chromophore, a magnetic probe or a contrast reagent; a radioactively labelled molecule; a molecule which is one part of a specific binding pair which is capable of specifically binding to a partner; a molecule that is suspected to interact with other biomolecules; a library of molecules that are suspected to interact with other biomolecules; a molecule which is capable of crosslinking to other molecules; a molecule which is capable of generating hydroxyl radicals upon exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and ascorbate, such as a tethered metal-chelate; a molecule which is capable of generating reactive radicals upon irradiation with light, such as malachite green; a molecule covalently attached to a solid support, where the support may be a glass slide, a microtiter plate or any polymer known to those proficient in the art; a nucleic acid or a derivative thereof capable of undergoing base-pairing with its complementary strand; a lipid or other hydrophobic molecule with membrane-inserting properties; a biomolecule with desirable enzymatic, chemical or physical properties; or a molecule possessing a combination of any of the properties listed above.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">Further labels L are positively charged linear or branched polymers which are known to facilitate the transfer of attached molecules over the plasma membrane of living cells. This is of particular importance for substances which otherwise have a low cell membrane permeability or are in effect impermeable for the cell membrane of living cells. A non cell permeable ACT substrate will become cell membrane permeable upon conjugation to such a group L. Such cell membrane transport enhancer groups L comprise, for example, a linear poly(arginine) of D- and/or L-arginine with 6-15 arginine residues, linear polymers of 6-15 subunits which each carry a guanidinium group, oligomers or short-length polymers of from 6 to up to 50 subunits, a portion of which have attached guanidinium groups, and/or parts of the sequence of the HIV-tat protein, in particular the subunit Tat49-Tat57 (RKKRRQRRR in the one letter amino acid code). The ACT substrate is covalently linked to this group L through a linker R<sub>2 </sub>as defined hereinbefore, which is preferably labile inside a living cell and may be degraded, e.g. by cleavage of an ester group R<sub>2 </sub>by intracellular esterases, leading directly or in a further reaction provoked by the cleavage of the ester function to a separation of the ACT substrate and the unit L enhancing cell membrane permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">Preferred as labels L are spectroscopic probes, and molecules which are one part of a specific binding pair which is capable of specifically binding to a partner, so-called affinity labels. Also preferred as labels L are molecules covalently attached to a solid support. Preferred spectroscopic probes are fluorophores.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">When the label L is a fluorophore, a chromophore, a magnetic label, a radioactive label or the like, detection is by standard means adapted to the label and whether the method is used in vitro or in vivo. If L is a fluorophore the method can be compared to the applications of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) which is genetically fused to a protein of interest and allows protein investigation in the living cell. Particular examples of labels L are also boron compounds displaying non-linear optical properties. Particularly preferred are labels such that L of one substrate (L<sub>1</sub>) is one member and L of another substrate (L<sub>2</sub>) is the other member of two interacting spectroscopic probes L<sub>1</sub>/L<sub>2</sub>, wherein energy can be transferred nonradiatively between the donor and acceptor (quencher) when they are in close proximity (less than 10 nanometer distance) through either dynamic or static quenching. Such a pair of labels L<sub>1</sub>/L<sub>2 </sub>changes its spectroscopic properties on reaction of the labelled substrate carrying L<sub>1 </sub>with the ACT fusion protein and another type of labelled substrate (e.g. a benzylguanine type) carrying L<sub>2 </sub>with another corresponding fusion protein, e.g. an AGT fusion protein. An example of such a pair of labels L<sub>1</sub>/L<sub>2 </sub>is a FRET pair explained below in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">Particular fluorophores considered are: Alexa Fluor dyes, including Alexa Fluor 350, 488, 532, 546, 555, 635 and 647 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif. 92008, USA, see also Panchuk-Voloshina, N. et al., J. Histochem. &#x26; Cytochem. 47:1179-1188, 1999); coumarins such as 7-dimethylamino-coumarin-4-acetic acid (succinimidyl ester supplied as product D374 by Invitrogen Molecular Probes), 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin-3-acetic acid and 7-diethylamino-coumarin-3-carboxylic acid; Cyanine-3 (Cy 3), Cyanine 5 (Cy 5) and Cyanine 5.5 (Cy 5.5) (Amersham&#x2014;GE Healthcare, Solingen, Germany); ATTO 488, ATTO 532, ATTO 600 and ATTO 655 (Atto-Tec, D57076 Siegen, Germany); DY-505, DY-547, DY-632 and DY-647 (Dyomics, Jena, Germany); and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and difluoro-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (Oregon Green). These particular labels on the substrate of formula (I) may be combined with the known AGT&#x2014;benzylguanine system wherein the label on the benzylguanine is a quencher to create a FRET pair with the fluorophore on the substrate of formula (I) reacting with ACT. Such quenchers are: QSY 35, QSY 9 and QSY 21 (Invitrogen Molecular Probes); BHQ-1, BHQ-2 and BHQ-3 (Black Hole Quencher&#x2122; of Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Novato, Calif. 94949, USA); ATTO 540Q and ATTO 612Q (Atto-Tec, D57076 Siegen, Germany); 4-dimethylamino-azobenzene-4&#x2032;-sulfonyl derivatives (Dabsyl) and 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4&#x2032;-carbonyl derivatives (Dabcyl).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">Depending on the properties of the label L, the fusion protein comprising protein of interest and ACT may be bound to a solid support on reaction with the substrate. The label L of the substrate reacting with the fusion protein comprising ACT may already be attached to a solid support when entering into reaction with ACT, or may subsequently, i.e. after transfer to ACT, be used to attach the labelled ACT fusion protein to a solid support. The label may be one member of a specific binding pair, the other member of which is attached or attachable to the solid support, either covalently or by any other means. A specific binding pair considered is e.g. biotin and avidin or streptavidin. Either member of the binding pair may be the label L of the substrate, the other being attached to the solid support. Further examples of labels allowing convenient binding to a solid support are e.g. maltose binding protein, glycoproteins, FLAG tags, or reactive substituents allowing chemoselective reaction between such substituent with a complementary functional group on the surface of the solid support. Examples of such pairs of reactive substituents and complementary functional group are e.g. amine and activated carboxy group forming an amide, azide and a propiolic acid derivative undergoing a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, amine and another amine functional group reacting with an added bifunctional linker reagent of the type of activated bis-dicarboxylic acid derivative giving rise to two amide bonds, or other combinations known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">Examples of a convenient solid support are e.g. glass surfaces such as glass slides, microtiter plates, and suitable sensor elements, in particular functionalized polymers (e.g. in the form of beads), chemically modified oxidic surfaces, e.g. silicon dioxide, tantalum pentoxide or titanium dioxide, or also chemically modified metal surfaces, e.g. noble metal surfaces such as gold or silver surfaces. Irreversibly attaching and/or spotting ACT substrates may then be used to attach ACT fusion proteins in a spatially resolved manner, particularly through spotting, on the solid support representing protein microarrays, DNA microarrays or arrays of small molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">When the label L is capable of generating reactive radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals, upon exposure to an external stimulus, the generated radicals can then inactivate the ACT fusion proteins as well as those proteins that are in close proximity of the ACT fusion protein, allowing to study the role of these proteins. Examples of such labels are tethered metal-chelate complexes that produce hydroxyl radicals upon exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and ascorbate, and chromophores such as malachite green that produce hydroxyl radicals upon laser irradiation. The use of chromophores and lasers to generate hydroxyl radicals is also known in the art as chromophore assisted laser induced inactivation (CALI). In the present invention, labelling ACT fusion proteins with substrates carrying chromophores as label L, such as malachite green, and subsequent laser irradiation inactivates the labelled ACT fusion protein as well as those proteins that interact with the ACT fusion protein in a time-controlled and spatially-resolved manner. This method can be applied both in vivo or in vitro. Furthermore, proteins which are in close proximity of the ACT fusion protein can be identified as such by either detecting fragments of that protein by a specific antibody, by the disappearance of those proteins on a high-resolution 2D-electrophoresis gels or by identification of the cleaved protein fragments via separation and sequencing techniques such as mass spectrometry or protein sequencing by N-terminal degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">When the label L is a molecule that can cross-link to other proteins, e.g. a molecule containing functional groups such as maleimides, active esters or azides and others known to those proficient in the art, contacting such labelled ACT substrates with ACT fusion proteins that interact with other proteins (in vivo or in vitro) leads to the covalent cross-linking of the ACT fusion protein with its interacting protein via the label. This allows the identification of the protein interacting with the ACT fusion protein. Labels L for photo cross-linking are e.g. benzophenones. In a special aspect of cross-linking the label L is a molecule which is itself an ACT substrate leading to dimerization of the ACT fusion protein. The chemical structure of such dimers may be either symmetrical (homodimers) or unsymmetrical (heterodimers).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">Other labels L considered are for example fullerenes, boranes for neutron capture treatment, nucleotides or oligonucleotides, e.g. for self-addressing chips, peptide nucleic acids, and metal chelates, e.g. platinum chelates that bind specifically to DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">A particular biomolecule with desirable enzymatic, chemical or physical properties is methotrexate. Methotrexate is a tight-binding inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Compounds of formula (I) wherein L is methotrexate belong to the well known class of so-called &#x201c;chemical inducers of dimerization&#x201d; (CIDs). Using fusion proteins of ACT with the DNA-binding domain LexA, and adding DHFR with the transcriptional activation domain B42 to the in vivo labeling of the ACT fusion protein with a compound of formula (I) wherein L is methotrexate induces the coupling (&#x201c;dimerization&#x201d;) of the ACT-LexA fusion protein and DHFR-B42 fusion protein, leading to spatial proximity of LexA and B42 and subsequent stimulation of transcription.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">If the substrate carries two or more labels, these labels may be identical or different.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">Particular preferred combinations are two different affinity labels, or one affinity label and one chromophore label, in particular one affinity label and one fluorophore label, or a pair of spectroscopic interacting labels L<sub>1</sub>/L<sub>2</sub>, e.g. a FRET pair.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">Preferred are compounds of formula (I) wherein R<sub>1 </sub>is phenyl, in particular para-substituted phenyl.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">Preferred are compounds of formula (I) wherein L is a spectroscopic probe, e.g. a fluorophore. Likewise preferred are compounds wherein L is a molecule representing one part of a specific binding pair, and compounds wherein L is a molecule covalently attached to a solid support.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">Most preferred are the compounds of the Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">The invention further relates to a method for detecting and/or manipulating a protein of interest, wherein the protein of interest is incorporated into an ACT fusion protein, the ACT fusion protein is contacted with a compound of formula (I) carrying a label as described hereinbefore, and the ACT fusion protein is detected and optionally further manipulated using the label in a system designed for recognising and/or handling the label.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">In the method of the present invention a protein or peptide of interest is fused to an ACT. The protein or peptide of interest may be of any length and both with and without secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure, and preferably consists of at least twelve amino acids and up to 2000 amino acids. Examples of such protein or peptide of interest are e.g. enzymes, DNA-binding proteins, transcription regulating proteins, membrane proteins, nuclear receptor proteins, nuclear localization signal proteins, protein cofactors, small monomeric GTPases, ATP-binding cassette proteins, intracellular structural proteins, proteins with sequences responsible for targeting proteins to particular cellular compartments, proteins generally used as labels or affinity tags, and domains or subdomains of the aforementioned proteins. The protein or peptide of interest is preferably fused to ACT by way of a linker which may be cleaved by an enzyme, e.g. at the DNA stage by suitable restriction enzymes and/or linkers cleavable by suitable enzymes at the protein stage.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">The ACT has the property of transferring a label present on a substrate, i.e. on the compound of formula (I), to one of the cysteine residues of the ACT forming part of a fusion protein. In preferred embodiments, the ACT is selected from the group consisting of ACT 1 to ACT 10 as defined hereinbefore, and homologs thereof. Particularly preferred is ACT 10.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">The fusion protein comprising protein of interest and an ACT is contacted with a particular substrate of formula (I). Conditions of reaction are selected such that the ACT reacts with the substrate and transfers the label of the substrate. Usual conditions are a buffer solution at around pH 7 at room temperature, e.g. around 25&#xb0; C. However, it is understood that ACT reacts also under a variety of other conditions, and those conditions mentioned here are not limiting the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">The label L of the substrate is chosen by those skilled in the art dependent on the application for which the fusion protein is intended. After contacting the fusion protein comprising ACT with the substrate, the label L is covalently bonded to the fusion protein. The labelled ACT fusion protein is then further manipulated and/or detected by virtue of the transferred label. The label L may consist of a plurality of same or different labels. If the substrate contains more than one label L, the corresponding labelled ACT fusion protein will also comprise more than one label which gives more options for further manipulating and/or detecting the labelled fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">&#x201c;Detected&#x201d; in the sense of the present invention means that the fusion protein with ACT carrying label L can be localised due to the properties of the label, and the amount of fusion protein determined either directly or by reference to a standard. &#x201c;Manipulated&#x201d; in the sense of the present invention means that the fusion protein with ACT carrying label L can be reacted further due to the properties of the label, e.g. isolated from the in vitro or in vivo system, enriched and purified, i.e. separated from other proteins and/or non-proteinaceous material, brought in solution (e.g. especially if the fusion protein is not soluble), precipitated (e.g. especially if the fusion protein is soluble) or otherwise fixed to a solid, and also further treated e.g. by cleaving the linker which splits off the label and regenerates the fusion protein. The skilled person well understands the many possibilities for further handling the fusion protein carrying label L due to the properties of the label L and of the linker R<sub>2 </sub>connecting L to the fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">In vitro, the reaction of the ACT fusion protein with the substrate of the invention can generally be either performed in cell extracts or with purified or enriched forms of the ACT fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">If experiments with the substrates of the present invention are done in vivo or in cell extracts, the reaction of the endogenous AGT will not disturb the reaction of an ACT fusion protein with a substrate of the formula (I), since said substrate does not (or at least not detectably) interact with endogenous AGT, only with ACT. This is a substantial advantage of the present combination ACT-substrate of formula (I) over the standard combination of AGT-benzylguanine type substrate described in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">Particular fluorophores labels on the substrate of formula (I) as described hereinbefore may be combined with the known AGT-benzylguanine system wherein the label on the benzylguanine is a quencher to create a FRET pair with the fluorophore on the substrate of formula (I) reacting with ACT. Preferred are the quenchers listed hereinbefore as labels L for substrates of formula (I).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">Alternatively, the label L on the substrate of formula (I) may be one of the quenchers mentioned above, and the reaction with ACT accomplished in a mixture with a AGT fusion protein-benzylguanine substrate combination wherein the label on benzylguanine is one of the mentioned fluorophores.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">Substrates of the invention are generally prepared by standard methods known in the art. A useful starting material is 2-chloropyrimidin-4-amine or another cytosine derivative with an activated leaving group at position 2 of the pyrimidine ring. This compound is then reacted with an alcohol of formula HO&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;R<sub>1</sub>&#x2014;R<sub>2</sub>-L or an analogous compound HO&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;R<sub>1</sub>&#x2014;R<sub>2</sub>&#x2032; wherein R<sub>2</sub>&#x2032; is precursor of a linker R<sub>2 </sub>allowing the introduction of a label L and thereby completing the residue R<sub>2</sub>-L. Particular useful precursor R<sub>2</sub>&#x2032; are those with an amino function, which allows a condensation reaction with labels carrying a carboxyl function, e.g. in the form of a succinimidyl ester giving rise to linker R<sub>2 </sub>incorporating an amide function.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Appropriate protecting groups for the envisioned functionalities can be chosen by those skilled in the art, and are e.g. summarized in Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M. in &#x201c;Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis&#x201d;, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, New York 1991.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">The invention further relates to methods of transferring a label from these substrates of formula (I) to alkylcytosine transferases (ACTs) and ACT fusion proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">The combination ACT-substrate of formula (I) is particularly suitable for tracing two different proteins in combination with the known AGT-benzylguanine type substrate, since the substrate of formula (I) and benzylguanine type substrates transfer their labels selectively to ACT and AGT fusion proteins, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0121">In order to demonstrate the feasibility of specific dual labelling using ACTs, an equimolar mixture of hexahistidine tagged <sup>N</sup>AGT (6&#xd7;His-<sup>N</sup>AGT) and GST-ACT1 fusion protein was incubated with either BGFL, BGCy5, BCFL, BCCy5 or an equimolar mixture of BGCy5/BCFL or BGFL/BCCy5. Incubation with BGFL or BGCy5 led to a complete labelling of 6&#xd7;His-<sup>N</sup>AGT and very low labelling of GST-ACT1 (estimated to be less than 5% in both case). In an opposite way, incubation with BCFL or BCCy5 led to a complete labelling of GST-ACT1 and a partial labelling of 6&#xd7;His-<sup>N</sup>AGT (76% and 6%, respectively). However, incubation with an equimolar mixture of BGCy5/BCFL (or BGFL/BCCy5) led to specific dual colour labelling, i.e. specific labelling of 6&#xd7;His-<sup>N</sup>AGT with Cy5 dye (or fluorescein, respectively) and specific labelling of GST-ACT1 with fluorescein (or Cy5 dye, respectively). In both case, cross labelling had been evaluated to be less than 1%.</p>

Des. Set. 19:309-316, 2006). Primers 1 (N, AGT, SEQ ID NO:3) and 2 (C, AGT, SEQ ID NO:4) contain Sfi1 restriction sites; Primer 3 (SEQ ID NO:5) contains the randomized bases for randomization at position 114; Primer 4 (SEQ ID NO:6) contains the randomized bases for randomization at position 131 and 135; Primer 5 (SEQ ID NO:7) contains the randomized bases for randomization at position 148, 156, 157 and 159. The PCR product was ligated into phage display vector pAK100 and the resulting construct was electroporated into <i>E. coli </i>XL1-blue (Stratagene, USA). This led to a library containing about 10<sup>7 </sup>clones. Library cells were grown in 2YT medium (25 &#x3bc;g/mL chloramphenicol, 1% glucose, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at 37&#xb0; C. until the optical density OD<sub>600 </sub>reached 0.6. Then 2&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>VCS M13 helper phages were added and the culture was incubated 30 min at 37&#xb0; C. without shaking and 3 h at 37&#xb0; C. at 170 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 5 min, RT), resuspended in SB-MOPS (50 mM 3-morpholinopropansulfonic acid, 25 &#x3bc;g/mL chloramphenicol, 70 &#x3bc;g/mL kanamycin, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and incubated 1-4 h at 37&#xb0; C. at 220 rpm, then overnight at 24&#xb0; C. at 220 rpm. Cells were pelleted and the supernatant containing phages adjusted to 1 mM DTT and stored at 4&#xb0; C. prior to selections. For selection, BCFL (compound 5) was added to the phage solution (1 mL) to a final concentration of 5 &#x3bc;M, gently rotated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of 8 &#x3bc;M BC and 200 &#x3bc;M BG. Phages were precipitated at 4&#xb0; C. using polyethylene glycol 8000 (4% w/v) and NaCl (3% w/v), centrifuged in a desktop centrifuge (13000 rpm, 4&#xb0; C.) and resuspended in 500 &#x3bc;L PBS. To this solution, 500 &#x3bc;L of PBSMM (PBS with 4% skimmed milk powder) were added and the solution was gently rotated for 60 min at room temperature. 200 &#x3bc;L of magnetic beads covered with anti-fluorescein antibody (washed twice with PBS and blocked for 60 min with PBSMM) were added to the phage preparation and rotated at 4&#xb0; C. for 30 min. After immobilization of labelled phages, the beads were washed 3 times with PBSMM, 5 times with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), twice with PBS. Phages were eluted by incubation of the beads with 100 &#x3bc;L 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5 for 5 min and the solution was neutralized with 50 &#x3bc;L 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8. <i>E. coli </i>JM101 were infected with eluted phages, plated on 2YT plates supplemented with 1% glucose and 25 &#x3bc;g/mL chloramphenicol, then incubated overnight at 37&#xb0; C. The next day, colonies were scraped off the plates, aliquoted and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. prior to the next round of selection. Six rounds of selection were performed.</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0165">The genes of mutants isolated after phage selection according to Example 9 were amplified by PCR using primers 6 (N, AGT, SEQ ID NO:8) and 7 (C, AGT, SEQ ID NO:9) that contain, respectively, BamH1 and EcoR1 restriction sites for subsequent subcloning into pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences, Otelfingen, Switzerland). Expression and purification of proteins as GST-ACT fusion proteins were performed as previously described for AGT fusion proteins (A. Juillerat, T. Gronemeyer, A. Keppler, S. Grendreizig, H. Pick, H. Vogel, K. Johnsson, Chem. Biol. 10:313, 2003). Reaction rates of labelling with BCFL (compound 5) and BG carrying fluorescein (BGFL, WO 02/08397) were determined by incubation of corresponding ACT protein (0.2-0.4 &#x3bc;M) with the appropriate fluorogenic substrate (2-20 &#x3bc;M) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mM DTT, 200 &#x3bc;g/mL of BSA) at 24&#xb0; C. Samples were taken at different times and the labelling reaction was quenched by addition of 4&#xd7; SDS buffer (8% SDS, 10% &#x3b2;-mercaptoethanol, 240 mM Tris pH 6.8, 40% glycerol) and incubation at 95&#xb0; C. for 5 min. The reaction advancement was determined by detection of the fluorescent dye-labelled proteins in SDS-PAGE gel and quantification of fluorescence intensity using a Pharox FX&#x2122; molecular imager. The data were fitted to a pseudo-first order reaction model. Second-order rate constants were then obtained by dividing the pseudo first-order constant by the concentration of fluorogenic substrate.</p>
