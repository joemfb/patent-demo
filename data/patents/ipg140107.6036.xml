<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A feedback scan isolation and bypass architecture apparatus and method. The apparatus includes core logic, and input and output multiplexers. The input multiplexer selectively provides a functional input or the core output to the core input based on a test signal. The output multiplexer selectively provides the core output or the input multiplexer output to a functional output based on the test signal. When the test signal indicates core feedback testing, the output multiplexer outputs the core output and the input multiplexer feeds back the core output to the core input. When the test signal indicates bypass testing, the input multiplexer outputs the functional input and the output multiplexer outputs the functional input bypassing the core logic. Logic can block the feedback or bypass signals when there are timing issues. Logic can modify the number of feedback or bypass signals when the number of functional inputs and outputs are different.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to the testing of integrated circuit devices, and more particularly to feedback and bypass isolation testing of embedded cores and external circuitry in integrated circuit devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many integrated circuit devices include at least one embedded core and external circuitry that provides inputs to and accepts outputs from the embedded core. The embedded core commonly has a plurality of inputs and outputs. It is advantageous to be able to isolate the embedded core from the external logic for core manufacturing testing, and to isolate the external logic from the embedded core for external logic manufacturing testing. Scan isolation feedback testing can be used to test the core separately from the external logic, and scan isolation bypass testing can be used to test the external circuitry separately from the core. However, scan isolation feedback and bypass testing can be difficult to implement without impacting the silicon area of the integrated circuit device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current scan isolation and bypass architectures may require the addition of a state element and a multiplexer for each of the inputs and outputs of the embedded core. This additional circuitry can require a large amount of silicon area on the die, especially when the core has a large number of input and output pins.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be desirable to have a scan isolation feedback and bypass architecture that does not need a state element for each input and output of the target core and that uses less silicon area for the scan isolation feedback and bypass circuitry, even when the target core has a large number of inputs and outputs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A scan isolation and bypass architecture is disclosed that includes core logic, an input isolation multiplexer and an output isolation multiplexer. The core logic receives a core logic input and produces a core logic output. The input isolation multiplexer includes a first input, a second input, a selection input and an output; and the input isolation multiplexer selectively provides one of the first and second inputs to the output based on the selection input. For the input isolation multiplexer, the first input is coupled to a functional input, the second input is coupled to a functional output, the output is coupled to the core logic input, and the selection input is coupled to a first test select signal. The output isolation multiplexer includes a first input, a second input, a selection input and an output; and the output isolation multiplexer selectively provides one of the first and second inputs to the output based on the selection input. For the output isolation multiplexer, the first input is coupled to the core logic output, the second input is coupled to the output of the input isolation multiplexer, the output provides the functional output, and the selection input is coupled to a second test select signal. When the first and second test select signals indicate a core feedback test, the output isolation multiplexer passes the core logic output from the first input of the output isolation multiplexer to the output of the output isolation multiplexer as the functional output, and the input isolation multiplexer passes the core logic output from the second input of the input isolation multiplexer to the output of the input isolation multiplexer and the core logic input. The scan isolation and bypass architecture can be configured so that when the first and second test select signals indicate a bypass test, the input isolation multiplexer passes the functional input from the first input of the input isolation multiplexer to the output of the input isolation multiplexer, and the output isolation multiplexer passes the functional input from the second input of the output isolation multiplexer to the output of the output isolation multiplexer as the functional output. The scan isolation and bypass architecture can be configured so that when the first and second test select signals indicate normal operation, the input isolation multiplexer passes the functional input from the first input of the input isolation multiplexer to the output of the input isolation multiplexer to be processed by the core logic, and the output isolation multiplexer passes the output of the core logic from the first input of the output isolation multiplexer to the output of the output isolation multiplexer as the functional output.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The scan isolation and bypass architecture can also include an at-speed signal and one or both of input AND logic and output AND logic. The input AND logic can include a first input coupled to the at-speed signal, a second input coupled to the functional output, and an output coupled to the second input of the input isolation multiplexer. When the at-speed signal has a first value, the input AND logic passes the functional output to the output of the input AND logic, and when the at-speed signal has a second value the input AND logic prevents the functional output from passing to the output of the input AND logic. The output AND logic can include a first input coupled to the at-speed signal, a second input coupled to the output of the input isolation multiplexer, and an output coupled to the second input of the output isolation multiplexer. When the at-speed signal has the first value, the output AND logic passes the output of the input isolation multiplexer to the output of the output AND logic, and when the at-speed signal has the second value the output AND logic prevents the output of the input isolation multiplexer from passing to the output of the output AND logic.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The scan isolation and bypass architecture can include exclusive-OR logic for situations where the number of functional inputs and outputs are different. When the functional input comprises N inputs and the functional output comprises M outputs, N being greater than M, the exclusive-OR logic can reduce the number of functional inputs to equal the number of functional outputs by receiving the output of the input isolation multiplexer and outputting the reduced output to the second input of the output isolation multiplexer. When the functional output comprises N outputs and the functional input comprises M inputs, the exclusive-OR logic can reduce the number of functional outputs to equal the number of functional inputs by receiving the functional output and an outputting the reduced output to the second input of the input isolation multiplexer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The scan isolation and bypass architecture can be incorporated into a device selected from a group consisting of a music player, a video player, an entertainment unit, a navigation device, a communications device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a fixed location data unit, and a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A scan isolation and bypass architecture is disclosed that includes core logic means, an input selection means and an output selection means. The core logic means processes a core logic input to generate a core logic output. The input selection means passes one of a first input and a second input to an output based on a selection input. For the input selection means, the first input is coupled to a functional input, the second input is coupled to a functional output, the output is coupled to the core logic input, and the selection input is coupled to a first test select signal. The output selection means passes one of a first input and a second input to an output based on a selection input. For the output selection means, the first input is coupled to the core logic output, the second input is coupled to the output of the input selection means, the output provides the functional output, and the selection input is coupled to a second test select signal. When the first and second test select signals indicate a core feedback test, the output selection means passes the core logic output to the output of the output selection means as the functional output and the input selection means passes the core logic output to the output of the input selection means as the core logic input. The scan isolation and bypass architecture can be configured so that when the first and second test select signals indicate a bypass test, the input selection means passes the functional input to the output of the input selection means and the output selection means passes the functional input to the output of the output selection means as the functional output. The scan isolation and bypass architecture can be configured so that when the first and second test select signals indicate normal operation, the input selection means passes the functional input to the output of the input selection means to be processed by the core logic and the output selection means passes the output of the core logic to the output of the output selection means as the functional output.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method of scan isolation and bypass testing for a core coupled to external logic is disclosed where the core has core inputs and core outputs, and the external logic provides functional inputs to the core inputs and accepts functional outputs from the core outputs. The method includes causing the functional inputs from the external logic to bypass the core and pass to the functional outputs when a test selection signal indicates bypass testing; causing the core outputs to feedback to the core inputs when the test selection signal indicates core logic feedback testing; and causing the functional inputs to be processed by the core and the core outputs to pass to the external logic as the functional outputs when the test selection signal indicates normal processing. The core outputs can be provided to the functional outputs when the test selection signal indicates core logic feedback testing. The feedback of the core outputs to the core inputs can be blocked when an at-speed signal indicates the core logic inputs are not synchronized to receive the feedback from the core outputs. The functional inputs from the external logic can be blocked from passing to the functional outputs when an at-speed signal indicates the external logic is not synchronized to receive the functional inputs. When there are more functional inputs than functional outputs and the test selection signal indicates bypass testing, the method can also include combining the functional inputs from the external logic to produce a reduced number of functional inputs equal to the number of functional outputs while bypassing the core, and passing the reduced number of functional inputs to the functional outputs. When there are more functional outputs than functional inputs and when the test selection signal indicates core logic feedback testing, the method can also include combining the core outputs to produce a reduced number of core outputs equal to the number of functional inputs, and feeding back the reduced number of core outputs to the core inputs. The combining can be done using exclusive-or logic.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary block diagram <b>100</b> of a core <b>102</b>, an input isolation multiplexer <b>104</b> and an output isolation multiplexer <b>106</b>. The core includes a compressor, a decompressor, combinational logic and various other core logic circuitry. The core <b>102</b> receives functional inputs from external logic (not shown) and provides functional outputs to the external logic. The functional inputs from the external logic pass through the input isolation multiplexer <b>104</b> into the core <b>102</b>, and the functional outputs pass from the core <b>102</b> through the output isolation multiplexer <b>106</b> to the external logic. The core <b>102</b> also receives external test control inputs including an in-test signal and an at-speed signal.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a feedback scan isolation and scan bypass architecture <b>200</b> when there are an equal number of functional inputs and functional outputs. The feedback scan isolation and bypass architecture <b>200</b> includes functional or core logic <b>210</b>, an input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> and an output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b>. The feedback scan isolation and bypass architecture <b>200</b> receives functional inputs from external logic (not shown) and supplies functional outputs to the external logic. The feedback scan isolation and bypass architecture <b>200</b> also receives an in-test signal, an in-test* signal and an at-speed signal. The in-test signal selects between feedback testing of the core logic or bypass testing of the external logic. The in-test* signal is also used to select between feedback testing or bypass testing, and to select normal, non-test functioning of the core. In feedback testing, the output of the core logic <b>210</b> is fed back to the input of the core logic <b>210</b>. In bypass testing, the input from the external logic bypasses the core logic <b>210</b> and is routed to the output of the scan isolation architecture <b>200</b>. In normal operation, the inputs from the external logic are processed by the core logic and are routed to the output of the scan isolation architecture <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The at-speed signal is used when necessary to account for differences in timing between the core logic <b>210</b> and the external logic. If clock latency differences are not an issue, the at-speed signal can be removed along with the associated circuitry described below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It should be noted that there are commonly a plurality of functional inputs and functional outputs, and that the logic blocks in the scan isolation and bypass architecture <b>200</b> commonly have a plurality of input/output lines and can include a plurality of instances of the depicted logic device. However, for clarity single instances of the input/output lines and of the logic blocks are shown and explained with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The functional or core logic <b>210</b>, which can include a plurality of logic devices and can have a plurality of inputs and outputs, for clarity is represented by a cloud having an input and an output. The input to the core logic <b>210</b> is coupled to the output of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>. The output from the core logic <b>210</b> is coupled to an input of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>, which can include a plurality of lines for each of its inputs and outputs and a plurality of 2-to-1 multiplexers, for clarity is represented by a single 2-to-1 multiplexer that includes two inputs, an output and a select input. The first input of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> is coupled to the functional input from the external logic. The second input of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> is coupled to the output of input AND logic <b>218</b>. The output of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> is coupled to the input of the core logic <b>210</b>. The output of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> is also coupled to an input of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> through output AND logic <b>220</b>. The select input of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> is coupled to the in-test signal.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The input AND logic <b>218</b>, which can include a plurality of lines for each of its inputs and outputs, for clarity is represented by an AND gate having two inputs and an output. The inputs to the input AND logic <b>218</b> are coupled to the at-speed signal and to a feedback of the functional output from the scan isolation architecture <b>200</b>. The input AND logic <b>218</b> adjusts for timing differences based on the at-speed signal. Since the functional output commonly includes a plurality of signals, the input AND logic <b>218</b> commonly comprises a set of logic to AND the at-speed signal with the functional output. The input AND logic <b>218</b> allows the functional output to feedback through to the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> when the at-speed signal has a first value, and blocks the functional output when the at-speed signal has a second value. If clock speed differences are not an issue, the input AND logic <b>218</b> can be removed and the functional output can be coupled directly to the second input of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b>, which can include a plurality of lines for each of its inputs and outputs and a plurality of 2-to-1 multiplexers, for clarity is represented by a single 2-to-1 multiplexer that includes two inputs, an output and a select input. The first input of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> is coupled to the output from the core logic <b>210</b>. The second input of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> is coupled to the output of the output AND logic <b>220</b>. The output of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> provides the functional output from the scan isolation architecture <b>200</b>. The select input of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> is coupled to the in-test* signal through an inverter <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The output AND logic <b>220</b>, which can include a plurality of lines for each of its inputs and outputs, for clarity is represented by an AND gate having two inputs and an output. The inputs to the output AND logic <b>220</b> are coupled to the at-speed signal and to the output of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>. The output AND logic <b>220</b> adjusts for timing differences based on the at-speed signal. Since the output of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> commonly includes a plurality of output signals, the output AND logic <b>220</b> commonly comprises a set of logic gates to AND the at-speed signal with the output of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>. The output AND logic <b>220</b> allows the output from the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> to pass through to the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> when the at-speed signal has a first value, and blocks the output from the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> when the at-speed signal has a second value.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The in-test and in-test* signals can have a first value for bypass or external logic testing where the core logic <b>210</b> is bypassed. For the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, bypass testing is indicated when the in-test and in-test* signals have a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value. When the in-test signal has a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value at the select input of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>, the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> passes the functional input from the external logic to the output of the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>. When the in-test* signal has the &#x201c;0&#x201d; value, due to the inverter <b>216</b>, a &#x201c;1&#x201d; value is passed to the select input of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b>. With a &#x201c;1&#x201d; value at the select input, the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> passes the output of the output AND logic <b>220</b> to the output of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> as the functional output to the external logic. Alternatively, the inverter <b>216</b> can be eliminated by switching the inputs to the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> or by switching the polarity of the in-test* input. When the at-speed signal indicates no timing issues, the functional inputs from the external logic pass through the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b>, through the output AND logic <b>220</b> and through the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> as the functional output to the external logic. Thus, when the in-test and in-test* signals indicate bypass testing, the core logic <b>210</b> is bypassed and the functional inputs from the external logic are passed through the scan isolation architecture <b>200</b> to the external logic through the functional output.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The in-test and in-test* signals can have a second value for core logic feedback testing where the output from the core logic <b>210</b> is fed back to the input of the core logic <b>210</b>.

When the at-speed signal indicates no timing issues, the functional output of the scan isolation architecture <b>200</b> is fed back through the input AND logic <b>218</b> and through the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> to the input of the core logic <b>210</b>. When the in-test signal has this second value for core logic feedback testing, due to the inverter <b>216</b>, a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value is input to the select input of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b>. With a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value at the select input, the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> passes the output of the functional logic <b>210</b> to the functional output.

When the at-speed signal indicates no timing issues, the N functional outputs of the scan isolation architecture <b>400</b> are fed back through and reduced by the XOR logic <b>410</b> to produce M outputs that are passed through the input AND logic <b>218</b> and the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> as the M inputs to the core logic <b>210</b>. When the in-test* signal has this second value for core logic feedback testing, due to the inverter <b>216</b>, a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value is input to the select inputs of the output isolation multiplexer <b>214</b> and the additional output isolation multiplexer <b>414</b>. With a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value at the select inputs, the output isolation multiplexers <b>214</b>, <b>414</b> pass the outputs of the core logic <b>210</b> to the functional outputs and additional functional outputs of the scan isolation architecture <b>400</b>. Thus, when the in-test and in-test* signals indicate core logic feedback testing and the at-speed signal indicates no timing issues, the N outputs of the core logic <b>210</b> pass through the output multiplexers <b>214</b>, <b>414</b> and are fed back through the XOR logic <b>410</b> which reduces/combines the functional outputs to produce M outputs that pass through the input AND logic <b>218</b> and the input multiplexer <b>212</b> to provide M inputs to the core logic <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, normal operation of the scan isolation architecture <b>400</b> can be implemented by setting the in-test signal to &#x201c;0&#x201d; and setting the in-test* signal to &#x201c;1&#x201d;. When the in-test signal has a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value, the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> passes the functional input from the external logic to the input of the core logic <b>210</b>. When the in-test* signal has the &#x201c;1&#x201d; value, due to the inverter <b>216</b>, a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value is passed to the select inputs of the output isolation multiplexers <b>214</b>, <b>414</b>. With a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value at the select inputs, the output isolation multiplexers <b>214</b>, <b>414</b> pass the outputs of the core logic <b>210</b> to the functional outputs and additional functional outputs. Thus, when the in-test and in-test* signals indicate normal operation, the functional inputs from the external logic pass through the input isolation multiplexer <b>212</b> to be processed by the core logic <b>210</b> and the output of the core logic <b>210</b> passes through the output isolation multiplexers <b>214</b>, <b>414</b> to the external logic as the functional outputs of the scan isolation architecture <b>400</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At block <b>504</b>, core bypass testing is started by routing the functional inputs to the system to the functional outputs of the system, and control passes to block <b>506</b>.

The number of functional inputs can be reduced using XOR logic <b>310</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or by ignoring the excess inputs, or by other methods. The number of functional inputs can be increased by routing certain inputs to multiple outputs, or by augmenting the functional inputs with additional signals of known or unspecified values, or by other methods.
