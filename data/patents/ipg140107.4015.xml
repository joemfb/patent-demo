<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Phase Application claiming the benefit of and priority to International Application No. PCT/CN2009/073577, filed Aug. 27, 2009, which claims the benefit of and priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 200810042139.7, filed Aug. 28, 2008. The entire disclosures of International Application No. PCT/CN2009/073577 and Chinese Patent Application No. 200810042139.7 are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an infrared induction device, particularly to a distance detection induction device applied in the automatic operation for sanitation and bathroom, such as automatic sensing faucet, automatic flush urinal etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The infrared sensor has been widely used in the sanitary equipments, such as automatic sensing faucet, automatic flush urinal, flush facilities of the toilet, toilet seat having the hot water sprayer, hand dryer, toilet having the fan providing hot blast, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most of traditional infrared sensors adopt the active sensing method, i.e. the infrared emitter emits the infrared light with certain wavelength, and then the infrared receiver receives the infrared light after the reflection of the human body, further the infrared sensor judges the intensity of the reflected signals to realize the automatic sensing and judging. However, the infrared sensor could not complete the automatic sensing and judging if the target has low reflectivity to infrared light (for example, the black clothing, hair, etc.). There is only few infrared light could be received by the infrared receiver after the infrared light from the infrared emitter was reflected by such matter. The intensity of the reflected signals is not strong enough, so that the above infrared sensor fails to judge whether there is a target existing in the sensing area.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve the above-mentioned problem of induction malfunction in the traditional infrared sensing sanitary ware, the Position Sensitive Detector (PSD) is introduced to the automatic operation for sanitation and bathroom. Shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the PSD sensor is a kind of photoelectric apparatus which is sensitive to the position of the incident light. When the incident light irradiates on the different position of the photosensitive surface of the PSD, the PSD will send out the different electrical signal. Using the triangulation principle, the PSD can accurately survey the distance to realize the auto-induction judgment. Shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the light from the light source irradiates on the surface of the detected target after focused by the lens L<b>1</b>. The reflected light is focused onto the one-dimensional PSD by the lens L<b>2</b> and forms a luminous spot. If the distance between the center of the lens L<b>1</b> and the center of the lens L<b>2</b> is &#x201c;b&#x201d;, the distance from the lens L<b>2</b> to the surface of the PSD is &#x201c;f&#x201d;, the distance between the luminous spot focused on the surface of the PSD and the center of the lens L<b>2</b> is &#x201c;x&#x201d;, the detected distance DIS can be expressed as: DIS=bf/x according to the principle of the similar triangles PAB and BCD. Therefore, so long as the value of the distance between the luminous spot focused on the surface of the PSD and the center of the lens L<b>2</b> &#x201c;x&#x201d; is surveyed, the detected distance DIS can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the distances of the detected target body fall into the pre-determined range, the distance detection induction device will control the sanitary fittings to work. Because the distance detection induction device achieves the purpose of the auto-induction by the way of judging the distance between the target and the distance detection induction device, not by the way of judging the intensity of the emitting signal, the problem of the induction malfunction caused by weak reflected signal in the traditional infrared sensing devices is solved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, it is necessary that the components of the distance detection induction device have higher positioning precision, therefore, so how to ensure the positioning precision of the Device need to be solved.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the present invention is to provide a distance detection induction device having higher positioning precision.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The purpose of the present invention is realized by the following technical solutions: a distance detection induction device comprises a housing, a condensing lens, a circuit board, an infrared light emitting means, a light receiving means for receiving and sensing the light which is emitted by the infrared light emitting means and reflected by target, and a shielding cover. The housing comprises a main body and two round opening on the top of the main body. The condensing lens comprises an emitting lens and a receiving lens located at the opening of the housing. The circuit board bearing multiple electronic components for processing signal is mounted inside the main body of the housing. The infrared light emitting means is light-emitting diode fixed on said circuit board, and emits the infrared light to the emitting lens. The light receiving means is distance detecting sensing module fixed on said circuit board to sense the reflected light focused by the receiving lens. A connection part having at least a bending part is set between the emitting lens and the receiving lens.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, said connection part is bent twice as &#x201c;z&#x201d; shape.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, said lower parts of the condensing lens are made into the cylindrical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, said condensing lens and said housing are combined together by injection molding.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, said distance detection induction device also comprises a sealing component mounted between the emitting lens and the infrared light emitting means or between the receiving lens and the light receiving means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the distance detection induction device also comprises a circuit wire disposing means fixed in the housing by screws.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The embodiments of the present invention will be clearly described referring the attached drawings, wherein the same figures are marked for the same structure parts or same function. It is understood that the attached drawings is just for the description of the embodiments of the present invention, not a limitation to the present invention. Besides, the attached drawings are not drawn as the pro rata.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the distance detection induction device <b>100</b> of the present invention are mainly mounted on all kinds of the automatic sanitary equipments such as an urinal or toilet having automatic sensing device, a tap having automatic sensing device and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The distance detection induction device <b>100</b> of the present invention mainly comprises a housing <b>1</b>, a condensing lens <b>2</b> for focusing, a circuit board <b>3</b> bearing multiple electronic components, a infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> for emitting the infrared light, a light receiving means <b>5</b> for receiving and sensing the reflected infrared light and a shielding cover <b>6</b> having the function of electromagnetic shielding.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the above device, the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> are mounted on the same side of the circuit board <b>3</b>. Shown as the embodiments of the present invention, the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> are mounted onto the circuit board <b>3</b> by leg welding. The condensing lens <b>2</b> is fixed in the housing <b>1</b> and lens <b>2</b> comprises the emitting lens <b>21</b> which focuses and emits the infrared light and the receiving lens <b>22</b> which focuses the reflected infrared light onto the light receiving means <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For the distance detection induction device <b>100</b>, the precise position between the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> should be precisely set. The precise position among the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>, the light receiving means <b>5</b> and the condensing lens <b>2</b> should be precisely set too. Therefore, the distance detection induction device <b>100</b> of the present invention comprises an emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> which fixes the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>, a receiving positioning bracket <b>8</b> which fixes the light receiving means <b>5</b>. The emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> and the receiving positioning bracket <b>8</b> hold the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b>, and are coordinately positioned to the housing <b>1</b> to ensure the positioning precision of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, the shielding cover <b>6</b> is mounted on the periphery of the circuit board <b>3</b>, and on the side that the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> are mounted to prevent the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> from the electromagnetic interference (EMI) of surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The housing <b>1</b> comprises a longitudinal long main body <b>10</b>, the first round opening <b>11</b> and the second round opening <b>12</b> on the top of the main body <b>10</b>. The condensing lens <b>2</b>, the circuit board <b>3</b> bearing multiple electronic components, the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>, the light receiving means <b>5</b> and the shielding cover <b>6</b> are all set within the main body <b>10</b> of the housing <b>1</b>. Correspondingly, the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b> of the condensing lens <b>2</b> are respectively mounted in the first round opening <b>11</b> and the second round opening <b>12</b>. The housing <b>1</b> is made of the insulating material such as ordinary plastic. Indeed, in another embodiment of the present invention, the housing <b>1</b> is made of the conducting material such as metal, conducting plastics to prevent from the electromagnetic interference effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the superior embodiments of the present invention, the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b> of the condensing lens <b>2</b> are installed into the first round opening <b>11</b> and the second round opening <b>12</b> of the housing <b>1</b> by injection molding. Particularly, the installation of the condensing lens <b>2</b> and the housing <b>1</b> is made by injection molding twice. First, the condensing lens <b>2</b> is molded. Then, the molded condensing lens <b>2</b> is put into the mold of the housing <b>1</b> and is molded together with the housing <b>1</b>. By injection molding, the problem of seal between the condensing lens <b>2</b> and the housing <b>1</b> is solved, and it also can ensure the relative positioning precision of the center of the condensing lens <b>2</b> and the housing <b>1</b>. The lower parts of the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b> are all made into the cylindrical structure to ensure the positioning precision during injection molding with the housing <b>1</b>. Specially, the emitting lens <b>21</b> is connected with the receiving lens <b>22</b> by the connection part <b>23</b>. In past design process, the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b> are arranged alone. However, the relative position precision between the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b>, and the relative position precision between the condensing lens <b>2</b> and both of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> should be precisely set. It is not easy to control the position precision if the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b> are established alone, and it is too hard to reach the requirements of precision. Thus, the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b> are connected as a whole by a connection part <b>23</b> to ensure the position precision. Further, the connection part <b>23</b> has at least a bending part to prevent the emitted infrared light emitted by lens <b>21</b> from conducting into the receiving lens <b>22</b> along the connection part <b>23</b> directly. It avoids unnecessary reflection and refraction effect of internal light, and ensures the detecting precision of the distance detection induction device. As shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the connection part <b>23</b> is bended by several times as the &#x201c;z&#x201d; shape. Considered from the overall evaluation of cost and effect, in this structure it needs reflecting for two times for the emitted infrared light to conduct into the receiving lens <b>22</b> from the emitting lens <b>21</b>. The optical path turns more complex, which can more effectively prevent the emitted infrared light emitted by lens <b>21</b> from conducting into the receiving lens <b>22</b> directly. Surely, the bending part can be increased or reduced according to the practical application situation. In another embodiment of the present invention, the condensing lens <b>2</b> and the housing <b>1</b> also can be mounted by assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Multiple electronic components are integrated into the circuit board <b>3</b>. The first hole <b>31</b> and the second hole <b>32</b> are placed just opposite to the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the receiving lens <b>22</b>. The first hole <b>31</b> allows the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> passing through. The circuit board <b>3</b> processes the signal and transmits the processed data to the master-control unit. Thus, the sanitary fitting is controlled further (not shown in the figure).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> is infrared light-emitting diodes (IR LED) fixed on the circuit board <b>3</b>, and located on the under side of the circuit board <b>3</b> (As shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, The side of the circuit board <b>3</b> that faces the condensing lens <b>2</b> is the upside, and the opposite side is the under side of the circuit board <b>3</b>). An indicator <b>41</b> is mounted on the under side of the circuit board <b>3</b> near the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>, and is used for demonstrating the normal or the non-normal working status of the distance detection induction device <b>100</b> such as the insufficiency of the battery capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The light receiving means <b>5</b> is a distance detecting sensing module (PSD Sensing Module) fixed on the circuit board <b>3</b>, and located on the under side of the circuit board <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The shielding cover <b>6</b> is fixed on the base of the housing <b>1</b> by the screws <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> to shield the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b>. It includes the first shielding cover <b>61</b> and the second shielding cover <b>62</b>. The first shielding cover <b>61</b> is fixed with the housing <b>1</b> and is touched with the ground line of the circuit board <b>3</b> by the screws <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> for grounding. The second shielding cover <b>62</b> is fixed with the housing <b>1</b> by the clip structure and is touched with the first shielding cover <b>61</b> by welding for grounding. It is better to set like the above-mentioned means, than to install a whole shielding cover, which will be not easy to be installed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> is fixed with the housing <b>1</b>. It includes a big round hole <b>71</b> at the top of the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> and coordinated with the emitting lens <b>21</b>, and includes the holder <b>72</b> in the bottom of the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> to hold the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>. The diameter of the big round hole <b>71</b> is an approximate match to the emitting area of the emitting lens <b>21</b>. The support stick <b>73</b> are set on two sides of the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> to press against the circuit board <b>3</b> closely, so that the circuit board <b>3</b> could provide enough bracket force to the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> correspondingly to avoid many problems, such as the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> dropping out from the housing <b>1</b> during the installation process. Specially, the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> also includes square protruding parts <b>74</b> at the two sides of the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b>. The square protruding parts <b>74</b> match with the positioning grooves <b>13</b> which are on the internal top of the housing <b>1</b>, so that the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> and the housing <b>1</b> can be positioned. Surely, the square protruding parts <b>74</b> also can be set at other positions of the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> and can be other shapes such as a cylinder protruding stand. The holder <b>72</b> of the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> goes through the first hole <b>31</b> in the circuit board <b>3</b> from the upside of the circuit board <b>3</b>, and takes in and positions the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> on the under side of the circuit board <b>3</b>. The weld legs of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> are bent after outstretching through the slots (not marked) on the two sides of the holder <b>72</b>, and are welded on the circuit board <b>3</b>. The emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> is made of the insulating material. Of course, it also can be made of the conducting material. When the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> is made of the conducting material, it works as a shield to prevent from the electromagnetic interference.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> also includes a small round hole <b>75</b> and an indicating hole <b>76</b>. The small round hole <b>75</b> is near the holder <b>72</b> holding the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>, and the indicating hole <b>76</b> is to show the light emitted by indicator <b>41</b>. Shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the small round hole <b>75</b> and the big round hole <b>71</b> form the cone-shaped channel of the infrared emission light, so the light is projected from the chip of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>, passing through the small round hole <b>75</b> and the big round hole <b>71</b>, and is projected out after focused by the emitting lens <b>21</b>. Thus, the light is not projected to other regions of the housing <b>1</b> to avoid affecting the efficiency and introducing the light interference. No reflection and refraction of the interior light is projected to the light receiving means <b>5</b>, and affects the detection effect. The chip of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> is so big that the emitting light has a big halo, which is a very disadvantageous factor to the light receiving means that needs precise signals and influences the detection result. In this embodiment of the present invention, the infrared light emitted out from the chip of the infrared light emitting means held in the holder <b>72</b> only passes through the small round hole <b>75</b> to project out. The light passes through the big round hole <b>71</b> and is focused by the emitting lens projecting out. The cross-section of the small round hole <b>75</b> is smaller than the light emitting area of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>, and the unnecessary light is blocked. It effectively reduces the affection of the halo to the detection signal, and enhances the detection precision. In this case, the emitting positioning bracket <b>7</b> is working as the guide means of the emitted light.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>, the receiving positioning bracket <b>8</b> comprises the transom <b>81</b> fixed onto the housing <b>1</b> and the holder <b>82</b> connected together with the transom <b>81</b>. The holder <b>82</b> holds the light receiving means <b>5</b>. The holder <b>82</b> has the holding space <b>821</b> holding the light receiving means <b>5</b>. A rectangular aperture <b>820</b> is set on the top of the holder <b>82</b> aligning with the second hole <b>32</b> on the circuit board <b>3</b> to let the received light arrive at the receiving surface of the light receiving means <b>5</b>. The holder <b>82</b> is formed by extending the middle part of the transom <b>81</b> horizontally, so the weld legs of the light receiving means <b>5</b> can extend out from the slots on the two sides of the holder <b>82</b> to conveniently make the welding. For effective positioning, the two free ends of the transom <b>81</b> are fitted with the positioning groove <b>14</b> on the two sidewalls of the main body <b>10</b> of the housing <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The distance detection induction device <b>100</b> of the present invention also includes a circuit wire disposing means <b>9</b>. The circuit wire disposing means <b>9</b> can tidy up the wires (not shown in the figure) on the circuit board <b>3</b> effectively and fix them in the housing <b>1</b> by the screw <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The distance detection induction device <b>100</b> of the present invention also includes a sealing component <b>104</b> which mounted between the condensing lens <b>2</b> and the circuit board <b>3</b> for sealing. On one hand, the sealing component <b>104</b> can prevent the epoxy used for sealing from entering the light receiving means <b>5</b>; for example, prevent the epoxy from entering the light receiving means <b>5</b> through the second hole <b>32</b>. On the other hand, the sealing component <b>104</b> can prevent the interference light from entering the housing <b>1</b> or the light receiving means <b>5</b>. In the present embodiment, the sealing component <b>104</b> is made of silicone rubber; of course, it also can be made of other sealing material. If permissible, similar seal structure can be used between the emitting lens <b>21</b> and the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first hole <b>31</b> and the second hole <b>32</b> are set on the circuit board <b>3</b>. The infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> projects the infrared emitting light to the emitting lens <b>21</b> through the first hole <b>31</b>. The emitting lens <b>21</b> focuses the infrared emitting light to the target area. When human body or moving target goes into the target area, the infrared light is reflected. The receiving lens <b>22</b> receives and focuses the reflected infrared light onto the light receiving means <b>5</b> through the second hole <b>32</b>. According to PSD triangulation principle, the light receiving means <b>5</b> surveys the distance of the target, then controls the sanitary fittings finally. Set like this, the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> can be fixed on the under side of the circuit board <b>3</b> (The side of the circuit board <b>3</b> that faces the condensing lens <b>2</b> is the upside, and the opposite side is the under side of the circuit board <b>3</b>). Because the focal distance of the condensing lens <b>2</b> is set with a determinate value, the thickness of the circuit board <b>3</b> can be part of the focal distance. Meanwhile, because other electronic components are set on the circuit board <b>3</b>, it can make highly efficient use of the inner space of the housing <b>1</b> and the space on either of upside or underside of the circuit board <b>3</b> to install the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> among these electronic components. Such arrangement reduces the height and the volume of the whole distance detection induction device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Moreover, as the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> are installed between the circuit board <b>3</b> and the shielding cover <b>6</b>, which can block the exterior disturbance, and the external interference could be shielded effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> of the distance detection induction device <b>100</b> of the present invention are fixed by the positioning brackets <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> to ensure the positioning precision of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b>. The relative position of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> to the housing <b>1</b> can be ensured by fixing the positioning bracket <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> to the housing <b>1</b> coordinately. Since welding process starts after the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> are fixed into the corresponding holders of the positioning bracket <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, so that the position precisions of the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> are not influenced by the installment. Therefore, it solves the problem that the position precisions is influenced by installation, which exist in prior art. Thus, it effectively solves the problems that the distance detection induction device <b>100</b> does not work well or even doses not work caused by the bad installation precision when the infrared light emitting means <b>4</b> and the light receiving means <b>5</b> are installed to the circuit board <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, the production cost of the distance detection induction device <b>100</b> of the present invention is low, in favor of the popularization and application.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
