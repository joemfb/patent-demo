<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to novelty mitts worn by people at sporting events such as baseball games. Various mini mitts have been designed. However, such conventional mini mitts are not designed for optimum comfort, versatility, ease of use, and fabrication.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is a novelty mitt to be worn on a person's hand at a sporting such as a baseball game. In one embodiment, the novelty mitt comprises a one piece unitary flexible base having inner and outer surfaces, left and right edges, and a bottom edge. The flexible base further comprises a lower portion, a left upper portion, a central upper portion, and a right upper portion. The central upper portion is spaced apart and disposed between the left and right upper portions. The outer surface of the left and right upper portions are removably engaged with the inner surface of the central upper portion to form the curved shape of the novelty mitt. The novelty mitt further comprises first, second, third, fourth and fifth finger pockets removably engaged with the outer surface of the flexible base to accommodate left and right hands having different hand sizes. The novelty mitt further comprises a wrist strap removably engaged with the lower portion of the flexible base to secure the novelty mitt to the person's hand. The novelty mitt can be fabricated at a significantly low cost and be comfortable, versatile and easy to use.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a first embodiment of a novelty mitt <b>10</b> according to the present invention is shown worn on a hand <b>2</b> of a person. Novelty mitt <b>10</b> may be worn on a person's left hand (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or right hand (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Novelty mitt <b>10</b> generally comprises a flexible base <b>12</b>, adjustable finger pockets <b>66</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, and a wrist strap <b>92</b>. Finger pockets <b>66</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> are removably engaged with and adjustably positioned on flexible base <b>12</b> so as to comfortably receive fingers <b>4</b> of hand <b>2</b>. Wrist strap <b>92</b> is engaged with flexible base <b>12</b> and may be wrapped about wrist <b>6</b> to secure novelty mitt <b>10</b> to hand <b>2</b>. Novelty mitt <b>10</b> may be used at a variety of sporting events such as a baseball game and/or corporate events or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, flexible base <b>12</b> comprises a flexible lower layer <b>14</b> and a flexible upper layer <b>32</b>. Lower layer <b>14</b> comprises an inside surface <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and an outside surface <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Outside surface <b>20</b> has a central portion <b>22</b> and a lower portion <b>24</b>. Lower layer <b>14</b> further comprises a left edge portion <b>16</b>, a right edge portion <b>26</b>, a bottom edge portion <b>28</b>, and a top edge portion <b>30</b>. Upper layer <b>32</b> comprises an inside surface <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and an outside surface <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Outside surface <b>36</b> has lower and upper portions <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>. Upper layer <b>32</b> further comprises a left edge portion <b>52</b>, a right edge portion <b>54</b>, a bottom edge portion <b>56</b>, and a top edge portion <b>58</b>. Left edge portion <b>16</b> of lower layer <b>14</b> is fastened to right edge portion <b>54</b> of upper layer <b>32</b> by stitching <b>60</b>. Right edge portion <b>26</b> of lower layer <b>14</b> is fastened to left edge portion <b>52</b> of upper layer <b>32</b> by stitching <b>62</b>. Top edge portion <b>30</b> of lower layer <b>14</b> is secured to top edge portion <b>58</b> of upper layer <b>32</b> by stitching <b>64</b>. Inside surface <b>18</b> of lower layer <b>14</b> faces inside surface <b>34</b> of upper layer <b>32</b>. Lower and upper layers <b>14</b> and <b>32</b> are made from a neoprene material having a thickness of about five millimeters (5 mm). The neoprene material is available as &#x201c;Textured Raw Neoprene&#x201d; from www.foamorder.com, FoamOrder.Com, 1325 Howard Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94103. One side of the neoprene sheet has a smooth surface and the other side has a course finish. The neoprene layer is orientated such that the palm side of mitt <b>10</b> has the course finish for external gripping.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, flexible base <b>10</b> further comprises nylon stitching <b>65</b> attaching lower and upper layers <b>14</b> and <b>32</b> to create the appearance of fingers of an actual baseball glove.

The stitching of the neoprene strings <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> is tight enough to create a curve at the fingertip region of the palm side of novelty mitt <b>10</b> giving a shell shaped appearance. Strings <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> only show on inside surface <b>20</b> (palm side) of novelty mitt <b>10</b> similar to a leather baseball glove. Strings <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> cross at sections <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> which are substantially over stitches <b>65</b>. This also provides the appearance of a leather baseball glove where the leather stitching keeps the actual fingers pockets together. Strings <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are made from neoprene. Strings <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> have a width of about 0.25 inches and a length of about twelve (12) inches.</p>

As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when cuts are made along lines <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b>, blank <b>200</b> is formed into three (3) sections: a left section <b>214</b> having inside edge <b>216</b>, a central section <b>218</b>; and a right section <b>220</b> having an inside edge <b>222</b>. As best shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the inside edges <b>216</b> and <b>222</b> of left and right sections <b>214</b> and <b>220</b>, respectively, are folded and secured to the back side of section <b>218</b> about its centerline by stitching <b>224</b> to form a shell shape. As shown, stitching <b>224</b> may run along the entire length of inside edges <b>216</b> and <b>222</b>. Alternatively, inside edges <b>216</b> and <b>222</b> of left and right sections <b>214</b> and <b>220</b>, respectively, are bent and secured to the front or palm side of section <b>218</b> about its centerline by stitching to form the shell shape. In this case, the stitching may likewise be extended along the entire length of inside edges <b>216</b> and <b>222</b>.
