<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Integrated circuit packages comprise vias, each of which extends from a pad in communication with an integrated circuit on a semiconductor chip through insulating material overlying the semiconductor chip to an attachment surface facing a substrate. The portion of each via proximate the attachment surface is laterally offset from the portion proximate the pad from which it extends in a direction away from the center of the semiconductor chip. Metallic material received in the vias mechanically and electrically interconnects the semiconductor chip to the substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit packaging, and more particularly to integrated circuit packages having vias for receiving solder bumps to interconnect a die to a substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A die may be formed of a semiconductor chip overlaid with a number of alternating layers of metallic materials and inter-layer dielectric (ILD) materials. The die may further include passivation materials overlaying the metallic and ILD layers, and one or more layers of insulating material, such as polyimides overlaying the passivation materials.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, solder bumps or other interconnecting structures extending through the layers of insulating material interconnect the die to a substrate, typically formed of an organic material. Collectively, the die and interconnected substrate are typically referred to as an integrated circuit package.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each of the different materials making up the package has a different coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). For example, a silicon semiconductor chip may have a CTE of approximately 2.6&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C.; polyimide may have a CTE of approximately 35&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C.; lead-free solder material may have a CTE in the range of approximately 20-30&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C. and an organic substrate may have a CTE of approximately 17&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C. During manufacture and use, the temperature of the package changes, causing the different materials to expand or contract according to their respective CTE.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">CTE mismatches in turn result in thermo-mechanical stress on package components due to differential expansion. Components also tend to warp when subjected to heat, based on CTE differences between the components. This causes peeling stress as components warp away from one another. These stresses are typically referred to as chip package interaction (CPI) stress.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Historically, CPI stress was mitigated, at least in part, by solder bumps interconnecting the die to the substrate. The solder bumps were typically formed from relatively ductile leaded alloys which were capable of deforming in response to differential expansion and warping, thus absorbing stress, and tending to isolate the die and substrate from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, however, leaded solder materials have been replaced with lead-free materials. These lead-free materials tend be stiffer, that is, have lower ductility than leaded materials. As a result, the lead-free solder bumps tend to absorb less stress. In some cases, this can cause cracking or de-lamination of the die from the rest of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This problem is exacerbated by other material choices made necessary by performance requirements. In particular, as semiconductor chip feature sizes decrease, it becomes necessary for performance reasons to select ILD materials having dielectric constant (K) of less than 3 (low-K materials) or less than 2.7 (ultra-low K (ULK) materials). Such materials often have lower shear strength and cohesive strength and poorer adhesion to adjacent die layers than dielectric materials with K&#x3e;3. Accordingly, low-K and ULK ILD materials are particularly prone to mechanical failure such as cracking or de-lamination.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need for semiconductor package designs which provide improved protection against thermo-mechanical stresses.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a semiconductor package <b>10</b>, exemplary of an embodiment of the present invention. Semiconductor package <b>10</b> generally includes a die <b>12</b> interconnected to a substrate <b>26</b> by a series of solder bumps <b>28</b>. Die <b>12</b> includes a semiconductor chip <b>11</b> with an integrated circuit thereon (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Die <b>12</b> is attached to substrate <b>26</b> in flip-chip. Solder bumps <b>28</b> extend from an attachment surface <b>34</b> of die <b>12</b>. Die <b>12</b> is attached to the substrate by way of these bumps, which are re-flowed for mechanical and electrical interconnection to substrate <b>26</b>. Optionally, an underfill (not shown) may further mechanically attach die <b>12</b> to substrate <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The integrated circuit is interconnected by way of a back end of line (BEOL) stack including BEOL pads <b>14</b>. In addition, the BEOL stack includes inter-layer dielectric (ILD) material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> which electrically separates conductive elements of the BEOL stack. ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be formed of a low-K dielectric material such as HSSQ, diamond-like carbon, carbon doped SiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiCOH or an ULK dielectric material such as porous SiCOH. For simplicity, only part of the BEOL stack is depicted, including BEOL pads <b>14</b> and ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. BEOL pads <b>14</b> are connected to other elements of BEOL stack (not shown) by conductive traces (not shown) passing through ILD layer <b>15</b>. The BEOL stack may include additional layers of metallic traces and ILD material between semiconductor chip <b>11</b> and BEOL pads <b>14</b> and ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Die <b>12</b> may also include a layer of passivation material <b>18</b> overlying BEOL pads <b>14</b> and ILD material <b>16</b> to protect elements of die <b>12</b> from corrosion. Atop passivation material <b>18</b>, die <b>12</b> may include layers of insulating material. Package <b>10</b> is illustrated with two layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of insulating material, but may have more or fewer layers. Layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may be formed of polyimide, polybenzoxadiazole, benzocyclobuten or similar material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Vias <b>24</b> are formed through layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> to receive solder bumps <b>28</b> for electrically and mechanically interconnecting die <b>12</b> to a substrate <b>26</b> by way of BEOL pads <b>14</b>. Solder bumps <b>28</b> are formed of an electrically conductive material, and extend from attachment surface <b>34</b> of die <b>12</b>. Solder bumps <b>28</b> may be formed of a lead-free material, such as SnAg, SnCu, SnAgCu or other lead-free alloys. In fine-pitch applications, solder bumps <b>28</b> may be Cu pillars. One or more conductive metallic layers (not shown) may also be formed between solder bumps <b>24</b> and BEOL pad <b>14</b>. Optionally, the region between attachment surface <b>34</b> and substrate <b>26</b> proximate solder bumps <b>28</b> may be filled with an epoxy underfill (not shown) to protect and/or mechanically reinforce the interconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Substrate <b>26</b> may be mounted on a circuit board <b>32</b> for interconnecting semiconductor package <b>10</b> to other devices interconnected to the circuit board. Typically, substrate <b>26</b> is formed of an organic material, but as will be appreciated, may instead be formed of any suitable material known to skilled persons.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a portion of the underside of layer <b>22</b> of insulating material, showing the array of solder bumps (collectively, solder bumps <b>28</b>; individually, solder bumps <b>28</b><i>a </i>through <b>28</b><i>y</i>) for interconnecting semiconductor package <b>10</b> to substrate <b>26</b>. Solder bumps are arranged generally in a 5&#xd7;5 grid pattern. However, solder bumps <b>28</b> may instead be arranged in alternate patterns with more or fewer bumps according to functional requirements of semiconductor package <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown, solder bump <b>28</b><i>a </i>is located at the centre of die <b>12</b>, marked point A, which lies over the centre of semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. Solder bumps <b>28</b><i>b </i>through <b>28</b><i>y </i>are located away from the centre of die <b>12</b>. However, solder bumps <b>28</b> need not include a bump at the centre of die <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">During manufacture and in operation, semiconductor package <b>10</b> may be subjected to heat. Unfortunately, this causes the components of semiconductor package <b>10</b> to expand and/or warp at rates corresponding to their respective coefficients of thermal expansion, which, as previously noted, can vary widely.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As solder bumps <b>28</b> mechanically interconnect die <b>12</b> with substrate <b>26</b>, differential expansion and warping of die <b>12</b> and substrate <b>26</b> causes thermo-mechanical shear and peeling stress on solder bumps <b>28</b>, BEOL pad <b>14</b>, the joints between solder bumps <b>28</b> and BEOL pad <b>14</b> and/or the joints between solder bumps <b>28</b> and substrate <b>26</b>. Further, stress on BEOL pads <b>14</b> may impose stress on the adjacent ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. Shear stress due to differential expansion and warping may also be present, depending on conditions and package characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of die <b>12</b> and substrate <b>26</b> will tend to thermally expand away from its respective centre in all directions. Thus, the cumulative effect of expansion increases with increasing distance from the respective geometric centres of die <b>12</b> and substrate <b>26</b>. The cumulative effects of warping will likewise increase with increasing distance from the centres of die <b>12</b> and substrate <b>26</b>. Accordingly, the magnitude of thermo-mechanical stress increases with increasing distance from the centres of die <b>12</b> and substrate <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, thermo-mechanical stress will be close to zero at the centre (location A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Thermo-mechanical stress will be higher at location B relative to location A, and higher still at location C. For the same reason, peak thermo-mechanical stress increases with increasing size of die <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The thermo-mechanical stress, particularly peeling stress, can cause cracks to form and propagate in ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. Partial or even full de-lamination of layers of ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may also occur. ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and the interfaces between ILD material <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and adjacent components of semiconductor package <b>10</b> are particularly vulnerable to both cracking and de-lamination: while low-K and ULK ILD materials are often desirable or necessary for performance reasons, such materials generally have poor mechanical properties such as low strength.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each of solder bumps <b>28</b><i>a </i>through <b>28</b><i>y </i>is received in a corresponding via <b>24</b><i>a </i>through <b>24</b><i>y </i>(collectively, vias <b>24</b>). Vias <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>are depicted in cross-section in the enlarged portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Via <b>24</b><i>a </i>is located at the centre of die <b>12</b> and over the centre of semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. Via <b>24</b><i>b </i>is laterally offset away from the centre of die <b>12</b>. The geometric arrangement of via <b>24</b><i>b </i>is representative of the arrangement of vias <b>24</b><i>c </i>through <b>24</b><i>y</i>, which are likewise laterally offset away from the centre of die <b>12</b>. Vias <b>24</b> have first via portions <b>36</b> and second via portions <b>38</b> (individually, via portions <b>36</b><i>a </i>to <b>36</b><i>y </i>and <b>38</b><i>a </i>to <b>38</b><i>y</i>, respectively). First via portions <b>36</b> extend from BEOL pads <b>14</b> through layer <b>20</b>. Second via portions <b>38</b> extend from attachment surface <b>34</b> through layer <b>22</b> and are in communication with first via portions <b>36</b>. Thus, vias <b>24</b> extend away from BEOL pads <b>14</b> through both layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each one of first via portions <b>36</b> and second via portions <b>38</b> extends along a longitudinal axis which passes through the centre of each respective via portion. The longitudinal axis of first via portion <b>36</b><i>b </i>of via <b>24</b><i>b </i>is axis <b>42</b>, while the longitudinal axis of second via portion <b>38</b><i>b </i>of via <b>24</b><i>b </i>is axis <b>44</b>. First and second via portions <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>a </i>of via <b>24</b><i>a </i>are coaxial and extend along longitudinal axis <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First via portions <b>36</b> have openings <b>48</b> proximate BEOL pads <b>14</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as openings <b>48</b><i>a</i>,<b>48</b><i>b </i>of first via portions <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>, respectively) and openings <b>50</b> where first via portions <b>36</b> intersect with second via portions <b>38</b> (likewise shown as <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>). Similarly, second via portions have openings <b>52</b> at the intersection of the first and second via portions and openings <b>54</b> at attachment surface <b>34</b> (shown as <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>and <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, respectively). Via portions <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are frustoconical in shape, increasing in diameter from a minimum at openings <b>48</b>, <b>52</b>, respectively, to a maximum at openings <b>50</b>, <b>54</b>, respectively. The minimum diameter of second via portions <b>38</b> is greater than the maximum diameter of first via portions <b>36</b>. As a result of vias <b>24</b> having this geometry, the sidewalls of vias <b>24</b> have flat steps atop the surface of layer <b>20</b> where the first and second portions intersect. As will be appreciated, the shape of vias <b>24</b> determines the shape of solder bumps <b>28</b>. Therefore, because of the geometry of vias <b>24</b>, solder bumps <b>28</b> sit on the flat steps in the walls of vias <b>24</b>. Also as a result of the shape of vias <b>24</b>, solder bumps <b>28</b> are larger in diameter where they bond to substrate <b>26</b> than where they bond to BEOL pads <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In alternate embodiments, vias <b>24</b> may have different shapes. For example, first and second portions may be cylindrical in shape, with vertical sidewalls and a step in the sidewalls where the first and second portions intersect.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the underside of layer <b>22</b> of insulating material is shown in simplified schematic view. For the purpose of illustrating the configuration of vias <b>24</b>, solder bumps <b>28</b> are omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In addition, only openings <b>50</b> of first via portions <b>36</b> and openings <b>54</b> of second via portions <b>38</b> are shown. As previously noted, via <b>24</b><i>a </i>is located at the centre of die <b>12</b>. First and second portions <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>a </i>of via <b>24</b><i>a </i>are co-axial, and extend along longitudinal axis <b>46</b>, which passes through the centre of die <b>12</b> and the centre of semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. Conversely, via <b>24</b><i>b </i>is located away from the centre of die <b>12</b>. Second via portion <b>38</b><i>b </i>of via <b>24</b><i>b </i>is laterally offset from first via portion <b>36</b><i>b </i>in a direction away from the geometric centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. In particular, longitudinal axis <b>44</b> of second via portion <b>38</b><i>b </i>is laterally offset from longitudinal axis <b>42</b> in a direction away from the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. Vias <b>24</b><i>c </i>through <b>24</b><i>y </i>are likewise offset away from the centre of die <b>12</b>, and their respective second via portions are offset away from their respective first via portions in a direction away from the centre of die <b>12</b> and the centre of semiconductor chip <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As vias <b>24</b> define the shape of solder bumps <b>28</b>, the portions of solder bumps <b>28</b> proximate substrate <b>26</b> are likewise offset from the portions proximate BEOL pads <b>14</b> in a direction away from the geometric centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. Thus, offsetting second via portions <b>38</b> away first via portions <b>36</b> in this way locates bonds between solder bumps <b>28</b> and substrate <b>26</b> where thermo mechanical stress is highest. By contrast, if second via portions <b>38</b> were not offset from first via portions <b>36</b>, the bonds between solder bumps <b>28</b> and substrate <b>26</b> would be located in lower-stress regions closer to the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. As will be appreciated, since via <b>24</b><i>a </i>is located at the centre of die <b>12</b>, an offset in any given direction would result in part of second via portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>being located farther from the centre of die <b>12</b>, and part of second via portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>being closer. Therefore offsetting second via portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>would not provide the same benefit as offsetting the remainder of second via portions <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thermo-mechanical stress applied to solder bumps <b>28</b> is transferred to layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, BEOL pads <b>14</b> and ILD layers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. As previously noted, ILD layers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are prone to cracking and/or de-lamination. Layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, on the other hand, are relatively soft and can tolerate some deformation without cracking, breaking or delaminating from adjacent layers of package <b>10</b>. Deformation of layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> absorbs stress. Layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> therefore have a cushioning effect, absorbing some stress so that less stress is transferred to BEOL pads <b>14</b> and ILD layers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. The above-described geometry of vias <b>24</b> provides additional material of layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> below solder bumps <b>28</b> in the areas which experience high thermo-mechanical stress, that is, on the side of each solder bump <b>28</b> located farther away from the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. Thus, relative to a die without offset via portions, more stress can be absorbed by deformation of layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> rather than being transferred to BEOL pads <b>14</b> and ILD layers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, first via portions <b>36</b> are aligned with BEOL pads <b>14</b>, which are evenly distributed over die <b>12</b> in a grid pattern. Second via portions <b>38</b> are of a consistent size and a consistent offset distance from the corresponding first via portions <b>36</b>. The maximum allowable offset distance is governed by process limitations. In addition, as will be appreciated, each one of second via portions <b>38</b> must overlap the corresponding first via portion <b>36</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the offset distance is determined by the size of the first and second via portions <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each one of second via portions <b>38</b> is offset from the corresponding one of first via portions <b>36</b> outwardly along a radial line that passes through the centre of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b> and the centre of the respective first via portion <b>36</b>. For example, line <b>55</b> intersects axis <b>42</b> along which the first via portion <b>36</b><i>b </i>of via <b>24</b><i>b </i>extends and axis <b>46</b>, which passes through the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. Axis <b>44</b>, along which second via portion <b>38</b><i>b </i>extends, is offset from axis <b>42</b> outwardly along line <b>55</b>. For via portions which are symmetrical and have circular openings, such as the frustoconical via portions depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, this results in second via portions <b>38</b> located at the farthest possible distance from the centre of die <b>12</b> for a given offset distance. In this configuration, solder bumps <b>28</b> will bond to substrate <b>26</b> at the regions which experience the highest stress, maximizing the stress-mitigating effect.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other embodiments, the arrangement of BEOL pads <b>14</b>, first via portions <b>36</b> and/or second via portions may differ. For example, the distance and direction of offset between the first and second via portions <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, that is, between the longitudinal axes along which they extend, may be varied based on the location of a particular via <b>24</b>. For example, vias <b>24</b> which are closer to the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b> may have smaller offsets than those farther from the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. In some embodiments, second via portions <b>38</b> of different vias <b>24</b> may have differing sizes. For example, vias <b>24</b> located towards the corners of die <b>12</b> may have larger second portions <b>38</b> than those of other vias. In some embodiments, the size of outer via portions and the offset size may vary proportionally with the distribution of thermo-mechanical stress.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, vias <b>24</b> may be grouped into patterns centred on the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, vias <b>24</b><i>b </i>through <b>24</b><i>i </i>are arranged in a first generally rectangular or square pattern centred at the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. The first via portions of vias <b>24</b><i>b </i>through <b>24</b><i>i </i>are laterally offset relative to the respective second via portions in a direction towards the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b> (equivalently, the second via portions of vias <b>24</b><i>b</i>-<b>24</b><i>i </i>are offset from the respective first via portions in a direction away from the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>). The size of the offset is consistent for each one of vias <b>24</b><i>b </i>through <b>24</b><i>i </i>making up the first generally rectangular pattern. Vias <b>24</b><i>j </i>through <b>24</b><i>y </i>are arranged in a second generally rectangular pattern that is concentric with the first generally rectangular pattern. That is, the first and second generally rectangular patterns are both centred on the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>. The first via portions of vias <b>24</b><i>j </i>through <b>24</b><i>y </i>are laterally offset relative to the respective second via portions in a direction towards the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b> (equivalently, the second via portions of vias <b>24</b><i>j</i>-<b>24</b><i>y </i>are offset from the respective first via portions in a direction away from the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b>). The size of the offset is consistent for each one of vias <b>24</b><i>j </i>through <b>24</b><i>y </i>making up the second generally rectangular pattern. In some embodiments, the offset size of the second pattern may be different than the offset size of the first pattern. For example, the offset size may be larger for the second pattern, each member of which is farther from the centres of die <b>12</b> and semiconductor chip <b>11</b> than the members of the first pattern. In some embodiments, vias <b>24</b> may be arranged in concentric patterns which are not rectangular. For example, vias <b>24</b> may be arranged in circular or oval-shaped rings.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, a die may have only a single layer of insulating material. In such embodiments, vias may have asymmetrically tapered boundaries such that each via's opening proximate the attachment surface is laterally offset from the centres of die and semiconductor chip relative to the via's opening proximate the corresponding BEOL pad. The via openings proximate the attachment surface may also be larger than the corresponding via openings proximate the BEOL pads. Relative to a die without offset vias, such an arrangement would provide additional insulating material below the solder bumps on the side farthest away from the die and semiconductor chip centres, that is, in the areas which experience high thermo-mechanical stress.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Though semiconductor package <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> with a central via <b>24</b><i>a</i>, central via <b>24</b><i>a </i>may alternatively be omitted from semiconductor package <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the first portion <b>36</b> of each via <b>24</b> is centred over the respective BEOL pad <b>14</b>. However, in an alternate embodiment, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, first via portions <b>36</b>&#x2032; may be offset relative to BEOL pads in much the same way as second via portions <b>38</b>&#x2032; are offset relative to first via portions <b>36</b>&#x2032;. This will result in second via portions <b>38</b>&#x2032; being located farther away from the centre of die <b>12</b> relative to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for a given offset distance between the first and second via portions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5K</figref>, an exemplary process for manufacturing an integrated circuit die and interconnecting it to a substrate will now be described, The process is described and illustrated with reference to a single die <b>12</b> comprising a single semiconductor chip <b>11</b>, however the steps of fabricating die <b>12</b> could instead be performed on a wafer comprising multiple semiconductor chips before singulation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As previously noted, semiconductor package <b>10</b> is assembled in flip-chip. Therefore, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5I</figref>, the sub-assembly of die <b>12</b> is upside-down relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, semiconductor chip <b>11</b> is formed on or in a semiconductor substrate in a conventional manner. Semiconductor chip <b>11</b> includes active circuit elements and a series of conductive traces and layers of dielectric material to interconnect the active circuit elements to one another and to I/O pads. This series of interconnecting and insulating elements is referred to as the BEOL stack. BEOL stack design and fabrication is well-known to skilled persons. Accordingly, for simplicity of illustration and explanation, only one BEOL pad <b>14</b> and two layers of dielectric material (ILD) <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are shown. BEOL pad <b>14</b> is connected to other elements of the BEOL stack by conductive traces passing through ILD layer <b>15</b>, however for simplicity, these are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Passivation material <b>18</b> is deposited overlaying the BEOL stack. Passivation material <b>18</b> serves to protect die <b>12</b> from corrosion. Passivation material <b>18</b> may be formed by a chemical vapour deposition process, such as a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition process (PECVD) or a low pressure chemical vapour deposition process (LPCVD). Silicon oxide passivation material may be formed by a PECVD process using silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N2O) or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) or by a LPCVD process using tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>) or dichlorosilane (SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) with nitrous oxide. Silicon nitride passivation material may be formed by a PECVD process using silane and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) or nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) in the presence of argon. For simplicity, passivation material <b>18</b> is depicted as a single layer. However, passivation material <b>18</b> may consist of a multilayer stack, consisting of an adhesion layer (NBlok), overlaid with layers of SiN, and SiO<sub>2 </sub>which may optionally be overlaid with a further layer of SiN. Typically, passivation material <b>18</b> is between 500 nm and 3000 nm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A mask <b>60</b> is formed overlaying passivation material <b>18</b> using a lithographic process. Mask <b>60</b> has openings <b>62</b> at the desired locations of vias <b>24</b>&#x2014;in particular, openings <b>48</b> of vias <b>24</b>. Typically, mask <b>60</b> is a photoresist mask.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once mask <b>60</b> has been formed, passivation material <b>18</b> is etched to create openings through passivation material <b>18</b> corresponding to openings <b>62</b>. The etching may be any suitable known etching technique, such as a reactive ion etch, selected based on the composition and thickness of passivation material <b>18</b>. A technique which is selective to passivation material <b>18</b> should be used, so as to remove as little of BEOL pads <b>14</b> as possible. Mask <b>60</b> is removed, e.g. by a solvent that is selective to the mask material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows in-progress semiconductor package <b>10</b> after etching of passivation layer <b>18</b> and removal of mask <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A layer <b>20</b> of insulating material is deposited overlaying passivation material <b>18</b>. The insulating material of layer <b>20</b> may be photo-sensitive, and may be deposited, for example, using a spin-coating process. In the finished state of die <b>12</b>, first portions <b>36</b> of vias <b>24</b> are formed in layer <b>20</b>. Accordingly, the thickness of layer <b>20</b> is determined at least in part by the desired thickness of first via portions <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows in-progress die <b>12</b> with layer <b>20</b> of insulating material. After deposition of layer <b>20</b>, first via portions <b>36</b> of vias <b>24</b> through layer <b>20</b> are created. The following process is one example of a suitable process for forming tapered vias through a positive-acting photosensitive polyimide. As will be appreciated, different processes could be used, for example, to form vias of different shapes (e.g. cylindrical) or using different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">First, layer <b>20</b> is patterned using a lithographic exposure process. For example, areas of layer <b>20</b> may be lithographically exposed using ultra-violet radiation through a photomask. Exposure causes the exposed regions to become soluble to a developing solution.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Exposed layer <b>20</b> is immersed in a developer which selectively dissolves the exposed regions <b>63</b>, forming first via portions <b>36</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. Following developing, layer <b>20</b> may be cured, making it resilient against further developing processes.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C-5D</figref>, exposed region <b>63</b> and first via portion <b>36</b> have tapered boundaries. The shape of exposed region <b>63</b> and the degree (slope) of tapering of the walls of via portion <b>36</b> are influenced by exposure energy (dose and time of exposure), the degree of pre-cure (e.g. on a hot plate after spin coating of layer <b>20</b>) and the develop recipe (developer chemistry, develop time and spray pattern).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A second layer <b>22</b> of insulating material may be deposited on layer <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>. Layer <b>22</b> may be deposited in a similar manner to layer <b>20</b>. It is then exposed and developed in a similar manner to layer <b>20</b> to create second via portions <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Layer <b>22</b> may be of a different material than layer <b>20</b>, such that a developing process can be selected to remove material from layer <b>22</b> while removing little or no material from layer <b>20</b>. Alternatively, layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> may be of the same material if layer <b>20</b> is cured before layer <b>22</b> is deposited, such that layer <b>22</b> may be developed without removing a substantial amount of material from layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, exposed area <b>66</b> of layer <b>22</b> has tapered boundaries, similar to exposed region <b>63</b>. Exposed area <b>66</b> is also larger than first via portion <b>36</b>, such that after layer <b>22</b> is developed, a portion of layer <b>20</b> will be uncovered. Exposed area <b>66</b> is also offset from first via portion <b>36</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, once layer <b>22</b> has been developed, the cavities forming first portions <b>36</b> and second portions <b>38</b> of vias <b>24</b> have been defined.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As the first portions <b>36</b> of vias <b>24</b> are formed in layer <b>20</b> and the second portions <b>38</b> of vias <b>24</b> are formed in layer <b>23</b>, the thickness of layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> is determined at least in part by the desired thickness of first via portions <b>36</b> and second via portions <b>38</b>. Typically, layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are between 2 &#x3bc;m and 15 &#x3bc;m thick, though most commonly they are between 3 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m thick.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>, a metallic layer <b>68</b> is deposited on die <b>12</b> and inside first and second via portions <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. Metallic layer <b>68</b> enables solder bumps <b>28</b> to be deposited in vias <b>24</b> by electroplating. Optionally, one or more additional metallic layers (not shown) may be formed underlying metallic layer <b>68</b> to serve as a barrier between layer <b>22</b> and solder bumps <b>28</b> and to provide additional stress relief.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A bump-forming layer <b>70</b> is overlaid on the one or more metallic layers and is patterned to form openings aligned with openings <b>54</b> of second via portions <b>38</b> to receive solder material. Bump-forming layer <b>70</b> is formed of an electrically insulating material, and may be deposited and patterned (that is, exposed and developed) similarly to layers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Bump forming layer is developed using a solvent that leaves metallic layer <b>68</b> intact.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Solder bumps <b>28</b> are deposited in vias <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref>. Solder bumps <b>28</b> may be deposited by an electroplating process using metallic layer <b>68</b> as the anode, such that solder bumps are only formed on the portions of metallic layer <b>68</b> which are exposed to the electroplating bath (that is, the portions within vias <b>24</b>). Solder bumps <b>28</b> are deposited in a pillar-like shape, defined by bump-forming layer <b>70</b>. Accordingly, the thickness of bump-forming layer <b>70</b> must be greater than the desired height of solder bumps <b>28</b> to ensure that solder bumps <b>28</b> do not protrude during the electroplating process.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref>, following deposition of solder bumps <b>28</b>, bump-forming layer <b>70</b> is removed along with the portion of metallic layer <b>68</b> and any underlying metallic layers which lay outside vias <b>24</b>. Bump-forming layer may be removed, for example, using a solvent selective to bump forming layer <b>70</b>. Metallic layer <b>68</b> and any underlying metallic layers may be removed using etching processes selected to leave solder bumps <b>28</b> and layer <b>22</b> intact. A reflow process is then applied to form solder bumps <b>28</b> into spherical solder balls.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Once solder bumps <b>28</b> are deposited and bump forming layer <b>70</b> removed, die <b>12</b> may be mounted to substrate <b>26</b> to form a semiconductor package <b>10</b>. Of course, if the previous fabrication steps were carried out at the wafer level, that is, if they were performed on a wafer comprising multiple semiconductor chips, the wafer must first be cut into individual dies so that each individual package may be mounted to a substrate <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">To mount, die <b>12</b> is inverted and positioned on substrate <b>26</b> such that each of solder bumps <b>28</b> sits in contact with a corresponding contact pad <b>72</b> on substrate <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref>. Solder bumps <b>28</b> are then heated so they reflow and bond to contact pads <b>72</b>, electrically and mechanically interconnecting die <b>12</b> with substrate <b>26</b>. Optionally, the region between attachment surface <b>34</b> and substrate <b>26</b> may be filled with an underfill to seal solder bumps <b>28</b> and to mechanically reinforce semiconductor package <b>10</b>. As will be appreciated, substrate <b>26</b> comprises a further series of metallic interconnects and a series of contacts (not shown) by which semiconductor package <b>10</b> may be interconnected with a circuit board (not shown) for connection of semiconductor package <b>10</b> with other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Embodiments of the present invention may be used in a variety of applications, including DRAM, SRAM, EEPROM and flash memory modules, graphics processors, general purpose processors, CPU's and APU's.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The above-described embodiments are intended to be illustrative only and in no way limiting. The described embodiments of carrying out the invention are susceptible to many modifications of form, arrangement of parts, details and order of operation.
