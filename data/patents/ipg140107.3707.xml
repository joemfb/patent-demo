<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments herein generally relate to target detecting, and in particular, to multidirectional target detection and aerial surveillance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems have been utilized for many years for various applications and are well known for providing high resolution. For instance, SAR systems are well known as for identifying objects out of deliberate or natural clutter to provide a variety of functions including: area mapping, surveillance, and target detection. Further, these systems can be used from the ground (i.e., ground based SAR systems) as well as from the air (airborne SAR systems) and exploit the motion of an aircraft or vehicle, simulating a large antenna by combining return radar data along the flight path. This simulation is called the synthetic aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, airborne SAR systems are typically side-looking radars which produce two-dimensional (2-D) images of the earth's surface that are perpendicular to the aircraft path of flight and located on one side of the aircraft. One dimension in the image is called range (i.e., cross track) and is a measurement of the &#x201c;line-of sight&#x201d; distance from the radar to the target. Range measurements are determined by measuring the time from transmission of a pulse to receiving the echo from a target. Additionally, range resolution is determined by the transmitted pulse width. Cross-range resolution is achieved by coherently integrating the radar return signals along the flight path.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of a SAR system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,796,829 (hereby incorporated by reference) entitled &#x201c;Method and system for forming an image with enhanced contrast and/or reduced noise,&#x201d; listing as inventors the same coinventors as the present application and filed on Dec. 10, 2008, and being assigned to The United States of America as represented by the Secretary of the Army.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To study the capabilities and limitations of utilizing the ultra-wideband (UWB) radar technology for the detection of concealed targets, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) implemented different versions of UWB low-frequency SAR. A version of the UWB SAR radar that ARL designed and built is the vehicle-based radar which is discussed in detail in the publication by Marc Ressler, Lam Nguyen, Francois Koenig, David Wong, and Gregory Smith, entitled &#x201c;The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) Forward-Looking Radar,&#x201d; Proceedings of SPIE, Unmanned Systems Technology IX, Vol. 6561, May 2007, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. It is to be appreciated that the radar can be configured in both forward-looking and side-looking SAR modes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional side-looking SAR systems are designed such that the radar is typically mounted on an airborne vehicle (e.g., aircraft) whereby the transmitting and receiving antennas typically face the direction perpendicular to the flight path. Through signal processing, the reflected radar signals along the flight path are combined to form the SAR image for the area that exists along only one side of the reflected image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an illustration of a conventional side-looking SAR system used to survey a long strip of an area of interest <b>410</b>. The challenge here is the detection of directional targets <b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>,<b>4</b>, which only have high reflectivity in a particular direction. Arrows extend from each directional target <b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>,<b>4</b> representing the direction of high reflectivity or the target's individual radar cross section. Typically, the reflected signals from targets <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> backscatter in directions that the radar will not be able to receive. In particular, an airborne vehicle <b>420</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, passing over target <b>1</b> may only be able to recognize the target if it receives the return radar signals in the direction of the arrows extending therefrom. Similarly, the same is true for targets <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>. Consequently, in order to receive or detect the reflected signals being radiated from the targets <b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>,<b>4</b>, the airborne vehicle with radar platform must fly in a direction perpendicular to the area of interest <b>410</b>, or alternatively, fly in a circular path around the area of interest <b>410</b> in order to capture all of the signals reflected from the targets. Thus, the overall operation is very impractical as it takes a long time to traverse all the pertinent paths to obtain target information regarding area of interest <b>410</b>. This requirement significantly slows down the total SAR operation and further makes a surveillance task using these conventional systems impractical.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an illustration of a conventional forward-looking SAR system mounted to an airborne vehicle <b>520</b> used to survey a long strip of an area of interest <b>510</b>. The radar might be able to receive return signals from some small sections of targets <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> along the flight path, but may not capture the return signals from targets <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As such, an ultra-wideband radar system is needed that can radiate and receive energy in all directions, thereby employing an array of antennas having the capability to capture the return radar signals in all directions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a system for investigating an area of interest to display a SAR image in a single pass including: a radar platform mounted on a mobile vehicle, a radar antenna array including a first group of antenna elements including at least one transmitting element and a plurality of receiving elements and a second group of antenna elements including at least one transmitting element and a plurality of receiving elements wherein the first group may transmit a first group of signals and receive a first group of backscatter signals in a forward direction and the second group may transmit a second group of signals and receive a second group of backscatter signals in a backward direction; a first group of receiving modules to capture and digitize the return radar signals in a forward direction, and a second group of receiving modules to capture and digitize the return radar signals in a backward direction; a processor in communication with the radar receivers to process the first and second group of signals and produce a first and second image respectively; a GPS system to measure the radar position logged by the radar platform; an image combiner (part of the processor) to combine the first and said second images; and a display to display the combined image from the first and second combined images.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The image may be either a 2-D or 3-D image. The system enables the detection of directional targets (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) in a single pass.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the transmitting elements may include a transmitter and a transmitting antenna and each of the receiving elements may include a receiver and a receiving antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The number of the receiving elements in the first group of antenna elements may be equal to half of the total number of the receiving elements and the number of receiving elements in the second group of antenna elements may be equal to half of a total number of the receiving elements.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of the receiving antenna elements may be positioned in an adjacent array and separated equidistant.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The receiving antenna elements form a circular array.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cross-range resolution of the system may be provided by the receiving elements and the radar platform, and the motion of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each of the receiving antennas may collect electromagnetic backscatter signals and feed the data to the respective receiver, whereby the respective receiver captures and digitizes the radar signals into digital signals.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The processor may perform data processing on the digital signals including removal of interference, motion compensation, filtering, and forming, and combining SAR imagery.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another exemplary embodiment may include a method for investigating an area of interest including mounting a radar platform and a radar antenna array on a mobile (ground or airborne) vehicle; transmitting a first group of signals and receiving a first group of backscatter signals in a forward direction from the radar antenna array;

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">The method may further include collecting backscatter radar signals via said receiving antennas and feeding said data to the respective receiver, whereby the respective receiver converts the radar signals into digital signals.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0040">The embodiments herein provide a SAR system capable of, among other things: area mapping, forming two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) imagery for the detection of targets under foliage, targets with high directional reflectivity, obstacles for robotic navigation, and mapping of internal building structures. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 10</figref> similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2</figref> show diagrammatically data collection geometry with a SAR radar system <b>100</b>. Generally, the radar system <b>100</b> includes an airborne or ground-based vehicle <b>110</b>, a radar device (not shown), a transmitting/receiving antenna array <b>200</b>, and a global positioning system (GPS) subsystem <b>230</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Both the radar device and the transmitting/receiving antenna array <b>200</b> are mounted on vehicle <b>110</b>. The GPS sub-system <b>230</b> of the radar device records the radar position and the radar signals from the receiving antennas are measured. The measured radar signals from the receiving antennas and the radar positional information from the GPS <b>230</b> are used to form the SAR image <b>120</b>, which covers a wide area <b>130</b> including the sides, front and back of the radar platform. The SAR images are continuously generated as long as the vehicle is in motion. Further, it should be noted that the exact height of the radar and the width of the SAR images can be changed by adjusting the radar's &#x201c;stand-off&#x201d; distance (i.e., the distance separating the radar system from the area of interest) and range swath (i.e., width of the imaged scene in the range dimension). Although an aircraft is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>4</b> &#x26; <b>5</b>, the radar system of the present invention is not limited solely to aerial vehicles. For example, the radar and the antenna element array <b>200</b> of the present invention can also be mounted on other moving vehicles, such as ground vehicles whereby the SAR image will be generated while the vehicle moves in a forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the transmitting/receiving antenna array <b>200</b> configuration of the SAR system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, according to an embodiment herein. In particular, the transmitting/receiving antenna array <b>200</b> includes a plurality of transmitting elements <b>210</b> and a plurality of receiving elements <b>220</b> that may be positioned in a circular array such that the individual elements are equidistant. For merely purposes of explanation, four transmitting elements <b>210</b> and sixteen receiving elements <b>220</b> may be used. It is to be appreciated, however, the present invention is not limited thereto and as such, the number of transmitting and receiving elements may be chosen to satisfy the physical space constraints of the platform and/or the particular application involved. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, receiving elements <b>220</b> may be arranged in a circular pattern having an arc radius that is defined as the distance from midpoint of the array to an end point of the circular array. Preferably, both the transmitting elements <b>210</b> and the receiving elements <b>220</b> are divided into two groups or sub-systems, which will be described in further detail below, including forward or front-looking receivers and transmitters and backward or back-looking receivers and transmitters. The first group or sub-system may be separated into a first set of eight receiving elements <b>220</b> and two transmitting elements <b>210</b> and used to transmit radar pulses and receive backscatter signals in the forward direction. The second group or sub-system may be separated into a second set of eight receiving elements <b>220</b> and two transmitting elements <b>210</b> and used to transmit radar pulses and receive backscatter signals in the backward direction. It is to be noted that there are preferably at least two transmitters used in each group (forward and backward) in order to increase the cross-range resolution of the image for the pixels near the projection line of the flight path onto the image plane. However, any number of transmitters may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a block diagram of the SAR radar system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> according to an embodiment herein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">Angular resolution is determined by the size of the receiving antenna array, and the synthetic aperture generated by the motion of the vehicle. At a given range, the ability to resolve objects or targets in the cross-range direction is known as the cross-range resolution. Similarly, the ability to resolve objects or targets in the down-range direction is known as down-range resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">The down-range resolution of the SAR system according to the present invention is generally provided by the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse from transmitting elements <b>210</b>, having a wide range of frequency. The cross-range resolution is provided by both the array of receiving elements <b>220</b> and the radar generated by the moving platform. Additionally, as discussed above, the radar antenna array <b>200</b> includes two symmetrical sub-systems: a first (or forward-looking) group of antenna elements and second (or backward-looking) group of antenna elements. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each group may include two transmitting elements (e.g., a transmitter and transmitting antenna) and eight receiving elements (e.g., a receiver and receiving antenna). Each receiving antenna feeds its own receiver, and functions essentially as a digitizing system. To that end, each receiving antenna feeds an analog signal or data to each receiver which in turn converts or processes the analog data or signal in digitized form. The digitized data generated from each receiver of each receiving element <b>220</b> is combined and sent to processor <b>240</b>, which then performs data processing tasks on the digitized signal (e.g., removal of interference from the digitized backprojection signal, motion compensation, filtering, and forming SAR imagery) using known image processing techniques, as outlined in &#x201c;Signal and Image Processing Algorithms for the Army Research Lab Ultra-Wideband Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (UWB SIRE) Radar,&#x201d; Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL-TR-4784 (2009), by Lam Nguyen, which is incorporated herein by reference. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a block diagram of the overall processing steps for the SIRE radar data in the forward-looking mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> are the block diagrams of the processing of radar position data including GPS data for post GPS processing and real-time GPS processing modes, respectively. As described in further detail in ARL Technical Report ARL-TR-4784, the radar may employ two Ashtech Z-surveyor GPS units in the differential mode to track the radar location that is necessary for the image formation algorithm. The GPS measurement system consists of two subsystems: a rover station, whose antenna is located with the radar's antenna frame, and a base station at a fixed location in the field. GPS data are recorded by both the rover receiver and the base station receiver. Both units operate independently and continuously track as many as 12 channels of satellites in orbit. The ARL radar system supports the data collection in two modes: post-processing and real-time. In the post-processing mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), measurements from the rover receiver are recorded independently and the GPS data stream from each receiver is recorded in its own flash memory. To synchronize the GPS measurement with the radar operation, the SIRE data acquisition and control system sends a trigger pulse to the rover receiver at the midpoint of each data acquisition cycle. In response to the trigger signal, the rover receiver reports back to the data acquisition system with the GPS time tag via the RS232 interface. The data acquisition then embeds this GPS time tag information into the radar data stream for synchronization purpose. After the radar measurement operation is completed, data from the GPS rover and base station receivers are differentially processed using the Wavepoint's GrafNav software to generate the position data within an accuracy of a few centimeters. With the differentially processed GPS data available, the radar (x, y, z) coordinates can be computed that are synchronized with the radar data measurements by using the GPS time tags embedded in the radar data stream and performing the table lookup and interpolation of the GPS data. In real-time mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), both the rover and the base station receivers record the GPS data independently as in the post-processing mode; however, data from the base station are sent to the rover via a radio frequency (RF) link. The rover receiver then combines its measured data with the base station receiver data, and differentially processes them to generate accurate GPS position information in real time. The two data stream&#x2014;GPS time tags and the differentially processed GPS data&#x2014;are sent to the data acquisition and control system by the rover receiver via two RS-232 interfaces. As in the post-processing mode, the radar signal and image processor computes the radar (x, y, z) coordinates that are synchronized with the radar data measurements by using the GPS time tags and performing the table lookup and interpolation processes. The difference is that the table lookup and interpolation of the GPS data are performed in real time in this case. Once the radar position information is available, the coordinates of the two transmitters and the receivers must be derived as required by the imaging process. Note that the GPS coordinates that were measured and computed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref>) only represent the positions of one point on the vehicle, which is the GPS rover antenna. The rover antenna may be located at approximately the center of a radar receiver antenna array. Since the locations of the transmitter antennas and the receiver antennas have fixed offsets (in three dimensions) with respect to the rover antenna, in theory, it is possible to derive the coordinates of all transmit and receive antennas from the coordinates of the rover antenna. However, in practice, the motion of the vehicle usually does not follow a straight path. Three components of the velocity vector are required to estimate the coordinates of all individual antennas. Among these three components, the heading information from the velocity vector is most important since a small variation in the heading results in a large error. For example, a change of 5&#xb0; in the heading corresponds to a shift of 1.75 m for the imaging pixels 20 m in front of the vehicle. The phase coherency between data frames will be degraded and the quality of the resulting SAR image will suffer. However, using the radar position data, the heading information of the platform can be estimated, and then use this information to estimate the coordinates for the transmit antennas and the receive antennas. A simple smoothing filter or a more sophisticated Kalman filter can be used to filter the position data and estimate the heading information.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, examples of processor <b>240</b> may include but are not limited to a computer, central processing unit (CPU), microprocessor, multiprocessor, main frame computer, personal computer, or laptop computer. After image processing, a SAR image is generated. The GPS sub-system <b>230</b> measures the radar position at each data acquisition cycle logged by the moving platform, which is vital for the generation of the SAR imagery. Timing control circuitry <b>270</b> is responsible for coordinating the transmit and receive sequence that the radar operates. The SAR images from the forward-looking sub-system and backward-looking sub-system that are formed by processor <b>240</b> are formed on the same imaging grid, and are combined into a 2-D or 3-D SAR image via image combiner (within processor <b>240</b>) and is then sent to display <b>250</b>. The terminology &#x201c;forward looking image former,&#x201d; &#x201c;backward image former,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;image combiner&#x201d; are used in the general sense and may comprise individual components, software components or subroutines, or a single component which performs all of the functions. The &#x201c;forward looking image former,&#x201d; &#x201c;backward image former,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;image combiner&#x201d; may be performed by software on a single processor or computer or may be performed by multiple processors or computers.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the SAR system of the present invention used to survey a long strip area of interest <b>610</b> according to an embodiment herein. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an airborne or ground-based vehicle passing over target <b>1</b>, will be able to detect substantially all sections of the target utilizing both sub-systems (i.e., forward-looking and backward-looking subsystems). In particular, due to the geometry of the antenna array configuration with respect to the target orientation, the section of the target to the left of the radar will reflect energy to the forward-looking sub-system array, and the section to the right of the radar will reflect the energy to the backward-looking sub-system array after the airborne vehicle with radar platform passes over the target. Similarly for target <b>2</b>, the backscatter from the section of the target to the right of the radar may be received by the forward-looking array, and the backscatter from the section of the target to the left of the radar will be received by the backward-looking array. Reflected signals from the entire target <b>3</b> will be received by the forward-looking antenna array. Similarly, the reflected signals from the entire target <b>4</b> may be received by the backward-looking antenna array Thus, the preferred embodiment system is able, with a single pass, to receive reflected energy and backscatter signals from all the targets despite the locations or positional directions.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagrammatic illustration of the simulation geometry of the SAR system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Shown are multiple isotropic targets (marked with X symbols) as well as highly directional targets <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>. It is to be appreciated that none of the highly directional targets typically show up in the conventional SAR image. However, according to the SAR of the present invention, the radar will fly along the area of interest <b>610</b> and detect radar signals radiated from both the isotropic and directional targets.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate the SAR images generated by the forward-looking sub-system and the backward-looking sub-system, respectively. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, SAR imagery of the isotropic and directional targets shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are displayed. All of the isotropic targets are detected in the forward-looking images; yet, the forward-looking SAR sub-system does not detect the right section of target <b>1</b> nor the left sections of targets <b>2</b> and target <b>4</b>. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, all of the isotropic targets are shown in the backward-looking images, yet, the backward-looking SAR sub-system does not detect the left section of target <b>1</b>, the right section of target <b>2</b>, and target <b>3</b>. However, despite the slight limitations of the forward looking and backward looking sub-systems displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> individually, it is to be noted that, the images are complementary. As such, combining the images of the forward-looking and backward-looking sub-systems will produce a complete or total representation of the radar images of the detected targets in the area of interest <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the combined SAR images using an image combiner (from processor <b>240</b>) from the images produced by both the forward-looking and backward-looking sub-systems shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0051">As used herein, the terminology relating to the emission or transmission of signals in opposing or opposite directions or substantially opposite is to be interpreted in the general sense in that the signals need not be transmitted in the exact opposite directions or that for each and every signal there is an exact opposite, but instead is intended to mean that the general direction of one set of signals is generally opposite to the other set of signals.</p>
