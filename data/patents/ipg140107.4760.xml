<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to parking lots, and more particularly, to a parking lot information system that uses image technology to identify available parking spaces and provide information on the parking lot to local and remote customers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Parking lots (or parking garages) have been used for years at various locations, ranging from shopping malls to airports. A typical parking lot remains basically the same over the years. A customer generally receives a ticket with a timestamp at a parking lot entrance or an electronic toll tag attached to the car is read by a tag reader when the car enters the parking lot. The customer then often drive by rows of parked cars in the parking lot to find an available parking space. When the customer later returns to the parking lot to retrieve the car, the customer would need to find the original parking space where the car was parked. As the customer exits through a gate of the parking lot, the customer presents the parking ticket to a parking lot attendant to pay for the parking duration, or an automated reader reads the electronic toll tag of the car and charges the customer for the parking.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Customers often have a difficult time in finding available parking spaces in parking lots, especially if the parking lots are relatively large or almost full. In addition, a customer may not remember exactly where the car was parked and may need to pay the maximum parking fees if the customer loses the parking ticket.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates to a system, computer-implemented method, and computer program product for identifying available parking spaces in a parking lot or parking garage, tracking the status of parking spaces, and providing parking lot information to on-site and remote customers.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention relates generally to parking lots and parking garages. More particularly, the invention concerns a system, method, and computer program product for identifying and displaying available parking spaces in a parking lot, tracking of the parking spaces, and providing information on the parking spaces to on-site and remote customers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In current parking lots, a driver may experience difficulties and delays in finding an available parking space, especially if a parking lot is relatively large and is almost full. Upon returning to the parking lot to retrieve the car, the driver may not remember the space where the car was parked and would have to pay for the delay in finding the car, or pay the maximum fees if the customer loses the parking ticket. Further, a parking lot company may charge the same rate for all of the parking spaces regardless of the convenience of the individual spaces to the customers. This is because the company would not know which parking space is used and for how long.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To better track the available parking spaces, the parking lot company may have an attendant record the parking space of a parked car or install a sensor to monitor each parking space. However, these approaches may not be practical due to their costs and other overheads. Embodiments of the invention provide an efficient system and method for quickly identifying and displaying available parking spaces in a parking lot to customers at any given time, directing customers to the available parking spaces, and tracking the occupancy of parking spaces in the parking lot to provide up-to-date information to on-site customers and remote customers through a computer network such as the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a diagram of a parking lot or parking garage in which embodiments of the invention may be provided. The parking garage <b>100</b> includes individual parking spaces <b>101</b>-<b>102</b>. As an example, the parking space <b>102</b> is currently occupied by a car <b>103</b> while parking space <b>101</b> is currently vacant and available to the drivers for parking. Drivers may enter the parking lot <b>100</b> through a main lane <b>106</b> and turn onto side lanes <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> to reach available parking spaces <b>101</b>-<b>102</b>. When exiting the parking lot <b>100</b>, the drivers again may use the main lane <b>106</b> to reach a parking lot exit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, one or more camera <b>107</b> may be installed at appropriate locations in the parking lot <b>100</b> to provide a full view coverage of all the parking spaces in the parking lot <b>100</b>. For example, multiple cameras <b>107</b> may be strategically positioned between two adjacent rows of parking spaces and at the ends of the rows to provide images of all of the parking spaces in these two rows. Cameras <b>107</b> may also be installed at the corners of the parking lot <b>100</b> to provide wide angle views of the parking lot <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cameras <b>107</b> may be connected to a computer (not shown) located away from the parking spaces to minimize damages to the computer due to dust and heat in the parking lot <b>100</b>. The connection between the cameras <b>107</b> and the computer may be through a video cable or a computer network. This computer may include a computer implementation that provides aspects of the invention, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>. One or more display <b>108</b> may be strategically positioned in the parking lot <b>100</b> to provide information on the currently available parking spaces and other relevant parking information to the drivers. The display <b>108</b> may be connected to the computer that provides embodiments of the invention through a video display cable.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a camera and mirror arrangement for sending an image of the license plates of parked cars in a parking lot to a parking lot information system, according to an embodiment of the invention. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows two adjoining parking spaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. The parking space <b>201</b> is occupied by a car <b>207</b> while parking space <b>202</b> is currently unoccupied and available to customers for parking. As an example, camera <b>205</b> may be positioned above a wall that separates the adjoining parking spaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. A mirror <b>203</b> may be appropriately positioned to reflect an image of the license plate of parked car <b>207</b> to the camera <b>205</b>. Similarly, a mirror <b>204</b> may be provided to reflect an image of the license plate of another car when this car is parked in the opposite space <b>202</b>. To protect the mirrors <b>203</b>-<b>204</b> from accidental breakage, they may be installed within protecting enclosures with small openings to receive and send reflected images of the license plates of the parked cars.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the car <b>207</b> is parked in the parking space <b>201</b>, the car <b>207</b> may be on top of the parking space identifier A<b>2</b> that marks the space <b>201</b> and thus block the direct view of the space identifier A<b>2</b> from the camera <b>205</b>. The camera <b>205</b>, however, can still receive an image of a license plate <b>208</b> of car <b>207</b> from a reflected view of the license plate <b>208</b> by mirror <b>203</b>. Mirror <b>203</b> may be appropriately positioned near the parking space <b>201</b> and associated with the parking space identifier A<b>2</b> marking the parking space <b>201</b>. The camera <b>205</b> and optical character recognition system <b>206</b> thus can recognize car <b>207</b> as being parked in the parking space <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">On the other hand, the parking space <b>202</b> is currently vacant and available to customers for parking. The camera <b>205</b> has a direct view of the parking space identifier B<b>2</b> that marks the parking space <b>202</b>, as the space identifier B<b>2</b> is not blocked by a parked card, and does not need to use mirror <b>204</b> to view a car license plate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a parking lot information system <b>300</b> for identifying and displaying available parking spaces in a parking lot, and tracking parking spaces, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The parking lot information system <b>300</b> may include one or more digital camera <b>310</b> which may be connected to an optical character recognition system <b>311</b> to recognize the identifiers marking the parking spaces in the parking lot. The camera <b>310</b> may be a high definition wide-angle camera to provide a broad coverage of the parking lot and allow the camera to zoom into parts of a view of the parking lot. In one embodiment of the invention, the camera <b>310</b> is capable of creating separate video streams for portions of a view of the parking lot. The parking lot information system <b>300</b> may then relate the video streams to parts of the parking lot in processing information on the individual parking spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The optical character recognition system <b>311</b> may employ a character recognition process as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,295,694 for &#x201c;MICR-based Optical Character Recognition System And Method&#x201d; by R. Moon et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,531 for &#x201c;Verification And Correction Method And System For Optical Character Recognition&#x201d; by R. Lorie, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The optical character recognition system <b>311</b> may be connected to a computer <b>312</b> such as a server or a laptop computer. The computer <b>312</b> may display parking information to drivers and other customers on one or more displays <b>313</b>. In one embodiment, multiple displays <b>313</b> may be positioned in appropriate locations in the parking lot to provide up-to-date information on available parking spaces to on-site drivers in the parking lot.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating components of a parking lot information system, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The parking lot information system <b>420</b> may include an image processor <b>421</b> for receiving images of individual parking spaces in a parking lot, for example, from digital cameras <b>205</b> installed throughout the parking lot. The image processor <b>421</b> may enhance the quality of the received images using an image enhancement process known in the art. In addition, the image processor <b>421</b> may dissect the images and organize the images to facilitate the identification of the individual parking spaces and the space identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The parking lot processor <b>420</b> may employ an optical character recognition component <b>422</b> to better recognize characters in the parking space identifiers from the images received from the camera <b>205</b>. Optical character recognition processes are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,295,694 for &#x201c;MICR-based Optical Character Recognition System And Method&#x201d; by R. Moon et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,531 for &#x201c;Verification And Correction Method And System For Optical Character Recognition&#x201d; by R. Lorie, which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once the optical character recognition component <b>422</b> has recognized characters from the parking space markers, the parking space identifying component <b>423</b> may correlate the identified parking space markers with the parking spaces in the parking lot, including occupied spaces and available spaces. Information on the parking spaces in the parking lot may be maintained in a database that the parking lot information system <b>400</b> has access to. The information on each parking space may include its location in the parking lot and other characteristics, and its up-to-date occupancy status.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The parking lot information system <b>420</b> may include a database updating component <b>424</b> for updating the parking lot information database with the current status of each parking space in the parking lot based on information from the identifying component <b>423</b>. For example, each parking space may have the status of &#x201c;available&#x201d; (or &#x201c;unoccupied&#x201d;), &#x201c;unavailable&#x201d; (or &#x201c;occupied&#x201d;), or &#x201c;out-of-order&#x201d;. The parking lot information system <b>420</b> may transmit the updated information on the parking spaces to displays <b>108</b> and <b>313</b> located throughout the parking lot, or to remote customers via computer networks that the parking lot information system is connected to. In example scenarios, customers at remote locations may check on the availability of parking spaces or the number of available parking spaces in the parking lot <b>100</b> through computers at work, at home, or through smartphones and portable computers while on the road, before reaching the parking lot.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a process for identifying and displaying available parking spaces in a parking lot, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The process may begin at step <b>501</b> when a vehicle enters the parking lot. Through a display <b>108</b> located in the parking lot, the driver may immediately see where the currently available parking spaces in the parking lot are and their parking space identifiers (e.g., the parking space identifier B<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), at step <b>502</b>. The driver may select one of the available parking spaces from the display <b>108</b> (step <b>503</b>) and proceed to park in one of the available parking spaces shown on the display <b>108</b> (step <b>504</b>). The occupancy status of each parking space in the parking lot is available to on-site customers as well as to remote customers through networks connected to the parking lot information system. For example, remote customers may check for space availability at a parking lot through office workstations, portable computers, mobile communication devices with embedded computers and applications.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A mirror <b>203</b> at the selected parking space reflects the license plate of the parked car to a camera <b>205</b>, at step <b>505</b>. Optical character recognition system <b>206</b> may read the identifier of the occupied parking space from the image, at step <b>506</b>, and send the parking space identifier to a computer <b>312</b> for processing. The computer <b>312</b> may update a parking lot information database with the current status of the now occupied parking space associated with the received space identifier, for example, from being &#x201c;available&#x201d; to &#x201c;occupied&#x201d;, at step <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The parking lot information system then sends the updated status of the now occupied parking space to display <b>108</b> and remote customers through networks connected to the parking lot information system <b>420</b>, at step <b>508</b>. The updated status of the parking space is thus available to on-site customers as well as remote customers through office workstations, portable computers, and mobile communication devices with embedded computers and applications that can access the parking information system through computer networks. The availability of parking information to remote customers through computer networks also provides the customers the peace of mind when they leave their cars for an extended period of time, such as at an airport parking lot.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a process identifying and tracking of the parking spaces that become available in a parking lot, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The illustrated process may start at step <b>601</b> when a vehicle leaves a parking space to exit the parking lot. As the vehicle leaves the parking space, the identifier of the parking space becomes visible to a camera <b>205</b>, at step <b>602</b>. The optical character recognition component <b>206</b> of the parking lot information system may analyze an image from the camera to read the space identifier of the now vacant space and send the space identifier to computer <b>312</b>, at step <b>603</b>. The computer <b>312</b> may then update the status of this parking space from &#x201c;occupied&#x201d; to &#x201c;available&#x201d;, per step <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram of the functional components in a computer in which aspects of the invention may be implemented, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.
