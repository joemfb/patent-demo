<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the control of vehicle sub-systems, and in particular to the identification of a user who is operating such vehicle sub-systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to provide a vehicle with a user-operated control for operating one or more subsystems of the vehicle, such as for example a manually rotated knob for adjusting the output temperature of a heating and ventilating system. It is also known, for example from U.S. Pat. No. 5,923,267 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,784,036 to provide sensor arrangements which can detect when an operator's hand is approaching or touching a control and respond by providing information to the operator, for example as a head-up display on a vehicle windscreen or as an audible signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the invention, there is provided a control system for a vehicle subsystem, the control system comprising a controller arranged to control operation of the subsystem, a user input connected to the controller and arranged to be operated by a first user and a second user, and a sensor comprising a transmitter and a receiver, one of the transmitter and the receiver being associated with the user input and one of the transmitter and the receiver being adapted to be associated with the first user whereby the controller can use detection of a signal from the transmitter by the receiver to distinguish between operation of the user input by said first user and operation of the user input by the second user, characterised in that the subsystem includes a display arranged to display information to a user, and the controller is arranged to operate the display in a manner determined by which user operates the user input. For example the display may be controlled to display the information only if one of the users operates the user input. Alternatively the position in which the information is displayed may depend on which user operates the user input.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The signal is preferably varied at a frequency of from 10 to 200 kHz. These frequencies have been found to work in the type of systems described above. More preferably the frequency of variation is from 50 to 100 kHz. The voltage of the signal is preferably from 1 to 15V.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably the controller is arranged to transmit a signal via the transmitter, and to receive the signal via the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably one of the transmitter and the receiver is in a position arranged to be associated with the first user. For example said one of the transmitter and the receiver may be arranged to be mounted in a seat of the vehicle such that the first user is a person sitting on the seat. Alternatively it can be mounted elsewhere, such as in a footwell of the passenger compartment of the vehicle where it will be significantly nearer to one user than another.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The driver input may comprise a movable input member and one of the transmitter and receiver may be mounted in the input member. Alternatively one of the transmitter and receiver may be mounted adjacent to the driver input. For example where the driver input is provided in a panel, one of the transmitter and receiver may be mounted so that it extends at least partially around the panel. Alternatively, if the driver input includes a screen, one of the transmitter and receiver may comprise a conductive layer forming part of the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The controller may be arranged to control the subsystem in a manner determined by which user operates the user input. For example, the controller may be arranged to respond to inputs from one of the users but not to inputs from the other of the users.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The display may be a head-up display arranged to project a display image onto a windscreen of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably the control system further comprises an indicator and the controller may be arranged to operate the indicator to indicate which user is operating the system. The indicator may comprise an illuminator associated with the user input, and the controller be arranged to control the illuminator in a manner which is dependent on which user is operating the system. For example the intensity, pattern, colour or another property of illumination of the user input may be variable dependent upon which user is operating the system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably the transmitter and the receiver are arranged to define first and second signal paths each associated with a respective one of the users, and the controller is arranged to measure the strengths of the signals transmitted through the first and second signal paths thereby to determine which of the users operates the user input.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The transmitter may comprise first and second transmitters each associated with a respective one of the users. In this case the controller may be arranged to transmit separate signals through the two transmitters and to identify which signal is received by the receiver thereby to determine which user operates the user input. The separate signals may be transmitted at different times, or may have different formats, for example being pulsed or coded in different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The receiver may comprise first and second receivers each associated with a respective one of the users. In this case the controller is preferably arranged to measure the strength of the signals received by the two receivers thereby to determine which user operates the user input.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably at least one condition is defined which must be met for the subsystem to respond to inputs from one of the users, but which does not need to be met for the system to respond to inputs from the other of the users. For example if the driver is detected as operating the input then the system may be arranged not to respond unless the vehicle is stationary.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, a control system for a vehicle subsystem <b>10</b>, which in this particular embodiment is a heating and ventilating system, comprises a system controller <b>12</b> arranged to control operation of the subsystem <b>10</b>, and a control panel <b>14</b>, which includes a plurality of user input elements in the form of rotary controls <b>16</b> and push button controls <b>18</b>. The controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are used to control the operation of the subsystem <b>10</b>, and the system controller <b>12</b> receives input signals from the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. A number of LEDs <b>17</b> are arranged around each of the rotary controls <b>16</b>, and a further LED <b>19</b> is provided around each of the push button controls <b>18</b>. A control electrode <b>22</b> in the form of a wire is provided in a bezel <b>24</b> around the control panel <b>14</b>, and a pair of seat electrodes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> in the form of conductive foil sheets are provided, one in each of the driver's seat <b>27</b> and front passenger seat <b>29</b> of the vehicle. The electrodes <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are all connected to a main processor or CPU <b>30</b> which is arranged to transmit electrical signals through the control electrode <b>22</b> and receive them through the seat electrodes <b>26</b>, <b>26</b> as will be described in more detail below. The CPU <b>30</b> also controls operation of the LEDs <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> which illuminate the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. Touch sensors <b>32</b> are also provided in each of the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and are connected to the CPU <b>30</b> so that it can detect contact between a user's hand and any of the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The CPU <b>30</b> is also connected to a graphics controller <b>34</b> which in turn is connected to a head-up display unit <b>36</b> mounted beneath the vehicle windscreen <b>38</b> and arranged to project a display onto the windscreen so that it can be viewed by the driver <b>40</b> from the driver's seat <b>27</b>. The CPU <b>30</b> is also connected to a bus interface <b>33</b> so that it can use data available on the vehicle CAN bus.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In use, the CPU <b>30</b> applies a sinusoidal signal of frequency 75 kHz and amplitude 5VV to the control electrode <b>22</b>, and monitors the signals received from each of the seat electrodes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> at that frequency. While neither the driver <b>40</b> nor the passenger <b>42</b> are operating the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, provided no part of their body is within a predetermined region <b>44</b> close to the control panel <b>14</b>, then no signal will be detected from either of the seat electrodes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. Under these conditions the head-up display unit <b>36</b> is not operated and the controlled system <b>10</b> is not altered.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">If the driver <b>40</b> brings his hand <b>46</b> into the region <b>44</b> then the signal from the control electrode <b>22</b> will be transmitted through his body to the driver's seat electrode <b>26</b> where it will be received sufficiently strongly to be detected by the CPU <b>30</b>. This is because the body of the driver <b>40</b> has different dielectric properties from the surrounding air and is better able to transmit the signal from the control electrode to the driver's seat electrode <b>26</b>. The body of the driver <b>40</b> therefore provides a signal path through which the signal travels from the control electrode <b>22</b> to the seat electrode <b>26</b>. When the signal is received by the driver's seat electrode <b>26</b>, the CPU <b>30</b> activates the head-up display unit <b>36</b> which projects onto the windscreen a HUD image <b>37</b> representing the current positions of the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. When the driver's hand touches one of the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, for example one of the rotary controls <b>16</b>, the contact switch <b>32</b> associated with that control <b>16</b> detects this contact and the CPU modifies the image <b>37</b> to indicate to the driver <b>40</b> which of the controls <b>16</b> his hand is touching, in this case by highlighting the representation of that control. As the driver moves the rotary control <b>16</b> the head-up display unit <b>36</b> alters the HUD image <b>37</b> to indicate to the driver the changing position of the control <b>16</b> so that he can determine what inputs he is making to the system controller <b>12</b>. When the driver <b>40</b> has altered the controls to the desired setting, he withdraws his hand. When his hand leaves the region <b>44</b>, the driver's seat electrode <b>26</b> ceases to receive the signal from the control electrode <b>22</b>, and the CPU <b>30</b> detects the removal of the driver's hand. It then de-activates the head-up display unit <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the passenger <b>42</b> brings his hand into the region <b>44</b>, then the signal from the control electrode <b>22</b> is transmitted through a different signal path defined by the body of the passenger to the passenger's seat electrode <b>28</b>. This is detected by the CPU which thereby recognizes that the passenger is about to operate the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. Since the passenger does not need to watch the road as the driver does, he does not need the head-up display as he can look at the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> while he operates them. Therefore, to avoid distraction of the driver, the head-up display <b>36</b> is not activated, but instead the LEDs <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> are illuminated to aid the passenger in finding the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and the system controller <b>12</b> responds to the passenger's inputs in the normal way. The LEDs <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> are not lit up when the driver brings his hand near the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> so that they do not distract him away from the head-up display.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be appreciated that the LEDs <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>, or other illuminating means associated with the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, can be controlled in a number of other ways to distinguish between use by the driver and passenger. For example a pattern of illumination may be provided such that when a hand of one of the users enters the region near the controls, the controls become illuminated in a particular pattern, which is dependent on which user's hand is detected. This can be achieved by illuminating the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> in one sequence for the driver and another sequence for the passenger. Alternatively the LEDs <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> may flash at a first predetermined rate for the driver and at a second predetermined rate for the passenger. LEDs of different colours can also be provided so that the controls can be illuminated in different colours for the driver and the passenger.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It will be appreciated that, with the ability to distinguish between the driver and the passenger, the manner in which the head-up display and the controlled system respond to operation of the controls can be varied in a number of ways. For example the system controller <b>12</b> can be arranged so as only to respond to inputs from the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> when the CPU detects that the driver is operating them. If the passenger is operating them, then the CPU sends a signal to the system controller <b>12</b> indicating this, and the system controller <b>12</b> does not respond. This might be advantageous for safety reasons to ensure that the driver's operation of the vehicle is not interfered with. Alternatively the position or the nature of the head-up display can be made dependent on which user operates the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. For example, when the driver <b>40</b> is detected as operating the controls then the head-up display can be provided on a part of the windscreen which is within the driver's view as he looks ahead so that he can watch the road ahead and see the display at the same time. However, when the passenger <b>42</b> operates the controls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, the head-up display can be provided in a different position within the passenger's view and to the edge of, or outside, the driver's view, so as not to distract the driver. In a further alternative the way the system responds can be made dependent on who is operating the controls. For example where the vehicle can provide separate heating or ventilation to the driver and the passenger, a single set of inputs can be used by both driver and passenger, and the system respond to inputs from each of them by changing the heating and ventilation provided to the appropriate side of the vehicle. In this way, the number of switches required is reduced thus saving space on the control panel <b>14</b>. Similarly if a touch screen user input is used, the number of graphics relating to a particular control e.g. seat adjustment can be reduced to a single graphic which is able to discriminate between different users operating the system instead of having a separate graphic for each user.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will also be appreciated that displays other than head-up displays can also form part of the system and be controlled in a manner which depends on which user is operating the user input. For example in an in-car entertainment system which includes a message centre for indicating the operation of the system visually using text or images, and which includes the ability to communicate information audibly, the system can be controlled so as to provide a visual output if the passenger is identified as operating the system, but to produce an audible output if the driver is identified as using the system. This ensures that use of the system by the passenger will not distract the driver, but the driver can operate the system without needing to look at the visual display.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a second embodiment of the invention components which correspond to those in the first embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals increased by 100. The control panel <b>114</b> has three rotary controls <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b><i>c </i>and each of these has mounted in it a respective receiver electrode <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>122</b><i>c </i>each of which is connected via a receiver circuit <b>123</b><i>a</i>, <b>123</b><i>b</i>, <b>123</b><i>c </i>and an analogue to digital converter (ADC) <b>123</b><i>d </i>to the CPU <b>130</b>. The two seat electrodes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> are connected to the CPU and arranged to act as transmitters.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In use, the CPU is arranged to transmit through the seat electrodes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> a sinusoidal signal of frequency 75 kHz and peak to peak amplitude of 5V. The signal is applied alternately to the two electrodes so that it is transmitted alternately from them. The frequency of alternation between the electrodes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> is set in this case to 30 Hz. The receiver circuits are tuned to the 100 kHz frequency of the transmitted signal and each produce a DC signal which varies with the strength of the signal detected by the respective receiver electrode <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>122</b><i>c</i>. Each of these signals is converted to a digital signal by the ADC <b>123</b><i>d </i>and then input at a respective input to the CPU <b>130</b>. The CPU can therefore measure the strength of the signal received from each of the electrodes <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>122</b><i>c</i>, and by the timing of the received signals, based on the timing of the transmission via the two seat electrodes <b>126</b>, <b>126</b>, it can also determine from which seat electrodes the signal originated, and therefore whether the signal is transmitted through the driver <b>140</b> or the passenger.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each of the signals received from the ADC <b>123</b><i>d </i>is processed in software in the CPU to provide an accurate measure of the level of each signal. Each signal is input at step <b>501</b>, and an offset subtracted from it at step <b>502</b>. At step <b>503</b> a scaling factor is applied. At step <b>504</b> the signal is filtered using a variable low pass filter. In the filtering step the degree of low pass filtering is arranged to reduce as the rate of change of the signal level increases. This reduces noise in the steady state signal, but does not affect large rapid changes in signal amplitude caused, for example, by contact between the driver or passenger's hand and one of the controls <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b><i>c</i>. At step <b>505</b> the level of the signal is checked against two thresholds, one corresponding to the driver or passenger's hand coming within a region <b>144</b><i>a</i>, <b>144</b><i>b</i>, <b>144</b><i>c </i>close to the respective control <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b><i>c</i>, and another corresponding to the hand touching the control <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b><i>c</i>. As the electrodes <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>122</b><i>c</i>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> act as capacitive sensors, and the human body is significantly more effective at transmitting the signals than is air, contact between the hand and the control <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b><i>c </i>produces a rapid increase in received signal strength. This can be detected by the CPU which enables the single electrode for each control <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b><i>c </i>to act as both proximity sensor and contact sensor. At step <b>506</b> hysteresis is applied to the threshold detection so as to reduce the possibility of &#x2018;jitter&#x2019; resulting from a rapid oscillation of the signal across either threshold. Finally at step <b>507</b> the decision is made, for each of the controls <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b><i>c</i>, based on the threshold check, whether either the driver or the passenger is operating or about to operate the controls, and whether their hand is actually in contact with one of the controls or only within its associated region <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the decision has been made as to whether any of the controls <b>116</b><i>a</i>, <b>116</b><i>b</i>, <b>166</b><i>d </i>is being operated, and by which user, the system responds in a suitable manner as described above in relation to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in a third embodiment of the invention the user input takes the form of a touch sensitive screen <b>610</b>. Such screens are well known and have areas defined on them which, when touched by a user's hand <b>611</b>, determine how the controlled system is controlled. A layer of conductive material <b>612</b> is provided over the screen <b>610</b> and acts as the control electrode, being connected to the CPU <b>614</b>. The electrode <b>612</b> can be a transmitting or receiving electrode and be used in the same manner as the control electrodes of the first and second embodiments. In this embodiment the conductive layer <b>612</b> is provided specifically to act as an electrode. However in some touch sensitive screens such a conductive layer is already present for operation of the touch sensing function of the screen, and this layer can be used also as the electrode. Depending upon which user is operating the system, and on other factors such as whether the vehicle is moving or not, different user input graphics (not shown) may be provided on the screen <b>610</b>. For example the driver may be allowed to operate only a limited range of inputs when the vehicle is moving, but have access to all inputs when the vehicle is stationary. A passenger may have exclusive access to navigation destination data entry, SMS, phone book lists, internet and television when the vehicle is moving since the driver should not be allowed to access these for safety reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in a fourth embodiment of the invention CPU <b>730</b>, which is connected to two seat electrodes <b>726</b>, <b>728</b> as in the first embodiment, is also connected to control the screen <b>738</b> of a satellite navigation system. That system also comprises a control unit <b>712</b> which is also connected to the CPU and to a GPS receiver. The navigation system control system control unit <b>712</b> controls the screen <b>738</b> in a conventional manner, in response to inputs from a user made by touching areas <b>716</b> on the screen <b>738</b>. However the CPU <b>730</b> is arranged to transmit user identification signals through each of the seat electrodes <b>726</b>, <b>728</b> and receive them through a screen electrode comprising a conductive layer in the screen <b>738</b> so as to identify whether the driver or passenger is operating the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the passenger is operating the touch screen then the CPU indicates this to the navigation control system <b>712</b> which responds in a normal way to the user inputs. If the driver is operating the touch screen, then the main processor checks the speed of the vehicle using the vehicle speed signal on the CAN bus which it accesses through the bus interface <b>733</b>. The vehicle speed signal is provided, for example, by an antilock brake system of the vehicle. If the vehicle speed is zero then it is judged to be safe for the driver to operate the navigation system, which responds to the user inputs. However, if the vehicle speed is greater than zero indicating that the vehicle is moving, then the CPU sends a signal to the navigation system control unit <b>712</b> which does not respond to the user inputs. This discourages the driver from trying to operate the navigation system while he is driving the vehicle. Alternatively the CPU may respond to some of the driver operated user inputs when the vehicle is moving, but not others i.e. the CPU may not respond to user inputs which are complex to operate and require significant attention from the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If for any reason both the driver and the passenger are both detected as touching the screen, then the navigation system still does not respond. This is to ensure that the lock-out of the system cannot easily be overcome, for example by a passenger who does not know how to operate the navigation system simply touching the screen to enable the driver to operate it.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, in a fifth embodiment of the invention, the CPU <b>830</b> is connected to two seat electrodes <b>826</b>, <b>828</b> which act as the transmitting electrodes, and a pedal electrode <b>822</b> which is mounted in the foot pad <b>823</b> of a brake pedal <b>824</b>. A pedal position sensor measures the position of the brake pedal <b>824</b> and sends a signal to the control unit <b>812</b> for the vehicle brake system. The CPU <b>830</b> is arranged to detect when the driver's foot is within a predetermined distance of the pedal <b>824</b> and in response to activate the brake lights <b>811</b> of the vehicle. The brake control unit also responds to depression of the brake pedal <b>824</b> by actuating the vehicle brakes <b>810</b>. If any other object, which is either positively identified as the passenger's foot or is not recognized at all by the system is brought within the predetermined distance of the brake pedal, then the brake lights <b>811</b> are not activated as it is assumed that the brakes are not about to be actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this embodiment the actual control of the vehicle brakes is not affected by whose foot is operating the brake pedal. This is for safety reasons to ensure that the brakes are always operated. However it will be appreciated that in some circumstances it would be desirable for the vehicle to only respond to pedal inputs by the driver. For example if the pedal electrode <b>822</b> were placed in the accelerator pedal, the engine management system could be arranged to respond by increasing the output of the engine only if the foot operating the pedal were positively identified as being the driver's foot. In a similar manner an electrode can be associated with other driver inputs such as the gear shift lever or switch, or the controls for the electronic park braking, traction control, driving mode selection, vehicle starting, driving terrain selection, mirror adjustment and ride height control, and the associated functions of the vehicle only respond to the inputs if it is detected that the driver is operating them. This can provide a useful safety function, for example to ensure that children cannot interfere with the operation of the vehicle in an undesirable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While all of the embodiments described above relate to differentiating between the driver and front passenger of a vehicle, it will be understood that the system of the invention could also be used to distinguish between any passengers. For example if there is an entertainment system with separate outputs, such as headphones, for each of the rear seat passengers, a single control input can be used by both passengers with the system controlling the output associated with whichever user is identified as operating the input.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Biometric sensors, which can identify an individual user by means of biometric parameters such as fingerprint or iris pattern, may be utilised in combination with the present invention to determine not only the identity of a user operating a user input, but the seat position within the vehicle of the user.</p>
