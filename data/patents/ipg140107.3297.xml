<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wafer level chip scale package (WLCSP) includes a semiconductor device including an active surface having a contact pad, and side surfaces. A mold covers the side surfaces of the semiconductor device. A RDL structure includes a first PPI line electrically connected to the contact pad and extending on the active surface of the semiconductor device. A UBM layer is formed over and electrically connected to the first PPI line. A seal ring structure extends around the upper periphery of the semiconductor device on the mold. The seal ring structure includes a seal layer extending on the same level as at least one of the first PPI line and the UBM layer. A method of manufacturing a WLCSP includes forming a re-routing laminated structure by simultaneously forming an interconnection line and a seal layer on the molded semiconductor devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A WLCSP structure is used as one of the package structures for semiconductor components of electronic products. Increased number of input-output (I/O) electrical contacts combined with increased demands for high performance integrated circuits (ICs) has led to the development of fan-out type WLCSP structures enabling larger pitches of bumps for the I/O electrical contacts.</p>

In some embodiments, the substrate comprises a bulk silicon wafer, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, or a silicon germanium substrate. In some embodiments, the integrated circuits comprise electronic circuits such as transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, inductors, active devices, or passive devices. In one or more embodiments, the semiconductor device <b>22</b> includes multiple metallization structures overlying the integrated circuits, and inter-layer dielectric layers for insulating the electronic circuits and the multiple metallization structures. In one or more embodiments, the active surface <b>22</b>A comprises a passivation layer exposed to the outside of the semiconductor device <b>22</b>. The contact pads <b>24</b> are exposed to the outside of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> through openings formed in the passivation layer. In one or more embodiments, the contact pads <b>24</b> include at least one of Cu or Al, but are not limited by the above-mentioned materials. In some embodiments, the passivation layer is formed of undoped silicate glass (USG), silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon oxide, or combinations thereof, but is not limited by the above-mentioned materials. In some embodiments, the mold <b>26</b> is formed from at least one molding material selected from an epoxy-based resin, a silicon-based based resin, Novolac-based resin, or other suitable encapsulants.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The re-routing laminated structure <b>40</b> is formed on the molded semiconductor device <b>20</b>. The re-routing laminated structure <b>40</b> has a plurality of redistribution layer (RDL) structures. In some embodiments, the re-routing laminated structure <b>40</b> comprises at least one of re-routing laminated structures <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C, <b>40</b>D, and <b>40</b>E, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>.

In some embodiments, the solder balls <b>60</b> comprise Cu, or Cu alloys, but are not limited by the above-mentioned materials.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fan-out area <b>10</b>B of the WLCSP <b>10</b> enables larger solder ball pitches, thereby resulting in a greater flexibility in terms of the arrangement of the solder balls <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The semiconductor device <b>22</b> is obtained by a series of processes including a process of simultaneously fabricating a plurality of integrated circuits on a wafer, a process of sawing the wafer into individual chips constituting the semiconductor device <b>22</b>. The active surface <b>22</b>A of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> is protected by a passivation layer formed during the process of fabricating the plurality of integrated circuits on the wafer. However, the side surfaces <b>22</b>S of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> are not covered by the passivation layer. Therefore, the side surfaces <b>22</b>S of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> may be vulnerable to undesirable moisture and mobile ionic contaminants. For example, moisture penetrated into the interior of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> can be trapped in oxide dielectric layers, and thus increase the dielectric constant of the dielectric layers, or increase possibility of crack propagation or delamination caused by the reduction of the mechanical strength of the dielectric layers. Additionally, moisture penetrated into the interior of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> can degrade the performance of unit devices such as transistors formed within the semiconductor device <b>22</b>, or can cause corrosion or short circuit, thereby reducing reliability of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> or causing device failure. The mobile ionic contaminants within the semiconductor device <b>22</b> can cause threshold voltage instability in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, or change the surface potential of a silicon surface in the vicinity of the ionic contaminants.</p>

The seal ring structure <b>80</b> extends around the upper periphery of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> over the molded semiconductor device <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the seal ring structure <b>80</b> extends within the fan-out area <b>10</b>B over the mold <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, the seal ring structure <b>80</b> extends from the fan-out area <b>10</b>B to edge portions of the chip area <b>10</b>A within the re-routing laminated structure <b>40</b>. In one or more embodiments, the seal ring structure <b>80</b> is formed of at least one of metals or metal alloys. The seal ring structure <b>80</b> can stop undesirable moisture and mobile ionic contaminants from penetrating through the re-routing laminated structure <b>40</b> and through the side surfaces <b>22</b>S of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> into a functional circuit area of the semiconductor device <b>22</b>, and can enable structural reinforcement of the WLCSP <b>10</b>, thereby preventing operational reliability of the semiconductor device <b>22</b> from being degraded.</p>
