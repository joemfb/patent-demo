<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2007-0081937, filed on Aug. 14, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electrophoretic display device, and more particularly, to an electrophoretic display device and a method of driving the same that may maintain paper-like image quality, when power is turned off, using an inverse afterimage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The importance of display devices to display information is on the rise. Display devices include a liquid crystal display (&#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) device, an electrophoretic display (&#x201c;EPD&#x201d;) device, and a plasma display panel (&#x201c;PDP&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An EPD device may have a high reflection factor, a high contrast ratio, and a low visual angle reliance that allows viewers to feel as if they are viewing a sheet of paper. In addition, the EPD device may have a stable black or white state and may maintain images without the need for a continuous supply of voltage, thereby reducing power consumption. Further, unlike an LCD device, the EPD device may not require a polarizing plate, an alignment film, or liquid crystal and may have competitive manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The EPD device may include a microcapsule having white and black charged particles reflecting external light or a microcup in a spacer shape. The EPD device may maintain a black or white image due to the stable characteristics of the black and white charged particles when power is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, a conventional EPD device may show an undesirable grayish color after power is turned off.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides an EPD device and a method of driving the same that may maintain paper-like image quality, even when power is cut off, using an inverse afterimage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention discloses an electrophoretic display device, including an electrophoretic display panel to display images and a driving circuit to drive the electrophoretic display panel. To display an individual image in a first signal supplying period, the driving circuit supplies a first refresh signal to display a black gray scale, a second refresh signal to display a white gray scale, an inverse image data signal to display an inversed image of the individual image, an image data signal to display the individual image, and a reset signal to provide a direct current unbalance between the first and second refresh signals to the electrophoretic display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also discloses an electrophoretic display device, including an electrophoretic display panel to display images and a driving circuit to supply a first refresh signal and a second refresh signal that have opposite polarities, an inverse image data signal to display an inversed image of the individual image, and an image data signal to display the individual image to the electrophoretic display panel. A supplying time of the second refresh signal is shorter than a supplying time of the first refresh signal at a first signal supplying period, and the supplying time of the second refresh signal is identical to the supplying time of the first refresh signal in a second signal supplying period following the first signal supplying period.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also discloses a method of driving an electrophoretic display device, including supplying a first refresh signal, supplying a reset signal to provide a direct current unbalance, supplying a second refresh signal to compensate for the first refresh signal, supplying an inverse image data signal to display an inversed image of an individual image, and supplying an image data signal to display the individual image. The first refresh signal, the reset signal, the second refresh signal, the inverse image data signal, and the image data signal are supplied to the electrophoretic display panel for a signal supplying period to display the individual image on the electrophoretic display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The driving circuit <b>200</b> supplies a first refresh signal <b>310</b>, a second refresh signal <b>330</b>, an inverse image data signal <b>340</b>, an image data signal <b>350</b>, a reset signal <b>320</b>, and a reset compensation signal <b>325</b> to the EPD panel <b>100</b> for a signal supplying period to display an individual image.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first refresh signal <b>310</b> is a positive signal to display a black color on the EPD panel <b>100</b>. For example, the first refresh signal <b>310</b> causes a voltage of +15V to be supplied to the data lines D<b>1</b> to Dn to display a black gray scale on the EPD panel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second refresh signal <b>330</b> is a negative signal to display a white color on the EPD panel <b>100</b>. For example, the second refresh signal <b>330</b> causes a voltage of &#x2212;15V to be supplied to the data lines D<b>1</b> to Dn to display a white gray scale on the EPD panel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A supplying time Tb of the first refresh signal <b>310</b> is identical to a supplying time Tw of the second refresh signal <b>330</b> to maintain a direct current (&#x201c;DC&#x201d;) balance for the same signal supplying period.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The DC balance prevents a variation in the quantity of electric charges of the electrophoretic element <b>180</b> by balancing the polarities of signals supplied to the EPD panel. However, when the DC balance is not compensated for, an inverse afterimage corresponding thereto may be generated. For example, when a white gray scale signal is not compensated for in an EPD panel to which the black gray scale signal is supplied, an afterimage of the white gray scale may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first refresh signal <b>310</b> and the second refresh signal <b>330</b> are not limited to the positive signal and the negative signal, respectively but may have opposite polarities according to a driving method of the driving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The inverse image data signal <b>340</b> inversely displays white and black gray scales of an individual image to be displayed. For example, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b> causes a white gray scale and a black gray scale displayed by the image data signal <b>350</b> to change to a black gray scale and a white gray scale, respectively. As the result, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b> preliminarily compensates for a DC balance with the image data signal <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The data signal <b>350</b> includes data to display an image.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reset signal <b>320</b> provides a DC unbalance in refresh driving. The DC balance equally adjusts positive and negative voltage levels according to black and white gray scales per pixel area. After the first refresh signal <b>310</b> is generated for the first signal supplying period, the reset signal <b>320</b> is output at the start portion of the second refresh signal <b>330</b> to display a black gray scale like together with the first refresh signal <b>310</b>. The reset signal <b>320</b> generates an inverse afterimage of the electrophoretic element by providing a DC unbalance for an image data maintaining period T<b>1</b> during which a driving voltage is not supplied. For example, the reset signal <b>320</b> of the black gray scale gradually generates an inverse afterimage after a power is cut off at a white gray scale of a displayed image, thereby showing the white gray scale. As a result, the reset signal <b>320</b> may maintain the white gray scale of the image for a longer time.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b> may correspond to about 6% to about 7% of the supplying time Tb of the first refresh signal <b>310</b>. Likewise, the supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b> may correspond to about 6% to about 7% of the supplying time Tw of the second refresh signal <b>330</b>. When the supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b> is shorter than 6% of the supplying time Tb or Tw, it may be difficult to maintain a white gray scale corresponding to an inverse image. When the supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b> is more than 7% of the supplying time Tb or Tw, it may be possible to generate an inverse afterimage but the driving efficiency of the EPD device may be reduced due to an increase in the refresh driving time.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For the image data maintaining period T<b>1</b>, an image displayed by the previous image data signal <b>350</b> is continuously displayed. The image data maintaining period T<b>1</b> is generated due to physical characteristics of the electrophoretic element <b>180</b> and an image may be displayed for the image data maintaining period T<b>1</b> even after a driving voltage is cut off.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After the image data maintaining period T<b>1</b>, the first refresh signal <b>310</b>, the reset signal <b>320</b>, the reset compensation signal <b>325</b>, the second refresh signal <b>330</b>, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b>, and the image data signal <b>350</b> are sequentially output for the next signal supplying period to display the next individual image. The driving circuit <b>200</b> further outputs the reset compensation signal <b>325</b> to display a white gray scale to compensate for the DC unbalance.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The reset compensation signal <b>325</b> is output to compensate for the reset signal <b>320</b> supplied for the previous signal supplying period when two or more individual images are displayed. The reset compensation signal <b>325</b> displays the white gray scale to compensate for the black gray scale displayed by the reset signal <b>320</b>. The reset compensation signal <b>325</b> may be output immediately after the reset signal <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The reset compensation signal <b>325</b> may be output for a time corresponding to about 6% to about 7% of the supplying time Tb or Tw of the first refresh signal <b>310</b> or the second refresh signal <b>330</b>. The supplying time of the reset compensation signal <b>325</b> may be identical to the supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The reset signal <b>320</b> output for the second signal supplying period is compensated for by a reset compensation signal (not shown) output for a third signal supplying period. That is, although the reset compensation signal <b>325</b> is not output for the first signal supplying period, the reset compensation signal <b>325</b> output for the next signal supplying period compensates for the reset signal <b>320</b> output for the previous signal supplying period.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">During the last signal supplying period, the driving circuit <b>200</b> sequentially outputs signals to display a last individual image and compensates for the DC balance of the reset signal <b>320</b> of the previous signal supplying period. For example, the driving circuit <b>200</b> sequentially outputs the first refresh signal <b>310</b>, the reset compensation signal <b>325</b>, the second refresh signal <b>330</b>, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b>, and the image data signal <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing output signals of a driving circuit according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The driving circuit <b>200</b> outputs a first refresh signal <b>410</b>, a second refresh signal <b>430</b>, an inverse image data signal <b>440</b>, and an image data signal <b>450</b> for a signal supplying period to display an individual image.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first refresh signal <b>410</b> is a positive signal to display a black color on the EPD panel <b>100</b>. In comparison with the first refresh signal <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first refresh signal <b>410</b> is output for a time during which the first refresh signal <b>310</b> and the reset signal <b>320</b> are output. The first refresh signal <b>410</b> may include the first refresh signal <b>310</b> and the reset signal <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second refresh signal <b>430</b> is a negative signal to display a white color on the EPD panel <b>100</b>. During the first signal supplying period, a supplying time Tw&#x2032; of the second refresh signal <b>430</b> is shorter than a supplying time Tb of the first refresh signal <b>410</b>. For example, the supplying time Tw&#x2032; of the second refresh signal <b>430</b> may correspond to a time subtracting a supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> from the supplying time Tb of the first refresh signal <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Especially, the supplying time Tw&#x2032; of the second refresh signal <b>430</b> may be shorter than the supplying time Tb of the first refresh signal <b>410</b> by about 6% to about 7% of the supplying time Tb. Therefore, the second refresh signal <b>430</b> provides a DC unbalance. Then the driving circuit <b>200</b> leads to an inverse afterimage of the first refresh signal <b>410</b> and increases a white gray scale maintaining time, thereby shortening the driving time of the driving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the supplying time Tw&#x2032; of the second refresh signal <b>430</b> is less than 6% of the supplying time Tb of the first refresh signal <b>410</b>, it may be difficult to obtain an inverse afterimage effect. When the supplying time Tw&#x2032; is more than 7% of the supplying time Tb, it may be difficult to obtain the refresh driving effect.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the first signal supplying period, a supplying time Tw of the second refresh signal <b>430</b>&#x2032; is identical to the supplying time Tb of the first refresh signal <b>410</b> to compensate for the DC unbalance generated for the previous signal supplying period. A second refresh signal <b>430</b>&#x2032; is output for the supplying time Tw&#x2032; of the second refresh signal <b>430</b> generated for the previous signal supplying period and the supplying time of the reset compensation signal <b>325</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The second refresh signal <b>430</b>&#x2032; includes the second refresh signal <b>430</b> and the reset compensation signal <b>325</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first refresh signal <b>410</b> and the second refresh signal <b>430</b> are not limited to a positive polarity signal and a negative polarity signal, respectively and the opposite polarity signals may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The inverse data image signal <b>440</b>, the data image signal <b>450</b>, and the image data maintaining period T<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> have the same configuration as corresponding ones in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and therefore a detailed description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">During the last signal supplying period to display the last individual image, a supplying time of the first refresh signal <b>410</b> may be shorter than the supplying time of the first refresh signal <b>410</b> generated for the previous signal supplying period. For example, the driving circuit <b>200</b> sequentially outputs the first refresh signal <b>410</b>, the second refresh signal <b>430</b>&#x2032;, the inverse image data signal <b>440</b>, and the image data signal <b>450</b>. The supplying time of the first refresh signal <b>410</b> generated for the last signal supplying period may be about 6% to about 7% shorter than the supplying time of the first refresh signal <b>410</b> generated for the pervious signal supplying period. Therefore, the driving circuit <b>200</b> may display the last individual image and adjust the whole DC balance.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A method of driving an EPD device is described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">During the first signal supplying period to display an individual image, the first refresh signal <b>310</b>, the reset signal <b>320</b>, the second refresh signal <b>330</b>, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b>, and the image data signal <b>350</b> are supplied to the EPD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first refresh signal <b>310</b> has a positive voltage to display a black color on the EPD panel <b>100</b>. For example, the driving circuit <b>200</b> supplies the positive voltage to a pixel electrode of the EPD panel <b>100</b> for a period of time to display a black color. Then positive pigment particles of an EPD element move toward a common electrode and reflect external light to display the black color.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The reset signal <b>320</b> has a positive voltage to display a black color on the EPD panel <b>100</b>. A supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b> corresponds to about 6% to about 7% of a supplying time of the first refresh signal <b>310</b>. The reset signal <b>320</b> generates a DC unbalance so that an inverse afterimage that gradually shows a white gray scale may be induced. The compensation for the reset signal <b>320</b> generating the DC unbalance is implemented when the next individual image is displayed, which will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The second refresh signal <b>330</b> has a negative voltage to compensate for the DC balance caused by the first refresh signal <b>310</b> and displays a white color on the EPD panel <b>100</b>. A supplying time of the second refresh signal <b>330</b> is identical to a supplying time of the first refresh signal <b>310</b>. The inverse image data signal <b>340</b> displays an inversed image of an individual image. For example, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b> changes a white gray scale and a black gray scale of the individual image into a black gray scale and a white gray scale, respectively. The inverse image data signal <b>340</b> is supplied prior to the image data signal <b>350</b> to preliminarily compensate for the DC balance for the image data signal <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The image data signal <b>350</b> causes the EPD panel <b>100</b> to display the individual image according to a voltage and a signal supplying time.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, the individual image is displayed during the first signal supplying period by sequentially supplying the first refresh signal <b>310</b>, the reset signal <b>320</b>, the second refresh signal <b>330</b>, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b>, and the image data signal <b>350</b> to the EPD panel <b>100</b>. Thereafter, the individual image is continuously maintained until the next signal supplying period to display the next individual image is started without providing an additional driving signal. Due to characteristics of the EPD element, the EPD panel may continue to display the individual image until the next driving signal is supplied even though a driving voltage is not supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, the first refresh signal <b>310</b>, the reset signal <b>320</b>, the reset compensation signal <b>325</b>, the second refresh signal <b>330</b>, the inverse image data signal <b>340</b>, and the image data signal <b>350</b> are supplied to the EPD panel for the second signal supplying period to display the next individual image.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The refresh signal <b>310</b> displaying a black gray scale is supplied to the EPD panel <b>100</b> to remove an afterimage and an electric charge of the previous individual image. The reset signal <b>320</b> displaying a black gray scale provides a DC unbalance and induces an inverse afterimage. The reset compensation signal <b>325</b> displaying a white gray scale compensates for the DC unbalance provided by the reset signal <b>320</b> for the previous signal supplying period. A supplying time of the reset compensation signal <b>325</b> is identical to a supplying time of the reset signal <b>320</b> provided for the previous signal supplying period. That is, the DC unbalance generated at the first signal supplying period is compensated for at the second signal supplying period. Likewise, the DC unbalance generated by the reset signal <b>320</b> at the second signal supplying period is compensated for by the reset compensation signal <b>325</b> at the third signal supplying period.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The second refresh signal <b>330</b> compensates for the DC balance caused by the first refresh signal <b>310</b>. The inverse image data signal <b>340</b> displays the inversed image of the second individual image. The image data signal <b>350</b> displays the second individual image.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The EPD device according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention outputs the reset signal generating an inverse afterimage by providing a DC unbalance together with the refresh signals. Therefore, even though a driving voltage is cut off after an image is displayed, a grayish phenomenon may be prevented by an inverse afterimage, thereby obtaining paper-like picture quality.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
