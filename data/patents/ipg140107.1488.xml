<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an anti-rotation lock device for preventing relative movement of a screwed assembly. The invention also relates to a screwed assembly including such an anti-rotation lock device. The invention also relates to the use of such an assembly in aircraft manufacture. The invention thus relates to the field of mechanical components for screwed assembly, in particular in the field of aircraft manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the prior art, a known anti-rotation lock device serves to keep a screwed assembly together and to prevent it from coming unscrewed in untimely manner, e.g. under the effect of vibration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a prior art screwed assembly in the loose position, the assembly being of the kind used in the field of aircraft manufacture and comprising a prior art lock device for preventing said assembly coming unscrewed. The assembly comprises a rod big end for use in aircraft manufacture and forming an endpiece <b>110</b>, a tube-forming rod body <b>100</b>, together with a lock device <b>1</b> and a nut <b>180</b>. The endpiece <b>110</b> is provided with a threaded shank <b>111</b> that can be screwed into a corresponding thread in the tube <b>100</b> and on which the nut <b>180</b> is tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The lock device <b>1</b> comprises a first washer <b>120</b>, a second washer <b>140</b>, and a lockwire (not shown). The washers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> are engaged on the threaded shank <b>111</b> between the tube <b>100</b> and the nut <b>180</b>. The washer <b>120</b> has two catches on its face that faces towards the tube <b>100</b>, one of which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the reference <b>123</b>. The catch <b>123</b> co-operates with a notch <b>103</b> situated at the end of the tube <b>100</b>, thereby enabling the washer <b>120</b> to be prevented from turning relative to the tube <b>100</b>. The faces of the washers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> that are to come into contact after the lock device has been tightened have complementary serrations that form a corresponding number of means for mutually locking the washers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> against rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inner periphery of the second washer <b>140</b> is provided with a key <b>143</b> that penetrates into a longitudinal groove <b>113</b> formed along the threaded shank <b>111</b>. The washer <b>140</b> is thus prevented from turning relative to the threaded shank <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">After the nut <b>180</b> has been tightened onto the threaded shank <b>111</b>, the nut <b>180</b> and the washers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> are compressed against the tube <b>100</b>, and the washers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> are mutually locked against rotation by their serrations interfitting.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The outer periphery of the first washer <b>120</b> has a lug <b>125</b> pierced by a hole <b>126</b>. The nut <b>180</b> has three holes <b>181</b>, <b>182</b>, and <b>183</b> that are pierced in directions that are substantially circumferential. To lock the nut against coming unscrewed, and thus ensure that the assembly remains cohesive, an operator needs to pass a lockwire through the holes <b>126</b> and <b>181</b> to <b>183</b>, and then tension the lockwire by twisting its strands together. The lockwire thus maintains contact between the nut, the washers, and the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Nevertheless, such an assembly is relatively lengthy to achieve, in particular because the operator needs to thread the lockwire through the holes. In addition, there is a risk of error in the direction in which the lockwire is installed, since the pitch of the thread may be left-handed or right-handed. Furthermore, the quality of the locking against rotation as provided by the lockwire depends on the tension given to the lockwire by the operator; if the operator does not tighten the lockwire sufficiently, then the nut and thus the lock device can loosen to a certain extent.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, such an assembly requires a nut that is specific, given that it is pierced, thereby increasing costs. Furthermore, the twisted ends of the lockwire can injure an operator or catch on the operator's protective garments, and that is unacceptable in certain aircraft applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention seeks specifically to remedy those drawbacks, by proposing a device for locking a screwed assembly against rotation that is effective, reliable, simple and quick to mount, inexpensive, and without risk of catching operators.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To this end, the invention provides an anti-rotation lock device for preventing movement in an assembly comprising an endpiece provided with a thread screwed into a tube, said endpiece comprising at least one longitudinal groove extending along the axis of the thread of the endpiece, said tube comprising at least one anti-rotation lock element situated at its end for receiving the endpiece, the assembly further comprising a nut suitable for being screwed on the endpiece, and the device comprising:

<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The term &#x201c;endpiece&#x201d; is used in a generic sense herein. In the field of aircraft manufacture, it can be used to designate an extender or an endpiece proper provided with a fastener component. More generally, the term &#x201c;endpiece&#x201d; is used herein to designate any part that includes a threaded shank, or even such a threaded shank on its own, i.e. a simple pin provided with a thread.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">An anti-rotation lock device of the present invention thus presents increased reliability and simplicity of mounting. An assembly in accordance with the invention including such a device can be assembled more quickly, without risk of error, while presenting good accuracy in adjusting the length of the thread that is engaged. Furthermore, the lock device of the invention does not present any projecting part that might catch an operator. The assembly in accordance with the invention also has no need of a nut that its specifically drilled to receive the lockwire, and the anti-rotation lock device is compatible with presently-existing endpieces and tubes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">The assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> comprises a tube <b>200</b>, an endpiece <b>210</b>, and an anti-rotation lock device <b>2</b> or a device for locking the screwed assembly against rotation. Specifically, the tube <b>200</b> and the endpiece <b>210</b> are respectively constituted by a body and a fork clevis for a rod as used in aircraft manufacture. Those elements of the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that correspond to elements of the prior art assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are given the same references plus 100.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">The endpiece <b>210</b> is provided with a thread made on a shank <b>211</b> for screwing into a corresponding thread in the tube <b>200</b>. The threaded shank <b>211</b> has a longitudinal groove <b>213</b> similar to the groove <b>113</b> that extends along the axis Z-Z&#x2032; of the thread of the endpiece <b>210</b> and that is represented by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">The tube <b>200</b> has two notches <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> that are situated at the end of the tube <b>200</b> designed to receive the endpiece <b>210</b>. The notches <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> are made on a common diameter of the tube <b>200</b> and they constitute elements for locking the tube <b>200</b> against rotation relative to the device <b>2</b>, as explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 6</figref>, the device <b>2</b> comprises a first washer <b>220</b> and a second washer <b>240</b>. The bottom face <b>222</b> of the first washer <b>220</b> has two catches <b>223</b> and <b>224</b>. The catches <b>223</b> and <b>224</b> constitute components for locking the washer <b>220</b> against rotation relative to the tube <b>200</b>. The catches <b>223</b> and <b>224</b> are adapted to co-operate with the notches <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> respectively, by being complementary in shape thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">The inner periphery of the second washer <b>240</b>, i.e. its radial wall facing towards the axis Z-Z&#x2032;, includes a projecting key <b>243</b> that is suitable for penetrating into the longitudinal groove <b>213</b> so as to lock the second washer <b>240</b> against rotation relative to the endpiece <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">The adjectives &#x201c;inner&#x201d; and &#x201c;outer&#x201d; are used herein to qualify the orientation of the elements to which they relate relative to the axis Z-Z&#x2032; which is vertical and upwardly directed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 8</figref>. A direction is described herein as being &#x201c;radial&#x201d;, &#x201c;axial&#x201d;, or &#x201c;circumferential&#x201d; relative to the axis Z-Z&#x2032;. A surface is described herein as being &#x201c;radial&#x201d; or &#x201c;axial&#x201d; depending on the direction of a normal to said surface with reference to the axis Z-Z&#x2032;. The term &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; is used to designate a direction that extends along the length of the assembly, i.e. parallel to the axis Z-Z&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">The top face <b>221</b> of the washer <b>220</b> and the bottom face <b>242</b> of the washer <b>240</b> have means for locking them mutually against rotation, these means comprising two series of radial serrations of complementary profiles. The adjectives &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d; are used herein relative to the upward direction of the axis Z-Z&#x2032;. When the assembly is assembled, in the loose position or in the tight position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>8</b>, the top face <b>221</b> and the bottom face <b>242</b> face each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, or they come into contact, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">The serrations present a triangular teeth profile. They extend radially from the axis Z-Z&#x2032; over the major portion of the faces <b>221</b> and <b>242</b>, thus providing a multitude of adjustment positions between the washers <b>220</b> and <b>240</b>. After the serrations have been tightened against each other under drive from tightening torque, the washers <b>220</b> and <b>240</b> can no longer move relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">The outer periphery, i.e. the radially outer wall, of the first washer <b>220</b> is associated with a projecting lug <b>225</b> that contributes to locking the assembly against rotation, as explained below. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 8</figref>, the lug <b>225</b> presents a flat profile. Its thickness is of the same order as the thickness of the non serrated portion of the first washer <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">The device <b>2</b> also comprises a third washer <b>260</b> that is placed above and in contact with the top face <b>241</b> of the second washer <b>240</b>. At the outer periphery of the third washer <b>260</b> there extends a tab <b>265</b> that is adapted to co-operate with the lug <b>225</b> by being complementary in shape thereto, so as to lock the washer <b>260</b> against rotation relative to the washer <b>220</b>. For this purpose, the tab <b>265</b> has a portion bent into an L-shape that forms a free flap pierced by an oblong slot <b>266</b> and suitable for receiving the terminal portion of the lug <b>225</b>. In the co-operation position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>, the lug <b>225</b> passes through the slot <b>266</b> and prevents relative rotation between firstly the first washer <b>220</b> and secondly the third washer <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">After the device <b>2</b> has been mounted on the endpiece <b>210</b>, and the endpiece has been screwed into the tube <b>200</b>, the assembly is locked by tightening the device <b>2</b> against the end of the tube <b>200</b> by means of a nut <b>280</b>. It should be observed that the nut <b>280</b> is solid, i.e. it does not require holes drilled therethrough. The three washers <b>220</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>260</b> are designed to be superposed and in contact one another once the assembly is locked.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">In practice, the top face of the washer <b>260</b> against which the nut <b>280</b> is to bear can be coated in a dry or greasy lubricant or with a protective substance so as to reduce the risk of it being turned. This also makes it possible to achieve tightening of the nut <b>280</b> progressively, thereby imparting uniform prestress to the thread. Similarly, the first and second washers <b>220</b> and <b>240</b> can be coated in a lubricant and/or a protective substance.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">The washer <b>260</b> also has two tongues <b>268</b> and <b>269</b> that extend from its outer periphery and that are suitable for being folded towards the axis Z-Z&#x2032; against at least two of the faces of the hexagonal nut <b>280</b>. After being folded up and against the nut <b>280</b>, the tongues <b>268</b> and <b>269</b> constitute a member for locking the nut <b>280</b> against rotation relative to the washer <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">Each of the three washers <b>220</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>260</b> is generally flat in shape and in the form of a circular cylinder about the central axis Z-Z&#x2032;. The three washers <b>220</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>260</b> constituting the device <b>2</b> for locking the assembly against rotation thus occupy limited axial space. Each of the three washers <b>220</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>260</b> can be replaced by an annular element of non-circular section, at least for its outer periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">In order to withstand the mechanical stresses generated by the tightening or loosening torques, the washer <b>220</b> and the washer <b>240</b> are advantageously made of a material that is hard, such as X5CrNiCuNb 17-04 steel, or the equivalent. When the member for locking the nut <b>280</b> against rotation is constituted by the two tongues <b>268</b> and <b>269</b> suitable for folding against the nut, as shown in the figures, the washer <b>260</b> is made of a ductile material such as X2CrNi 18-9 steel, or the equivalent.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">During assembly, the second washer <b>240</b> is free to rotate relative to the washers <b>220</b> and <b>260</b>. This freedom to rotate and the presence of the serrations on the faces <b>221</b> and <b>242</b> enable adjustments to be performed step by step, in particular with steps of micrometer size, depending on the dimensions of the thread and of each serrations, so as to position the endpiece <b>210</b> longitudinally relative to the tube <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">This enables the distance between the ends of a rod to be adjusted accurately. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, this adjustment can be performed when the serrations of the washers <b>220</b> and <b>240</b> are not yet mutually interfitted. In contrast, after the serrations have been mutually interfitted, they act mechanically to prevent rotation of the washers <b>220</b> and <b>240</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a lock device <b>3</b> constituting a second embodiment of the invention. The description of the device <b>2</b> as given above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 8</figref> can be transposed to the device <b>3</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, elements of the device <b>3</b> that are identical or that correspond to elements of the device <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 8</figref> have the same references plus 100.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">The device <b>3</b> differs from the device <b>2</b> in that the lug <b>325</b> of the first washer <b>320</b> presents a Z-shaped profile instead of a flat profile, including an angled flap <b>327</b> that extends towards the third washer <b>360</b>. The term &#x201c;profile&#x201d; is used herein to mean the section of an element on a plane containing the axis Z-Z&#x2032;. As for the device <b>2</b>, the terminal portion of the lug <b>325</b> is received in a rectangular slot <b>366</b> formed through the free flap of the angled tab <b>365</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">This shape serves to reduce the axial length of the tab <b>365</b> of the washer <b>360</b> compared with the tab <b>265</b>, thereby making it easier to pass a wrench to engage the flats <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) so as to hold the tube <b>200</b> while the nut is being tightened on the assembly. In addition, the lug <b>325</b> can thus withstand greater tightening or loosening torques.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref> show a device <b>4</b> constituting a third embodiment of the invention. The description of the device <b>2</b> given above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 8</figref> can be transposed to the device <b>4</b>. Elements of the device <b>4</b> that are identical to or that correspond to elements of the device <b>2</b> are given the same references plus 200.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">The device <b>4</b> differs from the device <b>2</b> in that the lug <b>425</b> and the tab <b>465</b> both present Z-shaped profiles that converge towards each other. In addition, the first washer <b>420</b> is locked relative to the third washer <b>460</b> in this embodiment by passing the tab <b>465</b> through a rectangular slot <b>426</b> made in the lug <b>425</b>, i.e. the opposite configuration to the device <b>2</b>. The slot <b>426</b> lies in a plane that is transverse relative to the axis Z-Z&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067">This shape further reduces the axial size occupied by the tab <b>465</b> and the lug <b>425</b> in the tight position, compared with the device <b>2</b> or the device <b>3</b>. In addition, with this shape, the tab <b>465</b> and the lug <b>425</b> are more robust thus enabling them to withstand higher levels of tightening and loosening torque. Furthermore, like the device <b>3</b>, the device <b>4</b> makes it easier to pass a wrench for holding the tube <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">In addition, since the slot <b>426</b> is made in the lug <b>425</b> instead of in the tab <b>465</b>, it is possible to use the first washer <b>420</b> as an anchor point for a lockwire, such that the device <b>4</b> can also be used as a prior art lockwire locking device, like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Under such circumstances, the assembly may omit the third washer <b>460</b>, providing the nut used is pierced with holes like the nut <b>180</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In contrast, the width of the slot <b>426</b> is sufficient to pass two strands of a single lockwire. This enables the lockwire to be fitted in symmetrical manner, i.e. in a manner that does not distinguish between a left-handed pitch or a right-handed pitch for the thread, thereby avoiding any risk of error during assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">Like the devices <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, the construction of the device <b>4</b> also serves to prevent the third washer <b>460</b> from rotating during micrometric adjustment between the washers <b>420</b> and <b>440</b>. When the threaded shank <b>211</b> is inserted into the washers of the device <b>4</b>, the washer <b>460</b> can no longer be separated from the washer <b>420</b> during micrometric adjustment. The washer <b>420</b> is prevented from turning relative to the tube <b>200</b> by means of its catches <b>423</b> and <b>424</b>. The washer <b>460</b> is prevented from turning relative to the washer <b>420</b> by means of its lug <b>465</b> held in the slot <b>426</b>. The washer <b>440</b> is driven in rotation by means of its key <b>443</b> that is held in the groove <b>213</b> of the threaded shank <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show a device <b>5</b> constituting a fourth embodiment of the invention. The description of the device <b>2</b> given above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref> can be transposed to the device <b>5</b>. Elements of the device <b>5</b> that are identical to or that correspond to elements of the device <b>2</b> are given the same references plus 300.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">In the device <b>5</b>, the lug <b>545</b> is associated with the outer periphery of the second washer <b>540</b> instead of with the outer periphery of the first washer <b>520</b>. This makes it easier to make the anti-rotation lock device <b>5</b>. Nevertheless, it can be desirable to lock the nut as directly as possible relative to the tube, and therefore to associate the lug with the first washer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072">In a variant that is not shown, in order to lock the tube against rotation relative to the first washer, it is possible to provide a single catch-and-notch pair, or conversely to provide more than two catch-and-notch pairs, depending on the tightening or loosening torque that needs to be withstood. The number and the dimensions of the catch(es) and notch(es) are determined on the basis of the mechanical stresses to which they are to be subjected.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">In another variant that is not shown, provision can be made to make one or more notches in the first washer and one or more catches on the tube. Such a shape is the inverse of the shape of the structures shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074">In another variant that is not shown, the slot in the lug may present a profile that is open.</p>
