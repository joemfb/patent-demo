<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-223134, filed Aug. 29, 2007, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an in-vivo image acquiring apparatus which is introduced inside a subject to acquire image information of an inside of the subject, and an in-vivo image acquiring system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, a swallowable capsule endoscope has been proposed in a field of endoscope. The capsule endoscope contains an imaging unit which acquires image information of an inside of a subject, an illumination unit which illuminates a portion captured by the imaging unit, a transmission unit which wirelessly transmits the image information captured by the imaging unit, and the like inside a capsule-shaped casing. The capsule endoscope is swallowed from a mouth of the subject, i.e., a patient, and introduced inside the subject. The capsule endoscope sequentially captures images inside a body cavity moving inside the body cavity with peristalsis, and wirelessly transmits the acquired image information to an outside of the body until naturally excreted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sometimes, an operation mode of the capsule endoscope which is introduced inside the subject needs to be changed. For example, a frame rate of the imaging may need to be changed, or a compression rate in transmission may need to be changed, depending on the imaged portion. As a technology developed to solve such problems, there is a known technology with which a position of the capsule endoscope is detected so as to change the frame rate when the capsule endoscope is at a portion such as an esophagus where the capsule endoscope passes in a short time, or when the capsule endoscope moves close around a legion or the like (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-70728). Further, in another known technology, an in-vivo state is detected by a state detector which detects an in-vivo state to change the mode (see Japanese translation of PCT international application No. 2006-509574). Further, in still another known technology, an operation-mode-change request switch is arranged, and the mode is changed by switching the switch to thereby change the frame rate and the like (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-21039). In still another known technology, a receiving device which receives an operation-command signal from an outside is attached to the capsule endoscope, and a measuring operation is performed according to the operation command signal received by the receiving device (see Japanese Patent No. 2933164).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An in-vivo image acquiring apparatus according to an aspect of the present invention is introduced inside a subject, captures an inside of the subject, and outputs acquired image information to an outside.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the in-vivo image acquiring system includes a capsule endoscope <b>10</b>, a receiving device <b>30</b>, and a display device <b>70</b>. The capsule endoscope <b>10</b>, i.e., an in-vivo image acquiring apparatus acquires image information inside a subject <b>1</b>. The receiving device <b>30</b> receives image information wirelessly transmitted from the capsule endoscope <b>10</b>. The display device <b>70</b> displays the image information acquired by the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> based on the image information received by the receiving device <b>30</b>. For example, a portable-type storage medium (portable storage medium) <b>50</b> is used for the transmission of the image information between the receiving device <b>30</b> and the display device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The capsule endoscope <b>10</b> has an imaging function and a wireless-transmission function. The capsule endoscope <b>10</b> is swallowed from a mouth of the subject <b>1</b> and introduced inside the subject <b>1</b>, and successively acquires image information of a body cavity moving through the body cavity. Then, the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> wirelessly transmits the acquired image information to an outside of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The receiving device <b>30</b> includes plural receiving antennas A<b>1</b> to An, and receives the image information wirelessly transmitted from the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> via each of the receiving antennas A<b>1</b> to An. The portable storage medium <b>50</b>, which is a storage medium such as a CompactFlash&#xae;, is detachably attached to the receiving device <b>30</b>, and the received image information is successively stored in the portable storage medium <b>50</b>. Thus, the receiving device <b>30</b> stores the image information of the inside of the subject <b>1</b> acquired by the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> in the portable storage medium <b>50</b> in order of time.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the receiving antennas A<b>1</b> to An is formed, for example, as a loop antenna, and dispersed at a predetermined position on a body surface of the subject <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, the receiving antennas A<b>1</b> to An are dispersed, for example, at positions corresponding to the pathway of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> inside the subject <b>1</b>. Alternatively, the receiving antennas A<b>1</b> to An are dispersed at positions on a jacket to be worn by the subject <b>1</b>. In this case, as the subject <b>1</b> wears the jacket, the receiving antennas A<b>1</b> to An are arranged at the predetermined positions on the body surface of the subject <b>1</b> corresponding to the pathway of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> inside the subject <b>1</b>. Further, the number of the receiving antennas is not limited as long as one or more receiving antennas are arranged on the subject <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The display device <b>70</b> is realized by a general-purpose computer such as a workstation and a personal computer, and the portable storage medium <b>50</b> is detachably attached to the display device <b>70</b>. The display device <b>70</b> reads image information stored in the portable storage medium <b>50</b>, and displays images of the read image information on a display such as an LCD and an ELD. Further, the display device <b>70</b> writes information of the subject <b>1</b> into the portable storage medium <b>50</b> as needed. Further, the display device may output images onto other mediums via a printer or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The configuration of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of a configuration of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a functional configuration of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> includes an imaging unit <b>110</b>, an illuminating unit <b>120</b>, a transmission processing unit <b>130</b>, a power unit <b>150</b>, a power switch <b>160</b>, a power control unit <b>170</b>, a ROM <b>180</b>, a control unit <b>190</b> and the like. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of the units are contained inside a capsule-shaped casing <b>11</b>. The imaging unit <b>110</b> acquires image information by capturing intracelomic images. The illuminating unit <b>120</b> emits illuminating light to the inside of the body cavity. The transmission processing unit <b>130</b> wirelessly transmits the image information acquired by the imaging unit <b>110</b> via a transmitting antenna <b>140</b>. The power unit <b>150</b> supplies driving power for each unit forming the capsule endoscope <b>10</b>. The power switch <b>160</b> switches supply/block of the driving power supplied by the power unit <b>150</b>. The power control unit <b>170</b> controls the supply state of the driving power supplied by the power unit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A casing <b>11</b> has a size which can be swallowed by a human. The casing <b>11</b> is formed with a hemispherical-shaped head cover <b>12</b> and a body cover <b>13</b> connected together. The head cover <b>12</b> is made of a transparent material, and works as an optical window. Specifically, in the casing <b>11</b>, the imaging unit <b>110</b> and the illuminating unit <b>120</b> are arranged at opposing positions to the head cover <b>12</b>. The illuminating light from the illuminating unit <b>120</b> transmits through the head cover <b>12</b> to an outside of the casing <b>11</b>, and reflected light is introduced into the inside of the casing <b>11</b> through the head cover <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The imaging unit <b>110</b> is formed by an imaging device including image sensors such as a CCD and a CMOS, an imaging lens which forms incident light on the imaging device, and the like. The imaging unit <b>110</b> performs an imaging operation to capture images inside the subject <b>1</b> by outputting an analog signal corresponding to intensity of the incident light. Specifically, the imaging unit <b>110</b> performs the imaging operation at a supply timing of an imaging-unit-driving pulse from a timing generator <b>191</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The illuminating unit <b>120</b> is formed, for example, by a light-emitting device such as an LED, a driving circuit for the light-emitting device, and the like. The illuminating unit <b>120</b> performs an illuminating operation to illuminate a portion captured by the imaging unit <b>110</b> by emitting illuminating light. Specifically, the illuminating unit <b>120</b> starts the illuminating operation at a supply timing of an illuminating-unit-driving pulse from the timing generator <b>191</b>. The illuminating unit <b>120</b> emits illuminating light for light-emitting time corresponding to a pulse width of the supplied illuminating-unit-driving pulse to thereby emit the illuminating light by a light-emitting amount controlled by a light controller <b>194</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The transmission processing unit <b>130</b> is formed by a transmission circuit which generates a wireless-transmission signal by performing a modulating process or the like on a transmission signal that is input from a signal processor <b>193</b> as needed, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The power switch <b>160</b> is a main switch of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b>, and switches ON/OFF states by detecting an external input. The power switch <b>160</b> is formed, for example, by a reed switch, which switches ON/OFF states according to an external magnetic field. The power switch detects whether the magnet is close to or away from the reed switch as the external input, and outputs an ON signal or an OFF signal to the power control unit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The power control unit <b>170</b> switches the supply/block states of the driving power supplied from the power unit <b>150</b> based on ON/OFF signals transmitted from the power unit <b>150</b>. The power control unit <b>170</b> distributes the driving power supplied from the power unit <b>150</b> among the imaging unit <b>110</b>, the illuminating unit <b>120</b>, the transmission processing unit <b>130</b>, the control unit <b>190</b>, and the like. Specifically, each unit of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> is connected with the power unit <b>150</b> via the power control unit <b>170</b> in such a manner that the supply state or the block state of electricity can be switched, so that the power unit <b>150</b> supplies the driving power for each unit under a control by the power control unit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, the power control unit <b>170</b> controls a toggle of the power switch <b>160</b> according to the external input that is input to the power switch <b>160</b> so as to start the supply of driving power for each unit of the apparatus from the power unit <b>150</b> or block the supply. When a magnet is moved toward the power switch <b>160</b> and moved away from the power switch <b>160</b> as the external input, the state of the driving power from the power unit <b>150</b> is switched from the supply state to the block state or vice versa. The current state, the supply state or the block state, is maintained without the external input.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The power control unit <b>170</b> includes a mode-control counter <b>171</b>. The mode-control counter <b>171</b> counts a number of times of switching the block state to the supply state of the driving power from the power unit <b>150</b> based on the ON/OFF signals from the power switch <b>160</b>. For example, the mode-control counter <b>171</b> sets an initial value at &#x201c;0&#x201d;, and increments the counted number every time the block state is switched to the supply state. The mode-control counter <b>171</b> outputs the updated counted number to the identification unit <b>195</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ROM <b>180</b> stores therein various data required for operations of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b>. The ROM <b>180</b> stores therein mode information <b>181</b>, whereby the control content of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> for each operation mode is set.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing an example of an operation mode of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> stored in the ROM <b>180</b> as the mode information <b>181</b> and a control content of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> operating on the operation mode. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, four types of operation modes identified as mode numbers &#x201c;1&#x201d; to &#x201c;4&#x201d; are set as the operation mode, and the control content is set for each of the operation modes. For example, the control content according to the operation mode which is identified as the mode number &#x201c;1&#x201d; is stored in a storage area whose initial address is an address &#x201c;00&#x201d; in the ROM <b>180</b> (record R<b>1</b>). Each operation mode has the control content, for example, corresponding to the portion where the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> passes inside the subject <b>1</b>, in order of portions of passage. Specifically, the operation mode of the mode number &#x201c;1&#x201d; is an operation mode assuming a case where the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> passes through an esophagus. Since the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> moves through the esophagus at high speed, a high frame rate of 30 fps and compression of the acquired image information are assigned to the mode number &#x201c;1&#x201d;. The operation mode of the mode number &#x201c;12&#x201d; is an operation mode assuming a case where the capsule endoscope passes through a stomach. In the stomach, since the capsule endoscope moves inside a large space, a relatively lower frame rate of 4 fps and non-compression of the acquired image information are assigned to the mode number &#x201c;2&#x201d;. The operation mode of the mode number &#x201c;3&#x201d; is an operation mode assuming a case where the capsule endoscope passes through a small intestine. Since the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> moves through the small intestine at low speed, a low frame rate of 2 fps and non-compression of the acquired image information are assigned to the mode number &#x201c;3&#x201d;. The operation mode of the mode number <b>411</b> is an operation mode assuming a case where the capsule endoscope passes through a large intestine. Since the capsule endoscope moves through the large intestine at even lower speed, an even lower frame rate of 2 fps and non-compression of the acquired image information are assigned to the mode number &#x201c;4&#x201d;. Further, the control content may be set, for example, as a value of frame rate, a variable of flag information for compression/non-compression, or the like, or may be set as a control program which realizes the control content. Further, the operation mode may be the operation mode which specifies the frame rate, or one which specifies the compression/non-compression of the image information. Further, the operation mode may be the operation mode which specified a compression rate, one which specifies a light-control area described later, one which specifies a baseline luminance value, one which specifies a gain control value, or the like as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The control unit <b>190</b> controls each unit of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> to control the entire operation of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b>. The control unit <b>190</b> includes a timing generator <b>191</b>, a signal processor <b>193</b>, a light controller <b>194</b>, an identification unit <b>195</b>, and a process determining unit <b>197</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The timing generator <b>191</b> generates driving timings for the imaging unit <b>110</b> and the illuminating unit <b>120</b> to control the imaging operation of the imaging unit <b>110</b>, and the illuminating operation of the illuminating unit <b>120</b>. For example, the timing generator <b>191</b> supplies an imaging-unit-driving pulse for the imaging unit <b>110</b> at predetermined intervals to control the imaging operation of the imaging unit <b>110</b>, and supplies, right before the supply of the pulse to start the imaging operation, an illuminating-unit-driving pulse for the illuminating unit <b>120</b> to control the illuminating operation of the illuminating unit <b>120</b>. Further, the timing generator <b>191</b> fluctuates a pulse width of the illuminating-unit-driving pulse according to light-emitting time input from the light controller <b>194</b> described later where a timing to start the operation is defined by a leading edge of the pulse and a timing to finish the operation is defined by a trailing edge of the pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The signal processor <b>193</b> generates a transmission signal by performing processes needed for the image information acquired by the imaging unit <b>110</b>. Specifically, the signal processor <b>193</b> performs an analog-signal processing such as a color balance adjustment and a gamma correction on an analog signal input from the imaging unit <b>110</b> to thereby convert the analog signal into a digital signal. Further, according to the acquired digital signal, the signal processor <b>193</b> generates the transmission signal to wirelessly transmit the acquired image information to an outside of the body. For example, when there is a signal frame having image information of a single image, the signal processor <b>193</b> attaches a vertical synchronizing signal to a head of the frame, and attaches a horizontal synchronizing signal to a head of constituent data of each line to thereby generate the transmission signal, and outputs the transmission signal to the transmission processing unit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing an example of the transmission signal generated by the signal processor <b>193</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the transmission signal is formed with fields of the vertical synchronizing signal, mode-number information, and appended information, and with image signals having the horizontal synchronizing signal and corresponding to constituent data of each scan-line. The mode-number information is information input from the identification unit <b>195</b> described later, from which the operation mode can be identified. The appended information includes, for example, information such as a serial number of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> and a white balance coefficient as needed. The transmission signal is input to the transmission processing unit <b>130</b> to be transmitted to the receiving device <b>30</b> arranged outside the body. The receiving device <b>30</b> receives the transmission signal, and then detects the head of the image based on the vertical synchronizing signal, and detects the head of the image signal of each line based on the horizontal synchronizing signal. The receiving device <b>30</b> processes each image signal, and acquires image information.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, the signal processor <b>193</b> calculates an average value of pixel values included in the predetermined light-control area of the acquired image information and outputs the average value to the light controller <b>194</b>. For example, the signal processor <b>193</b> calculates the weighted average value of RGB values of each pixel forming the light-control area to obtain an average luminance value in the light-control area.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The light controller <b>194</b> performs a light control to control light-emitting amount of the illuminating light emitted from the illuminating unit <b>120</b>. Specifically, the light controller <b>194</b> compares the average value input from the signal processor <b>193</b> to the baseline luminance value previously set as a threshold value, to determine the luminance of the light-control area in the acquired image information. As the baseline luminance value, a value with which an user can easily view a content of the image may be set. The light controller <b>194</b> calculates the light-emitting time of the illuminating unit <b>120</b> based on the result of comparison, and outputs the calculated light-emitting time to the timing generator <b>191</b>. Thus, the light-emitting amount of the illuminating light on a following imaging operation is controlled based on the luminance in the light-control area of the acquired image information, whereby image quality of the captured image can be stably maintained. For example, when the luminance is high, the following light-emitting time of the illuminating unit <b>120</b> is set short whereas when the luminance is low, the following light-emitting time of the illuminating unit <b>120</b> is set long. Further, the control method of the light-emitting amount is not limited to the control of the light-emitting time. For example, the light-emitting amount may be controlled by adjusting a current value supplied for the light-emitting device forming the illuminating unit <b>120</b>, or by changing the light-emitting luminance of the light-emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The identification unit <b>195</b> identifies the mode number based on the counter value that is counted by the mode-control counter <b>171</b>, and outputs the mode number to the process determining unit <b>197</b>. Further, the identification unit <b>195</b> outputs the identified mode number to the signal processor <b>193</b> as the mode-number information. Accordingly, the information of the operation mode on which the image information is captured is added to the transmission signal generated by the signal processor <b>193</b>. Further, the identification unit <b>195</b> performs a control to initialize the counter value of the mode-control counter <b>171</b> at an initial value &#x201c;0&#x201d; as default, and a control to initialize the counter value to the initial value &#x201c;0&#x201d; when the counter value of the mode-control counter <b>171</b> is the maximum of the mode numbers (i.e., &#x201c;4&#x201d; in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The process determining unit <b>197</b> accesses, based on the mode number identified by the identification unit <b>195</b>, storage area in the ROM <b>180</b> where the control content according to the operation mode of the mode number is stored. For example, when the mode number identified by the identification unit <b>195</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d; shown in the record R<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the process determining unit <b>197</b> accesses the storage area whose head address is &#x201c;00&#x201d; to read out the control content. Further, the process determining unit <b>197</b> outputs a specified frame rate of 30 fps to the timing generator <b>191</b>, whereby the process of the timing generator <b>191</b> is determined. Accordingly, the timing generator <b>191</b> supplied the imaging-unit-driving pulse for the imaging unit <b>110</b> at intervals of 1/30 seconds, and supplies, right before the supply of the imaging-unit-driving pulse, the illuminating-unit-driving pulse for the illuminating unit <b>120</b>. Further, the timing generator <b>191</b> outputs a compression signal to the signal processor <b>193</b>, whereby the process of the signal processor <b>193</b> is determined. Accordingly, the signal processor <b>193</b> performs a compression process on the image information acquired by the imaging unit <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a timing chart explaining the processes of the identification unit <b>195</b> and the process determining unit <b>197</b> according to the setting of the operation mode according to the first embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the power switch <b>160</b> first detects the external input and outputs the ON/OFF signals, and the power control unit <b>170</b> switches the supply/block states of the driving power from the power unit <b>150</b> according to the ON/OFF signals. The power control unit <b>170</b> maintains the supply state or the block state until the power switch <b>160</b> detects the external input.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the driving power from the power unit <b>150</b> is switched from the block state to the supply state by the power control unit <b>170</b> according to the ON/OFF signals from the power switch <b>160</b>, the mode-control counter <b>171</b> increments and updates the counter value. The mode-control counter outputs the counter value as a mode-control signal. For example, when the state is switched to the supply state for the first time, the initial value &#x201c;0&#x201d; is incremented, and &#x201c;1&#x201d; is output as the mode-control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The identification unit <b>195</b> identifies the mode number of the operation mode to be set according to the mode-control signal, and outputs the mode number. For example, when the mode-control signal is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the identification unit <b>195</b> identifies the mode number as &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and outputs &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The process determining unit <b>197</b> reads out the control content according to the operation mode of the mode number from the ROM <b>180</b> according to the mode number identified by the identification unit <b>195</b>. For example, when the mode number identified by the identification unit <b>195</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, read addresses starts from &#x201c;00&#x201d; and &#x201c;01&#x201d; to &#x201c;2F&#x201d; successively, and the process determining unit <b>197</b> reads out the control content according to the corresponding operation mode from the mode information stored in the ROM <b>180</b>. The process determining unit <b>197</b> determines the process according to the read control content. Thus, every time the driving power from the power unit <b>150</b> is switched from the block state to the supply state according to the detection of the external input, the operation mode is sequentially set and changed starting from the mode number &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A procedure of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an operation flowchart of the capsule endoscope <b>10</b> according to the setting of the operation mode. In the processes, the identification unit <b>195</b> performs a control to initialize the counter value of the mode-control counter <b>171</b> at the initial value &#x201c;0&#x201d; (Step S<b>101</b>). When the power switch <b>160</b> detects the external input (Step S<b>105</b>), the power control unit <b>170</b> switches the supply/block states of the driving power from the power unit <b>150</b>. When the driving power is switched from the supply state to the block state so that the supply of the driving power is blocked (Step S<b>107</b>: No), the power is turned off as a reset procedure or the like of internal circuits is executed. On the other hand, when the driving power is switched from the block state to the supply state so that the supply of the driving power is started (Step S<b>107</b>: Yes), the mode-control counter <b>171</b> increments and updates the counter value, and outputs the counter value to the identification unit <b>195</b> as the mode-control signal (Step S<b>109</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The identification unit <b>195</b> identifies the operation mode to be set based on the mode-control signal input from the mode-control counter <b>171</b> (Step S<b>111</b>). The process determining unit <b>197</b> reads out the control content of the corresponding operation mode according to the identified mode number from the ROM <b>180</b>, and determines the process according to the read control content (Step S<b>113</b>). The control unit <b>190</b>, which includes timing generator <b>191</b> and the signal processor <b>193</b>, performs the process determined by the process determining unit <b>197</b>, and starts controlling the operation of each unit of the apparatus (Step S<b>115</b>). Further, the identification unit <b>195</b> identifies the mode number, which is identified at Step S<b>111</b>. When the mode number identified at Step S<b>111</b> is the maximum of the mode numbers (Step S<b>117</b>: Yes), the control unit <b>190</b> returns to Step S<b>101</b> and performs a control to initialize the counter value of the mode-control counter <b>171</b> at the initial value &#x201c;0&#x201d;. When the mode number identified at Step S<b>111</b> is not the maximum of the mode numbers (Step S<b>117</b>: No), the control unit <b>190</b> returns to Step S<b>105</b> and repeats the operations above.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the receiving device <b>30</b> includes antennas A<b>1</b> to An, an antenna switching unit <b>310</b>, an intensity detector <b>320</b>, an A/D converter <b>330</b>, a demodulator <b>340</b>, an image processor <b>350</b>, a read/write unit <b>360</b>, a display unit <b>370</b>, a storage unit <b>380</b>, and a control unit <b>390</b>.</p>
