<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In 1998, Glinka A. et. al. published a research article in Nature (Nature, 1998; 391(6665):357-362), which claims that they have found a new secretory protein in the research work of the embryo development of <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, which is called dickkopf-1 (dkk-1). Their research confirms that dkk-1 is the inhibitory factor of Wnt signaling pathway and is &#x201c;inducer&#x201d; formed in the &#x201c;head induction&#x201d; during the embryonic development of <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Later, in 1999, Fedi P., et. al. (J Biol Chem, 1999; 274(27):19465-72) isolated human homologous gene of dkk-1 from human leiomyosarcoma cell SK-LMS-1 and the corresponding cDNA library by conditioned chromatogram and PCR. The mRNA transcript is about 2 kb, encoding 266 amino acids. Since then, the scientists for the first time reveal the molecular mechanism of DKK-1 as Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor through near 5 years of research work.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the research work of the function and action mechanism of DKK-1, the scientists also notice that DKK-1 is relevant to certain human diseases, such as osteoporosis (Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2004; 318(1):259-264. N Engl J Med, 2002; 346(20):1513-1521), bone damage caused by multiple myeloma (N Engl J Med, 2003; 349(26):2483-2494) and other human malignancy. For example, Mikheev A M et. al. (Carcinogenesis, 2004; 25(1):47-59) established 2 non-tumorigenic revertant cell lines with human cervical cancer Hela cell line, and found by cDNA chip that DKK-1 is highly expressed in the above 2 non-tumorigenic revertant cell lines and that lack of DKK-1 expression is necessary for Hela tumogenicity. Therefore, DKK-1 is deemed as a candidate cancer inhibitory gene. Furthermore, Wirths O et. al. (Lab Invest, 2003; 83(3):429-434) use &#x201c;suppression subtractive hybridization approach&#x201d; to find that DKK-1 is highly expressed in children hepatoblastoma and Wilms' tumor. The result shows that 26 out of 32 children hepatoblastomas highly express DKK-1 (26/32, 81%), 5 out of 6 Wilms' tumors highly express DKK-1 (5/6, 83%). However, only 2 out of 20 liver cancer patients highly express DKK-1 (2/20, 10%), and 1 out of 5 medulloblastoma cell lines highly express DKK-1 (1/5, 20%). There is no DKK-1 expression in malignant gliomas and breast cancers.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inventors compare difference of the gene expression profile of the liver cancer and the corresponding liver tissue adjacent to the cancer by genechip technology, and discover that it is contrary to the result of Wirths O et. al. (Lab Invest, 2003; 83(3):429-434) that DKK-1 only expresses in a few liver cancer patients (2/20, 10%). In the liver cancer patients analyzed and confirmed by the inventors, 7 out of 12 have DKK-1 high expression in the liver cancer tissue (7/12, 58%), obviously higher than the result reported by Wirths O for the liver cancer. Therefore, using ELISA, it is for the first time that the DKK-1 amount in the serum of liver cancer patients is tested, which indicates that it highly expresses and secretes DKK-1. Based on this, it can be used in clinic diagnosis and therapy of liver cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;DKK-1&#x201d; is a new secretory protein found in the research of <i>Xenopus laevis </i>embryo development, which is named dickkopf-1 (dkk-1). The sequence of the protein can be found by NCBI accession number NP 571078. The DKK-1 protein herein comprises the complete amino acid sequence, the secretory protein, the mutant, and the functional active fragments. It should be understood that when encoding the same amino acid, the nucleotide replacement in the codon is acceptable. Further to be understood is that in case of conservative amino acid replacement produced by nucleotide substitution, the replacement of nucleotide is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the amino acid fragments of DKK-1 are obtained, encoding nucleic acid sequences can be constructed, and the specific probes can be designed according to the nucleotide sequence. The full-length nucleotide sequence or the fragment thereof can be produced by PCR amplification, recombination or artificial synthesis. For PCR amplification, primers can be designed by the disclosed nucleotide sequences, particularly the open reading frame sequence, using commercially available cDNA library or cDNA library prepared by the common technology known by the skilled in the art to amplify the sequence. When the sequence is long, 2 or more times of PCR amplification is needed, then to link the fragments produced each time in right sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Once relevant sequence is obtained, recombination method can be used to massive produce the sequence, which commonly relates to clone the sequence into a vector, transfer into cell, and then isolate from the propagated host cells by common method to obtain the sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, artificial synthesis can be used to synthesize the sequence, especially when the fragment is relative short. Usually fragments with long sequences can be obtained by first synthesizing multiple small fragments and then linking them.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At present, the DNA sequence encoding the protein (or the fragments and derivatives) of the present invention can be produced by chemical synthesis. Then, the said DNA sequence can be introduced into any known DNA molecules (or vectors) and the cells in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">By common recombination DNA technology, the present polynucleotide sequence can be used to express or produce recombinant DKK-1 polypeptide. It usually comprises the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">(1) Transform or transduct the suitable host cell by the present polynucleotide (or mutant) encoding human DKK-1 polypeptide, or recombinant expression vector comprising the said polynucleotide;</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">(2) Culturing host cell in suitable culture medium;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">(3) Isolating and purifying the protein from the culture medium or the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present invention, DKK-1 polynucleotide sequence can be inserted into recombinant expression vectors. Generally any vectors and plasmids can be used as long as they can replicate and be stable in the host. One important character of the expression vector is that it usually comprises the replicate origin, promoter, marker gene and translation control element.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Methods well known by the skilled in the art can be used to construct the expression vectors comprising DKK-1 coding DNA sequence and suitable transcription/translation control signal. These methods include in vitro recombinant DNA technology, DNA synthesis technology, in vivo recombination technology, etc. The said DNA sequence can be effectively linked to suitable promoter in the expression vector to guide mRNA synthesis. Expression vectors also include ribosome binding site for starting the translation and the transcription terminators.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, expression vector preferably comprises one or more selective marker genes to provide the phenotypes which can be used to select the transformed host cell, for example, dihydrofolate reductase, neomycin resistance and green fluorescent protein (GFP) for eukaryote, or tetracycline or ampicillin resistance for <i>E. coli. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The vectors comprising the above suitable DNA sequences and suitable promoters or regulating sequences can be used to transform suitable host cells to express proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The host cells can be prokaryotic cells, for example bacteria cells; or lower eukaryotic cells, for example yeast cells; or higher eukaryotic cells, for example mammalian cells. The representative examples are <i>E. coli</i>, bacteria cells of <i>Streptomyces</i>; fungal cells for example yeast; plant cells, insect cells; animal cells.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Transforming host cells with recombinant DNA can perform with common technology well-known by the skilled in the art. When the host is prokaryotes for example <i>E. coli</i>, the competent cells that can absorb the DNA can be obtained after the logarithmic growth phase, processed by CaCl<sub>2 </sub>method, and the steps used are known in the art. The other method is to use MgCl<sub>2</sub>. If necessary, transforming can also use electroporation. When the hosts are eukaryotes, following DNA transfection method can be selected: calcium phosphate coprecipitation, normal mechanical methods such as microinjection, electroporation, liposome packing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The obtained transformant can be cultured with common method to express the polypeptide encoded by the present genes. According to the host cell used, the medium used in the cultivation can be selected from all kinds of regular mediums. The cultivation can be done under conditions suitable for the growth of the host cells. When the host cells grow into the desired cell density, suitable methods can be used to induce selected promoter (for example by temperature shift or chemical induction) and the cell can be cultured for some time more.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The recombinant polypeptides from the above method can be expressed in the cell, on the cell membrane, or secreted outside the cell. If necessary, recombinant proteins can be isolated and purified by various isolation methods utilizing its physical, chemical or other characters. These methods are well known by the skilled in the art. Examples of these method include, but not limited to, regular renaturation process, protein precipitator treatment (salt out), centrifugation, osmotic breaking-up of the bacteria, ultrasonication, ultracentrifugation, molecular sieve chromatography (gel filtration), adsorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, high performance liquid phase chromatography (HPLC) and other liquid phase chromatography, and the combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After obtaining the nucleic acid sequence, specific nucleic acid probe can be designed according to the sequence. Methods for designing the probes are common in the art, See Sambrook et. al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Mannual, Second edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, 1989. The exemplary method for testing whether DKK-1 protein or nucleic acid exists in the biological samples comprises examining the biological sample of the subject, exposing the said biological sample to labeled nucleic acid probes that can hybrid with DKK-1 mRNA or genomic DNA. The nucleic acid probes can be for example human nucleic acid or part of it, for example of at least 15, 30, 50, or 100 nucleotides and the nucleic acid probes that can sufficiently hybrid with DKK-1 mRNA or genomic DNA. Other probes used in the present diagnosis assay are as mentioned herein.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Nucleic acid probes contact with the labeled and amplified sequences. The probes preferably are linked to chromophore, but can also be radioactive labeled. In another embodiment, the probes are linked to binding partner, for example antibody or biotin, or another binding partner with a detectable domain.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the traditional methods, the detection can be realized by Southern blotting and hybridization with labeled probes. The technology of Southern blotting is well known by the skilled in the art (See Sambrook et. al., 1989). Common detections also include biochips, florescent imaging technology, and flow cytometry, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another expect, the present invention also includes the specific polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies, particular monoclonal antibodies, against polypeptides encoded by DKK-1 DNA or the fragments thereof. Herein, &#x201c;specific&#x201d; means that the antibody can bind with DKK-1 gene product or fragments thereof, preferably those antibodies that bind with DKK-1 gene product or fragment but do not recognize and bind other non-relevant antigen molecules. The present antibody can be prepared by any technologies known by the skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present invention not only include the complete monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, but also the antibody fragments that have immune activity, for example Fab' or (Fab)<sub>2 </sub>fragments, antibody heavy chain, antibody light chain, single chain Fv molecules modified by genetic engineering, or chimeric antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Anti-DKK-1 antibody can be used in immunohistochemistry to detect the DKK-1 protein in the biopsy samples.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The direct detection of DKK-1 in blood or urine sample can be observation index for tumor assistant diagnosis and prognosis, and can also be the basis of tumor early diagnosis.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Antibodies can be detected by ELISA, Western blotting, or linked with detecting groups, which can be detected by chemiluminescence, and isotopic tracing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The present invention also includes kit to perform any method described herein. In one non-limiting example, the kit can include one or more of the reagents with suitable forms of containers. The kit can also comprise reagents and labels for RNA isolation and purification of the RNA in the amplified cells.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The components of the kit can be packed in aqueous medium or in lyophilized form. The suitable containers in the kit usually at least include one vial, tube, flask, bottle, syringe or other containers, which can have one components, and preferably suitably parted. When there is more than one component in the kit, the kit will usually have second, third and other additional containers, which can separately hold additional components. However, different combination of the components can be included in one vial. The present invention usually includes one container to hold the reactants, which is sealed for commercial distribution. The said container can include die-cast or blow molded plastic containers, in which the necessary vial can be kept.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention is further described hereinafter with particular examples. It should be understood that these examples are just used to explain the invention, not to limit the scope of the invention. The experimental methods without particular conditions in the following examples usually use the regular conditions, for example those described in Sambrook et. al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Mannual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1989, or as suggested by the producers.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preparation. Electrophoresis chamber, gel plate and comb were dipped in 3% oxydol for more than 15 min, then rinsed clean by autoclaved DEPC processed water. Graduate and conical flask were dipped in DEPC water over night, 180&#xb0; C. parched for 8 h. 10&#xd7;MOPS formaldehyde gel electrophoresis buffer (Huashun, Cat W67) was used to formulate 1&#xd7; formaldehyde gel electrophoresis buffer 1000 ml: 10&#xd7;MOPS formaldehyde gel electrophoresis buffer 100 ml, 37% formaldehyde 20 ml, and Rnase-free water 880 ml. Formulation of 5&#xd7;RNA load buffer: 80 &#x3bc;l 500 mM EDTA (pH8.0), 720 &#x3bc;l 37% formaldehyde, 2 ml 100% glycerol. 3084 &#x3bc;l formamide, and 4 ml 10&#xd7;MOPS formaldehyde gel electrophoresis buffer. An amount of bromophenol blue was added, and RNAse-free water was added to make the volume up to 10 ml. The preparation of 1% formaldehyde gel denatured gen: 1 g agarose (GIBCO BRL, Cat 15510-027) was weighted and RNase-free water 90 ml was added. The agarose was microwave melted and then 1.8 ml 37% formaldehyde, 10 ml 10&#xd7;MOPS formaldehyde gel electrophoresis buffer was added, thoroughly mixed and then filled into gel. Before the electrophoresis, the gel was hold in 1&#xd7; formaldehyde gel electrophoresis buffer to balance at least 30 min. The denaturation of RNA samples: From each sample, total RNA 10 &#x3bc;g was taken, and 1 volume of 5&#xd7;RNA load buffer was added for every 4 volumes of sample. The mixture was mixed thoroughly and then incubated at 65&#xb0; C. for 10 min, and immediately put on ice.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The RNA sample after electrophoresis, transfer and denaturation was on formaldehyde gel denaturation electrophoresis for 4 h, using up-run capillary method to transfer the RNA on the gel to the nylon film (S&#x26;S, Cat 99J071). Load of 500 g was proposed, and the transfer time was 18-24 h. The film was taken out, and rinsed in Milli Q water for several minutes. The film was dried at 37&#xb0; C., baked at 80&#xb0; C. for 1.5 h, to immobilize the RNA on the nylon film.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">2) Labeling and Purification of DNA Probes:</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Preparation of the probes. DKK-1 gene was PCR amplified.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Radioimmunoimaging and biological distribution research was done on nude mouse model with human hepatoma using DKK-1 specific monoclonal antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">1. Material and Method</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">1.1 11 4-6 weeks old about 20 g male BALB/C nude mice were grown in Shanghai Cancer Institute. Anti-DKK-1 monoclonal antibody 500 &#x3bc;g/1 ml, mIgG1 antibody 1 mg/1 ml, available from R&#x26;D systems, Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">1.2 Cultivation of the Cells.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">(1) Cell resuscitation: Frozen human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cell cryovial was taken out, and fast cast into 37&#xb0; C. bath to recover the temperature and melted fast. (2) The cry vial was taken out of the bath and opened. Cell suspension was aspired with pipette, filled into centrifuge tube and 5 ml culture medium (DMEM+10% calf serum) was added dropwise. After mixing, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. Rinsed for 3 times. (3) After rinsing, the cells were diluted with culture medium, inoculated into culture flask, in which 5 ml culture medium was added, and then put in 37&#xb0; C. CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. On next day, the culture medium was changed and the incubation continued. (4) When the adherent cell were up to 80%, they were digested and divided several flasks. The culture medium was aspired completely with pipette, and the culture was washed with PBS twice, and the PBS medium was aspired. Several drops of trypsin were added, mixed thoroughly, and kept flat in 37&#xb0; C. incubator for digesting 1 min. Under inverted microscope it could be seen that the cells shrinked into round shape. 2 ml culture medium was added to stop the digestion, and the cells were removed from the flask wall, and moved into clean tubes, 1000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatant was removed, 2 ml culture medium was added to resuspend the cell pellet, mixed thoroughly. (5) Cells were counted and average value was calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">1.3 Establishing of the Nude Mice Model with Human Hepatoma</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">SMMC-7721 cell were prepared with PBS into unicell suspension. 4 nude mice were each subcutaneously injected at the back SMMC-7721 cell 0.2-1&#xd7;10<sup>7</sup>/0.2 ml. When the tumor grew up to about diameter 0.8 cm, it was removed by surgery. The tumor was immediately immersed into sterile physiological saline, and cut into small parts of 2.0 mm diameter, then transplanted subcutaneously in the right side of the back of the nude mouse with trocar. Such transplant were repeated several times (each time not more than 3 nude mice) to make the in vivo biological properties of SMMC-7721 cell stable. 11 nude mice were selected to transplant subcutaneously in the right side of the back using above procedure. After 5 weeks, the tumors grew into 1 cm in diameter for use.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">1.4 Labeling anti-DKK-1 monoclonal antibody using modified chloramine T method, using iodine [<sup>131</sup>I] to mark anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody and IgG1, isolated and purified on Sephadex G50 column. The radioactive chemical purity of iodine [<sup>131</sup>I] was tested as 95%, radioactive concentration was 200 &#x3bc;Ci/ml, radioactive specific activity was 5 &#x3bc;Ci/&#x3bc;g. The radioactive chemical purity of iodine [<sup>131</sup>I]-IgG1 was tested as 94%, radioactive concentration was 75 &#x3bc;Ci/ml, and radioactive specific activity was 1 &#x3bc;Ci/&#x3bc;g</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">1.5 24 h before assay, the mice were fed 1% KI water to block thyroid. The detailed experimental steps were as follows: (1) Assay group and the administration protocol: nude mice were divided into A and B groups, each group having 6 and 5 nude mices. Group A were all injected at vena caudalis with 30 &#x3bc;Ci iodine [<sup>131</sup>I]-DKK1 and group B were all injected at vena caudalis with 12 &#x3bc;Ci iodine [<sup>131</sup>I]-IgG1. (2) Biological distribution and visualization: SPET visualization. Mice were anaesthetized by inhaling of ether after 24, 48, 96 and 120 hours after injection of labeled antibodies, fastened by adhesive plaster and ran SPECT. ADAC WeltesPlus double sensor SPECT was used, which equipped high energy collimator, energy peak 364 Kev&#xb1;10% window width, matrix 64&#xd7;64, magnification 2.02, preset collection count 100K. (3) After SPECT 24, 48, 96, 120 h, mice were executed by pulling neck and tumor, blood, liver, lung and other organs were collected, weighted and counted for radioactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">2. Result</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">2.1 SPECT results: 1 in 6 experimental mice in Group I had positive image (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Experimental group II did not have positive image. Group I evidently was advantageous than group II.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">2.2 <sup>131</sup>I-DKK1 distribution profile (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) showed that <sup>131</sup>I-DKK1 gathered in the tumor tissue as time passed, and reached the peak at 120 h. <sup>131</sup>I-IgG1 in mice reached peak at 96 h.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">3. Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The characters of nuclide tumor imaging, such as high specificity, high sensitivity, non-traumatic and systematic make it the preferred screening examination for certain diseases and it is effective staging tool before certain tumor therapies. The present experiment used in vivo distribution experiment with <sup>131</sup>I labeled anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibodies, and demonstrated that after injection of anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody the tumor area has apparent radioactivity gathering, which indicates that anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody can recognize the tumor and the normal tissue, and has high affinity to human hepatoma cells.</p>
