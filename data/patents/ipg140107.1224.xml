<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the field of a wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle body of a wheel axle from a vehicle, in particular a road vehicle, such as a lorry or a lorry trailer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, the invention relates to the field in which a wheel axle suspension, on each side of the vehicle, has a suspension arm which extends substantially in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, called a &#x201c;trailing arm&#x201d; in the art, and to which the axle body is attached, each trailing arm being hingedly connected at the front, viewed in the direction of travel of the vehicle, to a bearing bracket which is arranged on the vehicle chassis. In a known embodiment, a pneumatic spring is arranged between the trailing arm and the chassis of such a wheel axle suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Trailing arms for wheel axle suspensions of this kind can essentially be divided into two types: spring trailing arms (also referred to as flexible trailing arms) and rigid trailing arms. In practice, a resilient bush is used for connecting rigid trailing arms to a bearing bracket which is mounted on the vehicle chassis, in which case the resilient bush absorbs relative movements of the wheel axle suspension. In the case of wheel axle suspensions which use spring trailing arms, the majority of the relative movements are absorbed by the deformation of a spring portion of the trailing arm itself. In this case, the spring trailing arm is often produced in the form of a monolithic and solid part from a suitable steel grade, in particular spring steel. The spring portion is situated between the area where the wheel axle is connected to the trailing arm and the front end of the trailing arm, where the arm is hingedly attached to a bearing bracket. The different operational principles of the trailing arms result in different requirements imposed on the trailing arms. Spring trailing arms are designed to be able to cope with relatively large deformations without breaking. This requirement also has consequences for the production of the trailing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention relates inter alia to the trailing arm of a wheel axle suspension of this type, both with regard to the design of the trailing arm and with regard to the method for the production of a trailing arm of this type.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention also relates to the production of wheel axle suspensions of this type, in particular the production of such wheel axle suspensions for wheel axles having different diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of the invention relates to the contact of the axle body and the trailing arm in the case of a wheel axle suspension.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A wheel axle suspension is disclosed in, for example, DE 296 15 286. With this known wheel axle suspension, the axle body is clamped directly against a contact region of a spring trailing arm by means of a clamping plate which is situated on that side of the axle body which is turned away from the trailing arm, and by a pair of U-shaped clamping straps extending around the trailing arm and through holes in the clamping plate. At the location of the axle clamp, the axle body is deformed to form a non-round contour with flattened regions which contact the contact region of the trailing arm. Here, the spring trailing arm has a constant width, that is to say, the contact region and the spring portion have the same width.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to save material, weight and space in the structure, the bearing springs are generally designed to be as narrow as possible, with the trailing arm still having a width and height which are such that the rolling motions of the vehicle can still be absorbed to a sufficient degree. In the case of the spring trailing arm from DE 296 15 286, this results in the axle body which extends at right angles to the trailing arm being only clamped in over a limited length of the axle body. As a result thereof, the axle body is subjected to high loads locally, due to the high clamping forces which are required to fix the axle. Particularly with thin-walled tubular axle bodies, this is a problem as these axle bodies, due to the great forces, are deformed significantly which adversely affects their service life. It is known to increase the length of the axle body which is clamped in by using an axle pad which is arranged between the trailing arm and the axle body and is wider than the trailing arm. Such a structure is shown, for example, in FIG. 7 of DE 296 15 286, but has the drawback that more parts are required which results in a more complicated fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It should be noted that US 2006/0163834 discloses a wheel axle suspension having a rigid trailing arm which is produced by casting or forging and is provided with a sleeve through which the axle body extends in the fitted state. The sleeve may be formed as a single part, with the axle body having to be pushed into the latter in the axial direction, but the sleeve may also be made up of two halves which are welded to one another by means of axial welding after the axle body has been placed therein. The sleeve is wider than that part of the trailing arm which is situated in front thereof. The sleeve is designed to be welded to the axle body. To this end, the sleeve has openings in which a plug weld or the like can be provided for connecting the sleeve to the axle body.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of the first aspect of the invention to provide an improved wheel axle suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This object is achieved, according to the first aspect of the invention, by means of a wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle body of a wheel axle from a vehicle, comprising on both sides of the vehicle a trailing arm which extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and to which the axle body is attached. The trailing arm is hingedly connected at the front, viewed in the direction of travel of the vehicle, to a bearing bracket which is arranged on the vehicle chassis. A pneumatic spring is operational between the trailing arm and the chassis. The axle body, in the fitted position, bears directly against a contact region of the trailing arm, which contact region is essentially complementary to the outer contour of the axle body. The trailing arm is clamped against the axle body by means of clamping means. The trailing arm is wider at the location of at least the front of the contact region than in the region which is situated immediately in front thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment as a spring trailing arm, the trailing arm at the location of at least the front end of the contact region is wider than the spring portion of the trailing arm, which is situated more to the front. In practice, the spring trailing arm is usually provided with an integrally formed securing eye and the spring portion is situated between that securing eye and the contact region, the trailing arm having a significantly greater stiffness at the location of the contact region than the spring portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first aspect of the invention makes it possible to make the design the trailing arm lightweight, while still clamping a sufficient length of the axle body to spread the load on the axle body resulting from the clamping and thus preventing the axle body from being subjected to locally excessive loads and to deformation, while not requiring any additional components between the axle body and the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It has been found that the axle body is mainly loaded and deformed at the front of the clamping arrangement. This makes it possible to taper the portion of the trailing arm which forms the contact region towards the rear, i.e. to reduce the width thereof towards the rear. At the front of the clamping arrangement, the axle body is then clamped over a sufficient length of the axle body, while the axle body is clamped over a smaller length at the rear of the clamp. This results in a saving in material and weight.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, the portion of the trailing arm which forms the contact region for the axle body, in top view, has an approximately triangular shape, the greatest width of which is situated at the front of said portion and the tip of the triangle being situated at the rear of that portion. This embodiment can be used in particular when the support part is provided with a securing arm for the pneumatic spring, preferably integrally formed with the support part, wherein the axle body is clamped between the trailing arm and the support part, and wherein the securing arm extends further towards the rear. In that case, for example, clamping means are provided which clamp the trailing arm and the support part against the axle body. For example, two holes are then provided near the wide front of that portion of the trailing arm which forms the contact region, and a single hole is provided at the narrower rear of said portion, for example in order to accommodate three clamping bolts (or one U-shaped strap and one bolt).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the axle body has a substantially circular cross section at the location of the axle clamping arrangement. Axle bodies having a circular cross section are more capable of absorbing moments of torsion than axles with a different cross section, for example a square cross section. In addition, it is preferable to use a hollow axle body.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment, the support part surrounds the preferably round and hollow axle body over at least 180&#xb0; of its periphery. As a result, the clamping force is distributed evenly over the periphery of the axle body and the axle body is prevented from becoming excessively deformed and deviating from a circular shape to an excessive degree. As a result of this measure, relatively thin-walled axle bodies can be used which in itself results in a weight saving of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one possible embodiment, the support part is omitted and the trailing arm, at the location of the axle clamping arrangement is provided with holes on both sides of the axle, for inserting the shanks of U-shaped clamping straps. As a result of this measure, it may be possible to achieve a weight saving.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the trailing arm is designed as a spring or flexible trailing arm. The rolling motions about the longitudinal axis of the vehicle are absorbed by these spring trailing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another possible embodiment, the trailing arm is designed as a rigid arm. Such rigid arms are hingedly connected to the bearing bracket by means of a resilient bush.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the trailing arm and the axle body are locked with respect to one another by means of a locking means. As a result of this locking action, a rotation of the axle body with respect to the trailing arm due to torsional forces is prevented. Preferably, the axle body or trailing arm is provided with a projection at the location of the axle clamping arrangement and the trailing arm or axle body, is provided with a complementary recess for accommodating the projection.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">If a support part is used, the support part may be provided with recesses for accommodating at least a bend portion of U-shaped clamping straps.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is an object of a second aspect of the invention to improve, in a pneumatically sprung wheel axle suspension, the attachment of the axle body to the trailing arm by means of the clamping means and/or to provide an alternative solution.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second aspect of the invention provides a pneumatically sprung wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle body of a wheel axle from a vehicle, comprising on both sides of the vehicle a trailing arm, which extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and to which the axle body is attached. The trailing arm is hingedly connected at the front, viewed in the direction of travel of the vehicle, to a bearing bracket which is arranged on the vehicle chassis, as well as a pneumatic spring which is operational between the trailing arm and the chassis. The axle body, in the fitted position, bears against a contact region of the trailing arm, which contact region is essentially complementary to the outer contour of the axle body. A support part is provided on that side of the axle body which is turned away from the contact region, which support part is provided with a recess for accommodating the axle body, which support part is clamped against the axle body by means of clamping means. In this case, the portion of the trailing arm which forms the contact region for the axle body has two holes at the front of the contact region and one hole at the rear of the contact region, with the clamping means extending through these holes. This solution is based on the insight that the load on the axle body and any deformation of the axle body primarily takes place at the front of the clamping arrangement. In this case, the axle body is preferably hollow and advantageously has a circular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The solution according to the second aspect of the invention makes it possible to design the wheel axle suspension with fewer and/or smaller clamping means compared to the prior art, which facilitates mounting and can result in a saving on material and weight.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the trailing arm is a spring trailing arm. In this case, the portion between the part where the trailing arm is hingedly connected to the bearing bracket and the contact region is the spring portion.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the trailing arm is wider at the front of the contact region than at the rear of the contact region. As a result thereof, it is possible to achieve a saving on material and thus weight as well.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one possible embodiment, the contact region has a substantially triangular shape when viewed from the top, in particular a shape which is substantially similar to that of an equilateral triangle.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one possible embodiment, the clamping means are three bolts, the bolt shanks of which extend through the holes, with the bolt shank at the rear of the contact region having a larger cross section than the bolt shanks at the front of the contact region. As a result thereof, the cross section of the clamping means can be adapted to the load, for example in such a manner that the stresses in the clamping means are equal on both sides of the contact region.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to save material and thus weight without significantly reducing the strength of the trailing arm, it is possible to provide a depression which extends from one of the two holes at the front of the portion which forms the contact region in the direction of the hole at the rear of said portion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an advantageous embodiment, that portion of the trailing arm which forms the axle clamping arrangement has a central rib on the side which is turned away from the axle body which extends from the front of the portion which forms the contact region, between the two holes at said front, in the direction towards the single hole at the rear, a depression being provided on either side of this central rib wherein, in each case, one of the holes at the front is situated, with a further rib preferably being present along each side edge of the respective portion which delimits the depression on that side.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the trailing arm is at least partially produced by forging. Preferably, at least the portion which forms the contact region is produced by forging. As will be explained below, the entire trailing arm is preferably produced by forging, with a securing eye at the front of the trailing arm being brought into the intended position after forging by twisting the trailing arm, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A third aspect of the invention relates to a wheel axle suspension, wherein an absorber is also provided, in practice usually a shock absorber having a telescopic body provided with mounting eyes on the ends of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is an object of the third aspect of the invention to provide improvements and/or to present alternatives for the attachment of such an absorber to that side of the absorber turned towards the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a first variant according to the third aspect of the invention, a separate absorber securing part is provided which is provided with one or more lips or a fork for hingedly attaching an eye of a shock absorber, which absorber securing part is clamped between the trailing arm and the support part in the fitted position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the absorber securing part has a rear concave surface which, in the fitted position, contacts the axle body.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the absorber securing part has one or more through-holes through which in each case one leg of a clamping means extends.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a second variant according to the third aspect of the invention, a separate absorber securing part with a bush is provided through which, in the fitted position, a shank of one of the clamping means, for example a clamping bolt or clamping strap, extends, by means of which clamping means the bush is clamped against the trailing arm or support part, the bush being provided with one or more lips or a fork for hingedly attaching an eye of a shock absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a third variant according to the third aspect of the invention, it is provided that the absorber attachment is integrally formed with one of the clamping means, for example one clamping means is designed as a bolt with a bolt shank and a bolt head, the bolt head being provided with one or more lips or a fork for hingedly attaching an eye of a shock absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A fourth aspect of the invention relates to the attachment of a possible absorber to the chassis. In practice, a shock absorber is usually provided between the trailing arm and the chassis, with the absorber usually having a telescopic body having an eye at each end of the body for attaching the absorber to the trailing arm and the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the fourth aspect of the invention, is provided a wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle body of a wheel axle from a vehicle, comprising a trailing arm which extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and to which the axle body is attached, which trailing arm, in the direction of travel of the vehicle, is hingedly connected at the front to a bearing bracket which is arranged on the vehicle chassis, wherein furthermore an absorber attachment is provided for attaching an absorber which absorbs the movement of the trailing arm, which absorber has a telescopic body having an eye at each end of the body. The wheel axle suspension comprises a separate absorber securing part which is provided with one or more lips or a fork for hingedly attaching an eye of a shock absorber, which absorber securing part, in the fitted position, is directly connected to the vehicle chassis. This has the advantage that the forces are passed on directly to the vehicle chassis by the shock absorber and do not pass via the bearing bracket. As a result thereof, the bearing bracket can be optimized further for hingedly supporting the trailing arm. Furthermore, the fitting of the bearing bracket can be simplified if the shock absorber is no longer connected to the bearing bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one preferred embodiment, the absorber securing part is provided with an integral bolt shank, preferably a single integral bolt shank, which is inserted through an opening in the chassis of the vehicle and secured by means of a nut. This measure simplifies the fitting. In this case, the absorber securing part can be used to replace the normal bolt/nut connection, as a result of which the number of bolt/nut connections remains the same.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A fifth aspect of the invention relates to the efficient production of pneumatically sprung wheel axle suspensions, in particular wheel axle suspensions for wheel axles with different cross-sectional dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In practice, hollow tubular wheel axles having a circular cross section and an outer diameter of 127 mm are often used for lorries. For trailers, hollow tubular wheel axles having a circular cross section and an outer diameter of 146 mm are often used. Other diameters are also known.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is an object of the fifth aspect of the invention to make efficient production of pneumatically sprung wheel axle suspensions possible.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To this end, the fifth aspect of the invention provides an assembly for a wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle from a vehicle. The assembly comprises a trailing arm which, in use, extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and to which the axle can be attached, wherein the trailing arm can be hingedly connected to a bearing bracket which is attached to the vehicle chassis, which trailing arm has a contact region against which an axle body having a first outer diameter can bear directly, wherein the contact region is substantially complementary to the outer contour of the axle body having the respective outer diameter. The assembly furthermore comprises a support part which, in use, can be attached on that side of the axle body which is turned away from the contact region of the trailing arm, which support part is provided with a recess for accommodating the axle, and which support part is furthermore provided with a securing arm which, in the fitted position, extends to the rear from the support part, which securing arm is designed so that the underside of a pneumatic spring can be fitted thereto, the top side of the pneumatic spring being attached to the vehicle chassis. Moreover, the assembly comprises clamping means for clamping the contact region of the trailing arm and the support part against the axle body. According to this aspect, the assembly also comprises a shell part which can be fitted between the contact region of the trailing arm and the axle body, which shell part has an outer contact surface which is designed to bear in a fitting manner against the contact region which has a diameter which is adapted to the first diameter and has an inner contact surface which is designed to bear against an axle body having a second diameter, the second diameter being smaller than the first diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the fifth aspect of the invention, it is provided that the trailing arm is produced for an axle body having a large outer diameter, for example 146 mm, but that it can also be used for axle bodies having a smaller diameter, for example 127 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, with this aspect of the invention, the support part is provided with a recess which is adapted to the outer diameter of the axle body. In this manner, a universal trailing arm for axle bodies of different diameters can be produced, while a specific support part and, if desired, a specific shell part are produced for each variant embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fifth aspect of the invention also relates to a method for producing wheel axle suspensions for wheel axles having axle bodies of different diameters, wherein use is made of the abovementioned assembly, wherein, based on the diameter of the axle body, no shell part or a shell part adapted to the diameter is fitted between the axle body and the trailing arm. In one preferred embodiment, different support parts having a recess adapted to the different diameters of the axle bodies are furthermore provided, with a support part being selected and fitted in the wheel axle suspension based on the diameter of the respective axle body.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A sixth aspect of the invention relates to the production of a spring trailing arm for a pneumatically sprung wheel axle suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As has already been mentioned, the trailing arms for such a wheel axle suspension can be divided into two types: sprung and rigid trailing arms. Rigid trailing arms are connected to a bearing bracket on a vehicle chassis by means of a resilient bush, with the resilient bush absorbing the relative movements of the wheel axle suspension. With wheel axle suspensions which use spring arms, the majority of the relative movements are absorbed by the deformation of a spring portion of the trailing arm itself. This spring portion is situated between the area where the axle is connected to the trailing arm and the front end of the arm, where the arm is hingedly suspended from a bearing bracket. The various operational principles result in different requirements being imposed on the trailing arms. Spring trailing arms are designed to be able to cope with relatively large deformations without breaking. This requirement also has consequences for the production of the trailing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is known to produce rigid structures which do not allow great deformations by means of casting or forging. An example thereof is the rigid trailing arm from US 2006/0163834. This trailing arm is of the rigid type and is therefore only suitable for wheel axle suspensions wherein the resilient bush absorbs the deformations. A drawback of these wheel axle suspensions is the fact that these are less suitable for absorbing rolling motions of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">By tradition, spring trailing arms have a substantially rectangular cross section and, according to the prior art, are always produced by rolling. By deforming and kneading the material during the rolling process, the trailing arm becomes resilient, thus preventing the trailing arm from breaking in the event of relatively small deformations. However, rolling has the drawback that passing a (semi-finished) product between two rollers results in the cross section of the product being unambiguously determined in one direction and no variation in cross section is possible, in principle, viewed in the longitudinal direction of the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some variation in the cross section is still possible if the (semi-finished) product is not passed between the two rollers in its entirety, but is pulled back in time. Another option would be to move the rollers towards one another or further apart while the product is being passed through. Apart from the fact that this requires a complicated control unit for the process, the shape of the trailing arm is largely limited due to the production process.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Some variation in cross section also occurs because the rolling process usually only determines the thickness with sufficient accuracy. The dimensions in the other two directions, i.e. the longitudinal direction and the width direction, cannot be controlled in principle. All this is dependent on the starting material. Different starting materials lead to different end products, so that there is insufficient control over the three-dimensional dimensions of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is an object of the sixth aspect of the invention to provide an improved and/or alternative manufacturing method for the spring trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the sixth aspect of the invention, the spring trailing arm is at least partially produced by forging. This has the advantage that the shape of the trailing arm is not limited to such a large degree by the manufacturing process. This offers more freedom in terms of design and can lead to savings on material, weight and space.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If there is more freedom in terms of design this offers the possibility of optimizing the design of a spring trailing arm further. Optimization of the trailing arm is desirable if, for example, the trailing arm is not only subjected to flexural loads, but, for example, also to torsional loads as a result of, inter alia, the rolling motion of the vehicle. By now using forging during the manufacturing process, more shapes are possible for the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A greater degree of freedom of design offers the advantage that parts of the trailing arm can be optimized for the function they perform. As a result, the trailing arm can be made more lightweight and still be sufficiently strong locally to absorb the loads to which it is subjected. Ultimately, the freedom of design leads to savings in material, weight and/or space.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Preferably, the trailing arm is made of spring steel.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Preferably, the trailing arm is made in its entirety in a single operation from the starting material. In other words, the trailing arm is preferably formed by one blow of the forging device.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the invention, it is possible to carry out the forging on a rolled and/or cast semi-finished product. In this case, the semi-finished product formed by rolling and/or casting serves as a base for the finished product formed by forging. This ensures that there is less loss of material during the forging and simplifies the forging process.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one possible embodiment, the semi-finished product comprises a projecting part. This projecting part is suitable for holding the semi-finished product and orienting it during forging. After the forging process, this part is removed. However, it is also possible for the projecting part by which the trailing arm is held not to be removed during forging, but for it to be part of the finished trailing arm. All this depends on the design of the trailing arm. An advantage thereof is the fact that even less material is required to manufacture the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After forging, the trailing arm is preferably hardened by means of a hardening process. This hardening process is preferably performed on the surface of the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A seventh aspect of the invention relates to a method for producing a trailing arm for a wheel axle suspension, preferably a pneumatically sprung wheel axle suspension, wherein the trailing arm has a securing eye at the front end. As is known, the trailing arm is in practice connected to a bearing bracket by means of the securing eye and a pin (if desired designed as a bolt) inserted through the eye, which bearing bracket is in turn attached to the chassis of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is an object of the seventh aspect of the invention to provide an improved and/or alternative manufacturing process for such a trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The seventh aspect of the invention provides a method for producing a trailing arm for a wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle body for a vehicle, wherein a securing eye is formed on the trailing arm by means of which the trailing arm can be hingedly connected on a bearing bracket on a vehicle chassis. Following the formation of the securing eye, the trailing arm is twisted about the longitudinal axis of the trailing arm, so that the securing eye is rotated through an angle, said twisting preferably taking place in a portion of the trailing arm which adjoins the securing eye.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The seventh aspect of the invention can advantageously be used for producing spring trailing arms of suitable steel.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An advantage of this method is the fact that the orientation of the securing eye can be adapted to the desired position in the wheel axle suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A wheel axle is sometimes produced in the form of a bend in order to make space, for example, for a cardan shaft. In most cases, a trailing arm is then attached to a horizontal part of the wheel axle corresponding to a horizontally oriented hinge pin of the securing eye. By twisting the trailing arm and orienting the securing eye in this manner, the trailing arm can be attached to any part of the wheel axle, it being possible for the hinge pin to remain oriented horizontally in the fitted position (as is usual), while allowing the trailing arm to be attached to an oblique part of the wheel axle. In this case, any rotation can be used, preferably 1&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, but larger rotations, such as for example 120&#xb0;, are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A second advantage offered by this method relates to the manufacturing process. The invention makes it possible for the securing eye to be oriented differently during a step of the manufacturing process than in the finished wheel axle suspension. By now carrying out the manufacturing process with the eye at a different orientation and subsequently twisting the trailing arm, preferably in a defined region, which preferably has a round cross section, in order to reach the final orientation of the securing eye, the manufacturing process can be optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Preferably, the trailing arm is, at least partially, produced by forging.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, the trailing arm is formed from a semi-finished product, the width being greater than the thickness of the semi-finished product. The securing eye is then, possibly in one blow, formed using a forging hammer in a pre-forming position of the eye, with the axis of the hole in the eye at that point in time still being in the thickness direction, that is to say at right angles to the width of the trailing arm, in particular when the spring trailing arm has a spring portion which has a substantially rectangular cross section. The forging hammer preferably also moves in said thickness direction, i.e. in fact at right angles to the principal plane of the trailing arm. The securing eye is then moved to the desired position by twisting a part of the trailing arm. The desired position of the eye will usually be rotated through 90&#xb0; with respect to the pre-forming position, with the axis of the hole in the eye, after twisting, running substantially parallel to the width of the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When forming the securing eye, the forging hammer is possibly designed as the complementary portion of the half of the securing eye to be formed. On the other side of the forging hammer, an anvil is provided which is complementary with the other half of the securing eye to be formed. By now placing the portion to be formed between the forging hammer and the anvil, the securing eye can be formed, preferably with one blow.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Forming the trailing arm with the securing eye by forging offers the advantage that the forming process is quick compared to, for example, a prior art process using rollers wherein the eye has to be formed later by means of bending. This is advantageous for the time of passage of the trailing arm to be produced. In addition, forging makes it possible to produce an eye having a closed annular body portion surrounding the hole of the eye. This results in a strong eye and, compared to bending a rolled portion of the trailing arm, as is used in the prior art with spring trailing arms, has the advantage that there is no interruption in the material at a seam and no welding operation is required in order to close this seam.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is conceivable that several blows of the forging hammer are required in order to form the securing eye. This is the case, for example, when the shape of the securing eye is relatively complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Preferably, the securing eye formed by forging does not require any shape-defining finishing, but with more complicated shapes and/or more stringent requirements with regard to tolerances, it is expected that one or more, preferably simple finishing operations may be required to produce the final shape of the securing eye.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one advantageous embodiment, a portion having a substantially round cross section, in particular a circular cross section is formed, adjacent to the securing eye, in such a manner that during twisting of the arm, the deformation takes place completely or at least substantially within the portion having the substantially round cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Preferably, the trailing arm, or at least the front end thereof with the securing eye and the portion having a round cross section which is provided, if desired, and adjoins the securing eye, is formed in its entirety by forging in a forging device. In this case, the eye is preferably formed from a portion of the trailing arm which was originally&#x2014;prior to forging&#x2014;circular, with the hole being formed in the eye by forging. If desired, a hole could already be present in the originally circular portion.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Preferably, twisting takes place after forging using a twisting device, when at least the portion of the trailing arm which is to be twisted is hot, in practice red-hot, preferably still hot from forging and/or as a result of suitable heating of the part to be twisted. Preferably, twisting takes place in a single uninterrupted twisting movement until the desired position of the securing eye has been reached.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An eighth aspect of the invention relates to a wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle body of a wheel axle from a vehicle. In this case, there is provided a trailing arm for a wheel axle suspension for suspending an axle body of a wheel axle from a vehicle, which trailing arm has a securing eye at a front end for attaching the trailing arm to the vehicle, for example to a bearing bracket which is provided on the vehicle chassis, for example using a hinge bolt. Adjacent to the securing eye, the trailing arm has a portion which has a substantially round cross section, in particular a circular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">One advantage of this round cross section is the fact that stresses in the material resulting from torsion due to, for example, a rolling motion of the vehicle, are distributed virtually evenly along the periphery of the cross section, where the deformation and the stress is greatest.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Another advantage of this aspect of the invention becomes clear in combination with the twisting of the trailing arm in order to orient the securing eye. When the portion of the trailing arm which is adjacent to the securing eye has a substantially round cross section before the securing eye is twisted and the deformation during twisting takes place completely or substantially in the portion having the substantially round cross section, this not only results in uniform stresses along the periphery of the cross section, but the shape of the portion of the trailing arm which is adjacent to the securing eye is also substantially identical to the situation prior to twisting and there is less superfluous material.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, the trailing arm comprises at least one portion having a substantially rectangular cross section between the securing eye and the arm region where the axle body is connected to the trailing arm. This has the advantage that the stiffness of the trailing arm can be optimized in various directions. This is particularly advantageous if the trailing arm also has to absorb transverse forces, for example when the vehicle goes around a bend.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In order to prevent peak stresses or stress concentrations as much as possible, the portion having the substantially round cross section then preferably merges smoothly with the portion having the substantially rectangular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The eighth aspect of the invention can be used with both sprung and rigid trailing arms. If the trailing arm is a spring trailing arm and has a portion which has a substantially rectangular cross section, this portion is preferably the spring portion.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one embodiment, the trailing arm, or at least the front part thereof, is produced by means of forging, preferably according to one or more aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the forged trailing arms according to the various aspects and preferred embodiments of the invention, as is already customary for pneumatically sprung wheel axle suspensions for lorries, trailers and the like, are preferably designed as monolithic and solid parts made from a suitable steel grade, particularly spring steel in the case of spring trailing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the various aspects of the invention can be used separately, but also in all kinds of different combinations. Non-limiting examples of the aspects and of combinations of these aspects of the invention will be explained below with reference to the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The invention also relates to a vehicle provided with a wheel axle suspension according to one or more aspects of the invention and/or a trailing arm according to one or more aspects of the invention, the wheel axle suspension preferably being pneumatically sprung. The vehicle is for example a lorry or a lorry trailer.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show a spring trailing arm <b>1</b>, which is also referred to in the art as a flexible trailing arm. The trailing arm <b>1</b> has a spring portion <b>2</b> which is provided at the front, viewed in the direction of travel of the vehicle, with a securing eye <b>3</b>. The trailing arm <b>1</b> can, by means of a hinge bolt, be hingedly connected to a bearing bracket which is provided on the underside of a vehicle chassis. The bearing bracket or equivalent supporting structure can also be integral with the vehicle chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Following on from the spring portion <b>2</b> of the trailing arm <b>1</b>, a curved portion <b>4</b> is formed, which curved portion <b>4</b> has a concave contact surface <b>5</b> which is directed downward in the example shown. Following on from the curved portion <b>4</b>, an end portion <b>6</b> is formed which is intended for fitting a pneumatic spring thereto. The illustrated trailing arm <b>1</b> has a shape which is referred to in the field as &#x201c;gooseneck&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The spring portion <b>2</b> of this arm <b>1</b> has a substantially rectangular cross section having a width and a thickness, the width being greater than the thickness. The spring portion <b>2</b> may be produced by rolling, but could also be produced by forging. The curved portion <b>4</b> is preferably produced by forging.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this case, four bore holes <b>7</b> are provided in the curved portion <b>4</b> which serve to insert clamping bolts. The bore holes <b>7</b> are recessed with respect to the top surface of the curved portion.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows how an axle body <b>10</b> which is designed as a relatively thin-walled, substantially round tube is clamped against the trailing arm <b>1</b>. Such a tubular axle body has, for example, an outer diameter of 146 mm and a wall thickness which is between 7 and 9 mm. Such an axle body can be deformed in the radial direction relatively easily.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that the axle clamping arrangement here comprises a support part <b>20</b>, as is preferred in combination with a hollow axle body. The support part <b>20</b> has a recess <b>21</b> in which a part of the axle body <b>10</b> is accommodated. In the fitted position, a part of the periphery of the axle body <b>10</b> is clamped against the inner wall <b>22</b> of the recess <b>21</b>, which inner wall <b>22</b> is complementary with the outer contour of the axle body <b>10</b>. The support part <b>20</b> is clamped against the underside of the axle body <b>10</b> by means of bolts <b>23</b>, having a bolt head <b>23</b><i>a </i>and a bolt shank <b>23</b><i>b</i>, which are inserted into bore holes <b>7</b> in the trailing arm <b>1</b>, and by means of nuts <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As can clearly be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, more than 180&#xb0; of the periphery of the axle body <b>10</b> bears against the inner wall <b>22</b> of the support part <b>20</b>. The inner wall <b>22</b> of the support part <b>20</b> and the contact surface <b>5</b> of the curved portion <b>4</b> of the trailing arm <b>1</b> surround virtually the entire periphery of the axle body <b>10</b>, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> clearly illustrates. This is advantageous when clamping relatively thin-walled axles since the load is omnidirectional, as a result of which the axle body <b>10</b> remains round at the location of the clamping arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In this example, the curved portion <b>4</b> of the trailing arm <b>1</b> is wider than the spring portion <b>2</b>. The width of the spring portion <b>2</b> is such that the rolling motion of the vehicle can be withstood. The curved portion <b>4</b> is wider, resulting in a lower surface pressure on the axle body, in particular when absorbing transverse forces. The round hollow axles can be clamped directly against the trailing arm, without the use of an axle pad or another fitting piece. It is known from the prior art to arrange an axle pad between the axle and the trailing arm, which axle pad is arranged in a fitting manner against the axle body on that side which is turned towards the axle and is arranged in a fitting manner against the trailing arm on that side which is turned towards the trailing arm.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the context of the first aspect of the invention, however, provision is made for a so-called galvanized plate to be fitted between the axle body and the trailing arm. This relatively thin galvanized plate offers cathodic protection against stress corrosion of the trailing arm, but does not serve any purpose in connection with arranging the axle body and the trailing arm together in a fitting manner.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a possible embodiment of the front clamping bolts <b>23</b>. The bolt heads <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the front clamping bolts <b>23</b> are provided with securing lips <b>25</b> to which a shock absorber <b>26</b> is hingedly attached. The securing lips <b>25</b> extend from the bolt head <b>23</b><i>a </i>upwards and to the front at an angle. It is also possible for a single bolt head to be provided with several lips or with a fork, for example in order to arrange the eye of a shock absorber therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The axle body <b>10</b> is preferably locked against rotation with respect to the trailing arm <b>1</b>. In theory, there are several options for locking. Preferably, locking is effected by providing a recess or depression in the contact surface <b>5</b> and to provide a projection on the axle body <b>10</b>, for example in the form of a welded-on spline <b>11</b>, as is illustrated in NL1022395. In addition to locking against a movement of the axle with respect to the trailing arm resulting from the action of torsional forces, for example due to the wheels of the vehicle braking, the projection and the recess furthermore also form a positioning means for axially correctly positioning the axle in the correct manner during assembly. Another possibility of locking against rotation is to provide a projection, for example in the form of a segment of a sphere, on the contact surface <b>5</b>. The axle may be provided with a recess or depression as is illustrated in EP 1 334 848 in the name of Schmitz Cargobull AG.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition to the possibility of locking the axle body <b>10</b> with respect to the trailing arm, an embodiment is also conceivable wherein the axle body <b>10</b> is locked in a similar way with respect to the support part <b>20</b>. A variant involving locking of the axle body <b>10</b> with respect to both the trailing arm and the support part is also possible. The same applies to the embodiments which have been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a wheel axle suspension for suspending a round hollow axle <b>10</b> from a vehicle. The wheel axle suspension comprises on both sides of the vehicle a trailing arm <b>41</b> which extends in the longitudinal direction and to which the axle <b>10</b> is attached. The trailing arm <b>41</b> is hingedly connected at the front, viewed in the direction of travel of the vehicle, to a bearing bracket <b>42</b> which is arranged on the underside of the vehicle chassis <b>43</b>. At the rear, a pneumatic spring <b>44</b> is fitted between the trailing arm <b>41</b> and the chassis <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the assembled state, the axle body <b>10</b> bears directly against a contact region <b>45</b> of the trailing arm <b>41</b>. The shape of the contact region <b>41</b> is essentially complementary to the outer contour of the axle body <b>10</b>. On the side of the axle body <b>10</b> which is turned away from the contact region <b>45</b> of the trailing arm <b>41</b>, a support part <b>46</b> is present which is provided with a recess for accommodating the axle <b>10</b>. The trailing arm and the support part <b>46</b> are clamped against the axle body <b>10</b> by means of clamping bolts <b>47</b> and nuts <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In this example, the front clamping bolts <b>47</b> are provided on their bolt heads with a securing lip <b>49</b> to which an end of a shock absorber <b>401</b> is attached. The other end of the shock absorber <b>401</b> is connected to the bearing bracket <b>42</b> or directly to the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">On the support part <b>46</b>, an additional arm <b>461</b> is fitted which extends to the front and upwards at an angle from the support part <b>46</b> and is connected to the trailing arm <b>41</b> on the end which is turned away from the support part. The connection between the additional arm <b>461</b> and the trailing arm <b>41</b> serves to reduce the load on the trailing arm <b>41</b>. The additional arm <b>461</b> can be designed as a spring.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of a trailing arm. On the front end which is to be fitted to the bearing bracket, the trailing arm <b>51</b> has a securing eye <b>53</b>, by means of which the trailing arm <b>51</b> can be attached to the bearing bracket by means of a hinge bolt. The trailing arm <b>51</b> has a spring portion <b>52</b>. Adjacent to the spring portion <b>52</b> of the trailing arm <b>51</b>, a curved portion <b>54</b> is formed, which curved portion <b>54</b> has a concave contact surface <b>55</b> which is facing upwards in the illustrated example. The curved portion <b>54</b> tapers towards the spring portion in the width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> furthermore shows a support part <b>56</b> which is positioned opposite the curved portion and has an axle recess <b>57</b> for accommodating a part of the periphery of the axle body.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">For the sake of clarity of the drawing, the axle body has been omitted in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the fitted position, a part of the periphery of the axle body bears against the inner wall <b>58</b> of the recess <b>57</b>, which inner wall <b>58</b> is complementary to the outer contour of the axle body. The support part <b>56</b> is clamped against the top side of the axle body by means of bolts (not illustrated). To this end, the support part is provided with securing holes <b>561</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As can clearly be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, more than 180&#xb0; of the periphery of the axle body lies against the inner wall <b>58</b> of the support part <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In this example, the inner wall <b>58</b> of the support part <b>56</b> and the contact surface <b>55</b> of the curved portion <b>54</b> of the trailing arm <b>51</b> surround virtually the entire periphery of the axle body <b>10</b>, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> clearly shows. This is advantageous when clamping relatively thin-walled axles since the load is then omnidirectional, as a result of which the axle body <b>10</b> remains round at the location of the clamp. Incidentally, it is also conceivable for the curved portion of the trailing arm to surround the periphery of the axle body over more than 180&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The support part <b>56</b> is provided with a securing arm <b>59</b>, which in this case is integrally formed with the support part, which arm <b>59</b>, in the fitted position, extends from the support part <b>56</b> to the rear. The securing arm <b>59</b> is designed so that the underside of a pneumatic spring (not shown) can be fitted thereto. The top side of the pneumatic spring is attached to the vehicle chassis. Thus, the pneumatic spring in this case acts on the hingedly connected trailing arm <b>51</b> via the support part <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In this example, the support part <b>56</b> is provided with two securing lips <b>562</b> at the top side which extend upwards and to the front at an angle. In the fitted position, a securing eye of a shock absorber is arranged between the securing lips <b>562</b>, which securing eye is hingedly connected to the securing lips <b>562</b> by means of a bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">It is also possible to omit the securing lips <b>562</b> and instead use, for example, the bolts <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and having a bolt head <b>23</b><i>a </i>which is provided with a securing lip <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In practice, axle bodies with different outer diameters are used. Thus, trailers often use an axle body with an outer diameter of 146 mm, while lorries for example use an axle tube of 127 mm. As has been described above, according to one aspect of the invention, the curved portion <b>54</b> with the concave contact surface <b>55</b> of the trailing arm <b>51</b> may be designed to bear directly against an axle body having a specific diameter, for example 146 mm or 127 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">According to one aspect of the invention, the trailing arm <b>51</b> is produced for a large outer diameter of a first axle body, for example 146 mm, and can then also be used for a second axle body having a smaller diameter, for example 127 mm. According to one aspect of the invention, this becomes possible by arranging a shell part <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) between the curved portion and the second axle body, which shell part <b>60</b> has an inner contact surface <b>61</b> having an inner diameter which corresponds to the outer diameter of the second axle body, and has an outer contact surface <b>62</b> having an outer diameter which can be arranged in a fitting manner against the contact surface <b>55</b> of the curved portion <b>54</b> of the trailing arm <b>51</b>, which corresponds to the first axle body.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The shell part <b>60</b> is preferably produced by casting. According to this aspect of the invention, it is also possible for the support part <b>56</b> to be provided with a recess <b>57</b> which is adapted to the outer diameter of the axle body.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In one possible embodiment, the contact surface <b>55</b> of the curved portion <b>54</b> of the trailing arm <b>51</b> is adapted to an axle tube having an outer diameter of 146 mm. In the curved portion <b>54</b>, the outer contact surface <b>61</b> of a shell part <b>60</b> is arranged against the contact surface <b>55</b> of the curved portion <b>54</b> of the trailing arm <b>51</b>, which shell part <b>60</b> has an inner contact surface <b>61</b> having an inner diameter of 127 mm. The associated support part <b>56</b> has a recess <b>57</b> with an inner diameter of 127 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In addition to the recess <b>57</b>, it is also possible for the shape and length of the arm <b>59</b> of the support part <b>56</b> to be adapted to the specific variant of the wheel axle suspension. In this manner, a universal trailing arm <b>51</b> can be produced which is suitable for various variant embodiments of wheel axle suspensions, whereas one specific support part <b>56</b> is produced for each variant embodiment. This makes it possible to produce the trailing arm <b>51</b> in large numbers which reduces the production costs per trailing arm as the production line only has to be designed to manufacture one single trailing arm <b>51</b>. This is particularly advantageous if the trailing arm <b>51</b> is produced by means of relatively expensive processing steps, such as rolling and/or forging, which will, according to the invention, often be the case when producing flexible trailing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The support part <b>56</b> is preferably produced in several variants, depending on the variant embodiments, in particular diameters, of the specific wheel axle suspensions.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Preferably, the support part <b>56</b> with the integrally formed arm <b>59</b> is produced by forging or casting, in which case it should be pointed out that casting is less expensive than forging in the case of relatively small production numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">With the embodiment from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a locking against rotation is preferably provided between the support part <b>56</b> and the axle body, in particular when a shell part <b>60</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a part of another embodiment of a wheel axle suspension according to the invention. The wheel axle suspension comprises a trailing arm <b>71</b> which is similar to the trailing arm <b>51</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At the end which is to be fitted to the front, the trailing arm <b>71</b> has a securing eye <b>73</b> with which the trailing arm <b>71</b> can be attached to a bearing bracket by means of a hinge bolt. The trailing arm <b>71</b> has a spring portion <b>72</b>. Adjacent to the spring portion <b>72</b> of the trailing arm <b>71</b>, a curved portion <b>74</b> is formed, which curved portion <b>74</b> has an upwardly directed concave contact surface <b>75</b>. The curved portion <b>74</b> here has a greater width than the spring portion <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> furthermore shows a support part <b>76</b> which is positioned opposite the curved portion and has an axle recess <b>77</b> for accommodating a part of the periphery of the axle body <b>10</b>. In the fitted position, a part of the periphery of the axle body <b>10</b> is clamped against the inner wall <b>78</b> of the recess <b>77</b>, which inner wall <b>78</b> is complementary to the outer contour of the axle body.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In this example, the support part <b>76</b> is clamped against the top side of the axle body <b>10</b> by means of U-shaped clamping straps <b>80</b>. In this example, the top side of the support part <b>76</b> is provided with clamp recesses <b>79</b> which extend essentially in the transverse direction and at least partially accommodate the bend of the U shape. The downwardly extending legs of the clamping straps <b>80</b> are situated along the sides of the support part <b>76</b>. Using clamping straps <b>80</b> instead of bolts (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>) has the advantage that the stretch length increases and the loss of prestress is prevented more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A separate absorber securing part <b>90</b> is clamped at the front of the axle body <b>10</b>, between the front end of the support part <b>76</b>, that is to say where the front clamping strap <b>80</b> surrounds the support part <b>76</b>, and the trailing arm <b>71</b>, at the location of the transition between the spring portion <b>72</b> thereof and the curved portion <b>74</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In this example, the absorber securing part <b>90</b> has a rear concave surface <b>91</b> which, in the fitted position, bears against the axle body <b>10</b>. In this example, the absorber securing part <b>90</b> has a few through-holes through which the legs of the front U-shaped clamping strap <b>79</b> extend. When the nuts <b>81</b> on the legs of the clamping straps <b>80</b> are tightened, the absorber securing part <b>90</b> is clamped securely.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, approximately 180&#xb0; of the periphery of the axle body <b>10</b> bears against the inner wall <b>78</b> of the support part <b>76</b>. The inner wall <b>78</b> of the support part <b>76</b>, that part of the absorber securing part <b>90</b> which is turned towards the axle body <b>10</b>, and the contact surface <b>75</b> of the curved portion <b>74</b> of the trailing arm <b>71</b> surround virtually the entire periphery of the axle body <b>10</b>, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> clearly shows. This is advantageous when clamping relatively thin-walled axles, since the load is then omnidirectional, as a result of which the axle body <b>10</b> remains round at the location of the clamping arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In this example, the front of the absorber securing part <b>90</b> is provided with two securing lips <b>82</b> which extend upwards and to the front at an angle. Each securing lip <b>82</b> is provided with a bore hole <b>83</b> through which a bolt (not shown) extends in the fitted position. In the fitted position, a securing eye of a shock absorber is situated between the securing lips <b>82</b>, which securing eye is hingedly connected to the securing lips <b>82</b> by means of said bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Similar to the support part <b>56</b>, the support part <b>76</b> is provided with a securing arm <b>769</b>, which extends from the support part <b>76</b> to the rear in the fitted position. The securing arm <b>769</b> is designed so that the underside of a pneumatic spring (not shown) can be fitted thereto. The top side of the pneumatic spring is attached to the vehicle chassis. Thus, the pneumatic spring in this case acts on the hingedly connected trailing arm <b>71</b> via the support part <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The embodiment from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also offers the possibility of using a shell part <b>60</b>, as has been described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a variant of the wheel axle suspension from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The wheel axle suspension comprises a trailing arm <b>51</b> which substantially corresponds to the trailing arm <b>51</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and has already been described above. The support part <b>56</b> is connected to the curved portion <b>54</b> by means of bolts. An extension bush <b>91</b> is in each case placed on the support part <b>56</b>, above the front securing holes <b>561</b>. The front bolts <b>92</b> extend through this extension bush <b>91</b> and, in the fitted position, the bolt head <b>92</b><i>a </i>is on the end side on the top side of the extension bush <b>91</b>. Preferably, that side of the extension bush <b>91</b> which is turned to the front (viewed in the direction of travel of the vehicle) is provided with a securing lip <b>93</b> having a bore hole <b>94</b>. In the fitted position, a hinge bolt is inserted into bore hole <b>94</b> in order to hingedly attach an eye of a shock absorber to the lips <b>93</b>. The use of an extension bush <b>91</b> means that bolts <b>92</b> having a longer bolt length have to be used, which offers the advantage that the stretch length increases and the loss of prestress is prevented more effectively. An extension bush could also be used with the rear clamping bolts, which would mean that longer bolts would have to be used there as well and the stretch length increases. An extension bush <b>91</b> can, if desired, also be designed without an absorber securing lip <b>93</b> in order to achieve that advantage, which is regarded as a further aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows two views of a trailing arm <b>110</b> according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows a top view of a spring trailing arm <b>110</b> comprising a securing eye <b>111</b>, a curved portion which forms the contact region <b>112</b> which can accommodate the axle clamp, and a spring portion <b>113</b> between these two parts. In the fitted position, the securing eye <b>111</b> is attached to a bearing bracket (not shown). The securing eye <b>111</b> is at the front of the trailing arm <b>110</b> and the portion which forms the contact region <b>112</b> is situated, in this example, at the rear of the trailing arm <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Holes are provided on both sides of the contact region <b>112</b>. Two holes <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> at the front of the contact region <b>112</b>, and one hole <b>122</b> at the rear of the contact region <b>112</b>. Clamping bolts or the shanks of U-shaped clamping straps are inserted through these holes <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> in order to clamp the trailing arm <b>110</b> to an axle body (not shown). Other clamping means are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">This example clearly shows that the trailing arm <b>110</b>, at the location of the contact region <b>112</b>, is wider at the front of the contact region <b>112</b> than in the region which is situated in front thereof (in the direction of the securing eye <b>111</b>) and the rear of the contact region <b>112</b> of the trailing arm <b>110</b>. This measure creates a large contact surface in the area where the load is highest, i.e. at the front of the contact region, using a minimal amount of material, so that the axle body is not undesirably deformed as a result of being clamped.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In this example, depressions <b>125</b>, <b>126</b> have also been provided on the outside of that portion of the trailing arm which forms the contact region <b>112</b>, with depression <b>125</b> extending from hole <b>120</b> in the direction of hole <b>122</b>, and depression <b>126</b> extending from hole <b>121</b> in the direction of hole <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As can be seen, that portion of the trailing arm which forms the axle clamping has, on that side which is turned away from the axle body, a central rib <b>124</b> which extends from the front of the contact region, between the two holes <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> on said front, in the direction of the single hole <b>122</b> at the rear of the contact region. On either side of this central rib <b>124</b>, there are depressions <b>125</b>, <b>126</b>, wherein in each case one of the holes at the front is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">As is preferred, a further rib <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>is provided along each side edge of the respective portion and delimits the depression on that side.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The embodiment which has been illustrated and described above provides a saving on material while the portion which forms the contact region <b>112</b> is sufficiently strong.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In this exemplary embodiment, flat surface portions <b>127</b>-<b>129</b> are provided round the holes <b>120</b>-<b>122</b>. This make it possible for a bolt head or nut to bear against the trailing arm <b>110</b> in a neat manner and to transfer the clamping forces onto the trailing arm <b>110</b> in an effective manner at relatively low peak stresses. In one variant, it is possible to select the dimensions of the holes and associated clamping means (clamping bolts or straps) in such a manner that clamping of the axle body leads to uniform stresses in the clamping means.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows the spring trailing arm <b>110</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> in side view. The two views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> together, clearly show that the trailing arm has a portion <b>114</b> which is adjacent to the eye <b>111</b> and has a substantially round cross section. If the trailing arm <b>110</b> is now subjected to a torsional load, this results in virtually uniform deformations and stresses along the periphery of the portion <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">It is also possible to twist the arm <b>110</b> in the region <b>114</b> during production of the trailing arm in order to adjust the position of the eye <b>111</b> to that required for fitting the trailing arm in the wheel axle suspension. No significant change in shape of the portion <b>114</b> can be observed during this twisting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">It is possible for the securing eye <b>111</b> to be formed in a different position during a manufacturing process, such as forging, after which it is, for example, turned by a quarter turn to a desired position and thus assumes the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. In this context, see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. The advantage thereof is that this makes it easier to form the securing eye <b>111</b> during the manufacturing process, in other words fewer forming steps or less complicated forming steps are required, following which the arm <b>110</b> only has to be twisted locally.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">It is possible to produce the trailing arm <b>110</b> in a single operation by forging. Preferably, the eye is also forged and this may render finishing of the hole of the eye <b>111</b> superfluous.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Preferably, the eye <b>111</b> is forged in such a manner that after forging the eye has a closed annular body portion surrounding the hole of the eye, resulting in an eye of great strength.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">It should be noted that, for example, a trailing arm <b>51</b> which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can also be formed by forging. In this case, only the hole in the eye <b>53</b> which is at right angles to the direction of the forging direction (from top to bottom), has to be provided by a finishing operation, for example boring.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Between portion <b>114</b> and the portion which forms the contact region <b>112</b>, the spring portion <b>113</b> is present, which in this example has a substantially rectangular cross section. As a result, the trailing arm <b>110</b> has different stiffnesses in different directions, which is advantageous, for example, if the trailing arm <b>110</b> is also subjected to transverse loads.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In this example, portion <b>114</b> merges smoothly with the spring portion having the substantially rectangular cross section. This prevents peak stresses in the material.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The shape of the trailing arm <b>110</b> is such that it can be produced in its entirety by forging. Mainly the portion which forms the contact region <b>112</b>, the front portion <b>114</b> and the securing eye <b>111</b> are pre-eminently suitable to be formed by forging and are a good example of the additional freedom of design for each portion of the arm compared to the prior-art spring trailing arms which are produced only by means of rolling.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a bearing bracket <b>130</b> which is connected by means of bolt/nut connections to vehicle chassis <b>131</b>, in this case a longitudinal member of the chassis. In this example, the bearing bracket consists of two plates, each of which is connected to the longitudinal member by means of bolt/nut connections <b>132</b>. In addition, part of an absorber <b>135</b> which is known per se can be seen, which usually has a telescopic body with a securing eye <b>136</b> at each end. The absorber securing part <b>140</b> is made of metal and has one or more lips or a fork <b>141</b> for attaching the eye of the absorber. Said one or more lips may be at an angle, for example approximately in line with the axis of the absorber. The securing part <b>140</b> furthermore has an integral bolt shank <b>142</b>, in this example a single bolt shank, as is preferred. An opening has been drilled in the vehicle chassis, in this case close to the bearing bracket, through which the bolt shank extends. A nut <b>143</b> is screwed onto the bolt shank. The advantage is now that the forces are passed directly to the vehicle chassis by the shock absorber, resulting in less stringent requirements being placed on the bearing bracket and thus leading to an improved design.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a front portion <b>154</b> of a trailing arm <b>150</b>, a securing eye <b>151</b> being attached to the front potion <b>154</b>. The front portion <b>154</b> preferably has a substantially round cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Eye <b>151</b> is now in the pre-forming position, that is to say the position in which eye <b>151</b> is formed. Forming has in this case taken place from the top downwards, preferably by means of a forging device.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">After the eye <b>151</b> has been formed, eye <b>151</b> can still be rotated into a desired position. An example of a desired position is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, in which arrow T indicates the rotation of the eye <b>151</b>. The rotation of the eye <b>151</b> has been carried out by twisting the trailing arm in the adjacent front portion <b>154</b>. In this example, the eye <b>151</b> is rotated a quarter turn, but other rotations between 1&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;, for example 45&#xb0;, are also possible. It is also possible to rotate the eye by more than 90&#xb0;, for example by 120&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">As a result of the round cross section of the front portion <b>154</b>, no or hardly any change in shape can be seen after twisting. Twisting could also take place in a front portion having a different cross section, for example a rectangular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">It should be noted that the invention is not limited to the specific examples illustrated in the drawing. The person skilled in the art will easily be able to think of variations and combinations of elements from the different exemplary embodiments illustrated and these are deemed to fall within the scope of the invention.</p>
