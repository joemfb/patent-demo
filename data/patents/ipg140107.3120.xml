No. 61/059,199, filed Jun. 5, 2008, and United Kingdom Patent Application No. GB 0820308.5, filed Nov. 6 2008. The entire contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mass spectrometer and a method of mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer is preferably arranged for charge reduction or charge stripping of Electron Transfer Dissociation (&#x201c;ETD&#x201d;) product or fragment ions via Proton Transfer Reactions (&#x201c;PTR&#x201d;) with gaseous neutral superbase reagents.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrospray ionisation ion sources are well known and may be used to convert neutral peptides eluting from an HPLC column into gas-phase analyte ions. In an aqueous acidic solution, tryptic peptides will be ionised on both the amino terminus and the side chain of the C-terminal amino acid. As the peptide ions proceed to enter a mass Spectrometer the positively charged amino groups hydrogen bond and transfer protons to the amide groups along the backbone of the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to fragment peptide ions by increasing the internal energy of the peptide ions through collisions with a collision gas. The internal energy of the peptide ions is increased until the internal energy exceeds the activation energy necessary to cleave the amide linkages along the backbone of the molecule. This process of fragmenting ions by collisions with a neutral collision gas is commonly referred to as Collision Induced Dissociation (&#x201c;CID&#x201d;). The fragment ions which result from Collision Induced Dissociation are commonly referred to as b-type and y-type fragment or product ions, wherein b-type fragment ions contain the amino terminus plus one or more amino acid residues and y-type fragment ions contain the carboxyl terminus plus one or more amino acid residues.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other methods of fragmenting peptides are known. An alternative method of fragmenting peptide ions is to interact the peptide ions with thermal electrons by a process known as Electron Capture Dissociation (&#x201c;ECD&#x201d;). Electron Capture Dissociation cleaves the peptide in a substantially different manner to the fragmentation process which is observed with Collision Induced Dissociation. In particular, Electron Capture Dissociation cleaves the backbone N&#x2014;C<sub>&#x3b1;</sub> bond or the amine bond and the resulting fragment ions which are produced are commonly referred to as c-type and z-type fragment or product ions. Electron Capture Dissociation is believed to be non-ergodic i.e. cleavage occurs before the transferred energy is distributed over the entire molecule. Electron Capture Dissociation also occurs with a lesser dependence on the nature of the neighbouring amino acid and only the N-side of proline is 100% resistive to Electron Capture Dissociation cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One advantage of fragmenting peptide ions by Electron Capture Dissociation rather than by Collision Induced Dissociation is that Collision Induced Dissociation suffers from a propensity to cleave Post Translational Modifications (&#x201c;PTMs&#x201d;) making it difficult to identify the site of modification. By contrast, fragmenting peptide ions by Electron Capture Dissociation tends to preserve Post Translational Modifications arising from, for example, phosphorylation and glycosylation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the technique of Electron Capture Dissociation suffers from the significant problem that it is necessary simultaneously to confine both positive ions and electrons at near thermal kinetic energies. Electron Capture Dissociation has been demonstrated using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (&#x201c;FT-ICR&#x201d;) mass analysers which use a superconducting magnet to generate large magnetic fields. However, such mass spectrometers are very large and are prohibitively expensive for the majority of mass spectrometry users.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As an alternative to Electron Capture Dissociation it has been demonstrated that it is possible to fragment peptide ions by reacting negatively charged reagent ions with multiply charged analyte cations in a linear ion trap. The process of reacting positively charged analyte ions with negatively charged reagent ions has been referred to as Electron Transfer Dissociation (&#x201c;ETD&#x201d;). Electron Transfer Dissociation is a mechanism wherein electrons are transferred from negatively charged reagent ions to positively charged analyte ions. After electron transfer, the charge-reduced peptide or analyte ion dissociates through the same mechanisms which are believed to be responsible for fragmentation by Electron Capture Dissociation i.e. it is believed that Electron Transfer Dissociation cleaves the amine bond in a similar manner to Electron Capture Dissociation. As a result, the product or fragment ions which are produced by Electron Transfer Dissociation of peptide analyte ions comprise mostly c-type and z-type fragment or product ions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One particular advantage of Electron Transfer Dissociation is that such a process is particularly suited for the identification of post-translational modifications (&#x201c;PTMs&#x201d;) since weakly bonded PTMs like phosphorylation or glycosylation will survive the electron induced fragmentation of the backbone of the amino acid chain.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is known to perform Electron Transfer Dissociation by mutually confining cations and anions in a 2D linear ion trap which is arranged to promote ion-ion reactions between reagent anions and analyte cations. The cations and anions are simultaneously trapped within the 2D linear ion trap by applying an auxiliary axially confining RF pseudo-potential barrier at both ends of the 2D linear quadrupole ion trap.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another method of performing Electron Transfer Dissociation is known wherein a fixed DC axial potential is applied at both ends of a 2D linear quadrupole ion trap in order to confine ions having a certain polarity (e.g. reagent anions) within the ion trap. Ions having an opposite polarity (e.g. analyte cations) to those confined within the ion trap are then directed into the ion trap. The analyte cations will react with the reagent anions already confined within the ion trap.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is known that when multiply charged (analyte) cations are mixed with (reagent) anions then loosely bound electrons may be transferred from the (reagent) anions to the multiply charged (analyte) cations. Energy is released into the multiply charged cations and the multiply charged cations may be caused to dissociate. However, some of the (analyte) cations may not dissociate but may instead be reduced in charge state. The cations may be reduced in charge by one of two processes. Firstly, the cations may be reduced in charge by Electron Transfer (&#x201c;ET&#x201d;) of electrons from the anions to the cations. Secondly, the cations may be reduced in charge by Proton Transfer (&#x201c;PT&#x201d;) of protons from the cations to the anions. Irrespective of the process, an abundance of charged reduced product ions are observed within mass spectra and give an indication of the degree of ion-ion reactions (either ET or PT) that are occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In bottom-up or top-down proteomics Electron Transfer Dissociation experiments may be performed in order to maximize the information available by maximizing the abundance of dissociated product ions within mass spectra. The degree of Electron Transfer Dissociation fragmentation depends upon the conformation of the cations (and anions) together with many other instrumental factors. It can be difficult to know a priori the optimal parameters for every anion-cation combination from an LC run.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One problem with known Electron Transfer Dissociation arrangements is that the fragment or product ions resulting from the Electron Transfer Dissociation process tend to be multiply charged and tend also to have relatively high charge states. This is problematic since highly charged fragment or product ions can be hard for a mass spectrometer to resolve. The parent or analyte ions which are fragmented by Electron Transfer Dissociation may, for example, have a charge state of 5<sup>+</sup>, 6<sup>+</sup>, 7<sup>+</sup>, 8<sup>+</sup>, 9<sup>+</sup>, 10<sup>+</sup> or higher and the resulting fragment or product ions may, for example, have a charge state of 4<sup>+</sup>, 5<sup>+</sup>, 6<sup>+</sup>, 7<sup>+</sup>, 8<sup>+</sup>, 9<sup>+</sup> or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is desired to address the problem of ETD product or fragment ions having relatively high charge states which is problematic for a mass spectrometer to resolve.</p>

The product or fragment ions are preferably reacted with the superbase reagent gas in a gas phase collision cell of a mass spectrometer. The superbase reagent gas preferably has the effect of reducing the charge state of the product or fragment ions. This is particularly advantageous in that reducing the charge state of the product or fragment ions has the effect of significantly simplifying and improving the quality of resulting product or fragment ion mass spectral data. In particular, the spectral capacity or spectral density of the mass spectral data is significantly improved. Lowering the charge state of the product or fragment ions preferably reduces the mass resolution requirements of the mass spectrometer since less resolving power is needed to determine the product ion charge states and hence the product ion masses or mass to charge ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Another advantageous feature of the preferred embodiment is that by reducing the charge state of the product or fragment ions, the product or fragment ions become distributed at higher mass to charge ratio values in the resulting mass spectrum with the result that there is a greater degree of separation on the mass or mass to charge ratio scale thereby improving mass resolution and spectral density hence identification of the product or fragment ions.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The use of non-ionic or neutral reagent vapours to perform charge reduction of the product or fragment ions by Proton Transfer Reaction is also particularly advantageous since a reagent ion source is not required in order to perform the PTR charge reduction process. Furthermore, the use of a neutral reagent gas as opposed to reagent ions in order to reduce the charge of the product or fragment ions eliminates any difficulties associated with reagent ion transfer and containment of reagent ions within the RF fields of a collision cell.</p>

The resulting ETD product or fragment ions preferably emerge from the ETD device and are preferably temporally separated as they are transmitted through an ion mobility separator or spectrometer. The ETD product or fragment ions are then preferably passed to a PTR device according to the preferred embodiment wherein the ETD product or fragment ions are preferably reduced in charge state within the PTR device by interacting with the neutral reagent gas.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The ETD device and/or the PTR device according to the preferred embodiment may comprise two adjacent ion tunnel sections. The electrodes in the first ion tunnel section may have a first internal diameter and the electrodes in the second section may have a second different internal diameter (which according to an embodiment may be smaller or larger than the first internal diameter). The first and/or second ion tunnel sections may be inclined to or may otherwise be arranged off-axis from the general central longitudinal axis of the mass spectrometer. This allows ions to be separated from neutral particles which will continue to move linearly through the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Different species of cations and/or reagent ions may be input into the ETD device from opposite ends of the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The mass spectrometer may comprise a dual mode ion source or a twin ion source. For example, an Electrospray ion source may be used to generate positive analyte ions and an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation ion source may be used to generate negative reagent ions which are transferred to the ETD device in order to fragment the analyte ions by ETD. Alternative embodiments are also contemplated wherein a single ion source such as an Electrospray ion source, an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation ion source or a Glow Discharge ion source may be used to generate analyte ions and/or reagent ions which are then transferred to the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">At least some multiply charged analyte cations are preferably caused to interact with at least some reagent ions within the ETD device wherein at least some electrons are preferably transferred from the reagent anions to at least some of the multiply charged analyte cations whereupon at least some of the multiply charged analyte cations are preferably induced to dissociate to form ETD product or fragment ions within the ETD device. The resulting ETD product or fragment ions tend to have a relatively high charge state which is problematic since the resolution of the mass analyser may be insufficient to resolve the ETD product or fragment ions having a relatively high charge state.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The preferred embodiment relates to an ion-neutral gas reaction device or PTR device which is preferably arranged to reduce the charge state of the ETD product or fragment ions. According to less preferred embodiments the PTR device may be arranged to reduce the charge state of product or fragment ions resulting from a fragmentation process other than ETD. The PTR device may also be arranged to reduce the charge state of parent or analyte ions having a relatively high charge state. The PTR device according to the preferred embodiment comprises a plurality of electrodes wherein one or more travelling wave or electrostatic fields may be preferably applied to the electrodes of the RF ion guide which preferably forms the PTR device. The RF ion guide preferably comprises a plurality of electrodes having apertures through which ions are transmitted in use. The one or more travelling wave or electrostatic fields preferably comprise one or more transient DC voltages or potentials or one or more transient DC voltage or potential waveforms which are preferably applied to the electrodes of the ion guide forming the preferred PTR device.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">According to an embodiment the mass spectrometer may be arranged to spatially manipulate ions having opposing charges in order to facilitate and preferably maximise, optimise or minimise ion-ion reactions within an ETD device which is preferably arranged upstream of the preferred PTR device. The mass spectrometer is preferably arranged and adapted to perform Electron Transfer Dissociation (&#x201c;ETD&#x201d;) fragmentation and/or Proton Transfer Reaction (&#x201c;PTR&#x201d;) charge state reduction of ions.</p>

The negatively charged reagent ions may, for example, be transmitted into the ETD device by applying a DC travelling wave or one or more transient DC voltages or potentials to the electrodes forming the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Once reagent anions (or neutral reagent gas) has been loaded into the ETD device, multiply charged analyte cations may then be driven or urged through or into the ETD device preferably by means of one or more subsequent or separate DC travelling waves. The one or more DC travelling waves are preferably applied to the electrodes of the ETD device. Reagent ions are preferably retained within the ETD device by applying a negative potential at one or both ends of the ion guide.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The one or more DC travelling waves applied to the ETD device preferably comprise one or more transient DC voltages or potentials or one or more transient DC voltage or potential waveforms which preferably cause ions to be translated or urged along at least a portion of the axial length of the ETD device. Ions are therefore effectively translated along the length of the ETD device by one or more real or DC potential barriers which are preferably applied sequentially to electrodes along the length of the ETD device. As a result, positively charged analyte ions trapped between DC potential barriers are preferably translated along the length of the ETD device and are preferably driven or urged through and into close proximity with negatively charged reagent ions (or neutral reagent gas) which is preferably already present in or within the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Optimum conditions for ion-ion reactions and/or ion-neutral gas reactions can be achieved within the ETD device by varying the speed, velocity or amplitude of the DC travelling wave. The kinetic energies of the reagent anions (or reagent gas) and the analyte cations can be closely matched. The residence time of ETD product or fragment ions resulting from the Electron Transfer Dissociation process can be carefully controlled so that the ETD fragment or product ions are not then duly neutralised. If positively charged ETD fragment or product ions resulting from the Electron Transfer Dissociation process are allowed to remain for too long in the ETD device after they have been formed, then they are likely to be neutralised.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">A negative potential or potential barrier may optionally be applied at the front (e.g. upstream) end and also at the rear (e.g. downstream) end of the ETD device. The negative potential or potential barrier preferably acts to confine negatively charged reagent ions within the ETD device whilst at the same time allowing or causing positively charged product or fragment ions which are created within the ETD device to emerge and exit from the ETD device in a relatively fast manner. Other embodiments are also contemplated wherein analyte ions may interact with neutral gas molecules and undergo Electron Transfer Dissociation and/or Proton Transfer Reaction within the ETD device. If neutral reagent gas is provided within the ETD device then a potential barrier may or may not be provided at the ends of the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">A negative potential or potential barrier may be applied only to the front (e.g. upstream) end of the ETD device or alternatively a negative potential or potential barrier may be applied only to the rear (e.g. downstream) end of the ETD device. Other embodiments are contemplated wherein one or more negative potentials or potential barriers may be maintained at different positions along the length of the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">It is also contemplated that positive analyte ions may be retained within the ETD device by one or more positive potentials and then reagent ions or neutral reagent gas may be introduced into the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Two electrostatic travelling waves or DC travelling waves may be applied to the electrodes of the ETD device in a substantially simultaneous manner. The travelling wave electrostatic fields or transient DC voltage waveforms may be arranged to move or translate ions substantially simultaneously in opposite directions towards, for example, a central region of the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The ETD device and the PTR device according to the preferred embodiment preferably comprise a plurality of stacked ring electrodes which are preferably supplied with an AC or RF voltage. The electrodes preferably comprise an aperture through which ions are transmitted in use. Ions are preferably confined radially within the ETD device and within the preferred PTR device by applying opposite phases of the AC or RF voltage to adjacent electrodes so that a radial pseudo-potential barrier is preferably generated. The radial pseudo-potential barrier preferably causes ions to be confined radially along the central longitudinal axis of the ETD device and the preferred PTR device.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Two different analyte samples may be introduced from different ends of the ETD device. Additionally or alternatively, two different species of reagent ions may be introduced into the ETD device from different ends of the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The DC travelling wave parameters (i.e. the parameters of the one or more transient DC voltages or potentials which are applied to the electrodes) can according to the preferred embodiment be optimised to provide control over the relative ion velocity between cations and anions (or analyte cations and neutral reagent gas) in the ETD device and the relative velocity between ETD product or fragment ions and neutral reagent gas molecules in the preferred PTR device. The relative ion velocity between cations and anions or cations and neutral reagent gas in the ETD device is an important parameter that preferably determines the reaction rate constant in Electron Transfer Dissociation experiments. Similarly, the relative velocity between product or fragment ions and neutral reagent gas in the preferred PTR device will also determine the degree to which the charge state of the product or fragment ions is reduced in the PTR device.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Other embodiments are also contemplated wherein the velocity of ion-neutral collisions in either the ETD device and/or the preferred PTR device'can be increased using either a high speed travelling wave or by using a standing or static DC wave. Such collisions can also be used to promote Collision Induced Dissociation (&#x201c;CID&#x201d;). In particular, the product or fragment ions resulting from Electron Transfer Dissociation or Proton Transfer Reaction may form non-covalent bonds. These non-covalent bonds can then be broken by Collision Induced Dissociation. Collision Induced Dissociation may be performed either sequentially in space to the process of Electron Transfer Dissociation in a separate Collision Induced Dissociation cell or in the preferred PTR device and/or sequentially in time to the Electron Transfer Dissociation process in the same ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">ETD reagent ions and analyte ions may be generated by the same ion source or by two or more separate ion sources.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to an embodiment Data Directed Analysis (&#x201c;DDA&#x201d;) may be performed which incorporates real time monitoring of the ratio of the intensities of charge reduced cations or charge reduced analyte ions to the intensity of non-charged reduced parent cations within a product ion spectrum. The ratio may be used to control instrumental parameters that regulate the degree of Electron Transfer Dissociation within the ETD device and/or the degree of charge state reduction of product or fragment ions in the preferred PTR device. As a result, the fragment ion efficiency may be maximised or controlled in real time and on timescales which are comparable with liquid chromatography (LC) peak elution time scales.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Real time feedback control of instrumental parameters may be performed that maximizes or alters the abundance of fragment and/or charge reduced ions based upon the ratio of the abundance of charge reduced analyte cations to parent analyte cations.</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows digital voltage pulses <b>7</b> which are preferably applied to the electrodes <b>1</b> of the ETD device <b>2</b> as a function of time (e.g. as an electronics timing clock progresses). The progressive nature of the application of the digital voltage pulses <b>7</b> to the electrodes <b>1</b> of the ETD device <b>2</b> as a function of time is preferably indicated by arrows <b>6</b>. At a first time T<b>1</b>, the voltage pulses indicated by T<b>1</b> are preferably applied to the electrodes <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The voltage pulses <b>7</b> which are preferably applied to the lens elements or ring electrodes <b>1</b> of the ETD device <b>2</b> preferably comprise square waves. The electric potential within the ETD device <b>2</b> preferably relaxes so that the wave function potential within the ETD device <b>2</b> preferably takes on a smooth function.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">According to an embodiment analyte cations (e.g. positively charged analyte ions) and/or reagent anions (e.g. negatively charged reagent ions) may be simultaneously introduced into the ETD device <b>2</b> from opposite ends of the ETD device <b>2</b>. Once in the ETD device <b>2</b>, positive ions (cations) are repelled by the positive (crest) potentials of the DC travelling wave or the one or more transient DC voltages or potentials which are preferably applied to the electrodes <b>1</b> of the ETD device <b>2</b>.

Cations and anions are preferably simultaneously carried towards the middle of the ETD device <b>2</b>. Less preferred embodiments are contemplated wherein analyte cations may be simultaneously introduced from different ends of the reaction device. According to this less preferred embodiment the analyte ions may be reacted with neutral reagent gas present within the reaction device or which is added subsequently to the reaction device.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Other embodiments are contemplated wherein both analyte cations and reagent anions may be simultaneously translated by a first DC travelling wave <b>8</b> towards the centre (or other region) of the ETD device <b>2</b>. According to this embodiment other analyte cations and/or reagent anions may optionally be translated simultaneously towards the centre (or other region) of the ETD device <b>2</b> by an optional second DC travelling voltage wave <b>9</b>.

As a result, the valleys and peaks of the travelling waves preferably effectively disappear (or are otherwise significantly reduced) in the middle (centre) of the ETD reaction device <b>2</b> so that ions of opposite polarity (or less preferably of the same polarity) are then preferably allowed or caused to merge and interact with each other within the central region of the ETD device <b>2</b>. If any ions stray randomly axially away from the middle or central region of the ETD device <b>2</b> due to, for example, multiple collisions with buffer gas molecules or due to high space charge effects, then these ions will then preferably encounter subsequent travelling DC waves which will preferably have the effect of translating or urging the ions back towards the centre of the ETD device <b>2</b>.</p>

The DC travelling wave amplitude may also be normalised along the length of the ETD device <b>2</b> so that the ETD device <b>2</b> is then effectively operated as a conventional travelling wave ion guide i.e. a single constant amplitude DC travelling voltage wave is provided which moves in a single direction along substantially the whole length of the ETD device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Similarly, in relation to embodiments wherein a single DC travelling voltage wave initially loads reagent anions into the ETD device <b>2</b> and then analyte cations are then subsequently loaded into or transmitted through the ETD device <b>2</b> by the same DC travelling voltage wave, then the single DC travelling voltage wave will also act to extract positively charged ETD fragment or product ions which are created within the ETD device <b>2</b>. The DC travelling voltage wave amplitude may be normalised along the length of the ETD device <b>2</b> once ETD fragment or product ions have been created within the ETD device <b>2</b> so that the ETD device <b>2</b> is then effectively operated as a conventional travelling wave ion guide.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">It has been shown that if ions are translated by a travelling wave field through an ion guide which is maintained at a sufficiently high pressure (e.g. &#x3e;0.1 mbar) then the ions may emerge from the end of the travelling wave ion guide in order of their ion mobility. Ions having relatively high ion mobilities will preferably emerge from the ion guide prior to ions having relatively low ion mobilities. Therefore, further analytical benefits such as improved sensitivity and duty cycle can be provided by exploiting ion mobility separations of the product or fragment ions that are generated in the central region of the ETD device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">According to an embodiment an ion mobility spectrometer or separation stage may be provided upstream and/or downstream of the ETD device <b>2</b>. For example, according to an embodiment ETD product or fragment ions which have been formed within the ETD device <b>2</b> and which have been subsequently extracted from the ETD device <b>2</b> may then be separated according to their ion mobility (or less preferably according to their rate of change of ion mobility with electric field strength) in an ion mobility spectrometer or separator which is preferably arranged downstream of the ETD device <b>2</b> and upstream of a PTR device comprising a neutral reagent gas according to the preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">According to an embodiment the diameters of the internal apertures of the ring electrodes <b>1</b> forming the ETD device <b>2</b> may be arranged to increase progressively with electrode position along the length of the ETD device <b>2</b>. The aperture diameters may be arranged, for example, to be smaller at the entry and exit sections of the ETD device <b>2</b> and to be relatively larger nearer the centre or middle of the ETD, device <b>2</b>. This will have the effect of reducing the amplitude of the DC potential experienced by ions within the central region of the ETD device <b>2</b> whilst the amplitude of the DC voltages applied to the various electrodes <b>1</b> can be kept substantially constant. The travelling wave ion guide potential will therefore be at a minimum in the middle or central region of the ETD device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">According to another embodiment both the ring aperture diameter as well as the amplitude of the transient DC voltages or potentials applied to the electrodes <b>1</b> may be varied along the length of the ETD device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In embodiments wherein the diameter of the aperture of the ring electrodes increases towards the centre of the ETD device <b>2</b>, the RF field near the central axis will also decrease. Advantageously, this will give rise to less RF heating of ions in the central region of the ETD device <b>2</b>. This effect can be particularly beneficial in optimising Electron Transfer Dissociation type reactions and minimising collision induced reactions.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The position of the focal point or reaction region within the ETD device <b>2</b> may be moved or varied axially along the length of the ETD device <b>2</b> as a function of time. This has the advantage in that ions can be arranged to be flowing or passing continuously through the ETD device <b>2</b> without stopping in a central reaction region. This allows a continuous process of introducing analyte ions and reagent ions at the entrance of the ETD device <b>2</b> and ejecting ETD product or fragment ions from the exit of the ETD device <b>2</b> to be achieved. Various parameters such as the speed of translation of the focal point may be varied or controlled in order to optimise, maximise or minimise the ETD ion-ion reaction efficiency. The motion of the focal point can be achieved or controlled electronically in a stepwise fashion by switching or controlling the voltages applied to the appropriate lenses or ring electrodes <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Product or fragment ions resulting from the Electron Transfer Dissociation reaction are preferably arranged to emerge from the exit of the ETD device <b>2</b> and are then transmitted to a PTR device comprising a neutral reagent gas according to the preferred embodiment wherein the product or fragment ions are reduced in charge state. The ions are then onwardly transmitted to, for example, a Time of Flight mass analyser. To enhance the overall sensitivity of the system, the timing of the release of ions from the ETD device <b>2</b> and/or from the preferred PTR device may be synchronised with the pusher electrode of an orthogonal acceleration Time of Flight mass analyser.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">According to an embodiment analyte cations and reagent anions which are input into the ETD device <b>2</b> may be generated from separate or distinct ion sources. In order to efficiently introduce both cations and anions from separate ion sources into an ETD device <b>2</b> a further ion guide may be provided upstream (and/or downstream) of the ETD device <b>2</b>. The further ion guide may be arranged to simultaneously and continuously receive and transfer ions of both polarities from separate ion sources at different locations and to direct both the analyte and reagent ions into the ETD device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Experiments involving applying travelling DC voltage waves to the electrodes of a stacked ring RF ion guide have shown that increasing the amplitude of the travelling DC wave voltage pulses and/or increasing the speed of the travelling DC wave voltage pulses within an ion reaction volume can cause ion-ion reaction rates to be reduced or even stopped when necessary. This is due to the fact that the travelling DC voltage wave can cause a localised increase in the relative velocity of analyte cations relative to reagent anions. The ion-ion reaction rate has been shown to be inversely proportional to the cube of the relative velocity between cations and anions.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Increasing the amplitude and/or the speed of the travelling DC voltage wave may also cause cations and anions to spend less time together in the ETD device <b>2</b> and hence may have the effect of reducing the reaction efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Ion-ion reactions within the ETD device <b>2</b> may be controlled, optimised, maximised or minimised by varying the amplitude and/or the speed of one or more DC travelling waves applied to the electrodes <b>1</b> of the ETD device <b>2</b>. Other embodiments are contemplated wherein instead of controlling the amplitude of the travelling DC wave fields electronically, the field amplitudes are controlled mechanically by utilising stack ring electrodes that vary in internal diameter or axial spacing. If the aperture of the ring stack or ring electrodes <b>1</b> is arranged to increase in diameter then the travelling wave amplitude experienced by ions will decrease assuming that the same amplitude voltage is applied to all electrodes <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The amplitude of the one or more travelling DC voltage waves may be increased further and then the travelling DC voltage wave velocity may be suddenly reduced to zero so that a standing wave is effectively created. Ions in the reaction volume may be repeatedly accelerated and then decelerated along the axis of the ETD device <b>2</b>. This approach can be used to cause an increase in the internal energy of product or fragment ions which are created or formed within the ETD device <b>2</b> so that the product or fragment ions may further decompose by the process of Collision Induced Dissociation (CID). This method of Collision Induced Dissociation is particularly useful in separating non-covalently bound product or fragment ions which may result from Electron Transfer Dissociation. Precursor ions that have previously been subjected to Electron Transfer Dissociation reactions often partially decompose (especially singly and doubly charged precursor ions) and the partially decomposed ions may remain non-covalently attached to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Non-covalently bound product or fragment ions of interest may be separated from each other as they are being swept out from the ETD device <b>2</b> by the travelling DC wave operating in its normal mode of transporting ions. This may be achieved by setting the velocity of the travelling wave to a sufficiently high value such that ion-molecule collisions occur which induce the non-covalently bound fragment or product ions to separate.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Analyte ions and reagent ions may be generated either by the same ion source or by a common ion generating section or ion source of a mass spectrometer.

As a result, ETD reagent ions are preferably created within the vacuum chamber <b>16</b> in a glow discharge region <b>20</b>.

For example, an Electrospray ion source may be used to generate analyte (or ETD reagent) ions and an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation ion source may be used to generate ETD reagent (or analyte) ions. Negatively charged ETD reagent ions may be passed into an ETD device by means of one or more travelling DC voltages or transient DC voltages which are applied to the electrodes of the ETD device. A negative DC potential may be applied to the ETD device in order to retain the negatively charged reagent ions within the ETD device. Positively charged analyte ions may then be input into the ETD device by applying one or more travelling DC voltage or transient DC voltages to the electrodes of the ETD device. The positively charged analyte ions are preferably not retained or prevented from exiting the ETD device. The various parameters of the travelling DC voltage or transient DC voltages applied to the electrodes of the ETD device may be optimised or controlled in order to optimise, maximise or minimise the degree of fragmentation of analyte ions by Electron Transfer Dissociation.</p>

Alternatively, instead of switching one or more ions sources ON and OFF, the one or more ion sources may instead be left substantially ON and an ion source selector device such as a baffle or rotating ion beam block may be used. For example, two ion sources may be left ON but the ion beam selector may only allow ions from one of the ion sources to be transmitted to the mass spectrometer at any particular instance in time.

In order to illustrate aspects of the preferred embodiment highly charged Polyethylene glycol ions (PEG 20K) were allowed to react with a superbase reagent called 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10-Octahydropyrimidol[1,2-a]azepine (commonly known as &#x201c;DBU&#x201d;) within a PTR or reaction cell of a mass spectrometer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a resulting mass spectrum of the PEG 20K ions after Proton Transfer Reaction and shows that the ions have been reduced in charge state to have predominantly a 4+ charge state. By way of contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a corresponding mass spectrum wherein the PEG 20K ions were not subjected to charge state reduction with DBU. It is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> that the non-charge reduced parent ions comprise a complex mixture of ions having high charge states and hence low mass to charge values. Individual oligomers are not discernible in the mass spectrum and the spectrum comprises relatively broad noisy bands due to the overlapping of charge states and the compression of the mass to charge ratio range due to the high charge states. A PEG sample consists of a mixture of oligomers each of which can have a variety of charge states. It is believed that up to 28 charges can be placed onto an oligomer chain with a mass of 20K Da.

<p id="p-0234" num="0233">According to an embodiment the neutral superbase reagent gas which is provided in the preferred PTR device may comprise 1,1,3,3-Tetramethylguanidine (&#x201c;TMG&#x201d;), 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10-Octahydropyrimidol[1,2-a]azepine {Synonym: 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (&#x201c;DBU&#x201d;)} or 7-Methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (&#x201c;MTBD&#x201d;){Synonym: 1,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydro-1-methyl-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidine}.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Although the preferred embodiment relates to performing PTR in an ion guide or device comprising a plurality of electrodes having apertures through which ions are transmitted, other embodiments are contemplated wherein the ETD device and/or the preferred PTR device may instead comprise a plurality of rod electrodes. A DC voltage gradient may be applied along at least a portion of the axial length of the rod set. If a control system determines that the degree of ETD fragmentation in the ETD device and/or the degree of PTR charge reduction in the PTR device is too high, then the DC voltage gradient may be increased so that the ion-ion reaction times between analyte ions and ETD reagent ions in the ETD device is reduced and/or the ion-neutral gas reaction times of ETD product or fragment ions and neutral superbase reagent gas in the PTR device is reduced. Similarly, if the control system determines that the degree of ETD fragmentation and/or PTR charge reduction is too low, then the DC voltage gradient may be decreased so that the ion-ion reaction times between analyte ions and reagent ions in the ETD device is increased and/or the ion-neutral gas reaction times of ETD product or fragment ions and neutral superbase reagent gas in the PTR device is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">According to a less preferred embodiment a neutral reagent gas (e.g. caesium vapour) may be used instead of reagent ions in an ETD device in order to perform ETD.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">According to an embodiment a control system may vary the degree of radial RF confinement within a radial pseudo-potential well. If the RF voltage applied, for example, to the electrodes of the ETD device and/or the preferred PTR device is increased, then the resulting pseudo-potential well will have a narrower profile leading to a reduced ion-ion or ion-neutral gas reaction volume. As a result, there will, for example, be greater interaction between analyte ions and reagent ions in the ETD device leading to increased ETD effects. If the control system determines that the degree of ETD fragmentation in the ETD device is too high, then the control system may reduce the RF voltage so that there is less mixing between analyte ions and reagent ions in the ETD device. Similarly, if the control system determines that the degree of ETD fragmentation is too low, then the control system may increase the RF voltage so that there is increased mixing between analyte ions and reagent ions in the ETD device.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Negative reagent ions may be trapped within the ETD device or ion guide by applying a negative potential at one or both ends of the ETD device or ion guide. If the potential barrier is too low, then the ETD device may be considered to be relatively leaky in terms of ETD reagent ions. However, the negative potential barrier will also have the effect of accelerating positive analyte ions along and through the ETD device. Therefore, overall if the negative potential barrier(s) is set relatively low then the ion-ion reaction time in the ETD device is preferably increased and there is an increased reaction cross-section leading to increased ETD fragmentation. If the control system determines that the degree of ETD fragmentation is too high, then the potential barrier may be increased so that there is less mixing between analyte ions and ETD reagent ions. Similarly, if the control system determines that the degree of ETD fragmentation is too low, then the potential barrier may be decreased so that there is increased mixing between analyte ions and ETD reagent ions.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Embodiments of the present invention are contemplated wherein a mass spectrometer may perform multiple different analyses of ions which may, for example, being eluting from a Liquid Chromatography column. According to an embodiment, within the timescale of an LC elution peak, the analyte ions may, for example, be subjected to a parent ion scan in order to determine the mass to charge ratio(s) of the parent or precursor ions. Parent or precursor ions may then be mass selected by a quadrupole or other mass filter and subjected, for example, to CID fragmentation in order to produce and then mass analyse b-type and y-type fragment ions. The parent or precursor ions may then subsequently be mass selected by a quadrupole or other mass filter and may then be subjected to ETD fragmentation in order to produce and then mass analyse c-type and z-type fragment ions. The ETD fragment ions are preferably reduced in charge state within a preferred PTR device by interacting with a neutral reagent gas prior to being onwardly transmitted to the mass analyser. In a further mode of operation parent or precursor ions may be subjected to high/low switching of a collision cell. According to this embodiment the parent or precursor ions are repeatedly switched between two different modes of operation. In the first mode of operation the parent or precursor ions may be subjected to CID or ETD fragmentation. In the second mode of operation the parent or precursor ions are preferably not substantially subjected to either CID or ETD fragmentation.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The ions which are fragmented and/or reduced in charge may according to an embodiment comprise peptide ions derived from peptides which have been subject to hydrogen-deuterium (&#x201c;H-D&#x201d;) exchange. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange is a chemical reaction wherein a covalently bonded hydrogen atom is replaced with a deuterium atom. In view of the fact that a deuterium nucleus is heavier than hydrogen due to the addition of an extra neutron, then a protein or peptide comprising some deuterium will be heavier than one that contains all hydrogen. As a result, as a protein or peptide is increasingly deuterated then the molecular mass will steadily increase and this increase in molecular mass can be detected by mass spectrometry. It is therefore contemplated that the preferred method may be used in the analysis of proteins or peptides incorporating deuterium. The incorporation of deuterium may be used to study both the structural dynamics of proteins in solution (e.g. by hydrogen-exchange mass spectrometry) as well as the gas phase structure and fragmentation mechanisms of polypeptide ions. A particularly advantageous effect of Electron Transfer Dissociation of peptides is that ETD fragmentation (unlike CD fragmentation) does not suffer from the problem of hydrogen scrambling which is the intramolecular migration of hydrogens upon vibrational excitation of the even-electron precursor ion. According to an embodiment of the present invention the preferred apparatus and method may be used to effect ETD fragmentation and/or subsequent PTR charge reduction of peptide ions comprising deuterium. According to an embodiment the degree of ETD fragmentation and/or subsequent PTR charge reduction of peptide ions comprising deuterium may be controlled, optimised, maximised or minimised. Similarly, the degree of hydrogen scrambling in peptide ions comprising deuterium prior to fragmentation of the ions by ETD and/or subsequent charge reduction by PTR may be controlled, optimised, maximised or minimised according to an embodiment of the present invention by varying, altering, increasing or decreasing one or more parameters (e.g. travelling wave velocity and/or amplitude) which affect the transmission of ions through the ion guide.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Although the preferred embodiment as described above relates to the use of a superbase reagent gas or vapour the present invention also extends to the use of non-superbase reagent gases or vapours and in particular the use of volatile amines such as trimethyl amine and triethyl amine. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention are also contemplated wherein in the embodiments described above the superbase reagent gas is replaced with a volatile amine reagent gas.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the accompanying claims.</p>
