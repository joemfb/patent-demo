<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the field of handheld electronic devices. Specifically, the present application relates to systems and methods for identifying a component inserted into a component receiving socket of an electronic device and optimizing settings of the electronic device in response to the identification of the component.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the proliferation of more robust wireless communications systems, advancements of wireless handheld electronic devices are becoming more feasible. Handheld electronic devices can provide a variety of functions including, for example, telephonic, electronic messaging and other functions. Handheld electronic devices include mobile stations such as simple cellular telephones, smart telephones, wireless PDAs, and laptop computers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such electronic devices decrease in size, they are often coupled with other components to increase their functionality. For example, audio headsets can be attached to allow a user to listen to music, watch movies with sound, or otherwise receive audio output from the electronic device. Additionally, the electronic device can be coupled to a projector, monitor, keyboard, chargers, data cables and the like. It is desirable to allow users greater flexibility when implementing such components in conjunction with the electronic device.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electronic device <b>300</b> includes a processor <b>338</b>, which in at least one embodiment is a microprocessor that controls the operation of the electronic device <b>300</b>. A communication subsystem <b>311</b> performs all communication transmission and reception with the wireless network <b>319</b>. The processor <b>338</b> is coupled to an auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>328</b> which is coupled to the device <b>300</b>. Additionally, in at least one embodiment, the processor <b>338</b> is coupled to a serial port (for example, a Universal Serial Bus port) <b>330</b> that facilitates communication with other devices or systems via the serial port <b>330</b>. A display <b>322</b> is coupled to processor <b>338</b> to display information to an operator of the device <b>300</b>. When the electronic device <b>300</b> is equipped with a keyboard <b>332</b>, which may be physical or virtual, the keyboard <b>332</b> is coupled to the processor <b>338</b>. The electronic device <b>300</b> includes a speaker <b>334</b>, a microphone <b>336</b>, random access memory <b>326</b> (RAM), and memory <b>324</b>, all of which may be coupled to the processor <b>338</b>. The device <b>300</b> may include other similar components that are optionally coupled to the processor <b>338</b>. Other communication subsystems <b>340</b> and other device subsystems <b>342</b> are generally indicated as being functionally coupled to the processor <b>338</b>. An example of a communication subsystem <b>340</b> is a short range communication system such as BLUETOOTH&#xae; communication module or a WI-FI&#xae; communication module (a communication module in compliance with IEEE 802.11a/b/g). These subsystems <b>340</b> and their associated circuits and components can be functionally coupled to the processor <b>338</b>. Additionally, the processor <b>338</b> is able to perform operating system functions and enables execution of programs on the electronic device <b>300</b>. In some embodiments the electronic device <b>300</b> does not include all of the above components. For example, in at least one embodiment the keyboard <b>332</b> is not provided as a separate component and is instead integrated with a touch-sensitive display.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, the electronic device <b>300</b> is equipped with components to enable operation of various programs, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, the memory <b>324</b>, which in at least one embodiment is flash memory, is enabled to provide a storage location for the operating system <b>357</b>, device programs <b>358</b>, and data. The operating system <b>357</b> is generally configured to manage other programs <b>358</b> that are also stored in memory <b>324</b> and executable on the processor <b>338</b>. The operating system <b>357</b> honors requests for services made by programs <b>358</b> through predefined program <b>358</b> interfaces. More specifically, the operating system <b>357</b> typically determines the order in which multiple programs <b>358</b> are executed on the processor <b>338</b> and the execution time allotted for each program <b>358</b>, manages the sharing of memory <b>324</b> among multiple programs <b>358</b>, handles input and output to and from other device subsystems <b>342</b>, and so on. In addition, operators can typically interact directly with the operating system <b>357</b> through a user interface usually including the keyboard <b>332</b> and display screen <b>322</b>. While in an exemplary embodiment the operating system <b>357</b> is stored in memory <b>324</b>, the operating system <b>357</b> in other embodiments is stored in read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage elements (not shown). As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the operating system <b>357</b>, device program <b>358</b> or parts thereof may be loaded in RAM <b>326</b> or other volatile memory.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one exemplary embodiment, the memory <b>324</b> contains programs <b>358</b> for execution on the electronic device <b>300</b> including an address book <b>352</b>, a personal information manager (PIM) <b>354</b>, and the device state <b>350</b>. Furthermore, programs <b>358</b> and other information <b>356</b> including data can be segregated upon storage in the memory <b>324</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the electronic device <b>300</b> is enabled for two-way communication within the wireless communication network <b>319</b>, it sends and receives signals from a mobile communication service. Examples of communication systems enabled for two-way communication include, but are not limited to, the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network, the Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service (UMTS) network, the Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE) network, the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) networks, Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service Time Division Duplexing (UMTS-TDD), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) networks, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and other networks that can be used for data and voice, or just data or voice. For the systems listed above, the electronic device <b>300</b> may require a unique identifier to enable the electronic device <b>300</b> to transmit and receive signals from the communication network <b>319</b>. Other systems may not require such identifying information. GPRS, UMTS, and EDGE use a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) in order to allow communication with the communication network <b>319</b>. Likewise, most CDMA systems use a Removable User Identity Module (RUIM) in order to communicate with the CDMA network. The RUIM and SIM card can be used in a multitude of different electronic devices <b>300</b>. The electronic device <b>300</b> can operate some features without a SIM/RUIM card, but a SIM/RUIM card is necessary for communication with the network <b>319</b>. A SIM/RUIM interface <b>344</b> located within the electronic device <b>300</b> allows for removal or insertion of a SIM/RUIM card (not shown). The SIM/RUIM card features memory and holds key configuration <b>351</b>, and other information <b>353</b> such as identification and subscriber related information. With a properly enabled electronic device <b>300</b>, two-way communication between the electronic device <b>300</b> and communication network <b>319</b> is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If the electronic device <b>300</b> is enabled as described above or the communication network <b>319</b> does not require such enablement, the two-way communication enabled electronic device <b>300</b> is able to both transmit and receive information from the communication network <b>319</b>. The transfer of communication can be from the device <b>300</b> or to the device <b>300</b>. In order to communicate with the communication network <b>319</b>, the electronic device <b>300</b> in the presently described exemplary embodiment is equipped with an integral or internal antenna <b>318</b> for transmitting signals to the communication network <b>319</b>. Likewise the electronic device <b>300</b> in the presently described exemplary embodiment is equipped with another antenna <b>316</b> for receiving communication from the communication network <b>319</b>. These antennae (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) in another exemplary embodiment are combined into a single antenna (not shown). As one skilled in the art would appreciate, the antenna or antennae (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) in another embodiment are externally mounted on the electronic device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When equipped for two-way communication, the electronic device <b>300</b> includes a communication subsystem <b>311</b>. As is understood in the art, this communication subsystem <b>311</b> supports the operational needs of the electronic device <b>300</b>. The subsystem <b>311</b> includes a transmitter <b>314</b> and receiver <b>312</b> including the associated antenna or antennae (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) as described above, local oscillators (LOs) <b>313</b>, and a processing module <b>320</b> which in the presently described exemplary embodiment is a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is contemplated that communication by the electronic device <b>300</b> with the wireless network <b>319</b> is any type of communication that both the wireless network <b>319</b> and electronic device <b>300</b> are enabled to transmit, receive and process. In general, these can be classified as voice and data. Voice communication generally refers to communication in which signals for audible sounds are transmitted by the electronic device <b>300</b> through the communication network <b>319</b>. Data generally refers to all other types of communication that the electronic device <b>300</b> is capable of performing within the constraints of the wireless network <b>319</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Example device programs that depend on such data include email, contacts and calendars. For these device programs, synchronization with home-based versions of the programs is desirable for either or both of their long term and short term utility. As an example, emails are often time sensitive, so substantially real time synchronization may be desired. Contacts, on the other hand, are usually updated less frequently without inconvenience. Therefore, the utility of the electronic device <b>300</b> is enhanced when connectable within a communication system, and when connectable on a wireless basis to a network <b>319</b> in which voice, text messaging, and other data transfer are accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the above description generally describes the systems and components associated with a handheld electronic device, the electronic device <b>300</b> can be another communication device such as a PDA, a laptop computer, desktop computer, a server, or other communication device. In those embodiments, different components of the above system might be omitted in order to provide desired operability of device <b>300</b>. Additionally, other components not described above may be required to allow the device <b>300</b> to function in a desired fashion. The above description provides only general components and additional components may be required to enable system functionality. These systems and components would be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An exemplary handheld electronic device <b>300</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The device <b>300</b> includes a body <b>371</b> housing a lighted display <b>322</b>, a navigational tool (auxiliary input) <b>328</b>, a keyboard <b>332</b> suitable for accommodating textual input, a receiving socket <b>350</b> for accommodating insertion of a component (not shown), a light source <b>352</b> and a light sensor <b>354</b>. The device <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is of unibody construction, but common &#x201c;clamshell&#x201d; or &#x201c;flip-phone&#x201d; constructions are also suitable for the embodiments disclosed herein. The display <b>322</b> is located above the keyboard <b>332</b>. The navigational tool (auxiliary input) <b>328</b> is located essentially between the display <b>322</b> and the keyboard <b>332</b>. The keyboard <b>332</b> comprises a plurality of keys with which alphabetic letters are associated, but at least a portion of the individual keys have multiple letters associated therewith. This type of configuration is referred to as a reduced keyboard (in comparison to the full keyboard having only one letter per key) and can, among others come in QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, and Dvorak layouts.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A block diagram example of an electronic device <b>300</b> and a component <b>400</b> coupled to the electronic device <b>300</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A receiving socket <b>350</b> is configured such that is at least partially within the body of the electronic device <b>300</b>. In at least one embodiment, the receiving socket <b>350</b> can extend beyond the body of the electronic device <b>300</b>. A light source <b>352</b> which emits light into the receiving socket <b>350</b> is provided. The light source can be coupled to a backlight or other light source as well. The light source <b>352</b> can be individual light emitting diodes as well. In other embodiments, the light source <b>352</b> can form a ring around the light sensor <b>354</b>. In yet another embodiment, the light source <b>352</b> can be a laser. The light sources <b>352</b> can also be controlled from the processor <b>338</b>. The light sensor <b>354</b> is coupled to the processor <b>338</b>. The light sensor <b>354</b> is configured to detect reflected light from at least one surface of a component connector <b>410</b> inserted into the receiving socket <b>350</b>. The microprocessor can be configured to identify a component <b>400</b> based on a stored reflected light profile associated with the identity of the component <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As explained below, the identification of the component <b>400</b> can be based upon at least one of the detected amplitude of the reflected light, the detected wavelength of reflected light, and the detected intensity of the reflected light. The identification can be based on surface properties of the component connector <b>410</b>. The amplitude of reflected light can depend on the surface characteristics of the component connector <b>410</b>, the location and angle of the source relative to the component connector <b>410</b>, and the location and angle of the detector relative to the component connector <b>410</b>. For instance, a component connector <b>410</b> could be configured with a surface finish, for example colored paint, that identifies it relative to other component connectors. Other surface finishes that are contemplated include but are not limited to glossy paint and flat paint, which can in at least one embodiment be used in connection with a paint color. Additionally, the surface finish can be a mirror like or specular finish that will produce a narrow angular reflection in contrast to a granular, diffuse or lambertian surface which reflects light at a wider angle. Alternatively or in addition, the component connector <b>410</b> can have a surface shape that differs, for example a crowned distal end as compared to a flat distal end, from other component connectors. The distal end with a crown shape reflects light differently than the flat surface owing to its geometry. Additionally, the length of the component connector <b>410</b> can be varied to reflect light with a different amplitude which can be in turn detected according to the present disclosure. In some embodiments, only one of the above described changes to the component connector <b>410</b> is made. While in other embodiments, the component connector <b>410</b> can be modified with one or more of the above described characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The microprocessor <b>338</b> can adjust a setting of the electronic device in response to identification of the component <b>400</b>. The settings that are adjusted can depend on the type of component <b>400</b> that is coupled to the electronic device <b>300</b>. The description below provides an example in relation to an audio headset. In other embodiments, the component could be one of a microphone, display screen, keyboard, touch pad, mouse, input device, speakers, audio sound system, and the like. Each of these different components <b>400</b> have settings that can be adjusted on the electronic device <b>300</b> to increase the user experience. For example, a display screen can have a native resolution, which can be adjusted to match the display properties. In the example of a keyboard, different configurations of keys can be implemented. In the case of speakers and audio sound systems the levels of output sound can be adjusted. Output sound can be adjusted through an equalizer setting where ranges of sounds are adjusted or it can be limited to treble, bass, and mid-range.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to provide reflected light from the component connector <b>410</b> that can be distinguished, the distal end <b>412</b> of the component connector <b>410</b> can have a surface that is unique. As described above, the identification of the component can be based upon at least one of the detected amplitude of the reflected light, the detected wavelength of reflected light, and the detected intensity of the reflected light. In order to illustrate some examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-E</figref> have been provided. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an end view of the distal end <b>412</b> is provided. As illustrated the distal end <b>412</b> is smaller in diameter than the component connector <b>410</b>. The distal end <b>412</b> can be colored with a specific color to reflect the light with a unique characteristic. Also the surface of the distal end <b>412</b> can have a predetermined texture. For instance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the predetermined texture is a series of raised bumps. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the surface texture is one that features a series of peaks and troughs. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the surface is a dark color such that it absorbs most of the light emitted upon it. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, the surface has a pattern that allows for some absorption as well as reflection. These and other similar patterns can be implemented on the surface of the distal end <b>412</b> to provide for identification of the coupled component <b>400</b>. In other embodiments, the texture can be described as one of granular and smooth. For instance, the surface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> can be described as granular, whereas the surface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> can be described as smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the component <b>400</b> is an audio headset including at least one driver support frame <b>402</b>, at least one audio driver <b>404</b>, at least one driver cable <b>406</b>, a microphone <b>408</b> and a component connector <b>410</b>, a male jack as illustrated, having a distal end <b>412</b>. The cable <b>406</b>, through which audio electrical signals are received and transmitted, extends from the audio drivers <b>404</b> through the microphone <b>408</b> and attaches to the component connector <b>410</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Audio electrical signals are received from that electronic device <b>300</b> and output through the audio drivers <b>404</b>. The microphone <b>408</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, allows audio electrical signals that are created by a user to be captured. The distal end <b>412</b> can be made to reflect a unique intensity, amplitude or wavelength of light. As described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-E</figref>, the distal end <b>412</b> can have unique surface including a pattern, color, or some combination thereof to control the way that light is reflected off of the distal end <b>412</b>. The surface of the component connector <b>410</b> can be used to distinguish the model and acoustical characteristics of the component <b>400</b>. In addition to controlling the surface of the component connector, the length and shape of the component connector <b>410</b> can also be varied to affect the intensity, amplitude or wavelength of light reflected from the component connector <b>410</b> of the component <b>400</b>. The surface of the component connector <b>410</b> can be constructed as described herein such that the light reflected therefrom has a predetermined intensity. Additionally, the reflected light can have a predetermined amplitude. Furthermore, the reflected light can have a predetermined wavelength. In other embodiments, a predetermined combination of intensity, amplitude, and wavelength can be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the illustrated component <b>400</b> is an audio headset with two drivers <b>404</b> and one microphone <b>408</b>, other audio headsets are considered within the scope of this disclosure. In other embodiments, the audio headset can have only a pair of drivers <b>404</b> or a single audio driver <b>404</b>. Additionally in one example, the drivers <b>404</b> can be intraconcha headsets configured to fit over the ear with the audio driver <b>404</b> fitting loosely on the entrance of the user's ear-canal. In another example, the audio driver <b>404</b> can also be inserted firmly in the user's ear canal to establish a tighter seal between the audio driver <b>404</b> and the user's ear canal. In yet another embodiment, the audio driver <b>404</b> can be a supra-aural headset that encompasses the entire ear of the user. Each of these different types of headsets can exhibit different audio properties. According to the present disclosure, the audio headset that is attached the electronic device can be determined from the component connector <b>410</b>. These different audio headsets can exhibit different properties depending on a variety of factors including the seal with the ear canal, driver size, and driver configuration. For instance, circumaural headsets are designed to completely encompass the ears and result in relatively low degree of sound leakage. Supra-aural headsets have pads that sit on top of the ears and allow for a greater degree of sound leakage. In order to optimize the quality of sound received and transmitted from a given audio headset with unique acoustical characteristics, the audio settings of the electronic device <b>300</b> can be adjusted. The electronic device <b>300</b> can store the different profiles associated with the corresponding audio headset and modify device settings based upon the sensed component.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, the manufacturer of the headset can configure the headset with specific uses and properties. For example, some headsets can be designed to increase the bass sensed by the user of the headset. In other applications, a consistent mid-range headset is desirable. As described herein, the electronic device can identify the component based upon the light reflected off of the component connector and modify at least one setting of the electronic device in response to the detection. For example, if a manufacturer wants the treble, bass, and mid-range to be adjusted to certain respective levels, the electronic device can adjust settings to these levels. In another embodiment, the user can set the desired settings for the audio headset as well. While the above examples have been described in relation to components which are audio headsets, other components such as microphones, keyboards, displays, projectors, and the like are also considered within the scope of this disclosure. Each of these components can be identified using the method and systems as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a light source <b>352</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b> is configured to emit light into the receiving socket <b>350</b>. Light emitted from the light source <b>352</b> is reflected off the distal end <b>412</b> of the component connector <b>410</b> when the distal end <b>412</b> of the component connector <b>410</b> is inserted into the receiving socket <b>350</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b>. Light can be automatically emitted from the light source <b>352</b> into the receiving socket <b>350</b> when the distal end <b>412</b> of the component connector <b>410</b> is inserted into the receiving socket <b>350</b>. In at least one other embodiment, the user can initiate emission of light from the light source <b>352</b> into the receiving socket <b>350</b> by actuating a predetermined key <b>140</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on the body <b>371</b> of the device <b>300</b>, executing a voice command, or actuating a user-selectable target image on a touch-sensitive display of the device <b>300</b>, and the like. In one embodiment, the light source <b>352</b> is a light emitting diode (LED) or backlight provided for lighting the display <b>322</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b>.</p>

The intensity of light reflected from the distal end <b>412</b> of the component connector <b>410</b> can vary based on the surface of the distal end <b>412</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the light sensor <b>354</b> can be a photo sensor that converts the intensity of light reflected from the distal end <b>412</b> of the male component connector <b>410</b> into a digital signal that is input to the processor <b>338</b> of the handheld electronic device <b>300</b>. Memory <b>324</b> is coupled to the processor <b>338</b> and stores a look-up table of known light intensity profiles corresponding to a color spectrum and corresponding to a plurality of components <b>400</b> with individual characteristics and associated device settings. For example, when the component is an audio headset the processor <b>338</b> can identify the model and acoustical characteristics of the audio headset inserted into the receiving socket <b>350</b> based on the intensity of light reflected from the distal end <b>412</b> and sensed by the photo sensor <b>354</b>. In order to optimize the quality of sound transmitted and received from the audio headset, the processor <b>338</b> modifies at least one setting of the electronic device <b>300</b> in response to the identification and acoustical characteristics of the audio headset.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Audio settings of the electronic device <b>300</b> that can be modified include one of a treble setting, a bass setting, a mid-range setting, a volume setting, a balance setting or any other audio setting modification contemplated by one of ordinary skill in the art capable of improving the sound quality received or transmitted through the audio headset.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another example embodiment, the light source <b>352</b> is a laser configured within the receiving socket <b>350</b> to emit light into the receiving socket <b>350</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b>.

In addition, if the laser is enabled through a predetermined key <b>140</b>, the laser can be emitted from the receiving socket and function as a pointer on the electronic device <b>300</b>.</p>

(Block <b>210</b>). Additionally, the method also detects reflected light, using a light sensor, from the surface of the component connector. (Block <b>220</b>). The method further identifies a component based on the reflected light off of the component connector. (Block <b>230</b>). Then, the method modifies at least one setting of the handheld electronic device in response to the identification of the component. (Block <b>240</b>). The identification of the component can be based upon at least one of the detected amplitude of the reflected light, the detected wavelength of the reflected light, and the detected intensity of the reflected light. The identification of the connected component can be either pre-stored in memory of the handheld electronic device or it may be user programmed for instance after coupling the component. The memory can sort the identification of the component and associated settings along with the associated sensed reflected light. The surface of the component connector can be as described above. For example, the surface of the component connector can be a colored surface. In at least another example, the surface of the component connector can be a predetermined texture comprising one of granular and smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, once the determination of the type of audio headset is made (Block <b>250</b>), the processor adjusts audio output signals to the headset based on the attached headset (Block <b>260</b>). For example, the at least one setting that is adjusted can be one of a treble setting, a bass setting and a mid-range setting. If another type of component is connected as described above, a similar determination can be made and appropriate settings can be modified in response to the identification of the component.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other embodiments, the memory <b>324</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b> can store a series of look-up tables containing a profile of reflected light intensities, wavelengths or light amplitudes corresponding to the texture, length, shape or composition of matter of any surface of the component connector <b>410</b>. Therefore, it is contemplated that the method herein disclosed can identify the model and characteristics of the component <b>400</b> based on the texture, length, shape or composition of matter of at least one surface of the component connector <b>410</b> of the component <b>400</b>. Furthermore, the light sensor <b>354</b> of the present application can be a fiber-optic sensor, photovoltaic sensor, a photo-resistive sensor or any other sensor contemplated by one of ordinary skill in the art capable of sensing the intensity, amplitude or wavelength of light reflected from at least one surface of the component connector <b>410</b> of the component <b>400</b>.</p>
