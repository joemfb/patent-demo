<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a non-provisional of U.S. Application Ser. No. 61/216,114 filed on May 14, 2009, titled ROBOTIC MAIL TRAY SLEEVER METHOD AND APPARATUS which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates generally to systems for automating repetitive tasks. In particular, the present application relates to the automated handling and sleeving of mail trays for routing bulk mailings and other articles.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) allows high volume postal customers to reduce their mailing costs and the delivery time for their mail by presorting, packaging and labeling their mail to reduce handling costs incurred by the USPS. According to the program, customers should sort the mail for a particular zip code destination, and load the sorted mail in a standard size tray. The trays must be sleeved in a cardboard cover. The sleeved tray is weighed to determined postal charges, and tagged with information on the weight, zip code and destination for the USPS. The tagged, sleeved tray is strapped, and finally delivered to the USPS.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The mail is packaged in standard sized mail trays and paperboard sleeves and securely banded. The trays for first and third class mail are in three different sizes designated MM, 4&#xbd; inches high, 10&#xbd; wide and 24 inches long, and EMM, 6&#xbd; high and 11&#xbd; wide and 24 inches long. Additionally, Half MM trays are available which have the same height and width as a Full MM tray but are 12 inches long. The sleeves are rectangular cardboard tubes provided in three sizes to accommodate the three standard trays. Customers receive the sleeves as flat, folded blanks. Unfolding a sleeve blank to open it to a tube and inserting a mail tray in the sleeve is a labor intensive operation. Accordingly, there is a need, for an automatic system that can insert a mail tray into a sleeve as part of a larger mail handling system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One obstacle to an automatic sleeving system relates to the ability of a system to store, feed and form sleeves reliably. The condition of the sleeves is a factor in mail packaging systems. To keep costs low, used sleeves are returned to customers and are reused as long as they are structurally intact. Over its useful lifetime, a sleeve is subject to wear and tear that can cause it to become creased and torn, and the edges and corners become frayed and dog-eared. The condition of a used sleeve makes it difficult for an automatic system to handle the sleeve to reliably obtain it from a supply device, unfold it to a proper shape and position it for inserting of a tray.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One known mail tray sleeving system is the AUTOSLEEVE system available from Carter Control Systems of Frederick, Md. and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,854. This system design has been widely adopted. While this system was an improvement when introduced, it still has practical limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The system described in the '854 patent includes a single, vertical stack of sleeve blanks where only the uppermost of the sleeve blanks in the stack is available for use by the system. Alternatively, two systems may be used in parallel such that trays of each particular size are directed to the sleeving system configured to handle trays of that size. This represents a significant increase in capital investment to operate the system. Also, in practice, the system is advertised as capable of only sleeving 18 mail trays per minute. This cyclic rate is further reduced by the fact that the system must be stopped to replenish the supply of sleeve blanks to the sleever which results in a lower overall throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need for a system capable of sleeving mail trays and capable of handling mail trays of multiple sizes at a single station without the intervention of a human operator. There is a further need for a sleeving system capable of sleeving mail trays at a higher throughput than what is currently achieved. There is yet a further need to provide an automatic sleeving system wherein the supply of sleeve blanks can be replenished without interrupting the operation of the system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This application relates to a novel method for placing trays into sleeves. The method includes the steps of positioning the tray into a staging zone, and gripping an unopened sleeve with a robotic arm and end of arm tool. The sleeve is opened or formed with the end of arm tool. The opened sleeve is placed into a ready position proximate to a tray induction system with the robotic arm. The opened sleeve is then secured in a ready position with mechanical devices. The end of arm tool may then release the opened sleeve. The tray is then inserted into the opened sleeve using other mechanical devices. After the tray has been sleeved, the sleeved tray is cleared away from the tray induction system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This application also relates to a robotic mail tray sleeving system. The system includes a conveyor system for transporting a mail tray, a sleeve blank presentment device and a robotic arm. The robotic arm is provided with an end of arm tool which retains and opens a sleeve blank. A tray induction system including a plurality of paddles configured to guide a tray into an open sleeve blank is also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This application further relates to a novel method for handling articles including the steps of positioning a tray of articles for inserting the tray in a sleeve and gripping an uppermost sleeve blank from a supply of sleeve blanks. The gripped sleeve blank is moved to a position below the supply and formed into a sleeve. The formed sleeve is positioned to accept a tray.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to the Figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of a robotic mail tray sleeving system <b>10</b> for sleeving a mail tray <b>12</b>. System <b>10</b> includes a conveyor system <b>14</b>, a sleeve blank presentment device <b>16</b>, a robotic arm <b>18</b>, having end of arm tooling <b>20</b>, and a tray induction system <b>22</b>. Conveyor system <b>14</b> transports tray <b>12</b> to a position proximate to sleeve blank presentment system <b>16</b>. Robotic arm <b>18</b> grasps a sleeve blank <b>24</b>, opens the sleeve blank to form a sleeve and positions the opened sleeve proximate to induction system <b>22</b>. Robotic arm <b>18</b> then releases sleeve <b>24</b> and tray <b>12</b> is positioned inside sleeve <b>24</b> before moving downstream of system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Conveyor system <b>14</b> may be specialized as shown herein. Sleeve blank presentment device <b>16</b> is shown as two side-by-side rectangular holders for providing sleeves of two different sizes to system <b>10</b>. An operator may restock each of the holders &#x201c;on the fly&#x201d; such that system <b>10</b> operates continuously during restocking. This allows for a higher average cyclic rate for the system as it operates over time. Robotic arm <b>18</b> is shown as a six axis robotic arm, but a multi axis robotic arm may also be used. The numerous degrees of freedom available in this design allow for greater tolerances during installation as any variation in actual relative position of the robotic arm <b>18</b> to conveyor system <b>14</b>, sleeve blank presentment device <b>16</b>, and tray induction system <b>22</b> may be corrected by altering the program controlling robotic arm <b>18</b> after installation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, end of arm tooling <b>20</b> may generally include a base plate <b>26</b>, a robotic arm adapter <b>28</b>, a coupler <b>30</b>, suction heads <b>32</b>, suction head couplers <b>34</b>, and sleeve opening system <b>36</b>. Each of suction heads <b>32</b> are coupled to base plate <b>26</b> by suction head couplers <b>34</b>. Each suction head may be in fluid communication with its own air supply for creating a partial vacuum. Alternatively, all four suction heads may be in fluid communication with the same air supply. End of arm tooling <b>20</b> may be coupled to robotic arm <b>18</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at coupler <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Sleeve opening system <b>36</b> may be coupled to base plate <b>26</b> by any of a variety of means including welding or fastening. Sleeve opening system <b>36</b> includes an arm <b>38</b> and a base <b>40</b>. Arm <b>38</b> includes a first end comprising a cam portion <b>42</b> having an aperture <b>44</b> that comprises the pivot point of cam portion <b>42</b>. Aperture <b>44</b> is positioned to be a working portion of cam portion <b>42</b> that may be engaged to move a second end of arm having a contact <b>46</b> at a point distal to cam portion <b>42</b>. Base portion <b>40</b> may comprise a plate portion <b>48</b> and an extension <b>50</b> through which aperture <b>44</b> also passes. Arm <b>38</b> may be pivotally coupled to extension <b>50</b> by a pin, rivet, or other fastening means. Actuator <b>52</b> urges a rod <b>54</b> that is engaged to arm <b>38</b> at aperture <b>55</b> such that substantially linear motion of rod <b>54</b> translates to an arcuate motion of contact <b>46</b> about aperture <b>44</b> and along path <b>56</b>. Thus, when actuator <b>52</b> urges rod <b>54</b> contact <b>46</b> is pivoted in a plane perpendicular to the plane defined by base plate <b>26</b>. Actuator <b>52</b> and rod <b>54</b> may comprise pneumatic piston, a screw drive, or any other known means of translating substantially linear motion into arcuate motion. Alternatively, other drive systems could be used including belts, chains and other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-13</figref>, a method of sleeving mail trays is illustrated using an embodiment of the robotic sleeving system disclosed herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, system <b>100</b> begins a sleeving cycle with robotic arm <b>118</b> in a generic &#x201c;home&#x201d; position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, robotic arm <b>118</b> engages a sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>in device <b>116</b> by means of the end of arm tooling <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. robotic arm <b>118</b> moves sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>to a first conveyor line <b>114</b><i>a </i>on which a first tray <b>112</b><i>a </i>is travelling. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the end of arm tooling is used to open sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>by exerting a force on a side surface of sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>in a way that biases sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>into an open position. In general, this operation may be carried out in a configuration such that gravity is also biasing sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>into the open position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>is placed onto tray induction system <b>122</b><i>a </i>as tray <b>112</b><i>a </i>advances. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, after placing sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>on tray induction system <b>122</b><i>a</i>, end of arm tooling releases sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>and moves to repeat the process. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, robotic arm <b>118</b> uses end of arm tooling <b>120</b> to engage a second sleeve <b>124</b><i>b </i>and position sleeve <b>124</b> <i>b </i>proximate to a second conveyor line <b>114</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the end of arm tooling <b>120</b> opens sleeve <b>124</b><i>b </i>similarly to how sleeve <b>124</b><i>a </i>was opened. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, sleeve <b>124</b><i>b </i>is placed on tray induction system <b>122</b><i>b </i>as tray <b>112</b><i>a</i>, now within sleeve <b>124</b><i>a</i>, advances past system <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In general, a method consistent with some embodiments would include the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">(a) providing a conventional mail tray containing mail envelopes being transported on the conveyor;</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(b) positioning a source of empty sleeves (i.e. device <b>16</b>) in a position proximate to the conveyor;</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(c) providing a robot including a multi-axis robot arm (i.e. arm <b>18</b>) having a sleeve support and sleeve former (i.e. end of arm tooling <b>20</b>) secured to an end thereof;</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(d) positioning the robot relative to the conveyor and the source of sleeves so that the robot sleeve support and sleeve former may be moved therebetween;</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(e) providing a tray entering a conveyor (i.e. conveyor <b>14</b>) in a staging zone upstream of the robot, where sensors determine the tray type and/or size for the robot as the tray moves down the conveyor;</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">(f) causing the robot arm to move to the source of empty sleeves, pick the correct sleeve type/size using suction from the end of arm tooling, and to then position an empty sleeve in the end of arm tooling;</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">(g) forming the empty sleeve into the sleeve's ready (open) position while in motion toward the tray induction system (i.e. system <b>22</b>);</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(h) moving the robot arm while positively retaining the formed sleeve during motion so that the empty sleeve in the end of arm tooling is positioned at the tray induction system in the sleeve's open position;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(i) moving the end of arm tooling and the formed sleeve so as to place the formed sleeve onto the funnel device of the tray induction station;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(j) securing the opened sleeve in the tray induction station by means of the funnel device and movable stops as described herein;</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(k) releasing the opened sleeve to the tray induction station from the robot by ending the end of arm tooling suction;</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(l) sending the robot back to the source of sleeves so that the robot end of arm tooling may pick the correct sleeve type/size for the next tray entering a conveyor (i.e. conveyor <b>114</b><i>b</i>) at a point upstream of the robot where sensors determined the next tray type and/or size for the robot as the next tray moves down the conveyor;</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">(m) concurrently, while the robot is picking the next sleeve for the next tray, inducting the previous tray into the sleeve via a paddle device that pushes the tray into the opened sleeve along guided side rails contained within the tray induction station;</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">(n) discharging the sleeved tray from the tray induction station onto the conveyor;</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">(o) concurrently moving the robot arm and empty sleeve support from the source of empty trays for the next sleeve to the next tray induction station; and</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">(p) similarly repeating the cycle for additional tray/sleeve sizes and/or types detected as the trays are transported down the conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>, a robotic mail tray sleeving system <b>210</b> may include a conveyor <b>214</b> sleeve blank cartridges <b>216</b><i>a </i>and <b>216</b><i>b </i>(i.e. sleeve blank presentment devices), and a robotic arm <b>218</b>. In a frame of reference where the front of a cartridge <b>216</b> is defined as the area closest to robotic arm <b>218</b>, the cartridge is generally pitched downward and rolled towards conveyor <b>214</b>. This allows the weight of the sleeve blanks to bias the sleeves into a consistent position at the front of the cartridge. In this way, the end of arm tooling attached to robotic arm <b>218</b> engages each successive sleeve blank at about the same point. Configuring the cartridges such that they extend in a plane that is roughly parallel to a plane that is normal to the top of conveyor <b>214</b>, allows the overall system <b>210</b> to have a larger &#x201c;on hand&#x201d; supply of sleeve blanks while having a relatively small effective footprint. This configuration gives the robotic arm access to both sizes of mail tray sleeves and allows for the cartridges to be restocked &#x201c;on the fly&#x201d; which improves the average cyclic rate of the system over that of existing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, cartridge <b>216</b> comprises a frame <b>270</b> and a housing <b>282</b>. Frame <b>270</b> includes a first set of longitudinal members <b>272</b> arranged in a plane and a second set of longitudinal members <b>274</b> arranged in another plane that is about perpendicular to the plane defined by members <b>272</b>. These two sets of members form a frame having an &#x201c;L&#x201d; crossection in which sleeve blanks may be retained. The end of cartridge <b>216</b> is defined by frame portion <b>276</b> which includes a members <b>278</b> and a members <b>279</b> which are generally perpendicular to each other. Members <b>278</b> and <b>289</b> are configured to provide a rectangular end to frame <b>270</b>. Housing <b>280</b> is positioned proximate to the front of cartridge <b>216</b> and is in the form of a rectangular prism having an open front formed by members <b>284</b> and members <b>286</b> that are roughly perpendicular to each other and form a rectangle. The housing extends back and includes additional members that at least define the edges of the rectangular prism. The sides and top of the housing may be fitted with clear panels <b>292</b> such that an operator can view the remaining sleeve blanks in cartridge <b>216</b> but be prevented access to pinch points that may cause injury.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Stops <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> are provided to secure the front most sleeve blank within cartridge <b>216</b>. When robotic arm <b>218</b> engages the front most sleeve blank, that sleeve blank must be readily removeable, but only in such a way that the blanks behind the front most blank are retained. Accordingly, stops are provided to prevent the free movement of blanks out of cartridge <b>216</b> through the front of the cartridge. Stops <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> are positioned on at least two sides of the front face of the housing and are configured to be the sides to which the blanks are biased by the pitch and roll of the cartridge shown. Stops <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> may be mechanical stops that are retracted to allow a single blank to be removed. Alternatively, stops <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> may be flexible such that they deform from the force exerted by the robotic arm in removing the front most blank. Alternatively, stops <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> may be rigid. In that case, the sleeve blank may deform to pass by the stops when urged outward by the robotic arm. Because cartridge <b>216</b> is rolled in relation to a its major axis, stops along two sides are sufficient for rectangular sleeves of a variety of sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A feeding device <b>291</b> is also provided. Feeding device <b>291</b> comprises a face plate <b>293</b> that bears against the rearmost sleeve blank when in use, and an orienting member <b>294</b>. Orienting member <b>294</b> is coupled to face plate <b>293</b> and extends into a slot <b>296</b> that extend along much of the length of the cartridge. The positioning of orienting member <b>294</b> in slot <b>296</b> keeps face plate <b>293</b> in a generally constant position with respect to a crossection of cartridge frame <b>270</b>. Feeding device <b>291</b> may urge the sleeve blanks towards the front of the cartridge by its own weight as the cartridge has a downward pitch. In some embodiments, feeding device <b>291</b> may be driven pneumatically or otherwise to allow an operator to move feeding device <b>291</b> to the back of cartridge <b>216</b> in order to facilitate the restocking of sleeve blanks.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> a tray induction system <b>222</b> may comprise a vertical support <b>2210</b> may be coupled to a conveyor. Support <b>2210</b> may in turn be coupled to a &#x2018;U&#x2019; shaped bracket <b>2212</b>. A coupler <b>2214</b> may be used to attach a side paddle <b>2216</b> to bracket <b>2212</b>. A stop <b>2218</b> may be used to prevent excessive outward deflection of paddle <b>2216</b>. Additional brackets <b>2222</b> may be used to provide paddles <b>2224</b>. The paddles may be made of a variety of materials, but a resilient material such as spring steel is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In use, vertical surface <b>2220</b> would bear against an open end of a sleeve. Paddles <b>2216</b> and <b>2224</b> would extend into a recess within the open sleeve and act as a funnel for a tray being urged into the sleeve along a direction indicated by arrow <b>2226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, conveyor <b>214</b> is configured to direct mail trays in a direction parallel to arrow <b>1400</b>. Conveyor <b>214</b> includes rollers <b>1402</b> mounted on a frame <b>1404</b>. Guide rails <b>1406</b> direct and straighten the mail trays relative to their direction of motion and are mounted on rail supports <b>1408</b> which, in turn, are coupled to frame <b>1404</b>. Supports <b>1410</b> may be used to secure conveyor <b>214</b> to a floor or other surface. Drive bands <b>1412</b> are used to transmit a drive force to the rollers <b>1402</b> along the length of conveyor <b>214</b>. Conveyor <b>214</b> is also configured with a longitudinal opening <b>1414</b> in rollers <b>1402</b> that allows for the travel of a paddle <b>1416</b>. Conveyor <b>214</b> may also include an emergency stop <b>1426</b></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In use, paddle <b>1416</b> would be in a lowered position relative to the top surface of conveyor <b>214</b> until a mail tray is in position for insertion into a sleeve positioned on the opposite side of tray induction system <b>222</b>. Once the tray is in position, the paddle raises and engages a trailing end of the tray to urge it through the funnel provided by tray induction system <b>222</b> and into the sleeve. Once that motion is complete, paddle <b>1416</b> may be used to advance the sleeved tray downstream of the tray induction system. Paddle <b>1416</b> may then be returned to the upstream end of opening <b>1414</b> to await another mail tray. Paddle <b>1416</b> may be kept in an up position to block a subsequent tray from reaching the tray induction system prematurely.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A first light generator/sensor <b>1418</b> is positioned along side conveyor <b>214</b> proximate to an upstream side of tray induction system <b>222</b>. Light from generator/sensor <b>1418</b> travels along a path across conveyor <b>214</b> in a direction generally perpendicular to arrow <b>1400</b> but in a plane parallel to the top of rollers <b>1402</b>. The light is reflected off of reflector <b>1420</b> and returns to light generator/sensor <b>1418</b> is detected by the sensor portion of light generator/sensor <b>1418</b>. Light generator/sensor <b>1422</b> and reflector <b>1424</b> work in a similar manner to provide a light beam across the path of any mail trays. When the beam generated by the first light generator/sensor <b>1418</b> is broken, a computer may interpret this as indicating the presence of a tray to be sleeved. If, while this first beam is broken, the second beam generated by the second light generator/sensor <b>1422</b> is not broken, the system may interpret that set of conditions as indicating that a small tray (i.e. a Half size tray) is present. If, on the other hand, the first beam and the second beam are broken simultaneously, the system may interpret that to mean that a large tray (i.e. a Full size tray) is in position for sleeving. Based on these conditions, the system will decide which size sleeve the robotic arm should use for a given tray. Alternatively, a combination of MM and EMM sleeves, or EMM and Half EMM sleeves, or MM and Half MM sleeves may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Two sets of sleeve stops <b>1428</b> and <b>1430</b> are also provided. In the case of a Full size sleeve, the set of sleeve stops <b>1430</b> are raised while the set of sleeve stops <b>1428</b> are lowered to prevent the sleeve from coming off of the tray induction system during insertion of the tray. The stops also prevent the tray from passing too far through the sleeve. In the case of a Half size sleeve, the set of sleeve stops <b>1428</b> will be raised to retain the sleeve and tray. Sleeve stops may be arranged in a variety of ways to accommodate any combination of MM, EMM, or Half MM trays and sleeves.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">While optical sensors are disclosed, weight and electromagnetic sensors may also be employed. Further many portions of the conveyor system could be used without being directly coupled to the conveyor. For example, sensors or mechanical stops could be mounted to other equipment or surfaces and not to the conveyor frame. Additionally, optical sensors including photo-eyes may be used to determine if the tray induction system has been cleared before the system attempts to sleeve another tray. Such optical sensors may also be used to monitor the stock of sleeves available in the cartridges.</p>
