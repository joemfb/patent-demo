<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Botanical designation: The present invention relates to a new, novel and distinct variety of nectarine tree, <i>Prunus persica </i>(subspecies <i>nucipersica</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Varietal denomination: &#x2018;Burnecttwentyfive.&#x2019;</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE NEW VARIETY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present variety of nectarine tree resulted from an on-going program of fruit and nut tree breeding. The purpose of this program is to improve the commercial quality of available deciduous fruit and nut varieties, and rootstocks, by creating and releasing promising selections of <i>Prunus, Malus </i>and <i>Juglans </i>species. To this end we make both controlled and hybrid cross pollinations each year in order to produce seedling populations from which improved progenies are evaluated and selected.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">ORIGIN</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The seedling &#x2018;Burnecttwentyfive&#x2019; was originated by us from a population of seedlings grown in our experimental orchards located near Fowler, Calif. The seedlings, grown on their own roots, were the result of a controlled cross made in February of 2004 of a seedling of the yellow-fleshed clingstone nectarine tree &#x201c;Burnectseven&#x201d; (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13,589) which was the seed parent, and an unnamed Burchell seedling, E25.071 nectarine tree which was the pollen parent. Within this seedling population one seedling, which is the present variety, exhibited especially desirable characteristics, and was designated as &#x2018;N8.068&#x2019;. This seedling was marked for subsequent observation. After the 2006 fruiting season the new variety of nectarine tree was selected for advanced evaluation and repropagation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Asexual reproduction of the new and distinct variety of nectarine tree was accomplished by budding the new nectarine tree to &#x2018;Nemared&#x2019; Rootstock (USDA, non-patented). This was performed by us in our experimental orchard which is located near Fowler, Calif. Subsequent evaluations have shown those asexual reproductions run true to the original tree. All characteristics of the original tree, and its fruit, were established, and appear to be transmitted through succeeding asexual propagations.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE VARIETY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">&#x2018;Burnecttwentyfive&#x2019; is a new and distinct variety of nectarine tree, which is considered of large size, and which has vigorous growth. This new nectarine tree variety is also a regular and productive bearer of relatively large, firm, acidic, yellow fleshed, melting, clingstone fruit which have good flavor and eating quality. The tree of the present variety displays a medium chilling requirement of approximately 650 hours or more. Still further, the present tree also produces relatively uniformly sized fruit throughout the tree. Additionally, the fruit produced by the present tree has a very high degree of red skin coloration, a firm, yet melting flesh and appears to have good handling and shipping qualities. The &#x2018;Burnecttwentyfive&#x2019; Nectarine tree bears fruit which are ripe for commercial harvesting and shipment on approximately July 14 to July 21 under the ecological conditions prevailing in the San Joaquin Valley of central California. In relative comparison to the seed parent tree (&#x2018;Burnectseven&#x2019; U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13,589), the &#x2018;Burnecttwentyfive&#x2019; Nectarine tree produces a nectarine which exhibits 20-40% more external red blush coloration than the seed parent. In relative comparison to the pollen parent tree E25.071, (unpatented) the &#x2018;Burnecttwentyfive&#x2019; nectarine ripens approximately 7-10 days earlier. In addition, the present new nectarine tree produces fruit approximately 3-7 millimeters larger and requires approximately 150 less chill units than the nectarine tree &#x2018;Summer Fire&#x2019; (U.S. Pat. No. 7,506), which is the most similar commercial variety in ripening date known to the breeders at this time. The lower chilling requirement of the present, new variety allows it to produce more flower buds than the nectarine tree &#x2018;Summer Fire&#x2019; (U.S. Pat. No. 7,506), and subsequently the &#x2018;Burnecttwentyfive&#x2019; tree has exhibited the potential to produce larger crops.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The accompanying drawing, which is provided, is a color photograph of the new variety of nectarine tree. The photograph depicts two whole mature fruit, and one mature fruit which is dissected substantially in the equatorial plane, and which is seen from the apical perspective. This photograph also reveals the flesh and the stone characteristics thereof. The external coloration of the fruit, as shown, is sufficiently matured for harvesting and shipment. Additionally, the photograph displays a sample vegetative shoot bearing typical leaves; and a typical stone; with the flesh removed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The colors in the photograph are as nearly true as is reasonably possible in a color representation of this type. Due to chemical development, processing, and printing, the leaves and fruit depicted in these photographs may or may not be accurate when compared to the actual specimen. For this reason, future color references should be made to the color plates (Royal Horticultural Society Fourth Edition, 2001) and the descriptions provided, hereinafter.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">NOT A COMMERCIAL WARRANTY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following detailed description has been prepared to solely comply with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;112, and does not constitute a commercial warranty, (either expressed or implied), that the present variety will in the future display all the botanical, pomological or other characteristics as set forth, hereinafter. Therefore, this disclosure may not be relied upon to support any future legal claims including, but not limited to, breach of warranty of merchantability, or fitness for any particular purpose, or non-infringement which is directed, in whole, or in part, to the present variety.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring more specifically to the pomological details of this new and distinct variety of nectarine tree, the following has been observed during the sixth fruiting season under the ecological conditions prevailing at orchards located near the town of Fowler, county of Fresno, state of Calif. All major color code designations are by reference to The R.H.S. Color Chart (Fourth Edition, 2001.) provided by The Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain. Common color names are also occasionally used.</p>

            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0011"><i>Size.&#x2014;</i>Generally &#x2014; Considered medium-large as compared to other common commercial nectarine cultivars ripening in the same season of maturity. The tree of the present variety was pruned to a height of approximately 300.0 cm to about 310.0 cm at maturity. The average spread of the new tree is approximately 4.7 meters when measured during the fifth year of growth.</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0012"><i>Vigor.&#x2014;</i>Considered moderately vigorous. The present variety grew from about 150.0 cm to 155.0 cm in height during the first growing season. The new nectarine tree variety was pruned to a height of approximately 140.0 cm during the first dormant season, and primary scaffolds were then selected for the desired tree structure.</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0013"><i>Productivity.&#x2014;</i>Productive. The fruit set varies from 1.5 to several times more than the desired crop load. The fruit set is spaced by thinning to develop the remaining fruit into the desired market-sized fruit. The number of the fruit set varies with the prevailing climatic conditions, and the current cultural practices employed during the bloom period. Therefore, this characteristic is not distinctive of this new variety.</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0014"><i>Bearer.&#x2014;</i>Regular. Fruit set has been heavy, and significant thinning was necessary during the past 5 growing seasons.</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0015"><i>Form.&#x2014;</i>Upright, and pruned into a vase shape.</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0016"><i>Density.&#x2014;</i>Considered medium dense. It has been discovered that pruning the branches from the center of the tree to obtain a resulting vase shape allows for proper air movement in the tree, and appropriate amounts of sunlight to enhance fruit color and renewal of fruiting wood throughout the entire tree.</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0017"><i>Hardiness.&#x2014;</i>The present tree was grown and evaluated in USDA Hardiness Zone 9. The winter chilling requirements of the new tree are approximately 650 hours at a temperature below 7.0 degrees C. The present variety appears to be hardy under typical Central San Joaquin Valley climatic conditions.</li>

            <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0020"><i>Lenticels.&#x2014;</i>Numerous flat, oval lenticels are present. The lenticels range in size from approximately 4.0 to about 8.0 millimeters in width; and from about 1.0 to about 2.0 millimeters in height. It should be noted that as the bark of the trees mature, the lenticels become less apparent and also less abundant.</li>
            <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0021"><i>Lenticel color.&#x2014;</i>Considered an Orange-Brown, (RHS Greyed-Orange Group 166 D).</li>
