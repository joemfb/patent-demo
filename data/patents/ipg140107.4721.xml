<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plain view illustrating a configuration of an earphone antenna of a portable terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating a configuration of an earphone of a portable terminal which employs an earphone antenna according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an earphone antenna of a portable terminal is described. The earphone antenna of the portable terminal includes a plurality of voice signal lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, an insulating sheath <b>26</b>, a receptacle <b>27</b> and a ground and antenna line <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The plurality of the voice signal lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>are located in a central part of the earphone antenna of the portable terminal. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two voice signal lines are illustrated; however, it should be noted that three or more voice signal lines can be included. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, two microphones (MIC+, MIC&#x2212;) (third and fourth pin lines) and two speakers (SPK_L, SPK_R) (fifth and sixth pin lines) can be used. Each of the voice signal lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>are covered by insulators <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plurality of the voice signal lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>are connected to a connector assembly <b>31</b>, which is connected to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly <b>32</b> through shielded connectors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The insulating sheath <b>26</b> covers outer surfaces of the plurality of the voice signal lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and one end of each of the plurality of the voice signal lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected to one end <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the receptacle <b>27</b>, which houses the PCB assembly <b>32</b>. The other end <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the receptacle <b>27</b> can be detachably connected to an earphone line (not shown), or alternatively, connected to the earphone line as one body.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An antenna line according to an exemplary implementation is a ground and antenna line, which uses a ground line as an antenna line, such as a second pin line shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The ground and antenna line <b>28</b> includes a first antenna line <b>28</b><i>a </i>and a second antenna line <b>28</b><i>b </i>that are connected to each other. The first antenna line <b>28</b><i>a </i>having a first thickness t<b>1</b> winds around an outer surface of the insulating sheath <b>26</b> at a first interval w<b>1</b>. The second antenna line <b>28</b><i>b </i>having a second thickness t<b>2</b> winds around an outer surface of the receptacle <b>27</b> at a second interval w<b>2</b>, the second interval w<b>2</b> being different from the first interval w<b>1</b> and the second thickness t<b>2</b> being greater than the first thickness t<b>1</b>. The second interval w<b>2</b> is determined such that a resonance point of the ground and antenna line <b>28</b> is produced, i.e., matching a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) value close to 1:1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second interval w<b>2</b> is greater than the first interval w<b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, only the first antenna line of the ground and antenna line <b>28</b> is shown and the second antenna line is omitted for conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the earphone antenna of the portable terminal according to an exemplary implementation, reducing a length of the earphone is possible because the second antenna line <b>28</b><i>b </i>covers the outer surface of the receptacle <b>27</b>, even if the ground and antenna line <b>28</b> of the earphone antenna of the portable terminal has the same length as an antenna line of the conventional earphone antenna of the portable terminal.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Table 1 represents reception sensitivity of a subject measured when the portable terminal is not gripped by a hand, and Table 2 represents reception sensitivity of the subject measured when the portable terminal is gripped by the hand. An increase in an absolute value of the reception sensitivity in a negative number indicates higher reception performance of the earphone antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in Table 1, in a case of the portable terminal that is not gripped by the hand, the earphone antenna of the portable terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention has enhanced performance than the conventional earphone antenna and shows reception performance not much lower than that of the exclusive external antenna. In addition, as shown in Table 2, when the portable terminal is gripped by the hand and the earphone is placed in an ear, the earphone antenna of the portable terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention has enhanced performance than the conventional earphone antenna and shows similar reception performance as that of the exclusive external antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the earphone antenna of the portable terminal, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, uses the ground and antenna line instead of using a separate antenna line, thereby reducing manufacturing costs compared with the conventional earphone antenna of the portable terminal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, by using the second antenna line having a thickness greater than that of the first antenna line and positioned on an outer surface of the receptacle or an outer surface of the insulating sheath adjacent to the receptacle at an interval different from that of the first antenna line, a higher reception sensitivity can be achieved even when a wearing state of the earphone of the portable terminal is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the present art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
