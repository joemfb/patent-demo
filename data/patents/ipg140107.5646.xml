<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention was made with Government support under W911NF-06-3-0001 awarded by United States Army. The Government has certain rights to this invention.</p>
<?GOVINT description="Government Interest" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to systems and methods for determining query paths in ad-hoc distributed database systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to automated query path reporting in distributed databases.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Distributed databases include multiple databases accessible via a network or other interconnection by a querying computing node. The distributed databases may be logically distributed across multiple access or network domains and may be geographically distributed across physical locations. The querying computing node often uses a centralized registry to identify databases and physical data structures within the identified databases. The physical data structures are identified and accessible globally by name. Queries are issued to an identified database using an identified global name of a physical data structure. Query results are returned from the identified database in response to the issued query.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The subject matter described herein provides automated query path reporting in ad-hoc distributed databases. For purposes of the present subject matter, &#x201c;ad-hoc&#x201d; encompasses systems that are fit for purposes of the present subject matter with any kind of connection strategy that may be employed. A logical data structure (e.g., table) and at least one route tracing indicator are transmitted in association with a distributed database query. A route tracing indicator includes an identifier instructing a processing node to obtain route tracing information, such as &#x201c;from node,&#x201d; &#x201c;to node,&#x201d; depth, precedence, and row count identifiers. A query response is received including distributed route tracing information associated with each distributed database node that processed the database query. The distributed route tracing information may include a query depth and a row count of the query for each node. The query may be received from more than one path at any node and route arrival precedence information may be determined and appended to the distributed route tracing information. The received distributed route tracing information is processed to characterize dynamic query route propagation, in one example by aggregating the received distributed route tracing information. The characterized dynamic query route propagation may be further translated into a graphical route tracing representation. Further analysis may be performed on the dynamic query route propagation to evaluate query propagation loops or other query propagation characteristics within the distributed database system.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The examples set forth below represent the necessary information to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and illustrate the best mode of practicing the invention. Upon reading the following description in light of the accompanying drawing figures, those skilled in the art will understand the concepts of the invention and will recognize applications of these concepts not particularly addressed herein. It should be understood that these concepts and applications fall within the scope of the disclosure and the accompanying claims.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The subject matter described herein provides automated query path reporting in ad-hoc distributed databases. For purposes of the present subject matter, &#x201c;ad-hoc&#x201d; encompasses systems that are fit for purposes of the present subject matter with any kind of connection strategy that may be employed. A logical data structure (e.g., table) and at least one route tracing indicator are transmitted in association with a distributed database query. A route tracing indicator includes an identifier instructing a processing node to obtain route tracing information, such as &#x201c;from node,&#x201d; &#x201c;to node,&#x201d; depth, precedence, and row count identifiers. A query response is received including distributed route tracing information associated with each distributed database node that processed the database query. The distributed route tracing information may include a query depth and a row count of the query for each node. The query may be received from more than one path at any node and route arrival precedence information may be determined and appended to the distributed route tracing information. The received distributed route tracing information is processed to characterize dynamic query route propagation, in one example by aggregating the received distributed route tracing information. The characterized dynamic query route propagation may be further translated into a graphical route tracing representation. Further analysis may be performed on the dynamic query route propagation to evaluate query propagation loops or other query propagation characteristics within the distributed database system.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The automated query path reporting in distributed databases described herein may be performed in real time to allow prompt reporting of query path route tracing information. For purposes of the present description, real time shall include any time frame of sufficiently short duration as to provide reasonable response time for information processing acceptable to a user of the subject matter described. Additionally, the term &#x201c;real time&#x201d; shall include what is commonly termed &#x201c;near real time&#x201d;&#x2014;generally meaning any time frame of sufficiently short duration as to provide reasonable response time for on demand information processing acceptable to a user of the subject matter described (e.g., within a few seconds or less than ten seconds or so in certain systems). These terms, while difficult to precisely define are well understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an example of an implementation of a system <b>100</b> for automated query path reporting in distributed databases. Within the system <b>100</b>, a database management system_<b>1</b> (DBMS_<b>1</b>) <b>102</b>, a DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>, a DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>, a DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b>, a DBMS_<b>5</b> <b>110</b>, up to a DBMS_N <b>112</b> are illustrated. The DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> are each associated with a database <b>114</b>, a database <b>116</b>, a database <b>118</b>, a database <b>120</b>, a database <b>122</b>, up to a database <b>124</b>, respectively. The DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> are interconnected via a network <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For purposes of the present description, it should be noted that while the network <b>126</b> is illustrated as interconnecting the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> with each other, this should not be considered limiting. The network <b>126</b> may be formed by any interconnection appropriate for use in a distributed database environment. For example, the network <b>126</b> may include any form of interconnection suitable for the intended purpose, including a private or public network such as an intranet or the Internet, respectively, direct inter-module interconnection, dial-up, or any other interconnection mechanism capable of interconnecting the devices with the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As such, any two or more of the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> may be interconnected by proximity, interconnection, or routing capabilities within the system <b>100</b>, while certain other of the devices may not have interconnectivity other than via other distributed database devices. Accordingly, certain of the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> may not be capable of communication with one another other than via the other distributed database devices.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As will be described in more detail below in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 6</figref> below, the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> provide automated query path reporting within the system <b>100</b>. The automated query path reporting in distributed databases is based upon propagation of distributed route tracing information in association with database queries.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be noted that the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> may be any type of device configurable for storage of information and distributed interconnectivity for database-style queries. For example, the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b> may include devices such as a personal computer (e.g., desktop, laptop, palm, etc.) or a handheld device (e.g., cellular telephone, personal digital assistant (PDA), email device, music recording or playback device, etc.), or any other device capable of processing information as described above and in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an example of an implementation of the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> that is capable of performing automated query path reporting based upon propagation of distributed route tracing information in association with a database query within a distributed database system, such as the system <b>100</b>. A central processing unit (CPU) <b>200</b> provides computer instruction execution, computation, and other capabilities within the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>. A display <b>202</b> provides visual information to a user of the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> and an input device <b>204</b> provides input capabilities for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The display <b>202</b> may include any display device, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), light emitting diode (LED), projection, touchscreen, or other display element or panel. The input device <b>204</b> may include a computer keyboard, a keypad, a mouse, a pen, a joystick, or any other type of input device by which the user may interact with and respond to information on the display <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be noted that the display <b>202</b> and the input device <b>204</b> are illustrated with a dashed-line representation within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to indicate that they are not required components for the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> may operate as a completely automated embedded device without user configurability or feedback. However, the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> may also provide user feedback and configurability via the display <b>202</b> and the input device <b>204</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A communication module <b>206</b> provides interconnection capabilities that allow the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> to communicate with other modules within the system <b>100</b>, such as the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b>, to perform query path reporting within the system <b>100</b>. The communication module <b>206</b> may include any electrical, protocol, and protocol conversion capabilities usable to provide the interconnection capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A memory <b>208</b> includes a matching criteria storage area <b>210</b> that stores information usable to identify processing preferences or priorities for non-conflicting queries within the system <b>100</b>. The matching criteria stored within the matching criteria storage area <b>210</b> are used to configure and control query data selection and processing, query forwarding, and query responses. The memory <b>208</b> also includes a query path reporting storage area <b>212</b> that stores query path reporting information, usable to determine and characterize dynamic query path propagation within the system <b>100</b>. As will be described in more detail below, the query path reporting information stored within the query path reporting storage area <b>212</b> is used to identify shortest query routing paths, to identify query propagation loops, and to perform other analysis on dynamic query propagation within the system <b>100</b>. The query path reporting information may also be used to optimize routing within a distributed database system, such as the system <b>100</b>, and to determine whether a re-distribution of data may improve query processing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A non-conflicting query propagation module <b>214</b> is illustrated. The non-conflicting query propagation module <b>214</b> provides query processing, query forwarding, and query response capabilities for the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>. A query path reporting module <b>216</b> is also illustrated. The query path reporting module <b>216</b> provides the query path determination and characterization capabilities for distributed database devices, such as the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>, as described above and in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Though the communication module <b>206</b>, the non-conflicting query propagation module <b>214</b>, and the query path reporting module <b>216</b> are illustrated as component-level modules for ease of illustration and description purposes, it should be noted that these modules include any hardware, programmed processor(s), and memory used to carry out the respective functions of the modules as described above and in more detail below. For example, the communication module <b>206</b>, the non-conflicting query propagation module <b>214</b>, and the query path reporting module <b>216</b> may include additional controller circuitry in the form of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), processors, antennas, and/or discrete integrated circuits and components for performing communication and electrical control activities associated with the respective modules. Additionally, the communication module <b>206</b>, the non-conflicting query propagation module <b>214</b>, and the query path reporting module <b>216</b> also include interrupt-level, stack-level, and application-level modules as appropriate. Furthermore, these modules include any memory components used for storage, execution, and data processing for performing processing activities associated with the respective modules. The communication module <b>206</b>, the non-conflicting query propagation module <b>214</b>, and the query path reporting module <b>216</b> may also form a portion of other circuitry described without departure from the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The database <b>114</b> provides storage capabilities for information associated with the automated propagation of non-conflicting queries and query path reporting capabilities of the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>. The database <b>114</b> includes a database catalog storage area <b>218</b>, a logical table definition storage area <b>220</b>, a physical table storage area <b>222</b>, and a query path storage area <b>224</b> that may be stored in the form of tables or other arrangements accessible by the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The database catalog storage area <b>218</b> stores information associated with logical tables stored at other database management systems, such as the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b>, within the system <b>100</b>. The information stored within the database catalog storage area <b>218</b> may be compiled in response to queries of other database nodes within the system <b>100</b> for logical table definitions stored at those other nodes. As such, the DMBS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> may determine and store logical table definitions for other nodes within the system <b>100</b> for use during query processing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The logical table definition storage area <b>220</b> stores information about logical tables stored locally to the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>. The logical tables map to physical data and physical tables stored within the physical table storage area <b>222</b>. The physical table storage area <b>222</b> stores physical tables that may or may not be federated within a distributed database system, such as the system <b>100</b>, based upon mappings defined within the respective logical table definition storage area <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The query path storage area <b>224</b> stores information associated with the received distributed route tracing information for distributed database queries as identified by the query path reporting module <b>216</b>. As will be described in more detail below beginning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, logical table definitions are associated with database queries. Upon receipt of a database query, the receiving distributed database node, such as the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b>, determines whether a route tracing indicator is present in association with a logical table received with the query. The route tracing indicator may be, for example, and indicator requesting a query path depth and/or a row count associated with the query. The DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> creates or appends distributed route tracing information and first arrival precedence to a response to the query. The query path depth represents the number of nodes that processed the query prior to the receiving node.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The receiving node also determines whether the query has been received from a different distributed database node prior to receiving the present query. In response to determining that the query has been received from a different node, a query path depth is again determined and the node compares the query path depth of the present path to a shortest query path. The shortest query path is set based upon first receipt of the query and is updated any time a second receipt of the query arrives on a shorter path. As such, the shortest path comparison provides information about routing for use in determining whether the query was later-received via a longer or a shorter query path. Second arrival precedence information is created to identify the relative precedence of the second path the query was received from and may include setting the second path as the shortest path. The arrival precedence information is appended to the created distributed route tracing information and the response is returned to the forwarding node. The query may be forwarded to any other interconnected distributed database node that has not previously sent the query to the receiving node. Upon receipt of the distributed route tracing information and any associated arrival precedence information, the originating node processes the received distributed route tracing information and any associated arrival precedence information to characterize dynamic query route propagation within a distributed network of databases, such as the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The originating node or any intermediate node may process received and locally-created route tracing information and arrival precedence information for query path reporting and analysis purposes. Any determined and/or characterized dynamic query route propagation information may be stored within the query path storage area <b>224</b> and may be forwarded to other distributed database nodes to distribute determined route tracing and reporting information.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is understood that the memory <b>208</b> may include any combination of volatile and non-volatile memory suitable for the intended purpose, distributed or localized as appropriate, and may include other memory segments not illustrated within the present example for ease of illustration purposes. For example, the memory <b>208</b> may include a code storage area, a code execution area, and a data area without departure from the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The CPU <b>200</b>, the display <b>202</b>, the input device <b>204</b>, the communication module <b>206</b>, the memory <b>208</b>, the non-conflicting query propagation module <b>214</b>, the query path reporting module <b>216</b>, and the database <b>114</b> are interconnected via an interconnection <b>226</b>. The interconnection <b>226</b> may include a system bus, a network, or any other interconnection capable of providing the respective components with suitable interconnection for the respective purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> is illustrated with and has certain components described, other modules and components may be associated with the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> without departure from the scope of the present subject matter. Additionally, it should be noted that, while the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> is described as a single device for ease of illustration purposes, the components within the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> may be co-located or distributed and interconnected via a network without departure from the scope of the present subject matter. For a distributed arrangement, the display <b>202</b> and the input device <b>204</b> may be located at a point of sale device, kiosk, or other location, while the CPU <b>200</b> and memory <b>208</b> may be located at a local or remote server. Many other possible arrangements for components of the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> are possible and all are considered within the scope of the present subject matter. It should also be understood that, though the database catalog storage area <b>218</b>, the logical table definition storage area <b>220</b>, the physical table storage area <b>222</b>, and the query path storage area <b>224</b> are shown within the database <b>114</b>, they may also be stored within the memory <b>208</b> without departure from the scope of the present subject matter. Accordingly, the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> may take many forms and may be associated with many platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an example interconnection of components within the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to further illustrate an example of automated query path reporting based upon propagation of distributed route tracing information in association with a database query within the system <b>100</b>. It is understood that many other types of query path reporting are possible, such as query depth reporting, and query row count reporting, query precedence reporting, and other types of query path reporting. As such, all possible types of query path reporting are considered within the scope of the present subject matter and the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides sufficient detail for a person of skill in the art to make and use other types of query path reporting.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the general representation of the network <b>126</b> has been replaced with a connection <b>302</b> interconnecting the DMBS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> and the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>. Additionally, a connection <b>304</b> interconnects the DMBS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> and the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> and a connection <b>306</b> interconnects the DMBS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> and the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> is shown issuing a &#x201c;Query1.&#x201d; It is understood that the Query1 includes a logical table definition including at least one route tracing indicator, as will be described in more detail below. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the logical table definition storage areas <b>216</b> of each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> are not shown for ease of illustration purposes. However, it is understood that each distributed database node processes the Query1 upon receipt by comparing a logical table definition received with the Query1 with a locally-defined logical table definition stored within the respective logical table definition storage areas <b>216</b> to determine whether there is a match for query processing purposes. Accordingly, for purposes of the present example, it is assumed that a matching logical table exists at each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> for processing of the Query1.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Continuing with the present example, the following detailed query example elaborates upon the query path reporting associated with the present subject matter. For purposes of the present example, the Query1 issued by DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> is assumed to be formed as shown in the following pseudo-query format including a request for a set of columns that represent qualitative information desired from the Query1.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As can be seen from the pseudo-query format for the example Query1, a query is formed using a &#x201c;select&#x201d; query identifier. The identifiers following the select query identifier in capital letters (e.g., FROM_NODE, TO_NODE, PRECEDENCE, DEPTH, and ROW_COUNT) represent qualitative route tracing indicators that identify the qualitative route tracing information to be returned in response to the Query1.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The qualitative route tracing indicator &#x201c;FROM_NODE&#x201d; represents a node identifier or node name associated with the node from which the Query1 was received for any node that processes the Query1. The qualitative route tracing indicator &#x201c;TO_NODE&#x201d; represents a node identifier or node name associated with the node that receives and processes the Query1.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The qualitative route tracing indicator &#x201c;DEPTH&#x201d; represents a number of database steps (e.g., forwards of the Query1) to the node that is processing the Query1. Accordingly, for the node that originates the Query1 and executes it against its local database, the depth is considered zero (0). For a node that receives the Query1 from the originating node, the depth is considered to be one (1). For nodes that receive the query when forwarded from a node with a depth of one, the depth is considered to be two (2), etc. Accordingly, each forwarding operation increases the depth of the query path reported by one integer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The qualitative route tracing indicator &#x201c;PRECEDENCE&#x201d; represents an order in which the Query1 is received for a given result row for the Query1. For example, a node that receives the Query1 may receive the Query1 from more than one distributed database node within the system <b>100</b>. As such, for purposes of the present example, the first receipt of the Query1 is marked with an &#x201c;F,&#x201d; for &#x201c;first,&#x201d; and subsequent receipts may be marked according to characteristics of the routing traversed by the Query1 to the receiving node. If the Query1 is received on a path that is longer than the current shortest path for the Query1, this second receipt of the Query1 may be marked with an &#x201c;L,&#x201d; for &#x201c;longer.&#x201d; This determination may also be based upon depth of the respective queries. If the Query1 is received on a path that is shorter than the current shortest path for the Query1, this receipt of the Query1 may be marked with an &#x201c;S,&#x201d; for &#x201c;shorter.&#x201d; This determination may also be based upon depth of the respective queries. Accordingly, qualitative route tracing information about query routing may be documented by the receiving nodes and this information returned in response to the Query1 for query route analysis purposes. Many other types of qualitative information may be gathered at distributed database nodes and returned in response to a query path reporting operation. Accordingly, gathering and analyzing any such qualitative information is considered within the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The qualitative route tracing indicator &#x201c;ROW_COUNT&#x201d; represents a number of rows that would be returned by an actual data query executed against the logical table associated with the Query1. The row count allows qualitative information about the distribution of data within a distributed database system, such as the system <b>100</b>, to be collected and analyzed. Based upon the collected information about the distribution of data, a determination may be made to re-distributed data storage within the system <b>100</b> to improve query response time or for other data processing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The Query1 instructs receiving distributed database nodes to use logical table definitions for fulfillment of the Query1 with the phrase &#x201c;from logical table&#x201d; within the Query1. The identified logical table is shown within single quotation marks. As such, the Query1 requests the receiving nodes to identify data and report route tracing information regarding data that would be returned for a logical table-based data query associated with a logical table named &#x201c;LT1.&#x201d; As described above, for purposes of the present example, it is assumed that each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> has a logical table named &#x201c;LT1&#x201d; stored within the respective logical table definition storage area <b>220</b> that maps to physical data, such as a physical table stored within the respective physical table storage area <b>222</b>. The second reference to &#x201c;LT1&#x201d; within the Query1 is an alias to a composite name for the logical table, again listed as &#x201c;LT1&#x201d; within the present example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A query suffix &#x201c;where COL1&#x3c;&#x2018;10&#x2019;&#x201d; allows a theoretical result set to be identified within the Query1 for processing at the distributed database nodes. The portion of the query suffix &#x201c;COL1&#x201d; identifies column one (1) of the associated logical table definition. The portion of the query suffix &#x201c;&#x3c;&#x2018;10&#x2019;&#x201d; identifies a data value to be used for evaluation of the query. Within the present example, this portion of the query suffix indicates to identify rows with a data value of less than ten (10). Accordingly, upon receipt of the Query1, a distributed database node identifies column one (1) of its local logical table definition that matches the logical table name (e.g., &#x201c;LT1&#x201d; in the present example) and identifies a number of rows associated with the named logical table that have a data value meeting the criterion associated with the query suffix (e.g., less than ten).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be noted that for a data-based logical table query (as opposed to the present example for query path reporting), the identifiers after the &#x201c;select&#x201d; query identifiers would represent column names associated with logical table associated with the query. In such a situation, actual data would be returned in response to a query. However, for the present example of query path reporting, the logical table column names are replaced with the route tracing indicators described above and query reporting is performed based upon the identified logical table definition. Accordingly, the present example instructs the receiving nodes to process the Query1 based upon one column (e.g., COL1) of the local logical table definition without additional information associated with data type or other criteria for processing the data portion of the Query1 for query path reporting. However, it is understood that the present example may be modified to add these other types of information and functionality without departure from the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For purposes of the present example, it is also assumed that each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> has a certain number of rows that will match the Query1 when processed at the respective node. For this example, it is assumed that the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>102</b> has three (3) rows that match the query suffix of the Query1. Likewise, it is assumed that the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> has three (3) rows that match and the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> two (2) rows that match. These query processing results obtained within the present query path reporting example based upon these assumptions for the number of rows that match at each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> will be described in more detail below in association with the description of the processing of the Query1 by each of the respective nodes. As an additional assumption for the present example Query1, it is assumed that each node waits for a response to be received from any forward operation of the Query1 before returning its local query results in response to receiving the Query1. As such, each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> compiles a result set including any data received from any downstream node(s) to facilitate aggregation of results for the present query path reporting example.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be noted that for purposes of the present description, a virtual table interface may be formed based upon the logical table definitions. The virtual table interface may be defined as a set of interfaces for representation of physical data for encapsulation and abstraction of the physical data within a distributed network of databases, such as the system <b>100</b>. Class definitions may be constructed for creation and representation of the logical table definitions. For example, a class for a query may be defined in a syntactic representation, such as Java, to accept logical table name as an argument of a class constructor. A logical table definition may also be passed as a second argument to the class constructor. Upon instantiation, a query object may be created with the logical table name and definition associated with the query object. Distributed database nodes may make calls into the query object for logical table information and processing.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should also be noted that, though the example Query1 associated with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> does not include communicated matching criteria, it is understood that the queries may be modified to include matching criteria without departure from the scope of the present subject matter. Further, matching criteria may be either communicated with the queries or may be stored locally in advance of issuance of a query. As such, default matching criteria may be established and stored within the matching criteria storage area <b>210</b> of the memory <b>208</b> at each distributed database node. For example, default matching may be strict matching for column name, column position within a logical table, column name data type, column name data precision, and other factors. Issued queries may modify default matching criteria to pass additional or alternative matching criteria instructing the receiving distributed database nodes to match based upon the additional matching criteria or to change default matching criteria. Example additional or alternative matching criteria include matching a column name in any position of a logical table, matching data precision based upon equal or greater precision within the respective logical table definitions, and other matching criteria. There are many other possible matching criteria that may be used and all are considered within the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Returning to the description of the present example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, automated query path reporting associated with the Query1 will now be described. As described above, the Query1 is originated by the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>. The Query1 is processed internally by the DMBS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> and is automatically propagated (e.g., forwarded) to other nodes for processing. Regarding the internal processing at the DMBS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>, the Query1 is compared with locally-defined logical tables to identify a local logical table named &#x201c;LT1.&#x201d; Again, the logical table definitions associated with each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> are not shown within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for ease of illustration purposes. However, it is understood that the Query1 is processed locally to identify a physical table mapped by the logical table &#x201c;LT1&#x201d; within the physical table storage area <b>222</b> (not shown) and will result in a return of qualitative information identifying a quantity of data (e.g., row count) that would be returned and other information associated with the Query1 (e.g., FROM_NODE, TO_NODE, PRECEDENCE, and DEPTH). Additional detail associated with processing of the Query1 by the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> will be described after the description of processing of the Query1 by other nodes within the present example.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It should be noted that, while no actual data values are returned from the physical or logical tables defined at the respective distributed database nodes, the qualitative information returned from each node may be used to identify characteristics of an actual logical table data-based query. As described above, the information collected may be used to determine data distribution and other organizational information about a distributed database system, such as the system <b>100</b>. It should also be noted that within an ad-hoc distributed database system, a query route may differ for each execution of a query. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> below shows an example of such a difference in routing using the query path reporting associated with the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For processing of the query suffix, the Query1 is forwarded to and is processed at each receiving node based upon the query suffix &#x201c;where COL1&#x3c;10.&#x201d; As such, routing and processing of the Query1 may be further controlled by use of the query suffix.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to processing performed by the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> upon receipt of the forwarded Query1, the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> performs a variety of operations to forward and fulfill the query path reporting request associated with the forwarded Query1. The DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> determines whether the identified logical table definition matches a local logical table definition and identifies data associated with the first column (e.g., COL1) of that logical table definition. As described above, it is assumed that the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> has a matching logical table defined. The DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> processes data within a physical table, such as a physical table stored within the physical table storage area <b>222</b>, that is mapped by the local logical table definition for &#x201c;LT1.&#x201d; The DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> identifies any rows that have data that meet any criteria associated with the query suffix described above. In the present example, it is assumed that the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> has three (3) rows that match the specified criterion (e.g., COL1&#x3c;10). For purposes of the present example, it is assumed that the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> waits for results to be returned from the forwarded query before returning results to the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Additionally, the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> determines route precedence and route depth associated with the Query1. For the present example, the Query1 was received from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> first (e.g., prior to any receipt of the Query1 from any other distributed database node). The DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> assigns a route precedence of &#x201c;F&#x201d; (e.g., first) for receipt of the Query 1 from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>. Additionally, a depth associated with the Query1 when received by the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> is one (1). Accordingly, an example response data set generated by the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> is represented within the example Row1 of the Table1 illustrated below. The data associated with the precedence, depth, and row count are illustrated within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as &#x201c;F/1/3.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> forwards the Query1 to at least one other distributed database node. Within the present example, the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> forwards the Query1 to the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b>. However, for purposes of the present example, it is assumed that the Query1 reached the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> before it is received from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>. Accordingly, processing of the Query1 by the DMBS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> as received from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> will be described before the processing associated with receipt of the Query1 from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As such, upon receipt of the Query1 from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>, the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> performs processing similar to that described in detail above for the DMBS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>. Based upon the assumed information described above for each node, the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> determines route precedence and route depth associated with the Query1. For the present example, the Query1 was received from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> first (e.g., prior to any receipt of the Query1 from any other distributed database node). The DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> assigns a route precedence of &#x201c;F&#x201d; (e.g., first) for receipt of the Query 1 from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>. Additionally, a depth associated with the Query1 when received by the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> is one (1). In the present example, it is assumed that the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> has two (2) rows that match the specified criterion (e.g., COL1&#x3c;10). Accordingly, an example response data set generated by the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> is represented within the example Row2 of the Table1 illustrated below. The data associated with the precedence, depth, and row count are illustrated within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as &#x201c;F/1/2.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above in association with the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>, the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> forwards the Query1 to at least one other distributed database node. Within the present example, the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> forwards the Query1 to the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>. As such, for purposes of the present example, each of the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> and the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> receives the Query1 from each other. The processing described above will be performed by each of the DMBS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> and the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> with the following differences. Because each node has accumulated data associated with a response to the Query1, each node will not return data in response to the second receipt of the Query1 (e.g., the row count will be zero). Additionally, the precedence will be assigned based upon the Query1 being received second from each of the respective nodes. As well, the depth will be two (2) in each case of the present example because the Query1 was forwarded twice to reach each of the respective nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, an example response data set generated by the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> is represented within the example Row3 of the Table1 illustrated below. Likewise, an example response data set generated by the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> is represented within the example Row4 of the Table1 illustrated below. The data associated with the precedence, depth, and row count for each forward of the Query1 is identical in the present example and is illustrated within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as &#x201c;L/2/0&#x201d; for each forward of the Query1.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It should be noted that the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> may receive the Query1 from either the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> or from the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> within the present example and a similar situation is present for the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b>. As such, if either node has previously received the Query1 from both interconnected devices, the respective nodes determine not to forward the Query1 any further. Accordingly, within the present example, each of the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> and the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> will not forward the Query1 further upon a determination that they have already received and processed the Query1 from all interconnected nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Additionally, because each node has determined that they have already received the Query1 and that they will not forward the Query1 to any additional node, the DMBS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> and the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> will begin the process of returning their respective result sets in response to processing the Query1. For the present example, the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> returns two rows of query path reporting information, Row1 and Row3, as illustrated in the Table1 below. Similarly, the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> returns two rows of query path reporting information, Row2 and Row4, as illustrated in the Table1 below. These result sets are returned to the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> within the present example.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Local processing of the Query1 at the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> will now be described. For purposes of the present example, the Query1 was not forwarded from another node to the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>. As such, the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> assigns the name of the query (e.g., Query1) as the &#x201c;FROM_NODE&#x201d; for its internal processing of the Query1. The DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> also assigns a route precedence of &#x201c;F&#x201d; (e.g., first) for receipt of the Query 1 based upon it being processed locally. Additionally, a depth associated with the Query1 at the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> is zero (0) because the Query1 was not forwarded by another node for processing at the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>. Accordingly, an example response data set generated by the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> is represented within the example Row5 of the Table1 illustrated below. The data associated with the precedence, depth, and row count are illustrated within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as &#x201c;F/0/8.&#x201d; The row count of eight (8) represents that three (3) rows of data were identified within the local database and that five (5) rows of data were identified at the other nodes and returned to the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> within the respective result sets described above.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The Table1 below represents the data returned as result sets from all processing operations performed on the Query1. As described above, this cumulative qualitative query path reporting information may be used to identify shortest query routing paths, to identify query propagation loops, and to perform other analysis on dynamic query propagation within the system <b>100</b>. The query path reporting information may also be used to optimize routing within a distributed database system, such as the system <b>100</b>, and to determine whether a re-distribution of data may improve query processing performance.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As can be seen from the example Table2, while the query path reporting information returned from the DMBS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> in response to the query is the same as that of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table1 above, an additional row of query path reporting information was returned. As such, DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> query path reporting information is now in example Row6 for the Table2. It can also be seen that the example Row3 is identical between the two examples. The Row3 represents the forwarding of the Query1 from the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> to the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> and there is no difference in processing of this forwarded query by the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> or the information returned by the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">However, because the Query1 was received by the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> prior to receipt from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>, all other example rows within the Table2 represent different query path reporting information. As can be seen from the example Row4 of the Table2, the query path reporting information returned from the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> in response to receipt of the Query1 from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> shows that the Query1 has a precedence value of &#x201c;F.&#x201d; The precedence information represents that the Query1 was received from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> before it was received from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Additionally, the depth value for the Row4 is two (2) indicating that the query was forwarded twice prior to receipt at the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b>. The depth value associated with processing of the Query1 received from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> at the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> is shown within the example Row2 as one (1). This difference in depth associated with the difference in precedence result in the Row2 relative to the Row4 is represented in the Row2 with a precedence value of &#x201c;S.&#x201d; The precedence value of &#x201c;S&#x201d; within the Row2 represents that the Query1 was received at the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> on a path with a larger depth value before the Query1 was received from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> on a path that with a smaller depth value (e.g., a shorter path). It should also be noted that because the Query1 was received at the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> prior to receipt from the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>, the Row2 shows that zero (0) rows would be returned from the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> to the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> in response to the a data-based query.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As also described above, for purposes of the present example, it is assumed that all nodes wait for the Query1 to fully propagate prior to returning the respective result sets. Additionally, each node responds with a row count value for the Query1 in response to the first receipt of the Query1. Accordingly, the Row4 of the Table2 shows that two (2) rows would be returned from the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> via the Query1 received from the DMBS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>. These two (2) rows are added to the three (3) that would be returned from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> in response to the Query1 processed locally by the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the example Row1 of the Table2 shows a value of five (5) rows returned from the DBMS_<b>3</b> <b>106</b> to the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Again, it should be noted that the aggregated result set shown within the example Row6 of the Table2 matches the aggregated result set shown within the example Row5 of the Table1. This would be anticipated without a change in data at the respective nodes between the sequential issuance of the Query1 within the two examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graphical representation of an example of an implementation of a query flow diagram <b>600</b> based upon the query path reporting information obtained within the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each of the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> through the DBMS_<b>4</b> <b>108</b> is illustrated with an oval representing the node within the example query flow diagram <b>600</b>. The query path reporting information from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is again represented. The graphical representation allows a user or system, such as the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>, to further process the query path reporting information obtained using the automated query path reporting in association with a database query as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For example, the graphical representation may be generated by the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> or a process associated with the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b>, such as the query path reporting module <b>216</b>, by translating the received query path reporting information into the &#x201c;dot&#x201d; language and writing to a file named &#x201c;graph.dot.&#x201d; The DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> may store the file to a memory location, such as within the memory <b>208</b> in the query path reporting storage area <b>212</b>. The query path reporting module <b>216</b> may process the &#x201c;graph.dot&#x201d; file and draw the graphical representation on the display <b>202</b> using representations within the &#x201c;graph.dot&#x201d; file.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> below describe example processes that may be executed by distributed database devices, such as the DBMS_<b>1</b> <b>102</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b>, to perform the automated query path reporting associated with the present subject matter. The example processes may be performed by modules, such as the query path reporting module <b>216</b> and/or executed by the CPU <b>200</b>, associated with distributed database devices. It should be noted that time out procedures and other error control procedures are not illustrated within the example processes described below for ease of illustration purposes. However, it is understood that all such procedures are considered to be within the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart of an example of an implementation of a process <b>700</b> for automated query path reporting in distributed databases. At block <b>702</b>, the process <b>700</b> forwards a database query including a logical table definition and at least one route tracing indicator to at least one distributed database node within a distributed network of databases. At block <b>704</b>, the process <b>700</b> receives at least one query response including distributed route tracing information associated with each distributed database node that processed the database query along a path associated with the at least one query response. At block <b>706</b>, the process <b>700</b> processes the received distributed route tracing information to characterize query route propagation within the distributed network of databases.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart of an example of an implementation of a process <b>800</b> for automated query path reporting in distributed databases based upon identification and aggregation of route tracing information and query arrival precedence. At decision point <b>802</b>, the process <b>800</b> waits for a path reporting query to be received. As described above, the path reporting query includes a logical table definition and at least one route tracing indicator. The route tracing indicator may include selection criteria, such as an indication for a &#x201c;from node,&#x201d; a &#x201c;to node,&#x201d; a precedence, a depth, and/or a row count, to be returned, as described above. A query may be originated at a distributed database node and processed locally or received from another distributed database node within a distributed database system, such as the system <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the determination at decision point <b>802</b> may be based upon receipt of a query under any such source.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When a determination is made at decision point <b>802</b> that a query has been received, the process <b>800</b> forwards the path reporting query to at least one other distributed database node at block <b>804</b>. It should be noted that, though the path reporting query is forwarded at block <b>804</b>, further processing may be performed to determine whether to forward the query. For example, the query may be forwarded to satisfy a maximum depth constraint, resilience (e.g., forwarded previously but failed to execute), and for other purposes. Additional processing for these activities is not shown within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for ease of illustration purposes. However, it is understood than any such additional processing is within the scope of the present subject matter. At block <b>806</b>, the process <b>800</b> processes the received query using the route tracing indicator(s) received with the query. Processing of the received query may include mapping the database query into a &#x201c;count&#x201d; query and executing the count query against a local database, such as the database <b>114</b>. The count query may return a number of rows that match the count query criteria. The count query criteria may be derived from the query suffix, as described above in association with the example pseudo-query format.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">At block <b>808</b>, the process <b>800</b> identifies local route tracing information. The local route tracing information includes route tracing information obtained from the local distributed database node in responses to route tracing indicators requested in the query. For example, the local route tracing information may include any requested information, such as described above in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> and the Table1 and the Table2, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">At block <b>810</b>, the process <b>800</b> assigns a local route precedence to the received query and assigns a present query path depth as the shortest path. For purposes of the present example, the query that is being processed is the first query received. As such, the query is assigned a precedence of first (e.g., &#x201c;F&#x201d;). Additionally, because it is assumed for purposes of the present example that the query that is being processed is the first query received, the query path depth associated with the present query path may be assigned to the &#x201c;shortest&#x201d; query path without further processing. At block <b>812</b>, the process <b>800</b> creates a local result set for the processed query. The result set includes at least one row of query path reporting information (e.g., row count, precedence, depth, from node, to node, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">At decision point <b>814</b>, the process <b>800</b> waits for a response to be received for the forwarded query. The response includes a result set associated with each node that processed the query along a path associated with the query. The response set is based upon database processing and forwarding operations at any such downstream nodes that have processed the query. For example, the response set may include distributed route tracing information and distributed arrival precedence information. The distributed arrival precedence information indicates receipt of the query by at least one downstream node from more than one node. Such a condition represents an example of a loop condition and this information may be used for subsequent query route characterization and optimization. As described above in association with other examples, for purposes of the present example, it is assumed that each distributed database node waits for a result set to be returned prior to returning any result set in response to a received query. When the process <b>800</b> makes a determination that a query response including a result set has been received at decision point <b>814</b>, the process <b>800</b> aggregates the local route tracing information with the received route tracing information at block <b>816</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At decision point <b>818</b>, the process <b>800</b> makes a determination as to whether the query received at decision point <b>802</b> has been received from another distributed database node. It should be noted that the receipt of query, including a second receipt of a query from a different distributed database node, may be asynchronous with respect to the example processing described in association with the process <b>800</b>. As such, the location of the decision point <b>818</b> within the example process <b>800</b> is for ease of illustration purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When a determination is made that the query has not been received from another distributed database node, the process <b>800</b> makes a determination at decision point <b>820</b> as to whether to process the aggregated result set locally to characterize dynamic query route propagation within a distributed network of databases, such as the system <b>100</b>, or to forward the aggregated result set for processing at another distributed database node or at an application-level module associated with the local distributed database node. When a determination is made not to process the aggregated result set locally, the process <b>800</b> forwards the result set for processing at block <b>822</b> and the process <b>800</b> returns to decision point <b>802</b> to continue processing as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Returning to the description of decision point <b>818</b>, when a determination is made that the query received at decision point <b>802</b> has been received from another distributed database node, the process <b>800</b> determines a query path depth associated with the most-recently received query relative to a previous shortest path for the query and assigns the present path as the shortest path if it is shorter than the previous shortest path at block <b>824</b>. Within the present example, it is assumed that the process <b>800</b> has received the query once previously at decision point <b>802</b> and that the depth of the query when received at decision point <b>802</b> is the present shortest path against which the most-recently received query is evaluated. As described above in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the difference in depth is used to determine a second local route precedence (e.g., &#x201c;L&#x201d; for longer or &#x201c;S&#x201d; for shorter). At block <b>826</b>, the process <b>800</b> assigns the determined second local route precedence and aggregates the assigned second local route precedence to the local result set. It should be noted that, as described above, the route tracing information generated will have a row count of zero (0) for second and subsequent receipts of the query. The process <b>800</b> continues to decision point <b>820</b> to make the determination as to whether to process the aggregated result set locally to characterize dynamic query route propagation within a distributed network of databases, such as the system <b>100</b>, or to forward the aggregated result set for processing at another distributed database node or at an application-level module associated with the local distributed database node.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Returning to the description of the decision point <b>820</b>, in response to a determination to process the aggregated result set locally, the process <b>800</b> translates the aggregated route tracing information into a graphical route tracing representation at block <b>828</b>. The graphical route tracing information may be displayed upon a display device, such as the display <b>202</b>, or forwarded to another node or application-level module for analysis and further processing. The process <b>800</b> returns to decision point <b>802</b> to continue processing as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is further understood that additional analysis of the aggregated route tracing information may be performed to determine data distribution and other characteristics of the distributed database nodes within the system <b>100</b>. For example, based upon analysis of the aggregated route tracing information, a re-distribution of data among distributed database nodes, such as the DBMS_<b>2</b> <b>104</b> through the DBMS_N <b>112</b>, may be performed. Additional processing associated with such additional processing is not shown within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for ease of illustration purposes. However, it is understood that any such additional processing is considered within the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As such, the process <b>800</b> provides automated query path reporting in distributed databases based upon identification and aggregation of route tracing information and query arrival precedence. Distributed query route tracing information and remote arrival precedence are received in response to forwarding of a query to at least one downstream distributed database node and local route precedence is assigned to each receipt of the query. The distributed and local route tracing information including precedence information are aggregated and processed to characterize dynamic query route propagation within a distributed network of databases.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As described above in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref>, the example systems and processes provide automated query path reporting in distributed databases. Many other variations and additional activities associated with automated query path reporting are possible and all are considered within the scope of the present subject matter.</p>
