<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A voltage regulator permits reduced current consumption by promptly and timely stopping the operation of an inrush current protection circuit immediately after the voltage regulator is started up. The voltage regulator has an output voltage detection circuit, which issues a detection signal to actuate the inrush current protection circuit when a low voltage at an output terminal is detected at the time of starting up the voltage regulator. When it is detected that the voltage at the output terminal has reached a predetermined level, the operation of the inrush current protection circuit is stopped and a power path of the output voltage detection circuit is cut off.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a voltage regulator provided with an inrush current protection circuit and more particularly to an output voltage detection circuit that controls an inrush current protection circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional inrush current protection circuit will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram of a conventional constant-voltage circuit. The conventional constant-voltage circuit is composed of a constant-voltage source <b>401</b> and a soft start circuit. The soft start circuit has a comparator <b>404</b>, a delay circuit <b>412</b>, a constant-current source <b>407</b>, a capacitor <b>408</b>, a resistor <b>403</b>, and switches <b>402</b>, <b>410</b> and <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The contact point of the constant-current source <b>407</b> and the capacitor <b>408</b> is connected to an output terminal <b>101</b> of the constant-voltage circuit. The output terminal <b>101</b> is connected to a non-inverting input terminal of the comparator <b>404</b>, and an output terminal of the constant-voltage source <b>401</b> is connected to an inverting input terminal of the comparator <b>404</b> through the intermediary of an offset voltage <b>405</b>. An output terminal of the comparator <b>404</b> is connected to the switch <b>402</b>, the constant-current source <b>407</b>, and the delay circuit <b>412</b>. An output terminal of the delay circuit <b>412</b> is connected to the switch <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The capacitor <b>408</b> is charged by receiving constant current Ic from the constant-current source <b>407</b>. The comparator <b>404</b> compares a voltage, which is obtained by subtracting the predetermined offset voltage <b>405</b> from an output voltage of the constant-voltage source <b>401</b>, and a voltage at the contact point of the constant-current source <b>407</b> and the capacitor <b>408</b>, and outputs a signal based on the result of the comparison. If the voltage at the contact point of the constant-current source <b>407</b> and the capacitor <b>408</b> becomes higher than the voltage obtained by subtracting the predetermined offset voltage <b>405</b> from the output voltage of the constant-voltage source <b>401</b>, then the switch <b>402</b> turns on, the constant-current source <b>407</b> stops, and the delay circuit <b>412</b> starts to operate. When the switch <b>402</b> is turned on, the capacitor <b>408</b> is charged through the resistor <b>403</b> on the basis of an RC time constant by the constant-voltage source <b>401</b>. After predetermined time elapses since the signal was received from the comparator <b>404</b>, the delay circuit <b>412</b> turns the switch <b>411</b> on. When the switch <b>411</b> is turned on, the output voltage of the constant-voltage source <b>401</b> is directly output to the output terminal <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The operation of the conventional constant-voltage circuit will now be described. In the state wherein the switch <b>410</b> is on, the constant-voltage circuit is not in operation and the output voltage at the output terminal <b>101</b> is 0 volt. When the switch <b>410</b> is turned off, the constant-voltage circuit starts the operation thereof. The constant-current source <b>407</b> supplies the constant current Ic to start charging the capacitor <b>408</b> with the constant current. At this time, the output voltage at the output terminal <b>101</b> linearly rises according to the constant current Ic and the capacitance of the capacitor <b>408</b>. If the voltage charged in the capacitor <b>408</b> exceeds the voltage, which is obtained by subtracting the offset voltage <b>405</b> from the voltage of the constant-voltage source <b>401</b>, then the output signal of the comparator <b>404</b> is inverted. This causes the switch <b>402</b> to turn on and the constant-current source <b>407</b> to stop, and the delay circuit <b>412</b> to start its operation. When the constant-current source <b>407</b> stops its operation, the capacitor <b>408</b> is charged by the output voltage of the constant-voltage source <b>401</b> through the resistor <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The moment the switch <b>411</b> turns on after the elapse of the predetermined time since the delay circuit <b>412</b> was actuated, the output voltage of the constant-voltage source <b>401</b> immediately reaches the output voltage of the output terminal <b>101</b>. As described above, the output voltage of the output terminal <b>101</b> of the constant-voltage circuit gradually increases, thus allowing the output terminal <b>101</b> of the constant-voltage circuit to be protected from an inrush current (refer to, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in patent document 1).

<p id="p-0011" num="0011">However, the conventional art has been posing a problem in that current continues to be supplied to the soft start circuit after the output voltage reaches a predetermined level, thus wastefully consuming the current.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0018">Embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a voltage regulator having an inrush current protection circuit according to a first embodiment. The voltage regulator of the first embodiment is constituted of a reference voltage circuit <b>101</b>, a differential amplifier circuit <b>102</b>, an output transistor <b>104</b>, resistors <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> of a voltage-dividing circuit, an inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b>, and an output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b>. The output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b> is formed of PMOS transistors <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>, a constant-current circuit <b>204</b>, an amplifier with offset <b>201</b>, and a capacitor <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">The inverting input terminal of the differential amplifier circuit <b>102</b> is connected to one terminal of the reference voltage circuit <b>101</b>, while the non-inverting input terminal thereof is connected to the connection point of the resistors <b>105</b> and <b>106</b>, and the output terminal thereof is connected to the gate of the output transistor <b>104</b> and the output terminal of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b>. The other end of the reference voltage circuit <b>101</b> is connected to a ground terminal <b>100</b>. The amplifier with offset <b>201</b> has a non-inverting input terminal thereof connected to one terminal of the reference voltage circuit <b>101</b>, an inverting input terminal thereof connected to the connection point of the resistors <b>105</b> and <b>106</b>, and an output terminal thereof connected to the gate of the PMOS transistor <b>203</b>. The PMOS transistor <b>203</b> has a drain thereof connected to the input terminal of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> and a source thereof connected to a power supply terminal <b>150</b>. The PMOS transistor <b>202</b> has a gate thereof connected to the input terminal of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b>, a drain thereof connected to the power supply terminal of the amplifier with offset <b>201</b>, and a source thereof connected to the power supply terminal <b>150</b>. The constant-current circuit <b>204</b> has its one terminal connected to the input terminal of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> and one terminal of the capacitor <b>205</b> and its other terminal connected to the power supply terminal <b>150</b>. The other end of the capacitor <b>205</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">The operation of the voltage regulator according to the present embodiment will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">The resistors <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> divide an output voltage Vout, which is the voltage of an output terminal <b>180</b>, and output a divided voltage Vfb. The differential amplifier circuit <b>102</b> compares an output voltage Vref of the reference voltage circuit <b>101</b> with the divided voltage Vfb to control the gate voltage of the output transistor <b>104</b> such that the output voltage Vout remains constant. If the output voltage Vout is higher than a predetermined voltage, then the divided voltage Vfb will be higher than the reference voltage Vref. Further, the output signal of the differential amplifier circuit <b>102</b> (the gate voltage of the output transistor <b>104</b>) will be high and the output transistor <b>104</b> turns off, causing the output voltage Vout to fall. Thus, the output voltage Vout is controlled to remain at a constant level. If the output voltage Vout is lower than the predetermined voltage, then a reverse operation from the above is performed to increase the output voltage Vout. Thus, the output voltage Vout is controlled to remain at the constant level.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">The following will describe the operation at the startup of the supply voltage of the voltage regulator according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">Immediately after the power is turned on, the voltage at the output terminal of the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b> is a ground voltage, so that the PMOS transistor <b>202</b> turns on, supplying power to the amplifier with offset <b>201</b>. The output voltage Vout has not yet risen, so that the divided voltage Vfb is lower than the reference voltage Vref, and the amplifier with offset <b>201</b> outputs a Hi signal, causing the PMOS transistor <b>203</b> to turn off. This causes the capacitor <b>205</b> to be charged with the current of the constant-current circuit <b>204</b>, gradually increasing the voltage at the output terminal of the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b>. The inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> operates to prevent an inrush current as long as it receives a Lo signal from the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b>. The startup time of the output of the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b> depends on the current value of the constant-current circuit <b>204</b> and the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>205</b>. The startup time is set to be longer than the startup time of the voltage regulator such that the operation of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> will not stop while the voltage regulator is being started up. The operation of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> is stopped when the output of the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b> has risen to a certain level and no longer consumes current after the voltage regular has been started up. Further, the PMOS transistor <b>202</b> of the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b> turns off to stop the operation of the amplifier with offset <b>201</b>, so that no current will be consumed after the voltage regulator starts up.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">The amplifier with offset <b>201</b> adds an offset to the non-inverting input terminal such that the divided voltage Vfb becomes higher than the reference voltage Vref. This makes it possible to prevent the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> and the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b> from repeatedly turning on/off when the divided voltage Vfb reaches a level in the vicinity of the reference voltage Vref.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">As described above, the voltage regulator according to the first embodiment is capable of isolating the inrush current protection circuit promptly and timely immediately following the startup of the voltage regulator, thus making it possible to reduce current consumption by interrupting the supply of power to the output voltage detection circuit after isolating the inrush current protection circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram of a voltage regulator according to a second embodiment. The voltage regulator according to the second embodiment differs from the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in the provision of an output voltage detection circuit <b>513</b>, which has a different configuration from that of the output voltage detection circuit <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">The following will describe the configuration of the voltage regulator according to the second embodiment. The description of the same part as that of the first embodiment will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">A PMOS transistor <b>203</b> has a drain thereof connected to the input of an inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b>, a source thereof connected to a power supply terminal <b>150</b>, and a gate thereof connected to a source of an NMOS transistor <b>506</b> and a drain of an NMOS transistor <b>507</b>. A PMOS transistor <b>202</b> has a gate thereof connected to an input of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b>, a drain thereof connected to a gate of the NMOS transistor <b>506</b> and one terminal of a constant-current circuit <b>508</b>, and a source thereof connected to the power supply terminal <b>150</b>. The other terminal of the constant-current circuit <b>508</b> is connected to a ground terminal <b>100</b>. A constant-current circuit <b>204</b> has one terminal thereof connected to the input of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> and one terminal of a capacitor <b>205</b>, and has the other end thereof connected to the power supply terminal <b>150</b>. The other end of the capacitor <b>205</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>100</b>. A constant-current circuit <b>501</b> has one terminal thereof connected to a drain of the NMOS transistor <b>506</b> and the other end thereof connected to the power supply terminal <b>150</b>. The NMOS transistor <b>507</b> has a gate thereof connected to a non-inverting input terminal of a differential amplifier circuit <b>102</b> and a source thereof connected to the ground terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">The operation of the voltage regulator according to the second embodiment will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">A constant-current source <b>501</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>507</b> constitute a single-ended amplifier. An inversion threshold value of the single-ended amplifier is set to be slightly lower than a feedback voltage Vfb.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">Immediately after the power is turned on, the voltage at the output terminal of the output voltage detection circuit <b>513</b> is an earth voltage, so that the PMOS transistor <b>202</b> turns on. The voltage at the gate of the NMOS transistor <b>506</b> becomes high, so that the NMOS transistor <b>506</b> turns on, thus activating the single-ended amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">The voltage at an output terminal <b>180</b> is also the earth voltage, so that the single-ended amplifier outputs a Hi signal, turning the PMOS transistor <b>203</b> off. Hence, the current from the constant-current circuit <b>204</b> charges the capacitor <b>205</b>, gradually increasing the voltage at the output terminal of the output voltage detection circuit <b>513</b>. The inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> operates to prevent an inrush current as long as it continues to receive a Lo signal from the output voltage detection circuit <b>513</b>. The startup time of the output of the output voltage detection circuit <b>513</b> depends on the current value of the constant-current circuit <b>204</b> and the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>205</b>. The startup time is set to be longer than the startup time of the voltage regulator such that the operation of the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> will not stop while the voltage regulator is being started up.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">When the voltage at the output terminal <b>180</b> further increases until the feedback voltage Vfb exceeds the inversion threshold value of the single-ended amplifier, the output of the single-ended amplifier inverts and the Lo signal is issued. The PMOS transistor <b>203</b> turns on, causing the voltage at the output terminal of the output voltage detection circuit <b>513</b> to be switched to a Hi level, which in turn causes the inrush current protection circuit <b>103</b> to turn off. At the same time, the PMOS transistor <b>202</b> also turns off, so that the voltage at the gate of the NMOS transistor <b>506</b> is brought to the earth voltage by the constant-current circuit <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">The PMOS transistor <b>202</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>506</b> turn off, and therefore, the output voltage detection circuit <b>513</b> no longer has a current path and therefore stops consuming current.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">As described above, the voltage regulator according to the second embodiment is capable of isolating the inrush current protection circuit promptly and timely to interrupt the supply of power to the output voltage detection circuit after isolating the inrush current protection circuit, thus making it possible to reduce power consumption.</p>
