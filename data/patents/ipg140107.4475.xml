<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The exemplary wireless communication systems and devices described below employ a wireless communication system, supporting a broadcast service. Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication such as voice, data, and so on. These systems may be based on code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution) wireless access. 3GPP LTE-A (Long Term Evolution Advanced) wireless access, 3GPP2 UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband). WiMax, or some other modulation techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In particular, the exemplary wireless communication systems devices described below may be designed to support one or more standards such as the standard offered by a consortium named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; referred to herein as 3GPP, including 3GPP TS 36.211 V8.6.0 (&#x201c;E-UTRA Physical Channels and Modulation&#x201d;), 3GPP TR 36.912 V9.0.0 (&#x201c;Feasibility Study for Further Advancements for E-UTRA (LTE-Advanced) (Release 9)&#x201d;), and 3GPP TSG-RAN WG1 Meeting #61 (&#x201c;Cross-carrier CFI Signalling&#x201d;)&#x2014;R1-103052). The standards and documents listed above are hereby expressly incorporated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a multiple access wireless communication system according to one embodiment of the invention. An access network <b>100</b> (AN) includes multiple antenna groups, one including <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, another including <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, and an additional including <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. In FIG. A<b>1</b>, only two antennas are shown for each antenna group, however, more or fewer antennas may be utilized for each antenna group. Access terminal <b>116</b> (AT) is in communication with antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, where antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> transmit information to access terminal <b>116</b> over forward link <b>120</b> and receive information from access terminal <b>116</b> over reverse link <b>118</b>. Access terminal (AT) <b>122</b> is in communication with antennas <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, where antennas <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> transmit information to access terminal (AT) <b>122</b> over forward link <b>126</b> and receive information from access terminal (AT) <b>122</b> over reverse link <b>124</b>. In a FDD system, communication links <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may use different frequency for communication. For example, forward link <b>120</b> may use a different frequency than that used by reverse link <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each group of antennas and/or the area in which they are designed to communicate is often referred to as a sector of the access network. In the embodiment, antenna groups each are designed to communicate to access terminals in a sector of the areas covered by access network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In communication over forward links <b>120</b> and <b>126</b>, the transmitting antennas of access network <b>100</b> may utilize beamforming in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of forward links for the different access terminals <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>. Also, an access network using beamforming to transmit to access terminals scattered randomly through its coverage normally causes less interference to access terminals in neighboring cells than an access network transmitting through a single antenna to all its access terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An access network (AN) may be a fixed station or base station used for communicating with the terminals and may also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, a base station, an enhanced base station, an eNodeB, or some other terminology. An access terminal (AT) may also be called user equipment (UE), a wireless communication device, terminal, access terminal or some other terminology.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of a transmitter system <b>210</b> (also known as the access network) and a receiver system <b>250</b> (also known as access terminal (AT) or user equipment (UE)) in a MIMO system <b>200</b>. At the transmitter system <b>210</b>, traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source <b>212</b> to a transmit (TX) data processor <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit antenna. TX data processor <b>214</b> formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated (i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, M-PSK, or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by processor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor <b>220</b>, which may further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor <b>220</b> then provides N<sub>T </sub>modulation symbol streams to N<sub>T </sub>transmitters (TMTR) <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t</i>. In certain embodiments, TX MIMO processor <b>220</b> applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each transmitter <b>222</b> receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. N<sub>T </sub>modulated signals from transmitters <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t </i>are then transmitted from N<sub>T </sub>antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At receiver system <b>250</b>, the transmitted modulated signals are received by N<sub>R </sub>antennas <b>252</b><i>a </i>through <b>252</b><i>r </i>and the received signal from each antenna <b>252</b> is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r</i>. Each receiver <b>254</b> conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding &#x201c;received&#x201d; symbol stream.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An RX data processor <b>260</b> then receives and processes the N<sub>R </sub>received symbol streams from N<sub>R </sub>receivers <b>254</b> based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide N<sub>T </sub>&#x201c;detected&#x201d; symbol streams. The RX data processor <b>260</b> then demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor <b>260</b> is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor <b>220</b> and TX data processor <b>214</b> at transmitter system <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A processor <b>270</b> periodically determines which pre-coding matrix to use (discussed below). Processor <b>270</b> formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link message is then processed by a TX data processor <b>238</b>, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source <b>236</b>, modulated by a modulator <b>280</b>, conditioned by transmitters <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r</i>, and transmitted back to transmitter system <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At transmitter system <b>210</b>, the modulated signals from receiver system <b>250</b> are received by antennas <b>224</b>, conditioned by receivers <b>222</b>, demodulated by a demodulator <b>240</b>, and processed by a RX data processor <b>242</b> to extract the reserve link message transmitted by the receiver system <b>250</b>. Processor <b>230</b> then determines which pre-coding matrix to use for determining the beamforming weights then processes the extracted message.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Memory <b>232</b> may be used to temporarily store some buffered/computational data from <b>240</b> or <b>242</b> through Processor <b>230</b>, store some buffed data from <b>212</b>, or store some specific program codes. And Memory <b>272</b> may be used to temporarily store some buffered/computational data from <b>260</b> through Processor <b>270</b>, store some buffed data from <b>236</b>, or store some specific program codes.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the following discussion, the invention will be described mainly in the context of the 3GPP architecture reference model. However, it is understood that with the disclosed information, one skilled in the art could easily adapt for use and implement aspects of invention in a 3GPP2 network architecture as well as in other network architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In LIE, there is a single transmission of a physical downlink control channel (PUCCH), Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), or Sounding Reference Signals (SRSs) with a single antenna and a single carrier. The WTRU does not transmit SRS whenever SRS and PUCCH format 2/2a/2b transmission happen to coincide in the same subframe. The WTRU does not transmit SRS whenever SRS and acknowledge/negative acknowledge (ACK/NACK) and/or positive SRS transmissions happen to coincide in the same subframe unless the parameter Simultaneous-AN-and-SRS is true. The parameter Simultaneous-AN-and-SRS provided by a higher layer determines if a WTRU is configured to support the transmission of ACK/NACK on PUCCH and SRS in one subframe. If it is configured to support the transmission of ACK/NACK on PUCCH and SRS in one subframe, then in the cell specific SRS subframes WTRU shall transmit ACK/NACK and SR using the shortened PUCCH format, where the ACK/NACK or the SR symbol corresponding to the SRS symbol is punctured. Furthermore, in order for the eNodeB to perform reliable channel estimation for frequency-scheduling for each UL, the transmit power for SRS (and other channels) is controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, in LIE, Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) transmission was selected for uplink (UL) direction. The specific implementation is based on Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). For the purpose of this application, either term may be used interchangeably. A WTRU in the UL will transmit only on a limited, contiguous set of assigned sub-carriers in an FDMA arrangement. For illustration purposes, if the overall OFDM signal or system bandwidth in the UL is composed of useful sub-carriers numbered <b>1</b> to <b>100</b>, a first given WTRU would be assigned to transmit its own signal on sub-carriers <b>1</b>-<b>12</b>, a second given WTRU would transmit on sub-carriers <b>13</b>-<b>24</b>, and so on. An eNodeB (or eNB) would receive the composite UL signal across the entire transmission bandwidth from one or more WTRUs at the same time, but each WTRU would only transmit into a subset of the available transmission bandwidth. DFT-S OFDM in the LIE UL was selected by 3GPP Radio Layer 1 (RAN1) as a form of OFDM transmission with the additional constraint that the time-frequency resource assigned to a WTRU must consist of a set of frequency-consecutive sub-carriers. In the LIE UL, there is no DC sub-carrier (unlike the downlink (DL)). Frequency hopping may be applied in one mode of operation to UL transmissions by a WTRU.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">WTRUs transmit their UL data (and in some cases their control information) on the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). The transmission of the PUSCH is scheduled and controlled by the eNodeB using the so-called uplink scheduling grant, which is carried on physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) format 0. As part of the uplink scheduling grant, the WTRU receives control information on the modulation and coding set (MCS), transmit power control (TPC) command, uplink resources allocation (i.e., the indices of allocated resource blocks), etc. Then, the WTRU will transmit its PUSCH on allocated uplink resources with corresponding MCS at transmit power controlled by the TPC command.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Similar to LIE DL, reference signals for channel estimation are also needed for the LTE UL to enable coherent demodulation of PUSCH (or PUCCH) at the eNodeB. These reference signals are referred to as UL demodulation reference signals (DRS). They are always transmitted together with and covering the same frequency band as PUSCH (or PUCCH).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To allow for the eNodeB to estimate UL channel quality for UL scheduling, sounding reference signals (SRS) may be transmitted in UL. In the frequency domain. SRS transmissions may cover the frequency band that is of interest for the frequency domain scheduling. When an SRS is to be transmitted in a subframe, it occupies the last SC-FDMA symbol of the subframe. If a WTRU is transmitting SRS in a certain subframe, then the last symbol of the subframe is then not used for PUSCH transmission by any WTRU within the cell. In order for the eNodeB to perform reliable channel estimation for frequency-scheduling for each UL, the transmit power for SRS (and other channels) is controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, from a UE perspective, there is one transport block (in absence of spatial multiplexing) and one hybrid-ARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) entity per scheduled component carrier. Each transport block is mapped to a single component carrier. A UE may be scheduled over multiple component carriers simultaneously. The design principles for downlink control signaling of control region size and uplink and downlink resource assignments can generally be described as following: (1) PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) on a component carrier assigns PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) resources on the same component carrier and PUSCH resources on a single linked UL component carrier, (2) PDCCH on a component carrier can assign PDSCH or PUSCH resources for one of multiple component carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In LTE, PDCCH and PDSCH are multiplexed in the time domain. In general, PDCCH occupies first several OFDM symbols whose number. CFI value, is determined by the signalling on PCFICH (Physical Control Format Indicator Channel). In one embodiment, exemplary possible values are provided the table below:</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In LTE-A, cross carrier scheduling is adopted for carrier aggregation. With such feature. PDSCH for one carrier can be scheduled from PDCCH on the other carrier if PDCCH on its own CC is not reliable due to interference (e.g., Het-Net). There were discussions that under such scenario. PCFICH may be unreliable as well which results in wrong starting position and PDSCH decoding problem. RRC signalling or PDCCH signalling were proposed to carry such information.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some concerns were raised for MBSFN subframe regarding this issue. Since maximum number of OFDM symbols in MBSFN subframe is two, it was proposed to have extra information in RRC configuration to let UE know which CFI value should be applied for every subframe, considering MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service) subframe configurations among eNBs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Signalling CFI for every subframe would require extra overhead. Furthermore, reconfiguration would be needed more often when the configuration of the MBSFN subframe changes. In addition, more interaction or coordination among eNBs would be required to maintain CFI information for each other.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, this figure outlines an exemplary flow diagram to determine a CFI value to reduce resource waste due to cross carrier scheduling, and to simplify the mechanism to determine CFI for cross carrier scheduling according to one embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A method and apparatus are disclosed determine a CFI value in a wireless communication system. In one embodiment, the method comprises configuring system devices, such as a UE or an eNB, with a plurality of component carriers for carrier aggregation. Furthermore, the method comprises receiving PDSCH on a first component carrier. The method also comprises transmitting a corresponding PDCCH on a second component carrier. In addition, the method also comprises using a RRC signal to configure a CFI with an initial configured value. The method further comprises setting the CFI so that the CFI could be used to determine a starting point of the PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>602</b>, devices in the system, such as a UE or an eNB, are configured with a plurality of component carriers for carrier aggregation. In step <b>604</b>, a PDSCH is received on one component carrier. In step <b>606</b>, a corresponding PDCCH is transmitted on a different component carrier. In step <b>608</b>, a RRC signal is used to configure a CFI with an initial configured value (such as the value A). In step <b>610</b>, the CFI is set so that it could be used to determine a starting point of the PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, for a MBSFN subframe, the CFI would be set to be the lesser of the initial configured value and a selected constant. For example, if the CFI is initially configured, using the RRC signal, to be the value A and the selected constant has a value of two (2), the CFI will be set to min (A, 2) or the lesser the value A and two (2) for a MBSFN subframe. In an alternative embodiment, for a normal subframe, the CFI would be set to the initial configured value. For example, if the CFI is initially configured, using the RRC signal, to be the value A, the CFI would be set to the value A for a normal subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment, the MBSFN subframes are determined from a MBSFN subframe configuration of the second component carrier used to transmit the PDSCH. In this embodiment, the MBSFN subframe configuration is carried on SIB (System Information Block) 2 of the component carrier used to transmit PDSCH.</p>
