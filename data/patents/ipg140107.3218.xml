<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefits of Taiwan application serial no. 100210043, filed on Jun. 2, 2011, and Taiwan application serial no. 100213825, filed on Jul. 27, 2011. The entirety of each of the above-mentioned patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a light emitting diode (LED) substrate, more particularly to an LED substrate with high light extraction efficiency and an LED using the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A light emitting diode (LED) is a light-emitting device fabricated with a compound semiconductor, in which electric energy is converted into light through the combination of electrons and holes. An LED is a type of cold light source, and has the advantages of low power consumption, no warm up time, long service life, and fast response speed, etc. It also provides the features of small size, high impact resistance, and is suitable for mass production. Consequently, a light emitting diode is readily attuned to meet the application requirements in fabricating extremely small or array devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to expand the application range of an LED in the future, the current research focuses on improving the light-emitting brightness of the LED. In an ideal LED, after the carriers in an active region are recombined into photons and all of these photons propagate to the external environment, the light emitting efficiency of such an LED is 100%. However, not 100% of the photons generated in the active region cannot be propagated to the external environment due to various depletion mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to improve the light-emitting efficiency of an LED, a patterned LED substrate, for example, an LED substrate constituted with a plurality of cones or platform structures is used to scatter the light emitted from the LED, so as to reduce the total reflection.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a light emitting diode substrate having high light extraction efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a light emitting diode having the above light emitting diode substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a light emitting diode substrate including a sapphire substrate, which is characterized by having a surface constructed with a plurality of irregular hexagonal pyramid structures, and a pitch of these irregular hexagonal pyramid structures is less than 10 &#x3bc;m. A symmetrical cross-sectional plane of the hexagonal pyramid structure has a first base angle and a second base angle, wherein the second base angle is greater than the first base angle, and the second base angle is between 50 to 70 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the pitch is between about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 3 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a maximum height of each irregular hexagonal pyramid structure is between 1 &#x3bc;m to 2 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the top part of each irregular hexagonal pyramid structure is a plane or a pointed tip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the above surface of the sapphire substrate includes a (0001) surface, and the (0001) surface is about 10% to 60% of a projected area of the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a light emitting diode substrate including a sapphire substrate which is characterized by having a surface constructed with a plurality of pyramid structures, and each of the pyramid structures has a bottom surface with a plurality of acute angles. Each of the acute angles in one pyramid structure is close to the acute angles in adjacent pyramid structures.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention, the above surface of the sapphire substrate includes a (0001) surface, and the (0001) surface is about 5% to 40% of a projected area of the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention, the pyramid structures includes trigonal pyramid or hexagonal pyramid.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention, the top of each pyramid structure is a plane or a pointed tip.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention, when the top part of each pyramid structure is a plane, a cover layer is disposed on the plane of each pyramid structure, and a material of the cover layer includes oxide, nitride or silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An exemplary embodiment of the invention further provides a light emitting diode, which includes one of the above sapphire substrates, a first semiconductor layer disposed on the above sapphire substrate, a light emitting layer disposed on the above semiconductor layer, a second semiconductor layer disposed on the above light emitting layer, a first ohmic layer in contact with the first semiconductor layer, and a second ohmic layer in contact with the second semiconductor layer.</p>

Light diffusion is increased based on the 6 faces of the irregular hexagonal pyramid structures and light emitting efficiency of the substrate is enhanced. In addition, the arrangement of the pyramid structures may be defined to properly increase the area of the (0001) surface, and thus the exposed areas in said surface will be collected appropriately. Accordingly, it may reduce the difficulty in subsequent epitaxy process.</p>
