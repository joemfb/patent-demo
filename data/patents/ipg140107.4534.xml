Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the health care system <b>1</b> includes a sensing unit <b>10</b>, a plurality of gateways <b>20</b>, and a health care server <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Components related to the current example are illustrated in the health care system <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Accordingly, the health care system <b>1</b> may also include components other than the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a health care controller <b>200</b> includes the sensing unit <b>10</b>, each gateway <b>20</b>, the health care server <b>30</b>, or a combination thereof. Examples for illustrating that providing of health care by the health care system <b>1</b> may be differently controlled according to where the health care controller <b>200</b> is disposed will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The health care system <b>1</b> provides health care based on a user's biological signal.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sensing unit <b>10</b> senses a user's biological signal. The sensing unit <b>10</b> is carried by the user and communicates with other devices in a wired or wireless manner to transmit the sensed biological signal to the other devices. In this regard, the sensing unit <b>10</b> includes one or more sensors that may sense, for example, an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal or an electromyogram (EMG) signal. In other words, the sensing unit <b>10</b> is not limited to any one device for sensing a biological signal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a non-limiting example, in the health care system <b>1</b>, the sensing unit <b>10</b> is carried by a user and senses a biological signal. Since the sensing unit <b>10</b> may be any device for sensing a biological signal, for example, an ECG sensor or an EMG sensor, which is understood, a description of the sensing unit <b>10</b> is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The gateways <b>20</b> include devices that may communicate with other devices in a wired or wireless manner via a network, for example, a portable terminal <b>21</b>, a TV <b>22</b>, and a personal computer (PC) <b>23</b>. The gateways <b>20</b> receive a sensed biological signal from the sensing unit <b>10</b> and transmit the received biological signal to the health care server <b>30</b> to function as passages of the health care system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, the gateways <b>20</b> receive information regarding health care from the health care server <b>30</b> and display the information regarding health care on a screen included in each gateway <b>20</b>. The information regarding health care may be information obtained by the health care server <b>30</b> analyzing a sensed biological signal. In other words, the gateways <b>20</b> are devices for providing health care to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The health care server <b>30</b> analyzes a user's health state based on a biological signal transmitted through the gateways <b>20</b>. For example, in response to the biological signal being the user's ECG signal, the health care server <b>30</b> analyzes the ECG signal to determine a state of the user's heart, for example, to determine whether the user has a heart disease such as atrial or ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac infarction, arrhythmia, or pericarditis. In response to the analysis of the biological signal being finished, the health care server <b>30</b> sends a result of the analysis to the gateways <b>20</b> and the gateways <b>20</b> provide the result as health care to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a conventional health care system using a mobile device such as a mobile phone, the mobile phone functioning as a gateway continuously receives a user's biological signal from a sensor carried by the user and transmits the received biological signal to a health care server to provide health care to the user via the mobile phone. Accordingly, since a communication module included in the mobile phone continuously operates in order to communicate with the sensor, a large amount of power of a battery of the mobile phone is consumed. Thus, time for other functions of the mobile phone, for example, a calling function or a text message sending function, is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Also, in response to the mobile phone transmitting and/or receiving processed data regarding a biological signal, a large amount of computing resources of the mobile phone is used, and thus resources for other functions of the mobile phone are reduced. For example, in response to continuous real-time monitoring of the biological signal being necessary, the mobile phone should be within such a distance from the sensor that the mobile phone and the sensor are able to communicate with each other, even while a user is at home, in order to prevent data loss.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the health care system <b>1</b> of the current example, in response to there being, in addition to the portable terminal <b>21</b>, a device capable of functioning as a gateway, for example, consumer electronics such as the TV <b>22</b> or the PC <b>23</b>, around a user, the health care controller <b>200</b> controls the TV <b>22</b> to function as a gateway and controls the portable terminal <b>21</b> to stop functioning as a gateway, thereby decreasing consumption of power and resources of the portable terminal <b>21</b>. Also, even in response to the user not carrying the portable terminal <b>21</b> within a short distance from the sensing unit <b>10</b> while the user is at home, the user may be continuously provided health care in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, operations of the health care controller <b>200</b> in the health care system <b>1</b> will be described. However, the health care controller <b>200</b> including components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will first be described.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the health care controller <b>200</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the health care controller <b>200</b> includes a communication unit <b>210</b>, a determination unit <b>220</b>, and a communication control unit <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The health care controller <b>200</b> may include one or more processors. Each processor may be implemented by an array including a plurality of logic gates or by a combination of a general-purpose microprocessor and a memory storing a program executable by the microprocessor. Also, each processor may be implemented by a different type of hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The communication unit <b>210</b> transmits and/or receives a user's biological signal sensed by the sensing unit <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other words, as described above, the communication unit <b>210</b> receives the user's biological signal, such as an ECG signal or an EMG signal. As will be described, the communication unit <b>210</b> communicates with other devices such as, for example, the portable terminal <b>21</b> or the TV <b>22</b>, in the health care system <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to where the health care controller <b>200</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The determination unit <b>220</b> determines whether the health care system <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes, in addition to a first gateway through which a biological signal is transmitted and/or received, at least one second gateway through which the biological signal may be transmitted and/or received, and determines which gateway the biological signal is to be transmitted and/or received through in response to the health care system <b>1</b> including the second gateway.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, in the health care system <b>1</b>, the determination unit <b>220</b> determines whether the TV <b>22</b> may transmit and/or receive a biological signal in response to the portable terminal <b>21</b> transmitting and/or receiving the biological signal. The determination unit <b>220</b> determines, from among the portable terminal <b>21</b> and the TV <b>22</b>, which gateway the biological signal is to be transmitted and/or received through in response to the TV <b>22</b> being capable of transmitting and/or receiving the biological signal.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this regard, in response to the determination unit <b>220</b> determining that there is, in addition to a current gateway through which a biological signal is transmitted and/or received, another gateway through which the biological signal may be transmitted and/or received, the determination unit <b>220</b> determines which gateway is to transmit and/or receive the biological signal based on a user's setting, processing capacities of the gateways, or a combination thereof. In response to the user previously setting that health care is to be provided through the TV <b>22</b> while the user is at home, in response to the user moving from outside of a house to the inside of the house, the determination unit <b>220</b> determines that the biological signal is to be transmitted and/or received through the TV <b>22</b> instead of the portable terminal <b>21</b>. Also, the determination unit <b>220</b> may determine which gateway is to transmit and/or receive the biological signal based on processing capacities of the portable terminal <b>21</b> and the TV <b>22</b>. In other words, since the processing capacity of the TV <b>22</b> is greater than that of the portable terminal <b>21</b>, in response to the user moving from outside of the house to the inside of the house, the determination unit <b>220</b> determines that the biological signal is to be transmitted and/or received through the TV <b>22</b> instead of the portable terminal <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In response to the determination unit <b>220</b> determining that the TV <b>22</b> is capable of transmitting and/or receiving a biological signal, the TV <b>22</b> transmits and/or receives the biological signal instead of the portable terminal <b>21</b>, and thus power and resources used by the portable terminal <b>21</b> to transmit and/or receive the biological signal are not consumed, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The communication control unit <b>230</b> controls a transmitting and/or receiving function of each gateway according to a result of the determining by the determination unit <b>220</b>. In other words, in the above-described examples, the communication control unit <b>230</b> controls transmitting and/or receiving functions of the portable terminal <b>21</b> and the TV <b>22</b> according to a result of the determining.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In response to the determination unit <b>220</b> determining that the TV <b>22</b> is capable of transmitting and/or receiving a biological signal, the communication control unit <b>230</b> controls the transmitting and/or receiving function of the portable terminal <b>21</b> to be inactive. Thus, power and resources used by the portable terminal <b>21</b> to transmit and/or receive the biological signal are not consumed by allowing the transmitting and/or receiving function of the portable terminal <b>21</b> to be inactive and allowing the TV <b>22</b> to transmit and/or receive the biological signal.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, the health care controller <b>200</b> may be included in the sensing unit <b>10</b>, each gateway <b>20</b>, the health care server <b>30</b> included in the health care system <b>1</b>, or a combination thereof. Hereinafter, a case where the health care server <b>30</b> includes the health care controller <b>200</b> will be referred to as a first example, a case where each gateway <b>20</b> includes the health care controller <b>200</b> will be referred to as a second example, and a case where the sensing unit <b>10</b> includes the health care controller <b>200</b> will be referred to as a third example.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">However, the health care system <b>1</b> is not limited thereto. In other words, although the portable terminal <b>21</b>, the TV <b>22</b>, and the PC <b>23</b> are shown as the gateways <b>20</b> of the health care system <b>1</b>, the health care system <b>1</b> may include various different kinds of devices such as, for example, a set top box, a notebook computer, a PC, etc. in addition to the portable terminal <b>21</b>, the TV <b>22</b>, and the PC <b>23</b> or may include only one kind of device. Even in an environment in which such devices exist, each operation to be described in the follow examples may be expansively applied.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, even in response to a user moving from one room to another room while the user is at home, each operation to be described in the follow examples may be expansively applied. In other words, each operation to be described in the follow examples may be expansively applied by assuming that all areas outside a house constitute a first room and all areas inside the house constitute a second room.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">First, an operation of the health care system <b>1</b> according to the first example is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrate as an example the health care server <b>30</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the health care controller <b>200</b> is configured as one module of the health care controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates an example of a method of controlling health care.

The determination unit <b>220</b> determines whether the biological signal received from the portable terminal <b>21</b> is the same as the biological signal received from the TV <b>22</b>. In response to both the biological signals being the same, according to a result of the determining, the communication control unit <b>230</b> generates a deactivation control signal that requests that the transmitting and/or receiving function of the portable terminal <b>21</b> be deactivated. Also, in operation <b>315</b>, the communication control unit <b>230</b> may generate a maintaining control signal that maintains that the transmitting and/or receiving function of the TV <b>22</b> be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In operation <b>316</b>, the communication control unit <b>230</b> controls the portable terminal <b>21</b> to deactivate the transmitting and/or receiving function of the portable terminal <b>21</b> by transmitting the deactivation control signal to the portable terminal <b>21</b> via the communication unit <b>210</b>.
