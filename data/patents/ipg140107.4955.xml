<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation Application of prior application Ser. No. 12/685,119, filed on Jan. 11, 2010 in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which claims priority from Korean Patent Applications No. 10-2009-0002400, filed on Jan. 12, 2009 and No. 10-2009-0130073 filed on Dec. 23, 2009 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present general inventive concept relates to a reverse-feeding unit to improve a printing speed and an image forming apparatus including the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, an image forming apparatus prints a desired image on a printing medium using an ink or toner and includes a copier, a printer, a fax machine, a scanner and a multi-function printer. The image forming apparatus includes a printing unit for performing printing for a printing medium and a storage unit for storing the printing medium which is completely printed through the printing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The storage unit is typically installed in a front upper part of the image forming apparatus so that a user can easily access the printed printing medium.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the case that the printed printing medium is fed towards a front part and then to a rear part of the image forming apparatus for an image forming process, the printing medium should be fed to the storage unit installed in the front upper part after the image forming process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this respect, in order to feed the printing medium to the storage unit while maintaining a feeding direction of the printing medium towards the rear part of the image forming apparatus, the printing medium should be turned around towards the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the turn around structure may have a curved structure to maintain the feeding direction of the printed printing medium, thereby to increase in height of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, since the turn around structure makes a feeding path of the printing medium long, it takes a longer time to discharge the printing medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present general inventive concept provides a reverse-feeding unit which can provide a compact structure and an image forming apparatus including the same.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present general inventive concept also provides a reverse-feeding unit which can reduce a feeding time of a printing medium and an image forming apparatus including the same.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present general inventive concept also provides a reverse-feeding unit which can convert a feeding direction of a printing medium at a high speed without jamming and an image forming apparatus including the same.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional aspects of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present general inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foregoing and other features and utilities of the present general inventive concept may also be achieved by providing an image forming apparatus, including a main body, a printing unit which is contained in the main body and performs printing for a printing medium; a storage unit which is installed on an upper part of the main body and stores the printing medium printed through the printing unit, and a reverse-feeding unit which reversely feeds the printed printing medium to the storage unit, the reverse-feeding unit including a frame which forms a first feeding path along which a printing medium is fed and a second feeding path which is branched off from the first feeding path, a guide plate which rotates between a first position in which the printing medium fed along the first feeding path is supported and a second position in which the supported printing medium is directed towards the second feeding path, and a plate driving unit which includes an actuator which actuates the guide plate, a driving source which drives the actuator, and an electronic clutch which selectively transmits a driving force of the driving source to the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first feeding path may extend between the printing unit and the guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second feeding path may extend between the guide plate and the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The reverse-feeding unit may be detachably coupled to the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The apparatus may include a sensor unit which is installed in the first feeding path; and a controller which controls the plate driving unit based on a sensing result of the sensor unit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The apparatus may include a first driving roller which feeds the printing medium along the second feeding path; and a contact unit which contacts the first driving roller with the printing medium being interposed therebetween when the guide plate is located in the second position and which separates from the first driving roller when the guide plate is located in the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The contact unit may include at least one of an idle roller, a sliding unit and an elastic pad.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The contact unit may be installed in the guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The apparatus may include a second driving roller which rotates in a one-way direction and which feeds the printing medium along the first feeding path and feeds the printing medium supported by the guide plate along the second feeding path.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first driving roller and the second driving roller may be driven by the driving source.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The apparatus may include a deviation prevention unit which prevents the printing medium supported by the guide plate from being deviated from the guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The actuator may include a cam.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The foregoing and other features and utilities of the present general inventive concept may also be achieved by providing an image forming apparatus, including a main body, a printing unit which is contained in the main body and performs printing for a printing medium, a frame to form portions of a first feeding path and a second feeding path, a guide plate to form another portions of the first feeding path and the second feeding path and to move between a first position with the portion and another portion of the first feeding path and a second position to feed the printing medium from the first feeding path toward the second feeding path of the frame, and a contact unit disposed on the guide plate to lift the printing medium from a portion of the guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The reverse-feeding unit may further include a deviation prevention unit disposed between the frame and the contact unit to bias the printing medium toward the guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The reverse-feeding unit may further include a roller disposed to feed the printing medium toward the frame in the second feeding path with the contact unit when the guide plate is in the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The guide plate may move with respect to a portion of the guide plate, the first feeding path may be extended from the portion of the frame to the portion of the guide plate in the first position, and the second feeding path may be extended from the portion of the guide plate to the portion of the frame.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present general inventive concept, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The exemplary embodiments are described below so as to explain the present general inventive concept by referring to the figures. Redundant description to different embodiments may be omitted for simplicity of description as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an image forming apparatus <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept includes a printing unit <b>120</b> which is contained in a main body <b>101</b> and performs printing for a printing medium, a storage unit <b>130</b> which is installed in a front upper part of the main body <b>101</b> and stores the printing medium printed through the printing unit <b>120</b>, and a reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> which reversely feeds the printed printing medium to the storage unit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The printing unit <b>120</b> may adopt electrophotographic printing. Since the electrophotographic printing is well known, detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the printing unit <b>120</b> includes a plurality of developing cartridges <b>121</b>, a plurality of light exposure units <b>124</b> each corresponding to the plurality of developing cartridges <b>121</b>, a plurality of transfer rollers <b>123</b> which transfers an image formed on image supports <b>122</b> contained in the plurality of developing cartridges <b>121</b> to a printing medium, a feeding belt <b>125</b>, a plurality of driving rollers <b>126</b> which drives the feeding belt <b>125</b>, and a fusing unit <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The plurality of developing cartridges <b>121</b> may have a housing <b>40</b> to respectively support therein a developer (toner) of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K) and contains the image support <b>122</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The plurality of light exposure units <b>124</b> exposes the image supports <b>122</b> in the corresponding developing cartridges <b>121</b>. Accordingly, the developer in the developing cartridges <b>121</b> is coated in light exposure regions on the image support <b>122</b>, thereby forming a visible image on the surface thereof. The housing may include a hole through which light emitted from a corresponding one of the light exposure units <b>124</b> can pass through toward the corresponding image support <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The feeding belt <b>125</b> feeds the printing medium supplied from a supply unit <b>110</b> to pass through the image supports <b>122</b> and the transfer rollers <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, the visible image formed on the surface of each image support <b>122</b> is transferred to the printing medium on the feeding belt <b>125</b> by the transfer roller <b>123</b>. As the printing medium sequentially passes through the image supports <b>122</b> and the transfer rollers <b>123</b>, the visible images having yellow, magenta, cyan and black are superposedly transferred onto the printing medium. Accordingly, a color visible image is formed on the printing medium.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The color visible image is fused on the printing medium through the fusing unit <b>127</b>. The fusing unit <b>127</b> includes a heating roller <b>127</b><i>a </i>to heat the color visible image, and a press roller <b>127</b><i>b </i>to press the printing medium towards the heating roller <b>127</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">By passing the fusing unit <b>127</b>, the printing process for the printing medium is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The printing unit <b>120</b> may adopt different printing types instead of or together with the electrophotographic type. For example, the printing unit <b>120</b> may adopt at least one of an inkjet printing to discharge an ink through a nozzle and a heat transfer printing using a thermal printing head (TPH).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may further include the supply unit <b>110</b> to supply the printing medium to be printed to the printing unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The supply unit <b>110</b> may be detachably coupled to the main body <b>101</b> to recharge the printing medium in the case that the printing medium is completely consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The supply unit <b>110</b> includes a knock-up plate <b>111</b> to load the printing medium to be printed; a pick-up roller <b>115</b> for picking up the printing medium on the knock-up plate <b>111</b> to the printing unit <b>120</b>; and an elastic member for elastically biasing the knock-up plate <b>111</b> towards the pick-up roller <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> includes a frame <b>210</b>, a guide plate <b>220</b>, and a plate driving unit <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The frame <b>210</b> includes sub frames <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>to form a portion S<b>1</b><i>a </i>of a first feeding path S<b>1</b> along which the printing medium passed the printing unit <b>120</b> is fed, and sub frames <b>210</b><i>c </i>and <b>210</b><i>d </i>to form a portion S<b>2</b><i>a </i>of a second feeding path S<b>2</b> which is branched off from the first feeding path S<b>1</b>. In this respect, the first feeding path S<b>1</b> connects the printing unit <b>120</b> and the guide plate <b>220</b>, and the second feeding path S<b>2</b> connects the guide plate <b>220</b> and the storage unit <b>130</b>. That is, the first feeding path S<b>1</b> extends from the printing unit <b>120</b> to the guide plate <b>220</b> toward a portion S<b>1</b><i>b </i>of the first feeding path S<b>1</b> through a portion S<b>1</b><i>a</i>. The second feeding path S<b>2</b> extends from the guide plate <b>220</b> to the storage unit <b>130</b> toward a portion S<b>2</b><i>a </i>of the second feeding path S<b>2</b> through a portion S<b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>, the guide plate <b>220</b> may rotate between a first position c in which the printing medium P fed along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> from the portion S<b>1</b><i>a </i>to the portion S<b>1</b><i>b </i>is supported and a second position d in which the printing medium P supported on the guide plate <b>220</b> is directed towards the second feeding path S<b>2</b> from the portion S<b>2</b><i>b </i>to the portion S<b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The guide plate <b>220</b> may rotate around a hinge shaft <b>221</b> installed in a downstream of the first feeding path S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">More specifically, an end part of the guide plate <b>220</b> is coupled to the hinge shaft <b>221</b>, and the other end part of the guide plate <b>220</b> is supported by an actuator <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first feeding path S<b>1</b> may be formed with the sub frames <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the frame <b>210</b> and the guide plate <b>220</b> in the first position c, and the second feeding path S<b>2</b> may be formed with the sub frames <b>210</b><i>c </i>and <b>210</b><i>d </i>of the frame <b>210</b> and the guide plate <b>220</b> in the second position d. The guide plate <b>220</b> may form a a common path for the first feeding path S<b>1</b> and the second feeding path S<b>2</b>. When the guide plate <b>220</b> moves by a distance between the first position c and the second position d or rotates by an angle between the first position c and the second position d, the first feeding path S<b>1</b> and the second feeding path S<b>2</b> may form the same distance or the same angle with respect to each other. Portions S<b>1</b><i>b </i>and S<b>2</b><i>b </i>of the first and second feeding paths S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> may be parallel to a surface of the guide plate <b>220</b>. Another portions S<b>1</b><i>a </i>and S<b>2</b><i>a </i>of the first and second feeding paths S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> may not be parallel to the portions S<b>1</b><i>b </i>and S<b>2</b><i>b </i>of the first and second feeding paths S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, respectively. The another portions S<b>1</b><i>a </i>and S<b>2</b><i>a </i>of the first and second feeding paths S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> may have be curved with respect to the portions S<b>1</b><i>b </i>and S<b>2</b><i>b </i>of the first and second feeding paths S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the plate driving unit <b>230</b> includes the actuator <b>231</b> to rotate the guide plate <b>220</b>, a driving source <b>235</b> to drive the actuator <b>231</b>, and an electronic clutch <b>233</b> to selectively transmit a driving force of the driving source <b>235</b> to the actuator <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The actuator <b>231</b> may be a cam which rotates around a cam shaft <b>231</b><i>a </i>in a one-way direction. However, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto. It is possible that different driving units can be used as the actuator <b>231</b> to ascend and/or descend the guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> includes a sensor to detect a position of the printing medium P with respect to the frame <b>210</b>. The sensor may be a sensor unit <b>240</b> installed in the first feeding path S<b>1</b>, and a controller <b>280</b> which controls the plate driving unit <b>230</b> based on a sensing result of the sensor <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Hereinafter, a feeding procedure that the printed printing medium is fed to the storage unit <b>130</b> along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> and the second feeding path S<b>2</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the sensor unit <b>240</b> includes a lever <b>241</b> which contacts the printing medium P fed along the portion S<b>1</b><i>a </i>of the first feeding path S<b>1</b>, and a photo-sensor <b>243</b> having a light emitting part to emit light and a light receiving part to receive the light or to not receive the light when the light is blocked according to a position of the lever <b>241</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lever <b>241</b> may rotate around the hinge shaft <b>242</b> between a blocking position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) in which the light from the light emitting part is blocked and a releasing position (FIG. <b>3</b>A) in which is spaced from the blocking position to allow the light to pass through toward the light receiving part of the photo-sensor <b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this respect, the sensor unit <b>240</b> may further include an elastic member (not illustrated) to elastically bias the lever <b>241</b> to maintain the blocking position.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Specifically, when the printing medium comes in contact with the lever <b>241</b>, the lever <b>241</b> rotates to the releasing position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Accordingly, the light from the light emitting part is received to the light receiving part, and thus, the photo-sensor <b>243</b> outputs an &#x2018;ON&#x2019; signal. To the contrary, when the printing medium does not come in contact with the lever <b>241</b>, the lever <b>241</b> is located in the blocking position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C by the elastic member (not shown). Accordingly, as the light from the light emitting part is blocked to the light receiving unit, the photo-sensor <b>243</b> outputs an &#x2018;OFF&#x2019; signal.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the case that the signal of the photo-sensor <b>243</b> is switched into &#x2018;ON&#x2019; from &#x2018;OFF&#x2019; in a time point t<b>1</b>, this means that an end part a of the printing medium P comes in contact with the lever <b>241</b> in the point t<b>1</b> to thereby rotate the lever <b>241</b>. In the case that the signal of the photo-sensor <b>243</b> is switched into &#x2018;OFF&#x2019; from &#x2018;ON&#x2019; in a point t<b>2</b>, this means that the other end part b of the printing medium P has just passed the lever <b>241</b> in the point t<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The controller <b>280</b> may control the electronic clutch <b>233</b> based on the sensing result of the sensor unit <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">More specifically, the controller <b>280</b> turns off the electronic clutch <b>233</b> until the other end part b of the printing medium which is fed along the first feeding path <b>51</b> is supported by the guide plate <b>220</b>. Accordingly, the driving force of the driving source <b>235</b> is not transmitted to the actuator <b>231</b>, and thus, the guide plate <b>220</b> is located in the first position (c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The controller <b>280</b> may determine a point t<b>3</b> in which the other end part b of the printing medium P is supported by the guide plate <b>220</b> based on the sensing signal of the photo-sensor <b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">More specifically, the controller <b>280</b> may determine a point that a predetermined time elapses from the point t<b>2</b> in which the signal of the photo-sensor <b>243</b> is switched into &#x2018;OFF&#x2019; from &#x2018;ON&#x2019; as the point t<b>3</b> in which the other end part b of the printing medium P is supported by the guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this respect, the predetermined time may be calculated based on a time taken for the other end part b of the printing medium P moving along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> to pass the distance between the lever <b>141</b> and the guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The controller <b>280</b> turns on the electronic clutch <b>233</b> for a predetermined time &#x394;t<b>1</b> after a point in which the other end part b of the printing medium P is supported by the guide plate <b>220</b>, for example, after the point t<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As the driving force of the driving source <b>235</b> is transmitted to the actuator <b>231</b> during the predetermined time &#x394;t<b>1</b>, the guide plate <b>220</b> moves to the second position (d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Accordingly, the printing medium P supported by the guide plate <b>220</b> is directed towards the second feeding path S<b>2</b> for the storage unit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described above, since the feeding direction of the printing medium can be simply converted by an ON/OFF operation of the electronic clutch, the printing medium can be smoothly discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, as the guide plate <b>220</b> has a small radius of rotation between the first position c and the second position d, the feeding direction of the printing medium can be quickly converted.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> may further include a first driving roller <b>253</b> which feeds the printing medium P supported by the guide plate <b>220</b> along the second feeding path S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> may include a contact unit <b>255</b> which selectively contacts the first driving roller <b>253</b> or separates from the first driving roller <b>253</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The contact unit <b>255</b> may have various shapes as long as the contact unit <b>255</b> comes in contact with the first driving roller <b>253</b> with the printing medium P being interposed therebetween, in order to feed the printing medium P towards the second feeding path S<b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an idle roller is illustrated as an example of the contact unit <b>255</b>. Alternatively, the contact unit <b>255</b> may be provided as a sliding unit (not illustrated) or an elastic pad (not illustrated). The elastic pad (not illustrated) may be made of a sponge or a soft plastic member.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, the contact unit <b>255</b> may be installed to the guide plate <b>220</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3A</figref>, the idle roller <b>255</b> may be rotatably supported by the guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, the guide plate <b>220</b> may perform the function of the contact unit <b>255</b> without the idle roller <b>255</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when the guide plate <b>220</b> is located in the first position c, the contact unit <b>255</b> is separated from the first driving roller <b>253</b>. Accordingly, the printing medium P moving along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> can pass between the first driving roller <b>253</b> and the contact unit <b>255</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The contact unit <b>255</b> may protrude from the guide plate <b>220</b> by a height h. That is, the contact unit may have a height h with respect to a surface of the guide plate <b>220</b> forming the portion S<b>1</b><i>b </i>of the first feeding path S<b>1</b>. The height h may be lower than a maximum height change of the guide plate <b>220</b> when the guide plate <b>220</b> moves or rotates between the positions c and d. However, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto. The height h may be higher than the maximum height change of the guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The contact unit <b>255</b> may be disposed between ends of the guide plate <b>220</b>. It is possible that the contact unit <b>255</b> can be disposed a middle position of the guide plate <b>220</b>. It is also possible that the contact unit <b>255</b> is disposed closer to an end of the guide plate <b>220</b> disposed adjacent to the sub frames <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>as the portion S<b>1</b><i>a </i>of the first feeding path S<b>1</b>, than the other end of the guide plate <b>220</b> adjacent to the rear part of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Here, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> may further include a deviation prevention unit <b>270</b> to prevent the printing medium P supported by the guide plate from being deviated from the guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The deviation prevention unit <b>270</b> includes a pressing lever <b>273</b> to face the guide plate <b>220</b> with the printing medium P moving along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> being interposed therebetween. The deviation prevention unit <b>270</b> may further include an elastic member (not illustrated) to elastically bias the pressing lever <b>273</b> towards the guide plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The deviation prevention unit <b>270</b> may be disposed between the contact unit <b>255</b> and the sub frames <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>or between the contact unit <b>255</b> and the sub frames <b>210</b><i>c </i>and <b>210</b><i>d</i>. When the contact unit <b>255</b> protrudes from the guide plate <b>220</b>, an end of the deviation prevention unit <b>270</b> may be in a position between the surface of the guide plate <b>220</b> and the height h of the contact unit <b>255</b>. The printing medium P can be guided by the contact unit <b>255</b> and the deviation prevention unit <b>270</b> between the portion S<b>2</b><i>b </i>and the portion S<b>2</b><i>a </i>or between the portion S<b>1</b><i>b </i>and the portion S<b>1</b><i>a</i>. It is possible that the printing medium may have a portion which is curved with respect to the surface of the guide plate <b>220</b> by the contact unit <b>255</b> and the deviation prevention unit <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the printing medium P moving along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> passes between the first pressing lever <b>273</b> and the guide plate <b>220</b>.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Here, the elastic force of the elastic member (not illustrated) to elastically bias the pressing lever <b>273</b> towards the guide plate <b>220</b> may be determined in such a range that does not cause severe interruption to the feeding of the printing medium P and that prevents a deviation of the printing medium P.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> may further include a second driving roller <b>263</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The second driving roller <b>263</b> rotates in a one-way direction G and feeds the printing medium P along the first feeding path S<b>1</b>, and then feeds the printing medium P supported by the guide plate <b>220</b> along the second feeding path S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second driving roller <b>263</b> may be arranged in a region in which the second feeding path S<b>2</b> is branched off from the first feeding path S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The first driving roller <b>253</b> and/or the second driving roller <b>263</b> may be driven by the driving source <b>235</b>. Alternatively, the first driving roller <b>253</b> and/or the second driving roller <b>263</b> may be driven by a driving source different from the driving source <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The controller <b>280</b> may control the driving source <b>235</b> to drive the first driving roller <b>253</b> and the second driving roller <b>263</b> based on the sensing result of the sensor unit <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">More specifically, if it is determined that the end part a of the printing medium P passes the sensor unit <b>240</b> based on the sensing result of the sensor unit <b>240</b>, the controller <b>280</b> turns on the driving unit <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this respect, between the driving source <b>235</b>, and the first driving roller <b>253</b> and the second driving roller <b>263</b> is installed a gear unit (not illustrated) for respectively transmitting the driving force of the driving source <b>235</b> to the first driving roller <b>253</b> and the second driving roller <b>263</b>. Accordingly, the first driving roller <b>253</b> rotates in a direction F for feeding the printing medium P to the second feeding path S<b>2</b>; and the second driving roller <b>263</b> rotates in the direction G.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this way, the first driving roller <b>253</b> and the second driving roller <b>263</b> can respectively rotate in the directions F and G without any clutch, and accordingly, the manufacturing cost may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, since it is not necessary to change the rotational direction of the driving shaft of the driving source <b>235</b> while the printing medium P is moving along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> and the second feeding path S<b>2</b>, the printing medium P may be discharged at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the printing medium P moving along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> is not interrupted by the rotation of the first driving roller <b>253</b> as the guide plate <b>220</b> and the second driving roller <b>253</b> forms a space which is large enough to allow the printing medium to pass therethrough even though the first driving roller <b>253</b> rotates in the direction F.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, since the deviation prevention unit <b>270</b> is provided in at least one of the first feeding path S<b>1</b> and the second feeding path S<b>2</b>, the interruption by the one-way direction of the first driving roller <b>253</b> can be prevented by generating a bias force to be applied to the printing medium P toward the surface of the guide plate <b>220</b>. Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the printing medium P may be supported by the guide plate <b>220</b> up to the other end part b.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As described above, after the time point in which the end part b of the printing medium is supported by the guide plate <b>220</b>, for example, after the point t<b>3</b>, the electronic clutch <b>233</b> is turned on for the predetermined time &#x394;t<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the guide plate <b>220</b> moves to the second position d and the contact unit <b>255</b> installed in the guide plate <b>220</b> comes in contact with the first driving roller <b>253</b> with the printing medium P being interposed therebetween. As the first driving roller <b>253</b> rotates in the direction F, the printing medium P is reversely fed along the second feeding path S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Here, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> may further include a discharging roller <b>267</b> installed in a downstream of the second feeding path S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The printing medium P which is reversely fed along the second feeding path S<b>2</b> moves to the discharging roller <b>267</b> by the second driving roller <b>263</b> and a driven roller <b>265</b> driven by the second driving roller <b>263</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The discharging roller <b>267</b> discharges the printing medium P to the storage unit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If it is determined that the other end part a of the printing medium P comes out of the guide plate <b>220</b> along the second feeding path S<b>2</b>, the controller <b>280</b> may turn on the electronic clutch <b>233</b> for a predetermined time &#x394;t<b>2</b> from t<b>5</b> to t<b>6</b>. Accordingly, the guide plate <b>220</b> located in the second position (d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) may return to the first position (c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In this way, the guide plate <b>220</b> can quickly return to the first position (c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), and accordingly, the next printing medium may be fed to the guide plate <b>220</b> even though the current printing medium P does not completely come out of the second feeding path S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In this respect, the point t<b>5</b> may be estimated on the basis of a rotational speed of the first driving roller <b>253</b> and the second driving roller <b>263</b> after the real sensing point t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept, a sensor unit to sense the printing medium may be further installed in a section of the second feeding path S<b>2</b> between the second driving roller <b>263</b> and the discharging roller <b>267</b>, to thereby control the electronic clutch <b>233</b> based on a sensing result of the sensor unit. In this case, the sensor unit may be of the same type as the sensor unit <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the case that the plurality of printing mediums P is printed, the controller <b>280</b> may turn off the driving source <b>235</b> after the final printing medium P is discharged through the discharging roller <b>267</b>, for example, in a time point t<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may further include a cover <b>103</b> which is coupled to the main body <b>101</b> to rotate around a hinge shaft <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may further include a scanner <b>140</b> which is installed under the cover <b>103</b> to scan an image of a document.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The image data acquired by the scanner <b>140</b> may be printed by the printing unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the above-described embodiment, the controller <b>280</b> is included in the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b>, but the controller <b>280</b> may not be included in the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">For example, a control signal for controlling the driving source <b>235</b> and the electronic clutch <b>233</b> may be received from the outside of the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b>, that is, a controller (not illustrated) provided in the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. In this case, the reverse-feeding unit <b>200</b> may include an input port for receiving the control signal and may be detachably provided to the main body <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may further include a manipulation panel <b>150</b> installed in a front upper part of the main body <b>101</b>. The manipulation panel <b>150</b> includes an input window (not illustrated), and an input key (not illustrated) such that a user can enter a signal to be used in scanning or printing process of the image forming apparatus using the input window or the input key. A user may receive information about the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> and input a copy command or a printing command through the manipulation panel <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an image forming apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>according to another exemplar embodiment may include a main body <b>101</b><i>a </i>having a through hole <b>104</b> through which a printing medium P can pass, and a hole cover <b>105</b> to cover the through hole <b>104</b>. Here, the hole cover <b>105</b> may be omitted in consideration of a compact size of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b><i>a</i>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">An leading edge of the printing medium P may be transferred along the first feeding path S<b>1</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) by the second driving roller <b>263</b> to pass through the through hole <b>104</b> and then get out of the main body <b>101</b><i>a</i>. The size and weight of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>can be reduced by arranging a portion of the feeding path of the printing medium outside the main body <b>101</b><i>a</i>, as compared with the feeding path fully disposed inside the main body <b>101</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Even though a portion of the printing medium P gets out of the main body <b>101</b><i>a </i>through the through hole <b>104</b>, the printing medium P can not be deviated from the guide plate <b>220</b> by the deviation prevention unit <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In addition, the hole cover <b>105</b> may be installed to the main body <b>101</b><i>a </i>detachably.
