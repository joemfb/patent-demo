<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-086036 filed on Mar. 31, 2009, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/242,609 filed on Sep. 15, 2009, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a gas flow path structure and a substrate processing apparatus. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a gas flow path structure used in a substrate processing apparatus having a movable electrode, and to a substrate processing apparatus including the gas flow path structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A substrate processing apparatus, which performs a plasma process on a semiconductor wafer (hereinafter, simply referred to as a &#x201c;wafer&#x201d;) serving as a substrate, includes a chamber (processing chamber) that accommodates a wafer therein and can be depressurized; a susceptor (mounting table) installed at a lower part within the chamber; and a shower head (upper electrode) provided within the chamber so as to face the susceptor. The susceptor is configured to mount the wafer thereon and serves as a mounting electrode applying a high frequency power from a connected high frequency power supply into the chamber. The shower head introduces a processing gas into the chamber. Further, the shower head is grounded to serve as a facing electrode. In this substrate processing apparatus, the processing gas supplied into the chamber is excited into plasma by the high frequency power, and the wafer is plasma-processed by the plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, in order to appropriately distribute the plasma in a space between the shower head and the susceptor, there has been developed a substrate processing apparatus having a movable susceptor, thereby adjusting a thickness (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;gap&#x201d;) of the space between the shower head and the susceptor. Besides, on account of the restriction on the layout around the substrate processing apparatus, a substrate processing apparatus having a movable shower head, not the movable susceptor, is recently under development.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional view schematically illustrating a configuration of a conventional substrate processing apparatus having a movable shower head.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a substrate processing apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a shower head <b>103</b> is installed within a cylindrical chamber <b>101</b> so as to face a susceptor <b>102</b>. The shower head <b>103</b> is formed into a substantially circular plate shape having an outer diameter substantially the same as an inner diameter of the chamber <b>101</b>. The shower head <b>103</b> is configured to vertically move like a piston within the chamber <b>101</b> by a non-illustrated lift mechanism. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the shower head <b>103</b> at the lowermost position is indicated by a solid line, and the shower head <b>103</b> at the uppermost position is indicated by a dashed line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The shower head <b>103</b> includes a processing gas introducing unit having a gas flow path <b>104</b>, a buffer room <b>105</b>, and gas holes <b>106</b>; and a gas feed pipe <b>107</b> connected to a gas supply source (not shown) for supplying a processing gas into the processing gas introducing unit from the outside. Further, a bellows <b>112</b> having a hermetically sealing function is concentrically installed at an outer peripheral portion of a shaft <b>111</b> on which the shower head <b>103</b> as a vertically movable electrode is held. Since the gas supply source is typically fixed and not moved while the shower head <b>103</b> moves up and down as stated above, the gas feed pipe <b>107</b> needs to be bent depending on a vertical movement of the shower head <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Typically, a flexible tube is known as a pipe for feeding a fluid toward a movable component from a fixed fluid supply source. For example, the flexible tube has been used as a pliable heat insulating pipe for feeding liquefied nitrogen toward a movable door shroud from a vacuum container in a space environment simulator (see, for example, Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, however, since a flexible tube <b>108</b> includes a thin metal pipe <b>109</b> on which a plurality of waves is formed; and a metal mesh blade <b>110</b> enclosing the metal pipe <b>109</b>, it has a relatively high stiffness against bending and thus is lack of flexibility. Accordingly, when the flexible tube <b>108</b> is largely bent, a great stress may be easily generated. Thus, when such a flexible tube is employed together with a movable component having a long displacement (moving distance), it may be broken in an early stage. Accordingly, it is difficult to use the flexible tube <b>108</b> as the gas feed pipe for supplying the processing gas into the shower head <b>103</b> which frequently moves up and down while having a long displacement of, e.g., about 70 mm in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">That is, the flexible tube is not designed to be repetitively bent, and it has a finite lifetime due to an irregular breakdown. Accordingly, the flexible tube needs to be replaced in a cycle of about one year, thus raising a safety issue related to the lifetime. Further, an integrally formed bellows not designed to be bent repetitively raises the same problem as that of the flexible tube. Thus, it is difficult to use such a bellows as the gas feed pipe for supplying the processing gas into the shower head <b>103</b> which frequently moves up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, using a rotary joint coupler at a movable portion of the gas feed pipe may be considered. Since, however, the rotary joint has a physical sliding part, it may be difficult to avoid particle generation. Thus, its application to the substrate processing apparatus in which the particle generation largely affects a quality of a final product is deemed to be unpractical.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, it may be considered to use a bellows instead of the flexible tube or the rotary joint coupler. The bellows includes a metal pipe formed by coupling several circular ring-shaped members (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;pieces&#x201d;) each having a mountain-like longitudinal cross sectional shape. Thus, the bellows has a relatively low stiffness against bending and has a sufficiently high flexibility. Accordingly, even when it is applied as a displacement-absorbing member for the shower head <b>103</b> which frequently moves a long distance, it may not be broken in an early stage because no great stress is generated thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2003-137200</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, although a bellows having a relatively low stiffness against bending and a high flexibility is used as the gas feed pipe for supplying a gas into the vertically-moving shower head, an installation space for the bellows needs to be additionally secured if the bellows is used only for the gas pipe. Accordingly, it is difficult to secure the installation space on a top surface of an upper unit of the substrate processing apparatus including many components. Thus, there arises a layout problem.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, since the bellows is of a higher price as compared to the flexible tube or the like, the length and the number of bellows used in the apparatus need to be minimized.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of the foregoing, the present disclosure provides a gas flow path structure capable of supplying a gas to a movable electrode with a high reliability without raising a layout problem in securing an installation space; and also provides a substrate processing apparatus using the gas flow path structure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, in accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a gas flow path structure of a substrate processing apparatus that performs a plasma process on a processing target substrate by plasma excited from a processing gas supplied between a mounting electrode and a facing electrode via a gas flow path. The substrate processing apparatus includes a depressurizable processing chamber, the mounting electrode installed within the processing chamber and configured to mount the processing target substrate, and the facing electrode installed so as to face the mounting electrode. The gas flow path structure includes: a supporting member configured to support either one of the mounting electrode and the facing electrode while allowing the one electrode to be movable with respect to the other; a first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall having a ring shape and installed at an outer peripheral portion of the supporting member so as to be concentric with the supporting member, the first partition wall serving to absorb a displacement (moving distance) of the one electrode with respect to a wall surface of the processing chamber at a penetration portion where the supporting member penetrates the wall surface and serving to seal an inside of the processing chamber against an ambient atmosphere around the supporting member; and a second displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall having a ring shape and installed at an outer peripheral portion of the first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall so as to be concentric with the first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall. Further, a first ring-shaped gas flow path is formed by the first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall and the second displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall.</p>

Furthermore, plasma is excited from the processing gas supplied between the mounting electrode and the facing electrode, and a plasma process is performed on the processing target substrate by the plasma. Moreover, the gas flow path structure includes: a supporting member configured to support either one of the mounting electrode and the facing electrode while allowing the one electrode to be movable with respect to the other; a first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall having a ring shape and installed at an outer peripheral portion of the supporting member so as to be concentric with the supporting member, the first partition wall serving to absorb a displacement (moving distance) of the one electrode with respect to a wall surface of the processing chamber at a penetration portion where the supporting member penetrates the wall surface and serving to seal an inside of the processing chamber against an ambient atmosphere around the supporting member; and a second displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall having a ring shape and installed at an outer peripheral portion of the first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall so as to be concentric with the first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross sectional view schematically illustrating a configuration of a substrate processing apparatus having a gas flow path structure in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The substrate processing apparatus is configured to form so as to perform dry etching process on a wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a substrate processing apparatus <b>10</b> includes a cylindrical chamber (processing chamber) <b>11</b> that accommodates a wafer W having a diameter of, e.g., about 300 mm. Installed in a lower part of the chamber <b>11</b> is a circular plate-shaped susceptor (mounting electrode) <b>12</b> configured to mount thereon the wafer W for a semiconductor device. An upper part of the chamber <b>11</b> is covered by an openable/closable cover <b>13</b> having a circular plate shape.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inside of the chamber <b>11</b> is depressurized by a TMP (Turbo Molecular Pump), a DP (Dry Pump) (both are not illustrated), and the like, and a pressure within the chamber <b>11</b> is controlled by an APC valve (not illustrated). Further, since even nano-sized particles may cause a defect when adhered to the semiconductor device, a cleaning process is performed in the chamber <b>11</b> prior to a dry etching process, thereby eliminating the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The susceptor <b>12</b> is connected with a first high frequency power supply <b>14</b> via a first matching unit <b>15</b> and with a second high frequency power supply <b>16</b> via a second matching unit <b>17</b>. The first high frequency power supply <b>14</b> is configured to apply a high frequency bias power of a relatively low frequency of, e.g., about 3.2 MHz to the susceptor <b>12</b>. The second high frequency power supply <b>16</b> is configured to apply a plasma-generating high frequency power having a relatively high frequency of, e.g., about 40 MHz to the susceptor <b>12</b>. The susceptor <b>12</b> is configured to apply the plasma-generating power to the inside of the chamber <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Installed at an upper part of the susceptor <b>12</b> is an electrostatic chuck <b>19</b> having therein an electrostatic electrode <b>18</b>. The electrostatic chuck <b>19</b> is made of a circular plate-shaped ceramic member, and the electrostatic electrode <b>18</b> is connected with a DC power supply <b>20</b>. When a positive DC voltage is applied to the electrostatic electrode <b>18</b>, a negative potential is generated on a wafer W's surface (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;rear surface&#x201d;) facing the electrostatic chuck <b>19</b>. As a result, a potential difference is created between the electrostatic electrode <b>18</b> and the rear surface of the wafer W. Accordingly, the wafer W is attracted to and held on the electrostatic chuck <b>19</b> by Coulomb force or Johnson-Rahbek force generated by the potential difference.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, a ring-shaped focus ring <b>21</b> is mounted on the susceptor <b>12</b> so as to surround the wafer W attracted to and held on the electrostatic chuck <b>19</b>. The focus ring <b>21</b> is made of a conductive material such as single crystalline silicon which is the same material as that forming the wafer W. Since the focus ring <b>21</b> is made of the conductive material, plasma can be distributed onto the focus ring <b>21</b> as well as onto the wafer W. Therefore, a plasma density at a peripheral portion of the wafer W can be maintained substantially the same as a plasma density at a central portion thereof. Thus, uniformity of the dry etching process can be maintained on the entire surface of the wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A shower head <b>22</b> is installed above the susceptor <b>12</b>, while facing it. The shower head <b>22</b> includes a conductive upper electrode <b>24</b> having a plurality of gas holes <b>23</b>; a cooling plate <b>25</b> on which the upper electrode <b>24</b> is attachably/detachably held; and a shaft <b>26</b> as a supporting member on which the cooling plate <b>25</b> is held. The upper electrode <b>24</b> is grounded and serves as a grounding electrode (facing electrode) for the plasma-generating power applied to the inside of the chamber <b>11</b>. An outer diameter of the upper electrode <b>24</b> is substantially the same as an inner diameter of the chamber <b>11</b>, and the upper electrode <b>24</b> is installed within the chamber <b>11</b> in a movable state.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The shaft <b>26</b> penetrates the cover <b>13</b>, and an upper portion of the shaft <b>26</b> is connected to a lift mechanism (not illustrated) located above the substrate processing apparatus <b>10</b>. The lift mechanism is configured to move the shaft <b>26</b> in a vertical direction. Along with the movements of the shaft <b>26</b>, the shower head <b>22</b> having the upper electrode <b>24</b> also moves up and down like a piston within the chamber <b>11</b>. Accordingly, a gap, i.e., a thickness of a space between the shower head <b>22</b> and the susceptor <b>12</b> can be adjusted. A maximum moving distance of the shower head <b>22</b> in the vertical direction is, e.g., about 70 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Particles may be generated due to a friction between the shaft <b>26</b> and the cover <b>13</b>. Therefore, an outer peripheral surface of the shaft <b>26</b> is enclosed by a first bellows <b>31</b> serving as a first displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall. The shaft <b>26</b> has a columnar shape, and the cylindrical first bellows <b>31</b> is arranged concentrically with the shaft <b>26</b>. An upper end of the first bellows <b>31</b> is joined to a bottom surface of the cover <b>13</b>, and a lower end of the first bellows <b>31</b> is coupled to a top surface of the cooling plate <b>25</b>. With this configuration, a displacement (moving distance) of the electrode with respect to the cover (wall surface) <b>13</b> is absorbed at a penetration portion where the shaft <b>26</b> penetrates the cover <b>13</b>. Further, the first bellows <b>31</b> seals the inside of the processing chamber <b>11</b> against the ambient atmosphere around the shaft <b>26</b>. Thus, the inside of the chamber <b>11</b> remains isolated from the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A second bellows <b>32</b> having a circular cross section is concentrically provided at an outer peripheral portion of the first bellows <b>31</b> to be located adjacent thereto. The second bellows <b>32</b> serves as a second displacement-absorbing pressure partition wall. The second bellows <b>32</b> has a diameter suitable for providing a gap between the first bellows <b>31</b> and the second bellows <b>32</b>. An upper end of the second bellows <b>32</b> is coupled to the bottom surface of the cover <b>13</b>, and a lower end of the second bellows <b>32</b> is fastened to the top surface of the cooling plate <b>25</b>. The gap between the first and second bellows <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> serves as a gas flow path <b>35</b>. The gas flow path <b>35</b> is connected with a gas supply system (not shown) through a processing gas supply pipe <b>36</b> that penetrates the cover <b>13</b>. Further, the gas flow path <b>35</b> communicates with a buffer room <b>29</b> within the cooling plate <b>25</b> through a gas hole <b>38</b>. The buffer room <b>29</b> communicates with the inside of the chamber <b>11</b> through the gas holes <b>23</b>. A processing gas is introduced from the gas supply system into the gas flow path <b>35</b> formed by the first and second bellows <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> through the processing gas supply pipe <b>36</b>. Then, the processing gas is introduced into the buffer room <b>29</b> within the cooling plate <b>25</b> through the gas hole <b>38</b> and then into the chamber <b>11</b> through the gas holes <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial enlarged view of the first bellows (second bellows). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a left half of the drawing is a cross sectional view, while a right half is a side view.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first bellows <b>31</b> includes a metal pipe formed by connecting a multiple number of circular ring-shaped members (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;pieces&#x201d;) <b>31</b><i>a </i>in a lengthwise direction. Each piece <b>31</b><i>a </i>has a mountain-like longitudinal (lengthwise) cross sectional shape. Each piece <b>31</b><i>a </i>includes two circular ring-shaped metal plates <b>31</b><i>b </i>formed in tapered shapes. By welding one ends of the two metal plates <b>31</b><i>b </i>together, they are joined to each other. That is, since the two metal plates <b>31</b><i>b </i>of each piece <b>31</b><i>a </i>are joined just at a welded part <b>31</b><i>c </i>at the top of the mountain-like shape, they have low stiffness against expansion/contraction in a direction indicated by an arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> while having high flexibility. Thus, the bellows is easily expanded and contracted in a direction indicated by an arrow A. Further, each piece <b>31</b><i>a </i>has a circular ring-shaped cross section in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction. Since each piece <b>31</b><i>a </i>is made of a metal, the first bellows <b>31</b> is hardly deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the non-illustrated lift mechanism is operated to move the shower head <b>22</b> up and down. As the lift mechanism is driven, a relative position of the shower head <b>22</b> coupled to the shaft <b>26</b> with respect to the susceptor <b>12</b> varies. Since, however, the first and second bellows <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> forming the gas flow path <b>35</b> are expanded and contracted depending on the vertical movements of the shower head <b>22</b>, a change in the relative position of the shower head <b>22</b> is absorbed. As a result, the gas flow path <b>35</b> is kept connected with the processing gas supply system so that it can always supply the processing gas even when the shower head <b>22</b> moves up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An operation of each part of the above-described substrate processing apparatus <b>10</b>, e.g., the first high frequency power supply <b>14</b> or the second high frequency power supply <b>16</b> is controlled by a CPU of a control unit (not shown) of the substrate processing apparatus <b>10</b> according to a program corresponding to a dry etching process.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the substrate processing apparatus <b>10</b> having the above-described configuration, to distribute plasma appropriately, the gap between the susceptor <b>12</b> and the shower head <b>22</b> is controlled by moving the shaft <b>26</b> up and down by means of driving the lift mechanism (not shown). Then, the processing gas is supplied into the chamber <b>11</b> via the processing gas supply pipe <b>36</b>. The processing gas flowing through the processing gas supply pipe <b>36</b> is introduced into the gas flow path <b>35</b> after particles are filtered by, e.g., a filter installed on the middle of the processing gas supply pipe <b>36</b>. Then, the particle-free processing gas is introduced into the chamber <b>11</b> via the buffer room <b>29</b> within the cooling plate <b>25</b> and the gas holes <b>23</b>. The processing gas introduced in the chamber <b>11</b> is excited into plasma by a plasma-generating power applied to the inside of the chamber <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Positive ions in the plasma are attracted toward the wafer W on the susceptor <b>12</b> due to a negative bias potential generated by a bias power applied to the susceptor <b>12</b>. As a result, a dry etching process is performed on the wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with the present embodiment discussed above, the gas flow path for introducing the processing gas between the susceptor <b>12</b> and the shower head <b>22</b> of the substrate processing apparatus <b>10</b> is formed by the expansible/contractible first and second bellows <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> that are arranged concentrically around the shaft <b>26</b> supporting the shower head <b>22</b>. Thus, an installation space for the gas flow path can be secured easily. Furthermore, since the displacement of the shower head <b>22</b> can be absorbed according to the vertical movement of the shower head <b>22</b>, the processing gas can be supplied stably and successfully, thus improving reliability of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In accordance with the present embodiment, the first bellows <b>31</b>, which is previously installed in the substrate processing apparatus having the vertically movable shower head, to be used as a pressure partition wall that isolates the space within the chamber from the atmosphere. The first bellows <b>31</b> is utilized as a member that forms the expansible/contractible gas flow path <b>35</b>. Thus, a structure for expanding/contracting the gas flow path and a structure for absorbing the vertical movement of the shower head can be integrated as one body, so that an increase of the number of necessary components can be minimized. Furthermore, since the expansible/contractible gas flow path <b>35</b> is installed within the chamber, a structure in the upper part of the chamber may not be complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the present embodiment, desirably, the first bellows <b>31</b> and the second bellows <b>32</b> have inner diameters equal to or larger than, e.g., about 100 mm &#x3c6;. Accordingly, conductance of the gas flow path <b>35</b> increases as compared to a typical gas pipe, whereby the gap between the first and second bellows <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> can be greatly shortened, for example. The width of the gap between the first and second bellows <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> mostly relies on the design of an operating margin of the bellows. However, a minimum gap of, e.g., about 10 mm, needs to be provided in order to cope with an interruption of the vertical movement such as buckling (deformation).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present embodiment, since the bellows has high flexibility for the expansion and contraction and no great stress is generated when the bellows expands and contracts, an early breakdown of the gas flow path <b>35</b> can be avoided. Thus, the reliability of the apparatus can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present embodiment, although the first and second bellows <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> have the circular cross sections, they may have other cross sectional shapes such as ovals, rectangles or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the present embodiment, only the first bellows <b>31</b> functions as a pressure partition wall that isolates a space within the chamber from the atmosphere. Accordingly, the first bellows <b>31</b> needs to withstand a pressure condition of &#x2018;internal pressure&#x3e;&#x3e;external pressure&#x2019; as compared to the second bellows <b>32</b>. Thus, a means to prevent buckling (deformation) (e.g., installation of a guide) needs to be prepared for the first bellows <b>31</b>. For example, it is desirable to install a guide member for preventing buckling (deformation) at an outer peripheral portion of the first bellows <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The second bellows <b>32</b> is provided to form the gas flow path <b>35</b>. The gas flow path <b>35</b> communicates with the inside of the chamber <b>11</b> and is depressurized to the same level as the inside of the chamber <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the function of isolating the vacuum from the atmosphere is not so much required for the second bellows <b>32</b> as compared to the first bellows <b>31</b>. Further, even when three or more bellows are arranged concentrically to form multiple gas flow paths, a vacuum stress applied to the bellows other than the first bellows may not be great.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, in the present embodiment, although the bellows is used as a displacement-absorbing partition wall, a sliding seal structure having a ferrofluid seal may be used instead of the bellows. In such a case, however, a countermeasure against particle generation needs to be prepared because the sliding seal structure has a sliding member.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although the present embodiment has been described for the configuration where the shower head <b>22</b> moves up and down, the present disclosure is also applicable to a configuration where the susceptor <b>12</b> installed in the lower part of the chamber <b>11</b>, for example, moves up and down. To elaborate, when the susceptor <b>12</b> moves up and down and a gas needs to be supplied to this susceptor <b>12</b> from outside, a gas flow path connected with an external gas supply source can be formed within the substrate processing apparatus by arranging a plurality of bellows concentrically around a shaft that supports the susceptor <b>12</b> while allowing vertical movements thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view schematically illustrating a modification example of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a substrate processing apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, two processing gas supply systems and two gas flow paths as in the substrate processing apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are provided so as to supply two different kinds of gases into the chamber <b>11</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the same parts as those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be assigned same reference numerals, and redundant description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The substrate processing apparatus <b>50</b> is different from the substrate processing apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that a third bellows <b>33</b> is installed at an outer peripheral portion of a second bellows <b>32</b> while being spaced apart from the second bellows <b>32</b>, and a gap between the second bellows <b>32</b> and the third bellows <b>33</b> serves as a second gas flow path <b>45</b>. Further, a buffer room <b>29</b> is divided into an inner buffer room <b>29</b><i>a </i>and an outer buffer room <b>29</b><i>b</i>. A first gas flow path <b>35</b> communicates with the inner buffer room <b>29</b><i>a </i>via a gas hole <b>38</b>, while the second flow path <b>45</b> communicates with the outer buffer room <b>29</b><i>b </i>via a gas hole <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the substrate processing apparatus <b>50</b> having the above-described configuration, two different kinds of processing gases are supplied into the first gas flow path <b>35</b> and the second gas flow path <b>45</b> via a processing gas supply pipe <b>36</b> and a processing gas supply pipe <b>46</b>, respectively. Further, for example, filters capable of filtering even a very small or minute amount of particles from the processing gases are installed on the middle of the processing gas supply pipes <b>36</b> and <b>46</b>. A first kind of processing gas is introduced into the gas flow path <b>35</b> after particles therein are removed by the filter. Then, the first kind of processing gas is introduced into the chamber <b>11</b> via the gas hole <b>38</b>, the buffer room <b>29</b><i>a </i>and gas holes <b>23</b>. Further, a second kind of processing gas is introduced into the gas flow path <b>45</b> after particles therein are filtered by the filter. Then, the second kind of processing gas is introduced into the chamber <b>11</b> via the gas hole <b>39</b>, the buffer room <b>29</b><i>b </i>and other gas holes <b>23</b>. The two different kinds of processing gases introduced in the chamber <b>11</b> are excited into plasma by a plasma-generating power applied to the inside of the chamber <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Positive ions in the plasma are attracted toward a wafer W on a susceptor <b>12</b> due to a negative bias potential generated by a bias power applied to the susceptor <b>12</b>. As a result, a dry etching process is performed on the wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As in the above-described embodiment, an installation space for the gas flow paths can also be easily secured in this example. Furthermore, since a displacement of a shower head <b>22</b> can be absorbed according to a vertical movement of the shower head <b>22</b>, the processing gas can be supplied stably and successfully, thus improving reliability of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this modification example, the number of the gas flow paths is not limited to two, but three or more gas flow paths may be provided by increasing the number of concentrically arranged bellows.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, in the above-discussed embodiment, although the wafer for the semiconductor device has been described as the substrate on which the dry etching process is performed, the substrate is not limited thereto, and it can be, e.g., a glass substrate for a FPD (Flat Panel Display) including a LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).</p>
