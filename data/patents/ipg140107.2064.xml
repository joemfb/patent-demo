<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to nonwoven materials produced from continuous tow bands, and to apparatuses, systems, and methods related thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Nonwoven material is a term of art that refers to a manufactured sheet, batting, webbing, or fabric that is held together by various methods. Those methods include, for example, fusion of fibers (e.g., thermal, ultrasonic, pressure, and the like), bonding of fibers (e.g., resins, solvents, adhesives, and the like), and mechanical entangling (e.g., needle-punching, hydroentangling, and the like). The term is sometimes used broadly to cover other structures such as those held together by interlacing of yarns (stitch bonding) or those made from perforated or porous films. The term excludes woven, knitted, and tufted structures, paper, and felts made by wet milling processes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nonwoven materials can be produced from carding processes that convert bales of staple fibers into mats that are needlepunched or hydroentangled to produce the nonwoven materials. Staple fibers are finite in length (approximately 7 centimeters in length) that during carding are spread into a uniform web. In the final steps of carding, a resin bonding treatment is typically included to enhance the robustness of the final nonwoven material, e.g., making the nonwoven material durable to washing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the carding process, staple fibers which are shorter may not be able to be carded by the carding apparatus and drop to the floor thereby creating waste. In some instances, recycling of the shorter stable fibers is performed to minimize waste.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, during the carding process, stable fibers may become airborne thereby increasing mechanical problems and health risk. Airborne fibers may collect in the equipment leading to increased maintenance and possible downtime. Further, airborne fibers pose inhalation and dermal irritation risks to workers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because of the significant investment in capital equipment for carding and health issues associated with processing bales of staple fiber, the production of nonwoven materials from tow bands has been of interest to one skilled in the art. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;continuous tow band&#x201d; and &#x201c;tow band&#x201d; may be used interchangeably to refer to a collection of continuous (e.g., indefinite or extreme length) fiber filaments without defined twist usually held together with a crimp and/or tackifier. It should be noted that tow bands may be of any cross-sectional shapes including, but not limited to, circular, substantially circular, ovular, substantially ovular, rectangular, substantially rectangular, planar, and substantially planar.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Producing nonwoven materials from continuous tow bands potentially increases the production speed of nonwoven materials in two ways. First, tow bands can be processed on the order of 650 meters per minute while bales of staple fibers can be run at a max speed of about 400 meters per minute. Second, bales of tow bands have more material than bales of staple fibers, which reduces the frequency of switch bales relative to the production volume of nonwoven materials. However, tow bands are typically produced with maximum widths of about 15 cm to about 60 cm depending on the composition of the tow band filaments. As some nonwoven materials need to be produced with widths of meters, the use of tow bands for the production of nonwovens has been limited.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Apparatuses to bring together tow bands to produce nonwoven materials similar in width to nonwoven material produced by carding would be of benefit to one skilled in the art for a plurality of reasons.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention relates to nonwoven materials produced from continuous tow bands, and to apparatuses, systems, and methods related thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The systems described herein enable the production of nonwoven materials from continuous tow bands. In some embodiments, the systems are capable of combining tow bands to ultimately produce nonwoven materials with widths many times the width of an individual tow band, e.g., 25 times the width of an individual tow band. The systems advantageously may require less capital investment in equipment, in most cases less than half the investment of traditional carding systems, and may be integrated with other processes and equipment for downstream nonwoven processing (e.g., hydroentanglement or needlelooming). Additionally, the systems of the present invention may, in some embodiments, be configured to produce nonwoven materials with layered or complex compositions at the point of integration of the mat, which in carding processes are produced by combining nonwoven materials as opposed to while the nonwoven materials are being produced.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Utilizing tow bands may also be advantageous in the processing speed and efficiency, in that, bales of tow bands are often more densely packed than staple fiber bales thereby yielding more nonwoven material per bale using tow band bales. Additionally, tow band processing is faster than staple fiber processing. Together, these increase both speed and efficiency of manufacturing nonwoven materials. Further, the utilization of continuous tow bands may provide advantages by reducing waste, reducing processing steps (e.g., eliminating resin bonding), reducing the risk of mechanical problems, and reducing health risks to workers all of which are typically associated with the production of nonwoven materials using carding.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the systems of the present invention for producing bulked webs from tow bands may comprise at least one tow band processing line operably connected to at least one master air jet to receive processed tow bands from the tow band processing lines, nonlimiting examples of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. In some embodiments, the systems of the present invention for producing bulked webs from tow bands may comprise at least one tow band processing line and at least one master air jet, nonlimiting examples of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. In some embodiments, a system may have six or more tow band processing lines and two or more master air jets (in parallel and/or in series).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">One skilled in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize the apparatuses or machinery capable for properly transporting the continuous tow bands, processed tow bands, and bulked webs to, between, and/or from the tow band processing lines, the master air jet, and any additional processing areas or lines (e.g., collection areas, additive application areas, nonwoven manufacturing lines, product manufacturing lines, and the like). By way of nonlimiting examples, suitable apparatuses and/or machinery may include guides, rollers, reels, gears, conveyors, transfer belts, vacuums, air jets, and the like, any hybrid thereof, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, systems may include a conveyor for transporting a bulked web to nonwoven manufacturing lines.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Master air jets generally use an air jet to create a Venturi that moves processed tow bands through the master air jet apparatus. The Venturi may further act to entangle filaments of adjacent processed tow bands as they pass through the master air jet. In some embodiments, the master air jet of the present invention may be configured to received a plurality of processed tow bands. In some embodiments, the master air jet of the present invention may be configured to produce bulked webs produced from tow bands where the bulked webs have calipers and/or complex cross-sectional make-ups not previously realized. In some embodiments, the increased caliper and/or possibility of complex cross-sectional make-ups of the bulked webs of the present invention may enable the production of nonwoven materials not previous realized when produced from tow bands.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-9</figref>, nonlimiting examples of master air jets of the present invention and components thereof, master air jet <b>440</b> may include housing <b>442</b> that generally is formed by a pair of side plates <b>474</b>, top plate <b>480</b>, and bottom plate <b>482</b>. It should be noted that side, top, and bottom to modify the plates are used for simplicity in describing the master air jet and should not be taken to be limiting as to the relation of the master air jet to the plane of the ground. The pair of side plates <b>474</b> may be operably attached to the top plate <b>480</b> and bottom plate <b>482</b> with bolts at sizing guides <b>478</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At one end, master air jet <b>440</b> includes inlet opening <b>444</b>. As best seen as an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, inlet opening <b>444</b> may have a generally rectangular configuration that corresponds generally to the shape of the continuous tow band which is received in inlet opening <b>444</b>. Housing <b>442</b> also includes outlet opening <b>446</b> which, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, may also have a rectangular configuration that corresponds to the desired shape of the processed tow band leaving master air jet <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Air jet <b>448</b> may be formed adjacent the inlet end of housing <b>442</b> and may include a source of compressed air (or other fluid in some embodiments) and a conventional control valve for regulating the flow of compressed air from the compressed air source to air manifold <b>454</b> through which the compressed air is delivered to jet orifices <b>456</b>. Jet orifices <b>456</b> may form a conventional jet of air for moving the continuous tow band through central passageway <b>458</b> in housing <b>442</b> as will be explained in greater detail herein. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, passageway <b>458</b> has a gradually increasing cross-sectional area in the direction of movement of the continuous tow band so as to provide forming chamber <b>460</b> downstream of air jet <b>448</b>. Forming chamber <b>460</b> may also preferably have a generally rectangular configuration that corresponds to the rectangular shape of the processed tow bands.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Accumulating chamber <b>462</b> may be located adjacent the outlet end of housing <b>442</b> and downstream of forming chamber <b>460</b> and may have a vertical dimension which is greater than outlet opening <b>446</b> of forming chamber <b>460</b>. Accumulating chamber <b>462</b> may also be preferably formed with a rectangular configuration to permit the continuous tow band to pass into accumulating chamber <b>462</b> from forming chamber <b>460</b> to accumulate within accumulating chamber <b>462</b>. Ultimately the processed tow bands may be withdrawn from housing <b>442</b> through outlet opening <b>446</b> at different flow rates yielding a bulked web.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a pair of perforated plates <b>468</b>, each having a large number of perforations <b>470</b> therein, may be disposed in accumulating chamber <b>462</b> and in side plates <b>474</b> between forming chamber <b>460</b> and accumulating chamber <b>462</b>. Perforated plates <b>468</b> may be fixed in place to top plate <b>480</b> and bottom plate <b>482</b> by a plurality of bolts <b>472</b> that maintain perforated plates <b>468</b> in fixed positions to form accumulating chamber <b>462</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The size of forming chamber <b>460</b> and accumulating chamber <b>462</b> may be involved in determining the caliper of the bulked web produced from master air jet <b>440</b>. Sizing guides <b>478</b> along side plates <b>474</b> allow for increasing or decreasing the size of forming chamber <b>460</b>. It should be noted that the configuration of sizing guides <b>478</b> along side plates <b>474</b> may allow for changing the size of forming chamber <b>460</b> by different amounts by angling top plate <b>480</b> relative to bottom plate <b>482</b>. Varying the shape and/or positions of perforated plates <b>468</b> the size of accumulating chamber <b>462</b> may be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, the size of inlet opening <b>444</b> and outlet opening <b>446</b> may be adjusted using sizing guides <b>478</b> along side plates <b>474</b> or varying the position and/or shape of perforated plates <b>468</b>. Variable sizing of inlet opening <b>444</b> may advantageously allow for receiving higher caliper processed tow bands into master air jet <b>440</b>. Also variable sizing of outlet opening <b>446</b> may advantageously allow for producing higher caliper bulked webs.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Side plates <b>474</b> may also have a plurality of perforations <b>476</b> located generally at a position where the carrier air leaves forming chamber <b>460</b> and enters accumulating chamber <b>462</b>, whereby some of the carrier air can be discharged through perforations <b>476</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the operation of master air jet <b>440</b>, compressed air flows to air jet <b>448</b> at a flow rate controlled by the control valve, and the jet of air formed by orifices <b>456</b> may move the continuous tow band through forming chamber <b>460</b>. As the processed tow band moves through forming chamber <b>460</b> by the carrier air, the carrier air may at least partially bulk the processed tow band so that it gradually increases in cross-sectional area in conformity with the gradually increasing cross-sectional area of forming chamber <b>460</b>. When the processed tow band exits forming chamber <b>460</b> and enters accumulating chamber <b>462</b>, the processed tow band bulks even further to correspond to the vertical distance between the upstream ends of perforated plates <b>468</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While some of the carrier air may be discharged through perforations <b>476</b> in side plates <b>474</b>, a substantial portion of the carrier air moves the processed tow band through the spacing between perforated plates <b>468</b> and passes outwardly through perforations <b>470</b> in perforated plates <b>468</b>. In so doing, the air passing outwardly through perforations <b>470</b> urges the processed tow band into frictional engagement with the facing inner surfaces of perforated plates <b>468</b>. This frictional engagement creates a braking action on the processed tow band which should retard the movement of the processed tow band through accumulating chamber <b>462</b> and causes the tow to accumulate in accumulating chamber <b>462</b> at a density greater than the processed tow band had in forming chamber <b>460</b>, after which the bulked and densified processed tow band exits the accumulating chamber <b>462</b> as a bulked web through the outlet opening <b>446</b> at different flow rates.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The flow rate of the carrier air may determine the retarding or braking action applied to the continuous tow band as it passes between perforated plates <b>468</b>. If the flow rate of the carrier air is increased, the carrier air passing outwardly through perforations <b>470</b> in perforated plates <b>468</b> will urge the processed tow band into engagement with perforated plates <b>468</b> with a greater force, and may thereby increase the retarding or braking action that is applied to the processed tow band. Conversely, if the flow rate of the carrier air is decreased, there will be a smaller braking action applied to the processed tow band. Therefore, virtually infinite regulation of the braking action may be obtained by the simple expedient of operating the control valve to provide a flow of carrier air that provides the desired braking action imposed on the processed tow band, and thereby should control the density and caliper of the bulked web as it leaves housing <b>442</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may having hinged side plates. Hinged side plates may advantageously allow for physically pulling processed tow bands through the master air jet then closing the hinged side plates with the air jets operating so as to create the Venturi that then operates to transport the processed tow bands through the master air jet. By way of nonlimiting example, the ability to physically start the movement of the processed tow bands through the master air jet may be needed with high denier and high denier per filament processed tow bands.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments of the present invention, two or more master air jets may be in series. Because master air jets produce bulked webs with increased caliper, the dimensions of the inlet of the second (or greater) master air jet in a series should be appropriately sized.
