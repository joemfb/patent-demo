<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to storage area networks and, more particularly, to systems and methods for protocol independent server replacement and replication in a storage area network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical storage area network (SAN), several servers are remotely connected to one or more storage devices. The servers treat the devices as if the devices are locally attached and may boot from or store data in the storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The benefits of SAN technology include flexible data storage, centralized storage management, disaster recovery, and large scalability. A server may connect to a SAN using different types of connections and protocols. Existing software implementations, however, prevent the user from taking full advantage of the benefits of SAN technology by imposing restrictions on the type of servers that may be connected to a SAN in some important SAN management scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, adding a new server to a SAN (for replacement or as a backup) requires the new server to connect to the SAN using the same SAN connectivity protocol or communication standard (e.g., FC&#x2014;Fiber Channel, iSCSI&#x2014;Small Computer System Interface over the Ethernet, SAS&#x2014;Serial Attached Small Computer System Interface) as an existing server.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Systems and methods are needed that can overcome the aforementioned shortcomings by providing multi-protocol compatibility when adding a new server to a SAN.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to a system and corresponding methods for protocol independent server replacement and replication in a storage area network.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough description of various embodiments of the invention. Certain embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with some variations in detail. In some instances, certain features are described in less detail so as not to obscure other aspects of the invention. The level of detail associated with each of the elements or features should not be construed to qualify the novelty or importance of one feature over the others.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment, an exemplary storage area network (SAN) <b>100</b> may comprise server(s) <b>110</b>, interconnects <b>115</b>, storage device(s) <b>130</b>, and management station <b>140</b>. Server(s) <b>110</b> and storage device(s) <b>130</b> may be physically or logically connected by way of wired or wireless interconnect(s) <b>115</b>, which may comprise physical media and connection devices. Protocol(s) <b>120</b> in conjunction with interconnects <b>115</b> govern and enable communication between the devices in the communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, server(s) <b>110</b> and storage device(s) <b>130</b> may thus communicate in accordance with communication standards defined in protocol(s) <b>120</b>. Management station <b>140</b> may logically configure server(s) <b>110</b>, storage device(s) <b>130</b>, and associated connection devices in interconnect(s) <b>115</b> so that server(s) <b>110</b> may communicate with storage device(s) <b>130</b> over protocols <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each storage device <b>130</b> has communication ports that may receive or transmit data according to protocol(s) <b>120</b>. Protocol(s) <b>120</b> may comprise, without limitation, protocols such as Fiber Channel (FC), Small Computer System Interface over the Ethernet (iSCSI), and Serial Attached Small Computer System Interface (SAS), for example. An FC protocol may require optic fiber wires, while an iSCSI protocol may require Ethernet cables, for example. As such, data communication over different protocols may require different system configurations that comply with the physical and logical properties of the communication components involved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Management station <b>140</b> monitors and controls the operation of SAN <b>100</b>'s components (e.g., configuration of server(s) <b>110</b> for access to storage device(s) <b>130</b>). SAN <b>100</b> may be reconfigured when a server <b>110</b><i>a </i>is added. Server <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be added to replace an existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>due to hardware failure or to replicate existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>for backup purposes or for cluster configurations (e.g., when several computing systems are treated as a single computing system).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment, server <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be added to replace or replicate existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>by identifying a set of supported protocols <b>120</b> for connecting server <b>110</b><i>a </i>to a storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>that is configured to communicate with existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>(S<b>210</b>). A protocol <b>120</b><i>a </i>is selected from the set of supported protocols <b>120</b> (S<b>220</b>) and used to configure storage device <b>130</b><i>a, </i>server <b>110</b><i>a, </i>and associated connection devices in interconnect <b>115</b> so that server <b>110</b><i>a </i>may communicate with storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>(S<b>230</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Operations performed in blocks S<b>210</b>, S<b>220</b>, and S<b>230</b> may be repeated for each storage device <b>130</b> that is configured as a storage resource for the existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>so that server <b>110</b><i>a </i>may communicate with the same storage devices <b>130</b> as existing server <b>110</b><i>b. </i>It is noteworthy that management station <b>140</b> may compute and store the information necessary to perform the operation in block S<b>230</b> until management station <b>140</b> has confirmed that the operation may be successfully performed for each storage device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The set of supported protocols <b>120</b> may be identified by making a first list of protocols supported by server <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a second list of protocols supported by storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>and computing the intersection between the two lists. For example, if server <b>110</b><i>a </i>supports protocols A, C, and D and storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>supports protocols B, C, and D, then the set of supported protocols <b>120</b> includes protocols C and D.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some cases, however, the set of supported protocols <b>120</b> may be empty, if there is no intersection between the first list of protocols supported by server <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the second list of protocols supported by storage device <b>130</b><i>a. </i>Such a scenario may arise, for example, if server <b>110</b><i>a </i>supports protocols A, B, and C and storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>supports protocols D, E, and F.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In certain embodiments, the problem of an empty set of supported protocols <b>120</b> may be solved by transferring data between storage devices. For example, where server <b>110</b><i>a </i>supports protocols A, B, and C and storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>supports protocols D, E, and F, no common protocol are shared between storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>and server <b>110</b><i>a</i>. However, if a storage device <b>130</b><i>b </i>that supports protocols B, C, and D is present in SAN <b>100</b>, then data from storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>may be transferred to storage device <b>130</b><i>b. </i>In this manner, the set of supported protocols <b>120</b> may be calculated based on the common protocols shared between storage device <b>130</b><i>b </i>and server <b>110</b><i>a </i>(i.e., the set of supported protocols <b>120</b> will included protocols B and C, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The set of supported protocols <b>120</b> may include a large number of protocols, especially if server <b>110</b><i>a </i>and storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>support several of the same protocols. Thus, when several protocols are identified in the supported set <b>120</b>, a protocol <b>120</b><i>a </i>may be selected from the supported set <b>120</b> by applying a prioritization algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, depending on implementation, the protocol used by existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be chosen over other protocols for the purpose of maintaining consistency and efficiency. The prioritization algorithm may also take into account other factors such as physical distance, cost, connection speed, and other factors that may be important to maximizing overall system efficiency and integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, SAN <b>100</b> may comprise one or more standby servers (not shown) that are connected but have no configured storage devices. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in accordance with one implementation, management station <b>140</b> may add a standby server to replace or replicate existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>in response to detecting a trigger event (S<b>310</b>). After analyzing and collecting configuration data from the computing environment (S<b>320</b>), management station <b>140</b> may select a standby server from the set of standby servers that are capable of replacing or replicating existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>(S<b>330</b>-S<b>340</b>). Management station <b>140</b> then configures the selected standby server to replace or replicate existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>(S<b>350</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The trigger event may cause management station <b>140</b> to either replace or replicate existing server <b>110</b><i>b</i>. Existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be replaced with a standby server for maintenance or repairs or due to hardware failure, for example. Existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be replicated by a standby server as a response to server overload or lack of resources, for example. The trigger event is not limited to hardware failure. Trigger events may also include, without limitation other events that may render existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>inoperable or inefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, management station <b>140</b> may analyze and collect configuration data from the computing environment by examining the configuration of each network device in the computing environment. Depending on implementation, management station <b>140</b> may update a database whenever a change is made to SAN <b>100</b>. The configuration data may comprise information about the particular storage devices <b>130</b> configured to communicate with a particular server <b>110</b>, the protocols <b>120</b> supported by the configured storage devices <b>130</b>, and the protocols <b>120</b> used by a particular server <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The collected configuration data may be used to identify a set of standby servers that are capable of replacing existing server <b>110</b><i>b</i>. A standby server is capable of replacing existing server <b>110</b><i>b </i>if the standby server is connected to existing server <b>110</b><i>b</i>'s storage devices <b>130</b> and it is possible to configure storage devices <b>130</b>, the standby server, and interconnect <b>115</b> devices to provide connectivity between the server and the storage.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is noteworthy that a standby server may be identified more than once in the set of standby servers, if there is more than one way or path for the standby server to connect to the existing server <b>110</b><i>b</i>'s storage devices <b>130</b>. For example, if the standby server supports protocols A, B, and C, and a storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>supports protocols A, B, C, and D, the set of supported protocols <b>120</b> comprise protocols A, B, and C. In this case, there are at least three ways that storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>may connect to the standby server (i.e., through each one of the three protocols A, B, and C). Thus, the standby server may be identified at least three times.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The standby server may also connect to storage device <b>130</b><i>a </i>using other protocols. As provided earlier, in certain embodiments, the set of supported protocols <b>120</b> may be expanded to include protocols that are supported by another storage device <b>130</b><i>b. </i>The possibility to connect through multiple protocols advantageously reduces the number of standby servers that may be needed in SAN <b>100</b> for backup purposes because a standby server is not needed for each existing server <b>110</b> that connects using a different protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Also provided earlier, selecting a standby server may be done in accordance with a prioritization algorithm. Once the standby server is selected, SAN <b>100</b> may be reconfigured so that the standby server may have access to the same data that server <b>110</b><i>b </i>had access to prior to being replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Depending on implementation, it is possible that the present invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. A software embodiment may include, but not be limited to, to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, the invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Other components may be coupled to the system. Input/output or I/O devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters (e.g., modem, cable modem, Ethernet cards) may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should also be understood that the logic code, programs, modules, processes, methods and the order in which the respective steps of each method are performed are purely exemplary. Depending on implementation, the steps may be performed in any order or in parallel, unless indicated otherwise in the present disclosure. Further, the logic code is not related, or limited to any particular programming language, and may comprise of one or more modules that execute on one or more processors in a distributed, non-distributed or multiprocessing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Therefore, it should be understood that the invention can be practiced with modification and alteration within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The description is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. These and various other adaptations and combinations of the embodiments disclosed are within the scope of the invention and are further defined by the claims and their full scope of equivalents.</p>
