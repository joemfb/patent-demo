<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic image forming apparatus for forming an image on a recording material, wherein cartridge is dismountably mounted to a main assembly of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Here, the electrophotographic image forming apparatus forms an image on the recording material using an electrophotographic image forming process. The examples of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus include an electrophotographic copying machine, an electrophotographic printer (a laser beam printer, an LED printer, for example), a facsimile device, and a word processor. On a recording material, an image is formed by the electrophotographic image forming apparatus and it includes paper, for example, an OHT sheet, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cartridge is a process cartridge, a developing cartridge or the like and contributes to an image forming process for forming the image on the recording material in the state that it is mounted to the main assembly of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus. Here, the process cartridge contains at least one of the charging means, developing means, cleaning means as process means, and the electrophotographic photosensitive drum as a unit integrally, and it is dismountably mountable to the main assembly. The process cartridge may contain the developing means as the process means and the electrophotographic photosensitive drum as a unit, and it is dismountably mounted to the main assembly of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus. The process cartridge may contain the charging means, the developing means, or the cleaning means as the process means and the electrophotographic photosensitive drum as a unit, and it is dismountably mounted to the main assembly. A process cartridge which is provided integrally with the electrophotographic photosensitive drum and the developing means is a so-called integral type. The process cartridge which is provided integrally with the electrophotographic photosensitive drum and the process means other than the developing means is called a discrete type process cartridge. In this case, the developing means is provided in a developing unit unintegral with the process cartridge, and the discrete type process cartridge forms the image using the combination with such a developing unit. The process cartridge can be mounted and demounted relative to the apparatus main assembly by the user. For this reason, the maintenance of the apparatus is easy. The act of the process means is carried out on the electrophotographic photosensitive drum.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The developing cartridge includes the developing roller, contains the powdery developer (toner) for developing the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum by the developing roller, and is dismountably mounted to the apparatus main assembly. In the case of the developing cartridge, the electrophotographic photosensitive drum is mounted to a main assembly or a cartridge supporting member. Or, the electrophotographic photosensitive drum is provided in a so-called discrete type process cartridge In this case, the process cartridge is not provided with the developing means. The developing cartridge can also be mounted and demounted relative to said main assembly by the user. For this reason, the maintenance of the apparatus is easy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the cartridge in this invention includes the process cartridges of a so-called the integral type or a so-called discrete type. The cartridge includes a combination of the so-called process cartridge of the discrete type and the developing cartridge. In another example of the cartridge, the electrophotographic photosensitive drum is mounted fixedly to the main assembly or the cartridge supporting member, and the detachably mountable developing cartridge acts on the electrophotographic photosensitive drum.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As has been described hereinbefore heretofore the electrophotographic image forming apparatus which forms the image on the recording material using the electrophotographic image forming process is known. In this electrophotographic image forming apparatus, the process cartridge type described above is known. In addition, the developing cartridge type which comprises only the developing unit unintegral with the photosensitive drum is known. In the present invention, the process cartridge type and the developing cartridge type are usable. The process cartridge and the developing cartridge are provided with a developer accommodating portion which contains the developer (toner) for developing the electrostatic latent image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the electrophotographic image forming apparatus of a type which uses a plurality of cartridges, the structure is known in which the developer removed from a photosensitive drum surface is stored in a common waste toner collecting container (Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 2002-82505).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the image forming apparatus described above, the developer removed from the photosensitive drum is fed into the waste toner collecting container disposed in a lower part of the cartridges by a pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic image forming apparatus in which a removed developer accommodating container is disposed efficiently.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the following descriptions, relating to the apparatus <b>100</b>, the front side is a side in which a feeding cassette <b>19</b> which stacks the recording materials S is drawn from an inside of a main assembly <b>100</b>A to an outside. A backside is the opposite side from it. The upper side is a side in which Recording material S is discharged. The front-rear directions are directions to the front side from the backside of the image forming apparatus and the reverse direction. The left and right are the left and the right of the image forming apparatus, as seen from the front side. The left-right directions are directions to the left from the right, and the reverse direction. The longitudinal direction is an axial direction of an electrophotographic photosensitive drum or a developing roller. The main assembly <b>100</b>A is a portion of the image forming apparatus except the cartridges <b>33</b> <b>33</b>Y, (<b>33</b>M, <b>33</b>C, <b>33</b>K) and a removed developer accommodating container <b>40</b>. In the image forming apparatus of this embodiment, right-hand side is the driving side and left-hand side is the non-driving side.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is placed on a substantially horizontal installation surface F such as a mounting base, the desk or the floor. A central portion in the main assembly <b>100</b>A is provided with the image forming unit <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged view of the image forming unit <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.

In this embodiment, a plurality of cartridges <b>33</b> are the first-fourth developing cartridge s <b>33</b>Y, <b>33</b>M, <b>33</b>C, <b>33</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, each electrophotographic photosensitive drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is mounted to the unit <b>200</b> as photosensitive member units <b>32</b> (<b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, <b>32</b>K) with a charging roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>and a cleaning blade <b>32</b><i>c</i>. The charging roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>and the blade <b>32</b><i>c </i>are process means. In the apparatus <b>100</b>, the cartridges <b>33</b> are dismountably mounted to the main assembly <b>100</b>A (unit <b>200</b>), and a color image is formed on the recording material S. The unit <b>200</b> will be described in detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment, the cartridges <b>33</b> have the similar structures except that the colors of the contained powdery developers (toner) are different. However, they are not limited to this example. For example, a cartridge <b>33</b>K which accommodates a black developer may be larger in the capacity of a developer accommodating portion than that of the cartridges <b>33</b> which accommodate the other color developers. In this embodiment, the cartridge is a developing cartridge, although the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the charging roller <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and the cleaning blade <b>32</b><i>c </i>mounted to the unit <b>200</b> in this embodiment may be mounted to the developing cartridge <b>33</b>. The cartridge of such a structure is called a process cartridge rather than a developing cartridge. The process cartridge contains the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and a charging roller <b>32</b><i>b</i>, a developing roller <b>33</b><i>b</i>, and a cleaning blade <b>32</b><i>c </i>as the process means integrally as a cartridge, and it is dismountably mounted as a unit to the main assembly <b>100</b>A.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Photosensitive Member Unit)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each of the unit <b>32</b> (<b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, <b>32</b>K) is fixed to a sub-frame <b>31</b> of the unit <b>200</b>. Each unit <b>32</b> includes the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. It is provided with the roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>and the blade <b>32</b><i>c </i>for removing the developer which remains on a surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>as the process means actable on the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. A feeding screw (feeding member) <b>32</b><i>e </i>for feeding the developer removed by the blade <b>32</b><i>c </i>in the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is provided. The drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the roller <b>32</b><i>b</i>, the blade <b>32</b><i>c</i>, and a screw <b>32</b><i>e </i>are assembled to a case <b>32</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with a predetermined arrangement relation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a perspective view of a unit <b>32</b>M, as seen from left-hand side.

The other unit <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>C and <b>32</b>K has substantially the same structures, and therefore, the description will be made as to the photosensitive member unit <b>32</b>M. A right-hand end portion and a left-hand end portion of the case <b>32</b><i>d </i>are provided with the bearing portions <b>32</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> and <b>32</b><i>d </i>which comprise through-holes, respectively, which support the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>rotatably. The insides of the bearing portions <b>32</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> and <b>32</b><i>d</i><b>2</b> are provided with the end sealing members <b>32</b><i>k</i><b>1</b>, <b>32</b><i>k</i><b>2</b> contacting the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the sheet-like sealing members <b>32</b><i>h </i>extended in the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Each of the sealing members <b>32</b><i>k</i><b>1</b>, <b>32</b><i>k</i><b>2</b> and <b>32</b><i>h </i>contacts to the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, so that the developer in the case <b>32</b><i>d </i>does not leak to an outside.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An inside of the case <b>32</b><i>d </i>is provided with a screw <b>32</b><i>e </i>extended over the length. A right-hand end portion (end) of the screw <b>32</b><i>e </i>is provided with a feeding gear (drive transmitting portion) <b>32</b><i>i</i>. The screw <b>32</b><i>e </i>receives a driving force from a drum gear <b>32</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> mounted to the right-hand end portion of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>through an idler gear <b>32</b><i>j</i>. A removed developer in the case <b>32</b><i>d </i>is fed in the direction of the arrow X<b>7</b> (leftward direction) by rotating operation of the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. The removed developer fed by the screw <b>32</b><i>e </i>is carried to the removed developer discharging portion <b>32</b><i>f </i>provided at the left-hand end portion of the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. The discharging portion <b>32</b><i>f </i>outwardly projects out of the left-hand end portion of the case <b>32</b><i>d</i>. The removed developer fed by the screw <b>32</b><i>e </i>is discharged to the outside through an opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> provided in the discharging portion <b>32</b><i>f</i>. The supply side opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> is provided with a rotatable shutter <b>32</b><i>g</i>. The shutter <b>32</b><i>g </i>is moved between an open position for opening the supply side opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> and a closing position for shutting the supply side opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> by the rotation thereof. The shutter <b>32</b><i>g </i>is moved to the open position by the mounting operation of the residual developer container <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) as will be described hereinafter relative to the unit <b>200</b>. By this, the removed developer in the case <b>32</b><i>d </i>can be discharged to the inside of the container <b>40</b>. When the container <b>40</b> is not mounted, the shutter <b>32</b><i>g </i>is urged to the closing position by an elastic force of a spring (unshown). Therefore, the developer does not leak outside from the container <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The right-hand end portion and the left-hand end portion of each unit <b>32</b> is each provided with the mounting portion <b>321</b> for mounting the cartridge <b>33</b>, and the mounting portions <b>321</b> are extended in the direction perpendicular to the axes of the drums <b>32</b><i>a</i>, respectively. The mounting portion <b>321</b> is provided with the recess (regulating portion) <b>321</b><i>a </i>for receiving portions-to-be-guided (portions-to-be-regulated) <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the cartridge <b>33</b>. Adjacent to a recess <b>321</b><i>a</i>, there are provided a regulating member <b>36</b> for regulating a position of the cartridge <b>33</b> and a resilient member (urging member) <b>37</b> which elastically urges the regulating member <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As has been described hereinbefore, by providing the screw <b>32</b><i>e </i>for feeding the removed developer to the outside in each unit <b>32</b>, it is not necessary to provide a space for containing the removed developer in the inside. Therefore, a downsizing of the unit <b>32</b> can be accomplished. In this embodiment, the unit <b>32</b> is fixed to the unit <b>200</b>. Therefore, when drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>or the like is worn, the whole unit <b>200</b> is exchanged. However, the unit <b>32</b> may be detachably mountable to the unit <b>200</b>, and in such a case, only the unit <b>32</b> is exchanged.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The operation for forming a full-color image will be described. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the description will be made. Each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is rotationally driven in a counter-clockwise direction of the arrow at a predetermined speed. The roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>is driven with the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>by the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>being rotationally driven. The transfer member <b>34</b> is rotationally driven at the speed corresponding to the speed of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>in the clockwise direction (codirectional with the rotation of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>) of the arrow. The developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>and the supplying roller <b>33</b><i>d </i>are rotationally driven at the predetermined speeds in the clockwise directions of the arrows, respectively. The scanner unit <b>11</b> is driven. In synchronism with this drive, a predetermined charging bias voltage is applied to each charging roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>at predetermined control timing. By this, the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is uniformly charged by the charging roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>to the predetermined polarity and predetermined potential. The unit <b>11</b> scanningly exposes the surface of each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>with the laser beams L (LY, LM, LC, LK) modulated as described above. By this, the electrostatic latent image corresponding to the correspondence color image signals is formed on the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>of each cartridge P. The electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is developed into the developer image by the developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the corresponding cartridge <b>33</b>. The developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>is supplied with a predetermined developing bias voltage at the predetermined controlled timing.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Through the above-described electrophotographic image forming process operation, a Y color developer image corresponding to a yellow component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>opposed by a cartridge <b>33</b>Y. The developer image thereof is transferred (primary transfer) onto the transfer member <b>34</b> in a primary transfer nip <b>34</b><i>b </i>which is a contact portion between the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the transfer member <b>34</b>. An M color developer image corresponding to a magenta component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>opposed by a cartridge <b>33</b>M. The developer image thereof is transferred (primary transfer) onto the color developer image already transferred onto the transfer member <b>34</b> in a nip <b>34</b><i>b </i>Y. A C color developer image corresponding to a cyan component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>opposed by a cartridge <b>33</b>C. The developer image thereof is transferred (primary transfer) onto the color+M color developer image already transferred onto the transfer member <b>34</b> Y in the nip <b>34</b><i>b</i>. A K color developer image corresponding to a black component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>which the cartridge <b>33</b>K opposed.

The transfer roller <b>22</b> is supplied with the secondary transfer bias voltage of the predetermined potential having the polarity opposite to that of the charge polarity of the developer at the predetermined controlled timing. By this, the four-color-superimposed developer image on the transfer member <b>34</b> is sequentially transferred (secondary transfer) onto the surface of the recording material S in the process in which the recording material S is nipped and fed through the nip <b>34</b><i>c. </i></p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The container <b>40</b> is mounted and demounted in the state of being placed in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in the direction (the direction perpendicular of the direction relative to the axis of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>) of the arrow X<b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, and (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an outside surface of the left side plate <b>31</b>L of the sub-frame <b>31</b> is provided with the guide portions <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>1</b> or <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>2</b> or <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>3</b>. The portions-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>d</i>, <b>41</b><i>e</i>, <b>41</b><i>f </i>provided in the container <b>40</b> is inserted in the direction of the arrow X<b>3</b> along the guide portions <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>1</b> or <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>2</b> or <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>3</b>. The guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> is provided with a leaf spring (elastic member, locking portion) <b>49</b> therein. After a portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e </i>is received, a spring <b>49</b> urges the portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e </i>by the elastic force in the arrow X<b>4</b>. The portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e </i>is urged by the elastic force of the spring <b>49</b>. In this manner, the portion to be positioned <b>41</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of the guide portion <b>41</b><i>e </i>is abutted to a positioning portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>4</b> provided at a trailing end of a guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> to effect the positioning in the front-rear direction. Since the width of an up-down direction of the guide portion <b>41</b><i>e </i>is substantially the same as that of the width of the up-down direction of the guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b>, the positioning in the up-down direction is also simultaneously effected. Furthermore, a movement in the direction opposite the direction of the arrow X<b>3</b> is prevented by the spring <b>49</b>. Therefore, the guide portion <b>41</b><i>e </i>does not disengage to the outside of the unit <b>200</b> (out of main assembly). Here, the elastic force of the spring <b>49</b> functions for the locking of the container <b>40</b> relative to the unit <b>200</b>. The guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> functions as a portion-to-be-locked <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> to be locked to a locking portion <b>49</b>. As has been described in the foregoing, the container <b>40</b> is dismountably mounted to the unit <b>200</b> ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). As has been described in the foregoing, the unit <b>200</b> is provided with the guide portions <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>1</b> or <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>2</b> or <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>3</b> for mounting and demounting the container <b>40</b> relative to main assembly <b>100</b>A (unit <b>200</b>). The container <b>40</b> is provided with the portions-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>d</i>, <b>41</b><i>e</i>, and <b>41</b><i>f </i>to be guided by the guide portions <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>1</b> or <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>2</b> or <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>3</b>. In this manner, the mounting and demounting of the container <b>40</b> relative to the unit <b>200</b> can stably be carried out. The guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>1</b> guides the portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>d</i>, the guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> guides the portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e</i>, and a guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>3</b> guides a portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">By this series of mounting operations, the container <b>40</b> moves the shutter <b>32</b><i>g </i>((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) provided in each unit <b>32</b> to the open position by an actuator (unshown). When the mounting is completed, the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>provided in the container <b>40</b> opposes to the supply side opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> provided in the unit <b>32</b>. Therefore, the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>can receive the residual developer fed by the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. As has been described in the foregoing, the unit <b>32</b> and the container <b>40</b> are directly coupled with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The means to feed the residual developer to the container <b>40</b> is only the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. Furthermore, the container <b>40</b> adjoins the cartridges <b>33</b> disposed adjacent to each other along one direction X<b>20</b> ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), and is provided along one direction X<b>20</b> so as to overlap with the cartridges <b>33</b> partially as seen in the direction of the axis. Therefore, the main assembly <b>100</b>A is free from a complicated structure for feeding the residual developer into the container (accommodating portion) <b>40</b>. Therefore, the structure of the main assembly <b>100</b>A can be simplified. Furthermore, the simplification of the structure downsizes the main assembly <b>100</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the state that the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>and an opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> are in engagement with each other. Part (a) is a general arrangement, and (b) is a detailed view. The size H<b>2</b> of the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is larger than the size H<b>1</b> of the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>. According to this embodiment, a diameter H<b>1</b> is approx. 10 mm, and a diameter H<b>2</b> is approx. 20 mm. The size of H<b>2</b> is 1.05-2 times the size of H<b>2</b>, preferably. With such structures, even if the relative position between the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>and an opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> varies due to the individual differences, the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> can overlap with the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>assuredly. Therefore, the supplied residual developer is acceptable without the leakage to the outside. As has been described in the foregoing, the size H<b>2</b> of the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is larger than the size H<b>1</b> of the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>. In this manner, even if the openings <b>41</b><i>a </i>deviate corresponding to the dispositions of the drums <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and therefore, the positional accuracies between the openings <b>41</b><i>a </i>tend to vary, the variation in the positional accuracy of the openings <b>41</b><i>a </i>is accommodated to collect the residual developer assuredly. It is preferable to change a difference between H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> in accordance with the settings (tolerances) of respective types. By such a structure employed, the complicated structure for preventing the leakage of the residual developer is unnecessary. Therefore, the structure of the main assembly <b>100</b>A can be simplified. Furthermore, the downsizing of the main assembly by the simplification of the structure is also possible. An elastic seal member <b>43</b> provided around each opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is placed between the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>. In this manner, as has been described in the foregoing, although the size H<b>2</b> of the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is larger than the size H<b>1</b> of the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>, the developer does not leak through the gap between the openings (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). More particularly, in storing the developer removed from the photosensitive drums <b>32</b><i>a </i>in a common container <b>41</b>, the leakage of the developer can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As the material of the sealing member <b>43</b>, the elastic member or flexible member such as a felt, a rubber, and a flocked material can be used. In this embodiment, the sealing member <b>43</b> is provided around the opening <b>41</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, even if the diameter of the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is larger than the diameter of the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>, the developer can be guided into the container <b>41</b> without leakage. However, the sealing member <b>43</b> may be provided around the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>. When the sealing member <b>43</b> is provided on the container <b>41</b> portion, a lifetime of the sealing member <b>43</b> can be shortened, as compared with the case in which it is provided in the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>. This is because the container <b>41</b> will be exchanged whenever it becomes full. The configuration of the openings <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> may be suitably selected by the person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the state of mounting the container <b>40</b> to the unit <b>200</b>, and (b) thereof is a perspective view illustrating the state (or before mounting the container <b>40</b>) of taking out the container <b>40</b> from the unit <b>200</b>. The container <b>40</b> is provided adjacent to each other along the direction (arrow X<b>20</b>) in which the plurality of cartridges <b>33</b> (<b>33</b>Y, <b>33</b>M, <b>33</b>C, <b>33</b>K) are disposed adjacent to each other over the plurality of cartridges <b>33</b>. More particularly, as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the container <b>40</b> overlaps with the cartridges <b>33</b> partially as seen in the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the container <b>40</b> can be provided with the minimum spacing expansion in the direction of the arrow X<b>21</b> perpendicular to the direction of the arrow X<b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When exchanging the container <b>40</b>, the user dismounts it from the unit <b>200</b>, while the user grips the grip <b>42</b><i>a</i>, as has been described in the foregoing. In response to the operation which dismounts the container <b>40</b>, an opening of the unit <b>32</b> is shut by a spring member (resilient member) of the shutter <b>32</b><i>g</i>. On the other hand, the member such as a shutter is not provided for the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>40</b> in order to suppress a cost. However, in a mounting and demounting direction (the direction X<b>3</b> in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and the opposite direction thereto) the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>does not face down with respect to the direction of gravity. Therefore, the leakage of the residual developer can be minimized without the provision of a member such as the shutter. Furthermore, the unit <b>32</b> and the container <b>40</b> are directly coupled with each other. Therefore, the number of the positions in which the residual developer may leak s decreases and the leakage of the developer can be suppressed in such a sense.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this embodiment, the shutter or the like is not provided for the opening <b>41</b><i>a</i>. However, even if the shutter which openably and closably blocks the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is provided, the leakage of the removed developer through the shutter can be suppressed as much as possible. Since the container <b>40</b> is detachably mountable relative to the unit <b>200</b>, the user can carry out the exchange of the cartridge <b>33</b> and the exchange of the container <b>40</b> through the same method. Therefore, this embodiment is excellent in the usability. The mounting and demounting direction of the container <b>40</b> and the mounting and demounting direction of the cartridge <b>33</b> as will be described hereinafter are the same. Therefore, the user can carry out both operations easily. Here, the same direction is not in the strict sense, but the directions may slightly be deviated, if the mounting and demounting of the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> can be performed, without changing the position of the unit <b>200</b>. Furthermore, the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> can be mounted and demounted individually. In other words, they are disposed, so that it does not overlap in the mounting and demounting direction (the direction of the arrow X<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, and the opposite direction thereto). The guide portions <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>1</b> or <b>31</b><i>m </i><b>2</b> or <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>3</b> of the unit <b>200</b> which support the container <b>40</b> are provided on the outside surface of the frame <b>31</b>. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide the accommodating space for accommodating the container <b>40</b> in the frame <b>31</b>, and therefore, the downsizing of a device can be accomplished. The mounting position of the container <b>40</b> is in the non-driving side opposite from the driving side which is provided with the driving system (driving force transmitting portion) such as the drum gear (<b>32</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>) and the feeding gear (<b>32</b><i>i</i>) with respect to the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the latitude in the disposition of the driving system is enhanced, and as a result, the downsizing of the device is accomplished.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The description will be made as to the mounting and demounting of each cartridge <b>33</b> <b>33</b>Y, (<b>33</b>M, <b>33</b>C, <b>33</b>K) relative to the unit <b>200</b>. First, the cover <b>10</b> is moved from the closing position G which closes the opening portion <b>100</b>B to the open position H which opens the opening portion <b>100</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The user grips a first grip <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) provided on the cartridges <b>33</b> <b>33</b>M, (<b>33</b>C, <b>33</b>K) and a part of case <b>33</b><i>a</i>. As for the cartridge <b>33</b>Y, the user grips the first grip <b>39</b> and a flat surface portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the second grip <b>38</b>. Or, only the second grip <b>38</b> is gripped. Each cartridge <b>33</b> is mounted to the corresponding mounting portion <b>321</b> of the unit <b>200</b>. The mounting direction is the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the roller <b>33</b><i>b</i>. More particularly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> the cartridge <b>33</b> side portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are inserted into the unit <b>200</b> side mounting portion <b>321</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows the case of the mounting of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y. It is inserted into the mounting portion <b>321</b> in the case of the mounting of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y. Subsequently, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>2</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> is inserted. The portion-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>-<b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> is guided by the mounting portion <b>321</b>, and it is inserted into the inside toward the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are abutted to the regulating member <b>36</b> provided in the mounting portion <b>321</b>. The regulating member <b>36</b> in this embodiment is an L-shape member, and contacts the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> to the L-shape portion. The regulating member <b>36</b> is pushed up by the elastic force of an elastic member <b>37</b> in a free state. In this manner, in the state that the regulating member <b>36</b> (L-shape portion) is in the recess <b>321</b><i>a </i>of the mounting portion <b>321</b>, the upper surface thereof is abutted to and received by a ceiling surface of the recess <b>321</b><i>a</i>. In this state, the position of the regulating member <b>36</b> is a regulation position D. When the cartridge <b>33</b> is further inserted, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> uses the L-shape portion of the regulating member <b>36</b> as a cam slope, and pushes the regulating member <b>36</b> down against the elastic force of the elastic member <b>37</b> elastically urged upwardly. By this, the regulating member <b>36</b> is pushed down in the direction (arrow X<b>5</b>) of retracting from the recess <b>321</b><i>a </i>of the mounting portion <b>321</b>, so that the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> enters between the upper surface of the regulating member <b>36</b> and the ceiling surface of the recess <b>321</b><i>a</i>. The push-down position of the regulating member at this time <b>36</b> is a permitting position E where the mounting and demounting of the cartridge <b>33</b> is permitted. In this manner, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> enter a rear side of the recess <b>321</b><i>a </i>beyond the regulating member <b>36</b>. The portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>2</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> is also entered to the recess <b>321</b><i>a </i>of the mounting portion <b>321</b>.

Therefore, the cartridge <b>33</b> and the container <b>40</b> carried on the same unit <b>200</b> are not mixed up, when the user exchanges them. The discrimination means may be any, if the user can discriminate it visually, and the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> may be provided with the different labels, for example. Or, an outer appearance of the container <b>40</b> may be different from that of the cartridge <b>33</b>. The container <b>40</b> may be a transparent container, and in this case, the user can recognize easily that the residual developer is contained in the inside. The combination of these examples accomplishes the assured discrimination.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this embodiment, the transfer member <b>34</b> is the intermediary transfer member for transferring the image indirectly onto the recording material S from the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. However, this is not inevitable, and it may be of the type of transferring the image directly onto the recording material S from the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. At this time, the transfer member <b>34</b> transfers the developed image directly from the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>onto the recording material S. In this embodiment, the cartridge which is to be exchanged is the developing cartridge <b>33</b> used for the process cartridge of the discrete type. However, this is not restrictive, and the cartridge which is to be exchanged may be the process cartridge which unifies a photosensitive unit <b>32</b> and developing cartridge <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Embodiment 1 is summarized as follows. The apparatus is an electrophotographic color image forming apparatus <b>100</b> for forming a color image on recording material S. The electrophotographic image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with the plurality of electrophotographic photosensitive drums <b>32</b><i>a</i>. It is provided with the cartridge <b>33</b>, wherein the cartridge <b>33</b> contains the developer and is detachably mountable in the direction X<b>3</b> perpendicular to the axis of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>relative to the main assembly <b>100</b>A of the apparatus <b>100</b>. The electrophotographic image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with a cartridge mounting portion <b>321</b> for mounting the cartridge <b>33</b>. The electrophotographic image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with a plurality of cleaning members <b>32</b><i>c </i>for removing the developer which remains on the surfaces of the plurality of drums <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The electrophotographic image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with the residual developer container (removed-developer accommodating portion) <b>40</b>, which contains the developer removed by the a plurality of cleaning members <b>32</b><i>c</i>, and which is detachably mountable relative to the main assembly <b>100</b>A in the direction X<b>3</b> perpendicular to the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The cartridges <b>33</b> are disposed adjacent to each other in one direction X<b>20</b>. The container <b>40</b> adjoins the plurality of cartridge <b>33</b>, and it overlaps at least partially with the plurality of cartridges (including drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>) as seen in the direction of the axis ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In this manner, even if the container <b>40</b> is mounted to the main assembly <b>100</b>A, the height or the depth of the apparatus <b>100</b> does not increase. Here, the depth is the dimension of the cartridge <b>33</b> in the mounting direction. As to the widthwise direction of the container <b>40</b>, the width of the apparatus <b>100</b> is not always increased, when the dead space in the apparatus can effectively be utilized. Therefore, the container <b>40</b> can be efficiently disposed in the main assembly <b>100</b>A. This is because the height and the depth of the container <b>40</b> are within the limits of the height and the depth of the cartridges <b>33</b> mounted. In this embodiment, the whole container <b>40</b> overlaps with the four cartridge s (drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>), as seen in the direction of the axis, and therefore the effect described above can sufficiently be provided. However, the present invention is not limited to this. The effect described above can be provided if the container <b>40</b> overlaps at least partially with the plurality of cartridges, as seen in the direction of the axis. According to this embodiment, there is provided the screw for feeding the developer removed by the cleaning blade (cleaning member) <b>32</b><i>c </i>in the axial direction of the electrophotographic photosensitive drum (<b>32</b><i>a</i>) (developer feeding member) <b>32</b><i>e</i>. The container <b>40</b> is provided in the downstream side of the feeding direction of the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. Therefore, according to this embodiment, also from this standpoint, the container <b>40</b> can be efficiently disposed in the main assembly <b>100</b>A. This is because, according to the disposition, the removed developer removed from the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>can be fed to the container <b>40</b> through the short feeding path. The developer removed from the plurality of photosensitive drums <b>32</b><i>a </i>can be accommodated into the common container <b>40</b>. Therefore, as compared with the case in which the plurality of containers are mounted and demounted, the space occupied by the structure which the mounting and demounting of the container <b>40</b> takes can be reduced. The mounting and demounting direction of the container <b>40</b> is the same as the mounting and demounting direction of the cartridge <b>33</b>. Therefore, the operativity when the user carries out the mounting and demounting of the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with the feeding member <b>32</b><i>e </i>for feeding the developer removed by the cleaning member <b>32</b><i>c </i>in the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>.
