<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/596,418, filed Aug. 28, 2012, which claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201110305461.6, filed Sep. 30, 2011, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, the contents of which in their entirety are herein incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication, including short message service (SMS) and, in particular, to the reduction of communications traffic between mobile terminals and the base station in the course of applying SMS service.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless frequency spectrum is an important resource for wireless communication services. With the development of broadband wireless communication, the demand for frequency spectrum tends to be in rapid and exponential growth. One of the embodiments is the popularity of small piece data services such as SMS and microblog. SMS is a tool that provides the user of mobile phone with short messages or other information. Microblog is a new means of communication. Microblog users may publish instant messages by distributing short posts over the network via mobile terminals such as mobile phones.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The data transportation capacity provided by the current wireless access network for data service is limited by wireless frequency spectrum resources. In reality, it often happens that transportation of a great deal of SMS messages of small piece data would burst in a short period of time. For example, at large gatherings, the huge communications traffic due to a great deal of SMS messages sent by group messaging would have a serious impact on a wireless access network, often leading to temporary unavailability of the SMS service.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a method for group messaging at a mobile terminal in an autonomous network includes acquiring a message and a list of target identifiers, the list of target identifiers containing the identifiers of multiple mobile terminals to which the message is to be sent; transmitting the message via the autonomous network to any mobile terminal of the multiple mobile terminals that is located in the autonomous network, and removing the identifier of the mobile terminal from the list of target identifiers to obtain an updated list of target identifiers; generating an aggregate message, wherein the aggregate message contains the message and the identifiers in the updated list of target identifiers; sending the aggregate message to a base station if the length of the aggregate message does not exceed a pre-defined threshold; and dividing the aggregate message into multiple fragment messages and then sending the multiple fragment messages to the base station if the length of the aggregate message exceeds the pre-defined threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a proxy apparatus for group messaging at a mobile terminal in the autonomous network includes an acquiring device, configured to acquire a message and the identifiers of multiple mobile terminals to which the message is to be sent; a transmitting device, configured to transmit a message via the autonomous network to one or more mobile terminals in the autonomous network; and a message aggregating device, configured to generate an aggregate message, the aggregate message containing a message and identifiers of multiple mobile terminals to which the message is to be sent, wherein the transmitting device is further configured to send the aggregate message generated by the message aggregating device to a base station of mobile terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In still another embodiment, a method for message processing in a base station of wireless communication network includes receiving a message frame from a mobile terminal; if the payload of the received message frame is a fragment message, assembling the fragment message and other fragment messages belonging to the same series as the fragment message into an aggregate message; disassembling the aggregate message in the payload of the received message frame or obtained by assembling the fragment message to generate multiple standard downlink frames each containing a message and a target mobile terminal identifier, and sending the message to the mobile terminal corresponding to each target mobile terminal identifier.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The flowcharts and blocks in the figures illustrate the system, methods, as well as architecture, functions and operations executable by a computer program product according to embodiments of the present disclosure. In this regard, each block in the flowcharts or block may represent a module, a program segment, or a part of code, which contains one or more executable instructions for performing specified logic functions. It should be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may also occur in a sequence different from what is noted in the drawings. For example, two blocks shown consecutively may be performed in parallel substantially or in an inverse order. This depends on relevant functions. It should also be noted that each block in the block diagrams and/or flowcharts and a combination of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowcharts may be implemented by a dedicated hardware-based system for performing specified functions or operations or by a combination of dedicated hardware and computer instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, the principle and spirit of the present disclosure will be described with reference to various exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that provision of these embodiments is only to enable those skilled in the art to better understand and further implement the present disclosure, not intended for limiting the scope of the present disclosure in any manner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following, various embodiments of the disclosure are described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings. For purpose of easy description and content consistency, in the following detailed description, the SMS will be taken as an example of short piece data service and the mobile phone will be taken as an example of smart mobile terminal/device. However, the disclosure is obviously not limited to that. Therefore, due to the need of the context in the specification, the term &#x201c;mobile terminal&#x201d; is sometimes used to represent &#x201c;mobile phone&#x201d;, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a wireless communication network <b>100</b> in which various embodiments of the disclosure may be implemented. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are several mobile terminals (such as mobile phones) <b>111</b>-<b>118</b>, a base station BS and an autonomous network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mobile terminals <b>111</b>-<b>118</b> and the base station BS are a part of the wireless communication network <b>100</b>. The mobile terminals and the base station communicate with an assigned wireless frequency band. When the mobile terminals transmit messages to each other via the base station, a source mobile terminal that originates a message would send an up-link frame (UL-frame) comprising a part of frame header and a part of frame content via the up link to the base station BS. The base station BS sends a down-link frame (DL-frame) via the down link to a target mobile terminal that received the message. Specific details such as coding, sending, receiving, decoding of the UL-frame and the DL-frame, are known in the art and thus a detailed description of the same is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is noted that although only eight mobile terminals are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be understood that the base station BS may be able to manage additional mobile terminals than are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates that a mobile terminal <b>114</b> is adjacent to a wireless access point (AP). The mobile terminal <b>114</b> having a WiFi function may establish a stable connection with external networks via the wireless access point.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows that mobile terminals <b>111</b>-<b>115</b> are within coverage of the autonomous network <b>101</b>. The autonomous network <b>101</b> is an independent wireless communication network providing end-to-end route of any pair of nodes within the network. The mobile terminals <b>111</b>-<b>115</b>, as network nodes, are able to identify adjacent mobile terminals and effectively complete the grouping of multi-hop wireless network in self-organized manner. Examples of the implementation of the autonomous network include such techniques as PAN (Personal Area Network), IEEE 802.11G Standard, Bluetooth and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The autonomous network <b>101</b> is a social relation based autonomous network (SAN). In such an autonomous network, mobile terminal users have some social relationships with each other, such as friends, colleagues, relations, club members and so on. Users may register with, for example, a social relationship server (SRS) providing social relationship registration service and establish various social relationships among themselves. The social relationship server SRS may also establish and save such social relationships automatically with such information as the communications record of the users, and provide query. In SAN, the short message route in the network layer is determined according to social relationships. WLAN or Bluetooth is taken as the Media Access Control Layer protocol for performing the transmission instruction issued by the Network Layer, so that end-to-end multi-hop transmission of SMS data may be realized. The mobile terminals in the autonomous network <b>101</b> may communicate with each other wirelessly via a connection channel provided by the autonomous network. For example, mobile terminals <b>111</b>-<b>115</b> may realize short message communication with each other by the &#x201c;Bluetooth&#x201d; function.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at some point of time, there is a connection channel between the mobile terminal <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, as well as connection channels between the mobile terminal <b>114</b> and <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A SAN network list may be used to store identification information of the mobile terminals in the SAN, such as a mobile phone number. For example, assuming the phone numbers of the mobile terminals <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> in the SAN of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b> and A<b>5</b> respectively, then the SAN network list may be {A<b>1</b>,A<b>2</b>,A<b>3</b>,A<b>4</b>,A<b>5</b>}.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, the SAN network list may take the form of an adjacency list for representing connection relationships among mobile terminals, as the following:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A<b>1</b>:A<b>2</b>, A<b>4</b></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A<b>2</b>:A<b>4</b></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A<b>3</b>:A<b>4</b></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A<b>4</b>:A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>5</b></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A<b>5</b>, A<b>4</b></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Wherein, for example, &#x201c;A<b>1</b>: A<b>2</b>, A<b>4</b>&#x201d; denotes that the mobile terminal <b>111</b> is adjacent to the mobile terminal <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> respectively, &#x201c;A<b>4</b>: A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>5</b>&#x201d; denotes that the mobile terminal <b>114</b> is adjacent to the mobile terminal <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally speaking, the mobile terminals in the autonomous network SAN <b>101</b> have different capabilities. The mobile terminals with relatively strong capability generally have following one or more capabilities, including: a relatively strong electric power endurance capability, such as having relatively adequate battery charge or having access to active power supply; a relatively strong processing capability, such as large storage, rapid in computing speed; having well established wireless connection with surrounding mobile terminals, and capable of realizing relatively stable wireless data transmission with surrounding mobile terminals; and a capability of establishing stable connection with wireless network external to the SAN.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> is a smart mobile device, such as notebook computer. The mobile terminal <b>114</b> is connected to an outer power supply and can establish stable connection with wireless communication network external to the SAN <b>101</b> via a wireless access point AP. It is the mobile terminal with stronger capability in the present SAN <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In practical implementations, other or more capability evaluation items may be set and a capability evaluation function Q may be used to quantify the capability of the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mobile terminal with stronger capability may become the relay device when other mobile terminals in the autonomous network are transmitting messages. There might be multiple mobile terminals qualified for acting as relay devices, one of which being the master relay device. The communication connections among the multiple relay devices have hierarchical relations like the tree structure, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the following, a method of the disclosure for group messaging at a mobile terminal in the autonomous network will be described by way of example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart of the method in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in the figure, in block <b>210</b>, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> acquires a message MSG and the identifiers of multiple target mobile terminals to which the message is to be sent. In other words, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> acquires a message MSG and a list of target identifiers that contains the identifiers of multiple mobile terminals to which the message is to be sent.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> acquires the message and the identifiers of multiple target mobile terminals based on a user's input. To facilitate description, the identifiers of target mobile terminals are also referred to as &#x201c;target identifiers&#x201d; below. Assuming the above list of target identifiers is &#x3c;A<b>3</b>, A<b>5</b>, A<b>6</b>, A<b>7</b>, A<b>8</b>&#x3e;, the target identifiers contained in the list are respectively the identifiers of the mobile terminal <b>113</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>. For example, &#x201c;A<b>3</b>&#x201d; denotes the mobile terminal <b>113</b>. If the mobile terminal <b>113</b> is a mobile phone, then &#x201c;A<b>3</b>&#x201d; could be a phone number.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In block <b>220</b>, the message is transmitted via the autonomous network to any mobile terminal of the multiple mobile terminals that is located in the autonomous network, and the identifier of the mobile terminal is removed from the list of target identifiers to obtain an updated list of target identifiers. In other words, for one or more mobile terminals corresponding to target identifiers that are located in the autonomous network <b>101</b>, the message is transmitted via the autonomous network <b>101</b> to the one or more mobile terminals and the identifiers of the one or more mobile terminals are removed from the list of target identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the mobile terminal <b>113</b> corresponding to &#x201c;A<b>3</b>&#x201d; is located in the autonomous network <b>101</b>, so the mobile terminal <b>114</b> transmits the message MSG to the mobile terminal <b>113</b> via the autonomous network <b>101</b>, and removes A<b>3</b> from the list of target identifiers. Similarly, the mobile terminal <b>115</b> corresponding to &#x201c;A<b>5</b>&#x201d; is located in the autonomous network <b>101</b>, so the mobile terminal <b>114</b> transmits the message MSG to the mobile terminal <b>115</b> via the autonomous network <b>101</b>, and removes &#x201c;A<b>5</b>&#x201d; from the list of target identifiers. The message transmission from mobile terminal <b>114</b> to the mobile terminals <b>113</b> and <b>115</b> may be implemented by Bluetooth technology, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, block <b>220</b> may first detect whether mobile terminals corresponding to the acquired multiple target identifiers are located in the autonomous network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> may detect whether a mobile terminal is located in the autonomous network according to the SAN network list as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If a certain mobile terminal is located in the autonomous network, then the message is transmitted to the mobile terminal via the autonomous network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As a result of block <b>220</b>, the content of target identifier list is updated to be &#x3c;A<b>6</b>, A<b>7</b>, A<b>8</b>&#x3e;.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In block <b>230</b>, an aggregate message is generated, wherein the aggregate message contains the message and the updated list of target identifiers. In the present example, the aggregate message generated contains the message MSG and the target identifiers A<b>6</b>, A<b>7</b> and A<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the aggregate message also contains information indicating the position of the message MSG and the updated target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>6</b>, A<b>7</b> and A<b>8</b>&#x3e; in the aggregate message.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the format of an aggregate message is described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates the format of aggregate message in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in the figure, the aggregate message <b>300</b> includes an aggregate header <b>310</b> and an aggregate body <b>320</b>, wherein the aggregate body includes a message content <b>321</b> and an identifier list <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in the figure, the aggregate header <b>310</b> is 4 (four) characters in length, which comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Bit <b>0</b>: message indicator <b>311</b>, indicating aggregate message if the value of the bit is 1, indicating fragment message if the value is 0;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Bits <b>1</b>-<b>6</b>: message type <b>312</b>, indicating a non-standard SMS frame if the value is &#x201c;111111&#x201d;;</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Bits <b>7</b>-<b>18</b>: length of aggregate body <b>313</b>, the value of which indicates the length of aggregate body <b>320</b> of aggregate message <b>300</b>, the unit of the length being character; and</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Bits <b>19</b>-<b>29</b>: identifier position <b>314</b>, the value of which indicates the starting position of the target identifier list <b>322</b> in the aggregate message <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The message content <b>321</b> includes the content to be sent by group messaging, for example MSG.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The identifier list <b>322</b> comprises all the target identifiers in the target identifier list. Each target identifier in the identifier list <b>322</b> occupies a fixed length, or, target identifiers are separated by a specific separator between them.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With such a format, the starting position of the target identifier list <b>322</b> in the aggregate message may be determined according to the content of the identifier position <b>314</b>. Then the position of each of target identifiers may be further determined according to the fixed length or the separator for the target identifier. The position of the message MSG can be determined according to the length of the aggregate header <b>310</b> and the target identifier position <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a schematic presentation of an aggregate message. As shown in the figure, an aggregate message <b>301</b> includes an aggregate header <b>310</b> and an aggregate body <b>320</b>. The aggregate body further comprises a message MSG (<b>321</b>) to be sent by group messaging and identifiers (<b>322</b>) of target mobile terminals. Here, it is assumed that target mobile terminal <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>118</b> are mobile phones and, for better description, the phone numbers &#x201c;623456789&#x201d;, &#x201c;723456789&#x201d; and &#x201c;823456789&#x201d; are also used below to represent their respective identifiers A<b>6</b>, A<b>7</b> and A<b>8</b>. The phone numbers are separated by the separator &#x201c;;&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Those skilled in the art shall appreciate that, in practice, the length and content of the aggregate header <b>310</b> may be set according to requirements. Not only may the content and position of the message indicator <b>311</b>, the message type <b>312</b>, the payload length <b>313</b> and the identifier position <b>314</b> be adjusted, additional information may also be included into the aggregate header.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, the aggregate header <b>310</b> may further contain the identifier of the source mobile terminal originating the group messaging of the message. Thus, the base station BS may determine that the message MSG is initially originated from the source mobile terminal represented by the identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in decision block <b>240</b>, it is determined whether the length of the aggregate message exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Here, the pre-defined threshold means a length threshold of the payload of message frame transmitted by the mobile terminal to the base station BS. A UL-frame, sent by the mobile terminal to the base station BS via the up-link, is the basic unit of transmission in wireless transmission channels and consists of a frame header and a payload with a certain length limitation. For example, the length threshold of the payload is 140 bytes or 70 characters for a UL-frame of SMS message channel. In general, the payload comprises the original data to be transmitted, and the frame header comprises the size, the target address or identifier, and the parity bit of the original data. If the aggregate message is taken as the payload of the UL-frame, the length of the aggregate message must not exceed the threshold of length of payload.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the length of the aggregate message <b>300</b> does not exceed the pre-defined threshold, the aggregate message <b>300</b> is sent to a base station BS in block <b>250</b>. Then, the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the base station BS receives the UL-frame whose payload is the aggregate message <b>300</b>, it will perform corresponding parsing. This further described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">From the foregoing, it will be seen that if the length of the aggregate message does not exceed the pre-defined threshold, the aggregate message only needs to be transmitted from the mobile terminal <b>114</b> to the base station BS once, instead of three times, in order to sent the message to three target mobile terminals <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>. Thus the occupation of air interface bandwidth between the terminal and the base station could be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the length of the aggregate message exceeds the pre-defined threshold, then the process proceeds to block <b>260</b>, where the aggregate message is divided into multiple fragment messages.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, assuming that the pre-defined threshold is 70 characters, then the aggregate message <b>300</b> is divided into multiple fragment messages to so that the fragment messages, except the last one, are each 70 characters in length.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the format of the fragment message is described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustratively shows the format of a fragment message <b>400</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. As shown in the figure, the fragment message <b>400</b> contains a fragment header <b>410</b> and a fragment body <b>420</b>. They are respectively 2 characters (characters <b>0</b>-<b>1</b>) and 68 characters (characters <b>2</b>-<b>69</b>) in length.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in the figure, the length of the fragment header <b>410</b> is 2 characters, which includes Message indicator <b>411</b> (bit <b>0</b>), indicating fragment message if the value of the bit is 0 (zero), and message type indicator <b>412</b> (bits <b>1</b>-<b>6</b>), used for distinguishing the fragment message of the disclosure from the standard SMS message. For example, a value of &#x201c;111111&#x201d; is used to indicate that the current frame is a fragment message.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">End-of-fragment indicator <b>413</b> (bit <b>7</b>) is used for indicating whether the fragment message is the last one of a series of fragment messages. For example, the value of End-of-fragment indicator may be set to &#x201c;1&#x201d; to indicate the fragment message is the last one.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Message identifier <b>414</b> (bits <b>8</b>-<b>10</b>) is a field used for identifying different aggregate messages. For example, when the mobile terminal <b>114</b> sends a first aggregate message to the base station BS, the value of the field is &#x201c;000&#x201d; (binary). The value of the field will be increased by degrees along with the increase of the number of aggregate messages sent by the mobile terminal <b>114</b> to the base station BS. When the mobile terminal <b>114</b> sends the eighth aggregate message to the base station BS, the value of the field is &#x201c;111&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Serial number <b>415</b> (bits <b>11</b>-<b>15</b>) is a field used for identifying different fragment messages within the same aggregate message. The field is valid inside the same aggregate message. The initial value is &#x201c;00000&#x201d; (binary) corresponding to a first fragment message and the value will be increased by degrees as the number of fragment messages is increased, up to a maximum value of &#x201c;11111&#x201d;. So the field can identify 32 fragment messages within the same aggregate message.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The fragment body <b>420</b> is filled with the data obtained by sequentially splitting the aggregate message <b>300</b> including the aggregate header <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Following the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, and assuming that the length of the aggregate message <b>300</b> is greater than 70 but not greater than 136, then the aggregate message <b>300</b> is divided into two fragment messages. The fragment body of the first fragment message contains the content of the first section starting from the starting position of the aggregate message <b>300</b>, the length of the content of the first section being 68 characters. The payload of the second fragment message is the content after the first section content in the payload of the aggregate message <b>301</b>. The length of the content is no more than 68 characters since the length of the aggregate message <b>300</b> is not greater than 136 characters.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the series of fragment messages generated by dividing the aggregate message <b>301</b> include two fragment messages <b>401</b> and <b>402</b>. The fragment body <b>420</b> of the first fragment message <b>401</b> contains the aggregate header <b>310</b> of the aggregate message <b>301</b> as well as the message content (<b>321</b>) and a part of the identifier list (<b>322</b>) in aggregate body <b>320</b>. In the present example, the content of this part in the target identifier list is &#x201c;623456789; 723456&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The fragment body <b>420</b> of the fragment message <b>402</b> contains the remaining part of target identifier list (<b>322</b>), i.e., &#x201c;789; 823456789&#x201d;. Besides, the value of the End-of-fragment indicator <b>413</b> in the fragment header <b>410</b> of the fragment message <b>402</b> is set to 1, because the fragment message <b>402</b> is the last one in the generated series of fragment messages.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in block <b>270</b> following block <b>260</b>, the multiple fragment messages are sent to the base station BS. After the fragment messages are sent, the process ends. For example, in block <b>270</b>, the fragment messages <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> are sent to the base station BS. The above description is an exemplary process of group messaging with the mobile terminal <b>114</b> acting as the originating mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, it is assumed that the user of a certain mobile terminal <b>111</b> intends to send a message with the content of MSG by group messaging to mobile terminals <b>113</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>. According to one embodiment of the disclosure, the mobile terminal <b>111</b> may first select a relay device from multiple mobile terminals in the social relation based autonomous network SAN <b>101</b>. Generally speaking, the relay device that may be selected by the mobile terminal is a mobile terminal with relatively strong capability in the autonomous network SAN <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The below mechanism may be followed in determining a mobile terminal with relatively strong capability in the autonomous network SAN <b>101</b> to act as the relay device. When a mobile terminal starts, it will firstly launch broadcast information to search whether or not there is existed a SAN. If there is existed a SAN, the mobile terminal would launch a request for joining in the SAN to the mobile terminals in the SAN. The other mobile terminals in the SAN would learn the joining of the new mobile terminal and update respective adjacency lists. Otherwise, the mobile terminal would set up a SAN by itself, become a number of the SAN and automatically become the master relay device, with the value of capability assessment function Q being q.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The addresses or identifiers of other members in the SAN are acquired, and comparison is made between the value q&#x2032; of its own capability assessment function Q to the value q of the capability assessment function Q of the current master relay device. If the difference q&#x2032;&#x2212;q is greater than a pre-defined threshold, the current master relay device will be replaced by the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The mobile terminals in the SAN periodically report their own values of the capability assessment function Q to the master relay device. The master relay device maintains a list of nodes sorted according to values of Q of all mobile terminals within its scope coverage. And the node list is sent to the surrounding mobile terminals as a copy. At anytime, if there is a mobile terminal, the difference of whose value q&#x2032; of capability assessment function Q of a mobile terminal and the value q of the capability assessment function Q of the current master relay device is greater than a pre-defined threshold, the mobile phone will replace the current master relay device.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When a mobile terminal normally exits from the SAN, it informs other surrounding mobile terminals to remove it from their route tables and informs the master relay device to remove it from the node list. The master relay device sends maintenance information to other mobile terminals periodically. If no reply is received from a certain mobile terminal upon a time-out, it indicates that the mobile terminal exits abnormally. Then the master relay device will broadcast to all mobile terminals in the SAN informing them to remove the exit mobile terminal from their route tables, and remove it from the node list.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the master relay device normally exits from the SAN, it selects a mobile terminal with the highest Q value according to the node list, requests it to become the master relay device, and transfers management information to it. All mobile terminals in the SAN are notified of the updating of the master relay device. If the master relay device exits from SAN abnormally, other mobile terminal will not receive maintenance information from the master relay device upon a time-out. The relay device with a copy of the node list will select the mobile terminal with the highest Q value to be the master relay device according to the node list.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Assuming the relay device selected by the mobile terminal <b>111</b> is the mobile terminal <b>114</b>, the mobile terminal <b>111</b> will transmit, via the SAN <b>101</b>, the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e; to the mobile terminal <b>114</b> acting as the relay device.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in block <b>210</b>, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> acquires a message and a target identifier list. Under the circumstance that the mobile terminal <b>114</b> is selected as the relay device by the mobile terminal <b>111</b>, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> will receive the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e; transmitted from the mobile terminal <b>111</b> via the autonomous network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The mobile terminal <b>114</b> may proceed with Block <b>220</b> to <b>270</b> so as to complete the processing of the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e;. The details are not repeatedly described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, in this case, in block <b>230</b> of generating aggregate message, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> also sets the identifier of the source mobile terminal <b>111</b> originating the group messaging in the aggregate header of the aggregate message.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, prior to transmitting the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e; to the mobile terminal <b>114</b>, the mobile terminal <b>111</b> may conduct aggregating processing of the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e; to generate an aggregate message. Then the aggregate message is transmitted to the mobile terminal <b>114</b>. The mobile terminal <b>111</b> may conduct message aggregation with respect to the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e; in the same way as generating aggregate message shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (Block <b>230</b>) and describe in the above. The details are not repeatedly described here.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In this case, what the mobile terminal <b>114</b> acquires from the mobile terminal <b>111</b> is the aggregate message containing the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e;.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> that acquires the aggregate message containing the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e; from the mobile terminal <b>111</b> may obtain the message and each target identifier therein by parsing the aggregate message. Specifically, as described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the aggregate header of the aggregate message contains information indicating the position of the message and the target identifiers in the aggregate message. According to the information, the message MSG and each target identifier may be extracted from the aggregate message. Then the mobile terminal <b>114</b> proceeds with blocks <b>220</b> to <b>270</b> so as to complete the processing of the message MSG and the target identifier list &#x3c;A<b>3</b>,A<b>5</b>,A<b>6</b>,A<b>7</b>,A<b>8</b>&#x3e;. The details are not repeatedly described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the above two embodiments, the source mobile terminal <b>114</b>, as well as the source mobile terminal <b>111</b>, sends message to five target mobile terminals by group messaging. But, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> only needs to send the message MSG to three mobile terminal <b>116</b>,<b>117</b> and <b>118</b> via the base station BS.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, although the mobile terminal <b>114</b> needs to send message to the three mobile terminals via the base station BS, the mobile terminal <b>114</b> merely needs to transmit data to the base station BS twice. This shows that, by applying the embodiments of the disclosure, the times of signaling interaction and the up-link communications traffic between the mobile terminal and the base station may be reduced, thereby reducing the occupation of wireless bandwidth of the base station. In general, the more the numbers of identifiers for group messaging, the shorter the message MSG is.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The method for group messaging at a mobile terminal in the autonomous network is described above. Those skilled in the art shall appreciate the above method may be implemented by configuring a proxy at the mobile terminal.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">According to one embodiment of the disclosure, the detecting device <b>660</b> may detect whether a mobile terminal is located in the autonomous network according to the SAN network list described above.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The functions of various devices contained in the above proxy apparatus <b>600</b> and details of their implementation have been fully elaborated in previous description of various embodiments of the inventive method for group messaging at a mobile terminal in the autonomous network given in conjunction with drawings; thus they will not be repeatedly described here.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Various embodiments of the method and apparatus for group messaging at a mobile terminal in the autonomous network have been described in above. From the above description it can be known that the payload of a UL frame transmitted from the mobile terminal to the base station may comprises an aggregate message or a fragment message. Accordingly, the disclosure also provides a method for processing a message containing the aggregate message and the fragment message at the base station BS.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Generally speaking, the disclosure provides a method for message processing in a base station of wireless communication network, comprising: receiving a message frame from a mobile terminal; if the payload of the received message frame is a fragment message, then assembling the fragment message and other fragment messages belonging to the same series as the fragment message into an aggregate message; disassemble the aggregate message in the payload of the received message frame or obtained by assembling the fragment message to generate multiple standard downlink frames each containing a message and a target mobile terminal identifier, and sending the message to the mobile terminal corresponding to each target mobile terminal identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there in shown a flow chart of a method for processing a message containing the aggregate message and the fragment message at the base station BS in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. In block <b>510</b>, a message frame is received, which consists of a frame header and a payload. In decision block <b>520</b>, it is determined whether or not the payload of received message frame is a standard SMS message.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4A</figref>, according to one embodiment of the disclosure, bits <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> (<b>312</b>, <b>412</b>) of the aggregate message and the fragment message are taken as the &#x201c;message type&#x201d; indicator for distinguishing a standard UL frame from an aggregate message or a fragment message of the disclosure. For example, it may be prescribed that, for aggregate messages and fragment messages, the value of the bits is &#x201c;111111&#x201d;. So, by reading the content of bits <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> in the payload of a message frame, it can be determined whether or not the payload is a standard SMS message.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">If it is determined in decision block <b>520</b> that the payload is a standard SMS message, then, in block <b>530</b>, the SMS message is forwarded in a standard manner. Then the processing of the frame ends. On the other hand, if it is determined in decision block <b>520</b> that the payload is not a standard SMS message, then, in decision block <b>540</b>, it is determined whether the payload is an aggregate message. As described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the aggregate message and the fragment message may be distinguished by the setting a message indicator bit (<b>311</b>, <b>411</b>). For example, the value of the message indicator bit of the aggregate message is &#x201c;1&#x201d; and the value of the message indicator bit of the fragment message is &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Therefore, whether the payload is an aggregate message can be determined by reading the content of bit <b>0</b> in the payload of the received message frame.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If, in decision block <b>540</b>, it is determined that the payload is an aggregate message is determined, the message frame is divided into one or more standard SMS message frames in block <b>542</b>. Then the process turns to block <b>530</b>, where the SMS message is forwarded in a standard manner. Then the processing of the frame ends.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, an aggregate message includes information for indicating the position of message and target identifier list in the aggregate message. Therefore, in block <b>542</b>, each target identifier, i.e., the identifier of the mobile terminal to which the message is to be sent, such as mobile phone number, may be extracted from the aggregate message. Each target identifier is respectively combined with the message to obtain one or more standard SMS message frames.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">If, in decision block <b>540</b>, it is determined that the payload is not an aggregate message, then in decision block <b>550</b>, it is determined whether the payload is fragment message. As described above, in the case that message indicator bits <b>311</b> and <b>411</b> are used for distinguishing aggregate message from fragment message, the determination operations in decision blocks <b>540</b> and <b>550</b> may be merged as one operation.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">If, in decision block <b>550</b>, it is determined that the payload is fragment message, the process turns to decision block <b>552</b>. In decision block <b>552</b>, it is determined whether the payload is the last fragment message in a series of fragment messages. As described in the above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, whether the payload is the last fragment message in a series of fragment messages may be determined according to the end-of-fragment indicator bit <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If it is determined that the payload is not the last fragment message, the process turns to block <b>554</b>. In block <b>554</b>, the received fragment message is stored. Then in block <b>556</b>, the next fragment message is received. If the payload is the last fragment message is determined, then the process turns to block <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In Block <b>560</b>, the fragment message and other fragment messages belonging to the same series as the fragment messages are assembled into an aggregate message. The other fragment messages belonging to the same series as the fragment message are those that are in block <b>554</b>. As descried above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the &#x201c;message identifier&#x201d; field <b>414</b> in a fragment message contains the identifier of the aggregate message and the &#x201c;serial number&#x201d; field <b>415</b> contains the serial number of the fragment message. Therefore, block <b>560</b> may proceed in the following manner: extracting the payload of each fragment message having the same content of the &#x201c;message identifier&#x201d; field <b>414</b>, and then combining each of the extracted payloads sequentially in the order of the serial number in the &#x201c;serial number&#x201d; field <b>415</b> to obtain a completed aggregate message.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">For example, the method of assembling the fragment message <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is to combine the splitting body <b>420</b> in the fragment message <b>401</b> and the fragment body <b>420</b> in the fragment message <b>402</b> in sequence. Since the fragment body <b>420</b> of the first fragment message <b>401</b> contains the aggregate header <b>310</b> of aggregate message <b>301</b>, the sequential combination results in a completed aggregate message <b>301</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">After block <b>560</b>, the process proceeds to blocks <b>542</b> and <b>530</b>. Then the process ends. As a result, the base station BS sends the message MSG to mobile terminals <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>118</b> via downlink.</p>
