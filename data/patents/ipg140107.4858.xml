<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a modular support system for optical fiber trays, a kit of parts for a modular support system for optical fiber trays as well as to an optical fiber organizer with such a modular support system.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Telecommunication cables are used for distributing all manner of data across vast networks. A telecommunication cable typically includes a bundle of individual telecommunication lines (either optical fibers or copper wires) that are encased within a protective sheath. As telecommunication cables are routed across data networks, it is necessary to periodically open the cable so that for example one or more telecommunication lines therein may be spliced, thereby allowing data to be distributed to other cables or &#x201c;branches&#x201d; of the telecommunication network. In distribution points of a telecommunications network it is also necessary to install organizers where the cables may be managed and connected to the necessary telecommunications infrastructure such as for example splitters etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Commonly, optical fiber organizers are arranged in racks that comprise optical fiber storage and/or splice trays mounted on support systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO 2009/106874 discloses an optical fiber storage or management module for an optical distribution frame or rack for management of fiber cables, fibers and connections. The module comprises a housing and a drawer for a rack with at least one optical fiber storage tray and a support for supporting the storage tray(s).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO98/22842 discloses an optical fiber organizer with a storage module. The storage module comprises a support plate for supporting a plurality of hinged optical fiber storage trays. The support plate is fixed to the storage module by a snap-fit. A plurality of support plates may be arranged side-by-side in the storage module, thereby forming a larger support plate. Each support plate comprises a central area and lateral routing areas, e.g. in the shape of several narrow channels or one big corridor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need to provide a flexible support system for optical fiber trays that can be adapted easily to different applications and different sizes of cable management systems. There is further a need for a flexible support system for optical fiber trays that allows of retrofitting cable management systems and adapting them to changing boundary conditions. There is also a need to provide a kit of parts for a modular support system for optical fiber trays and to provide an optical fiber organizer with the above mentioned properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention comprises a modular support system for optical fiber trays comprising at least one central module for supporting the optical fiber trays, the central module being adapted to be positioned side-by-side with a plurality of central modules supporting additional optical fiber trays. According to the invention, the central module further comprises a fixing structure for attaching at least one additional fiber management module to the central module. The fixing structures according to the invention may be all kind of appropriate fixing structures that have the ability to attach two parts to each other or to position them adjacent to each other such that they can be easily detached from one another but stay side-by-side to each other during use of the support system. Examples for such fixing structures may be snap fit elements, friction fit elements, screws or gluing. In other words the system according to the invention is based on a central module. The size of the system may be adapted by choosing the appropriate number of central modules and positioning them side-by-side. Depending on the application, additional fiber management modules may be attached to the central modules. The fiber management modules may provide different kind of fiber management functions, thus it is possible to adapt the modular support system to all kind of different applications by choosing the appropriate fiber management module(s).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The modular support system according to the invention provides the advantage of being a flexible system with regard of its size and fiber management functions which may be adapted according to a great number of applications.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The central modules of the modular support system according to the invention may have an essentially planar structure and can be made out of plastic. The use of plastic has the advantage that the modules may easily and cost effectively manufactured such as for example by injection moulding. Possible plastic material that can be used are for example ABS, PC or PBT (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polycarbonate or polybutylene tereph).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The support system according to the invention may be used for standard optical telecommunication fibers, for example, fibers having a standard buffer cladding, or a fiber buffer cladding having an outer diameter being larger or smaller. The outer fiber jackets may be standard sizes, such as for example 1 mm, 2 mm, or 3 mm, etc. or they may be even less, such as for example 0.9 mm or 0.25 mm. The support system according to the invention may further be used for optical fiber ribbon cables, it may be used for single or multi fiber cables or even for patch cords.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention, the modular support system for optical fiber trays comprises recesses and projections cooperating with each other while central modules are positioned side-by-side. A first central module may have at least one recess that cooperates with a projection of a second central module that is positioned adjacent to the first support module. Such a structure has the advantage that the central modules that are positioned side-by-side are fixed relative to each other. During use of the system, it is important that the modules are not moved relative to each other since the fibers being managed on the system need a stable support. The recess and the projection may be configured such that the fixation between the first and the second central modules is a detachable fixation such as for example a snap-fit based fixation. It is also possible that the central modules may be fixed at each other in a non-detachable way such as for example by gluing, press-fitting or screwing. If the central module comprises a repetitive structure, such as for example a structure for guiding fibers or a structure for supporting fiber trays, the central module may be configured such that the structure is continuously set forth on central modules that are positioned adjacent each other. In other words, repetitive structures on central modules that are positioned side-by-side are arranged on the modules such that the structures continue over the plurality of central modules without any gap or break between them. The recesses and projections may function as keying-features that allow easy alignment and orientation of the central modules in a side-by-side manner.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a further exemplary embodiment of the invention, the central module comprises a plurality of hooks configured to engage with a latching mechanism of the optical fiber trays. Hooks are a commonly known element for attaching elements at each other, especially if it is intended to swivel or pivot one element relative to the other. Furthermore, hooks are easy to manufacture if the central module is produced by injection moulding. The hooks may be integrated into the design of the central module and therefore be one part with the central module. The hooks may be configured such that the optical fiber tray may be snap fitted to the central module. The hooks may also be part of the repetitive structure described above with the advantage that the trays may be arranged on the support system in a very space saving manner.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The modular support system according to the invention may comprise a central module with a bearing structure configured to support pivotal movement of the optical fiber trays relative to the central module. The bearing structure may have the shape of open channels with a semi circle cross section. The bearing structure may also be part of the repetitive structure described above.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The modular support system according to the invention may further comprise a central module with a guiding structure configured to direct optical fibers in more than one direction to and from the optical fiber trays. Such a structure provides flexibility in routing fibers on the support system without being limited to guide the fibers into a given direction. The guiding structure may provide multi-directional fiber channels that provide sufficient physical support to the fibers and assure the suitable bending radius of the fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The modular support system according to the invention may provide a central module with a retaining bracket that extends over a lateral side of the support part for retaining optical fibers that are routed from or to the optical fiber trays or lengthwise along the support system. An additional retaining bracket may provide more physical support to the fibers that are routed over the support structure according to the invention. The retaining bracket may be configured as being one part with the central module with the advantage of being produced in one step with the central module or it may be configured as being two parts with the central module. The second alternative may have the advantage of an even more flexible and adaptable system, since the retaining bracket may only be installed when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The modular support system according to the invention may further provide a central module having fixing structures for attaching a fiber management module. The fiber management module can be positioned on a bottom side of the central module. Such a configuration has the advantage that the top side of the central module may be used exclusively for routing and/or managing fibers as well as for supporting or holding optical fiber trays. It is also possible to position the fixing structures of the central module in other suitable areas of the central module, such as for example at lateral sides.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention also comprises a kit of parts for a modular support system for optical fiber trays comprising
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">at least one central module for supporting the optical fiber trays, the central module being adapted to be positioned side-by-side with a plurality of additional central modules supporting the optical fiber trays, wherein the central module further comprises fixing structures for attaching at least one additional fiber management module to the central module and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">at least one additional fiber management module. Such a kit of parts offers the same advantages as the modular support system mentioned above.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention the kit of parts comprises a fiber management module with a c-shaped fiber corridor for guiding optical fibers. A c-shaped fiber corridor provides on one side sufficient protection for the fibers being routed through the corridor. On the other side it provides the possibility that fibers may enter or leave the corridor at any appropriate location since the corridor provides one open side. The open side of the corridor may face the central module when the fiber management module is attached to the central module. It is of course also possible to have fiber management module with a L-shaped fiber corridor.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">The fiber corridor may be oriented such that optical fibers may be routed lengthwise to the support system, wherein each corridor can route optical fibers to either end of the support system and provide optical fibers access to individual splice trays mounted on the support system. This may for example be the case if the corridor is oriented with an angle of approximately 90&#xb0; relative to a pivot axis of the fiber optic trays.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">The kit of parts may further comprise an additional fiber management module which comprises a strain relief element fixing structure with parallel sidewalls and snap elements, e.g. noses, for holding strain relief elements. Instead of the snap elements for holding the strain relief elements, the additional fiber management module may also comprise other common fixing structures, such as for example tube holders for tubes protecting fibers as well as universal fixing elements such as for example cable-ties.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">The kit of parts according to the invention may have a fiber management module with a strain relief fixing structure, wherein the strain relief fixing structure is configured such that the strain relief elements are positioned in a staggered way on the additional fiber management module. Such an arrangement provides a space saving possibility of positioning a strain relief element on a fiber management module.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">According to another embodiment of the invention the fiber management module comprises a flat section carrying a fixing structure corresponding with the fixing structure of the central module for attaching the additional fiber management modules to the central module. The flat section provides a space saving possibility of being positioned under the central module and cooperates with the fixing structures of the central module.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">The invention further includes an optical fiber organizer comprising a housing, a drawer slidable mounted in the housing and a modular support system for optical fiber trays as described above mounted in the drawer or a kit of parts for a modular support system for optical fiber trays as described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">Herein below various embodiments of the present invention are described and shown in the drawings wherein like elements are provided with the same reference numbers. Directional terms such as &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; and others are used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective exploded view of an optical fiber organizer <b>1</b>. The optical fiber organizer <b>1</b> may be part of an optical fiber distribution frame or rack for the management of optical fiber cables, optical fibers and optical fiber connections. The optical fiber organizer <b>1</b> comprises a housing <b>2</b> and a drawer <b>3</b>, that is slidably arranged in the housing <b>2</b> and enters the housing <b>2</b> at its front wall. The housing comprises a rear side wall that is positioned opposite the front wall. It further comprises two parallel side walls that are arranged perpendicular to the front and the rear side wall. The drawer <b>3</b> has a two level structure, a first level <b>4</b>, e.g. a lower level, that provides an area for slack storage of entering cables and a second level <b>5</b>, e.g. an upper level, that is configured to carry a support system <b>7</b> for optical fiber trays. Fiber can be routed from one level to the other across a rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b>. For providing a safe guidance for these fibers into the drawer, the fibers may be guided through fiber-tubes fitted in fiber-tube guide elements <b>71</b>. Several of such fiber-tube guide elements <b>71</b> are attached to the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer. A fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Fibers that are managed in the optical fiber organizer <b>1</b> may enter the housing <b>2</b> through an opening (located next to a fan out element <b>91</b>) in one of its side walls. A detailed description of a fan out element <b>91</b> will follow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. Through the opening they may be lead onto the first level <b>4</b> of the drawer, the slack storage level, using fiber-tubes to protect them. From the first level <b>4</b>, the fibers may further be lead over the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> onto the second level <b>5</b>, using the fiber-tube guide elements <b>71</b>, that will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 13</figref>. The fibers enter the second level <b>5</b> at discrete points&#x2014;predetermined by the geometry of the fiber-tube guide elements <b>71</b> along the length of the drawer <b>3</b>. From there the fibers may directly enter the modular support system <b>7</b> according to the invention, that is arranged in the centre of the second level <b>5</b> of the drawer <b>3</b>, where they may be spliced, connected etc. on optical fiber trays <b>10</b>. The modular support system <b>7</b> extends from the left side of the second level <b>5</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> to a header <b>8</b>, which is positioned at the right side of the drawer <b>3</b> and may, for example, be used for routing fibers into another direction. The fibers may leave the modular support system <b>7</b> on the opposite side, that is the side that faces the front end of the second level <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The front end of the second level <b>5</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> can be in the form of a patch panel <b>9</b> providing space for a plurality of optical fiber connectors <b>11</b>. Terminated cables (not shown) from outside the drawer <b>3</b> can be connected to optical connectors <b>11</b> by fiber connector couplings in the patch panel <b>9</b>. The terminated cables may be guided over a flat cable holder <b>13</b> that is arranged in the same plane as the second level <b>5</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> and through a series of five bar-shaped cable guides <b>12</b>, having a half-moon shaped cross section, that are arranged in a row extending parallel to the cable holder <b>13</b>. The radii of the half-moon shaped cable guides <b>12</b> are selected such that the minimum bend radius of the cables is maintained. It is also possible to arrange more or less than five cable guides <b>12</b> in front of the drawer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">According to the invention the support system <b>7</b> for optical fiber trays is a modular support system. That means that the support system <b>7</b> according to the invention comprises several different modules. These modules may be attached to each other or may be positioned next to each other such that the whole support system for optical fiber trays can be adapted to a plurality of applications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>is a perspective view of a central module <b>21</b>, of one exemplary embodiment of a modular support system <b>7</b> for optical fiber trays according to the invention. A top view of the central module is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. In an exemplary aspect the central module <b>21</b> is a substantially flat element with a rectangular shape. It comprises two parallel first sides <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>adapted to be positioned next to another central module <b>21</b> as well as two parallel second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>adapted to be positioned next to or fixed to an additional fiber management module <b>41</b>, <b>51</b> (such as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The first sides <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>are longer than the second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>and the first sides <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>are arranged perpendicular to the second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b</i>. The top side of the central module <b>21</b> comprises several structures that will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">In the middle of the top side of the central module <b>21</b>, a row of hooks <b>24</b> for attaching the optical fiber trays <b>10</b> is arranged. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the central module <b>21</b> comprises a row of six hooks <b>24</b>. The hooks <b>24</b> are arranged such that the optical fiber trays <b>10</b>, when fixed to the central module <b>21</b>, are oriented parallel to the first sides <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The hooks <b>24</b> may be designed as snap fit elements to provide a detachable fixing element. They may also be designed such that an optical fiber tray <b>10</b> may be attached once at the central module <b>21</b> but not detached again.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">The structures on the top side of the central module <b>21</b> are arranged symmetrical relative to an axis through of the row of hooks <b>24</b>, thus only one half of the structures will be described herein. With a certain distance from the hooks <b>24</b> the central module <b>21</b> comprises a bearing structure <b>25</b>. The bearing structure <b>25</b> has the shape of six parallel channels, having a semicircular cross section. This structure <b>25</b>, especially the orientation of the channels, can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. The channels function as bearings for outer edges of the optical fiber trays <b>10</b>. Between the bearing structures <b>25</b> and the hooks <b>24</b> in the middle of the central module <b>21</b> parallel protrusions <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> are arranged which help keeping the fiber trays fixed in a certain position, for example with an angle of 90&#xb0; or 45&#xb0;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>is a perspective view of the central module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>with an optical fiber tray <b>10</b> that shows how the tray <b>10</b> is fixed over the hooks <b>24</b> at the support structure and how the tray <b>10</b> interacts with the bearing structures <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Adjacent the channel shaped bearing structure <b>25</b>, the central module <b>21</b> provides a first fiber guide structure <b>26</b>, constructed such that fibers may be lead into three different directions. For example, fibers that are coming from an optical fiber tray <b>10</b> may be lead in a direction parallel to the channels of the bearing structure <b>25</b> (straight direction, see arrow X), the fibers may be lead to the right (indicated by arrow A) and the fibers may be lead to the left (indicated by arrow B). This is achieved by two rows of fiber guiding elements <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. Those fiber guiding elements <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> may also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The guiding elements <b>31</b> in the first row&#x2014;that is the row that is positioned closer to the row of hooks <b>24</b>&#x2014;are triangular shaped. They are oriented such that one corner of the triangle points towards to the second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the central module <b>21</b>. The flat side of the triangle that is opposite of the corner facing towards the second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>touches the channels of the bearing structure <b>25</b> such that one triangle is arranged between two of the bearing structure channels and touches the side walls of those two channels. Thus, fibers coming from optical fiber trays <b>10</b> may be lead between two of the triangles of the guiding elements <b>31</b>. The guiding elements <b>32</b> in the second row have a trapezoidal or diamond shape and are arranged such that one corner of their corner points to the corner of the guiding elements <b>31</b> facing towards the second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b</i>. The guiding elements <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are arranged in a non-staggered way relative to each other. Thus, fibers coming from optical fiber trays may be led between two triangles of the guiding elements <b>31</b>&#x2014;as mentioned above&#x2014;and they may be led between two trapezoids of the guiding elements <b>32</b>. This is the above mentioned straight guiding direction. A fiber coming from or going to an optical fiber tray <b>10</b> passing through two triangular shaped guiding elements <b>31</b> of the first row may also be lead to the left or to the right by passing through two guiding elements <b>32</b> of the second row as indicated by the arrows A and B, respectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. It is also possible to direct the fiber in a straight direction as indicated by the arrow X. The side walls of the guiding elements <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> have rounded bottom edges leading into the surface of the central module <b>21</b>. Thereby the repetitive structure on the surface of the central modules <b>21</b> may be continued without a gap over the length of a plurality of central modules <b>21</b> positioned side-by-side.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">When looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, the first row of guiding elements <b>31</b> extends from the first side wall <b>22</b><i>a </i>to the opposite side wall <b>22</b><i>b</i>, starting with half a guiding element <b>31</b><i>a </i>at the first side wall <b>22</b><i>a </i>and ending with a corresponding second half of a guiding element <b>31</b><i>b</i>. The second row of guiding elements <b>32</b> also extends from the first side wall <b>22</b><i>a </i>to the opposite side wall <b>22</b><i>b</i>. It starts with a recess and then with a complete guiding element <b>32</b><i>a </i>and it ends with a complete guiding element <b>32</b><i>b </i>that extends over the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the central module <b>21</b>. The guiding element <b>32</b><i>b </i>that extends over the side wall <b>22</b><i>b </i>of a first central module <b>21</b> may be positioned in a recess next to a guiding element <b>32</b><i>a </i>of a second central module <b>21</b> that is placed side-by-side to the first central module <b>21</b> (as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>). Such the guiding element <b>32</b><i>b </i>functions as a keying element that helps to position two central modules <b>21</b> relative to each other. Since the central module <b>21</b> has a symmetric geometry it does not matter which of the two sides <b>22</b><i>a </i>or <b>22</b><i>b </i>of two central modules <b>21</b> are placed next to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">The central module <b>21</b> further provides a retaining bracket <b>33</b> at the middle of each second side <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>for retaining fibers that are routed on a lateral side of the central module <b>21</b>, e.g. in an additional fiber management module as will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The retaining brackets <b>33</b> each extend from the middle of a fiber guide element <b>32</b> over the second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b</i>. Each bracket has a shape like a hook or nose and may have any other appropriate shape. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>the central module <b>21</b> comprises a recess <b>36</b> at its second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>(only the one on the side <b>23</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>). This recess <b>36</b> may accommodate parts of additional fiber management modules as will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of an additional fiber management module according to the invention&#x2014;a fiber routing module <b>41</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a top view of the fiber routing module <b>41</b> from a top view. The fiber routing module <b>41</b> comprises essentially two parts: a c-shaped fiber corridor <b>42</b> for routing fibers e.g. from and to optical fiber trays <b>10</b> that may be attached to the central module <b>21</b> and a flat connection part <b>43</b> for fixing, attaching or positioning the fiber routing module <b>41</b> to the central module <b>21</b>. The fiber routing module <b>41</b> is adapted to be positioned next the central module <b>21</b> adjacent its second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>23</b><i>b</i>. The length of the c-shaped fiber corridor <b>42</b> corresponds to the length of those second sides <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the central module <b>21</b>. The c-shaped fiber corridor <b>42</b> comprises an upper shoulder <b>44</b><i>a</i>, a rear shoulder <b>44</b><i>b </i>and a lower shoulder <b>44</b><i>c</i>. The upper shoulder <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the lower shoulder <b>44</b><i>b </i>are oriented parallel to each other, the rear shoulder <b>44</b><i>b </i>joins the upper shoulder <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the lower shoulder <b>44</b><i>c </i>with each other and is oriented perpendicular to both. The upper shoulder <b>44</b><i>a </i>has a recess <b>45</b> positioned in its middle facing the central module <b>21</b>, when both modules are fixed at each other. The recess <b>45</b> corresponds to the fiber retaining bracket <b>33</b> of the central module <b>21</b> and allows pushing fibers through the gap between the c-shaped corridor <b>42</b> and the retaining bracket <b>33</b> of the central module <b>21</b> into the corridor <b>42</b>. The c-shaped fiber corridor <b>42</b> leads to the second flat connection part <b>43</b> of the fiber routing module <b>41</b> over an abutment <b>46</b> functioning as an abutment for the central module <b>21</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of the fixing structures of a central module <b>21</b> and an additional fiber management module&#x2014;here a fiber routing module <b>41</b>&#x2014;according to the invention from the bottom side. This view shows how the two parts are fixed relative to each other. The central module <b>21</b> comprises two elongated protrusions <b>34</b> corresponding to the elongated holes <b>47</b> of the fiber routing module <b>41</b>. The central module <b>21</b> further comprises two essentially round protrusions <b>35</b> corresponding to the two u-shaped recesses <b>48</b> of the fiber routing module <b>41</b>. For fixing the fiber routing module <b>41</b> relative to the central module <b>21</b>, the protrusions <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> of the central module <b>21</b> may be positioned in the holes <b>47</b> and recesses <b>48</b> of the fiber routing module <b>41</b>. Holes <b>47</b>, recesses <b>48</b> and protrusions <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> may be designed such that the connection between the two modules is a detachable snap-fit connection. They also may be designed such that the connection is a loose one which only holds the two parts in a relative position next to each other but does not really fix the two modules at each other. Any other appropriate possibilities to fix the two modules at each other may be used as well, such as for example gluing, clipping or clamping, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective view of a central module <b>21</b> with a strain relief module <b>51</b> with one strain relief element <b>61</b> positioned onto the strain relief module <b>51</b> and another positioned over the strain relief module <b>51</b>. The strain relief element <b>61</b> comprises a plurality of holes <b>62</b> (here six holes) in a row, each hole <b>62</b> configured to hold one fiber and providing strain relief to the sleeve of the fiber. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows one fiber <b>63</b> that is being led through the strain relief element <b>61</b> that is positioned onto the strain relief module <b>51</b>. Each strain relief element <b>61</b> may be positioned between two parallel walls <b>54</b> that provide holding noses <b>55</b> at their upper end. The walls <b>54</b> are arranged in a staggered way. Such an arrangement provides a space saving manner of positioning strain relief elements <b>61</b> onto the strain relief module <b>51</b>. The fibers that are being led through the strain relief element <b>61</b> may go through or come from the fiber trays <b>10</b> supported by the support system <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a perspective view of a fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> from a first side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the same fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> from the opposite side. The fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> may be positioned on the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for guiding fibers being stored on the first slack storage level <b>4</b> to the second (upper) level <b>5</b>. The fibers being stored on the first slack storage level <b>4</b> may be routed trough tubes (not shown in the drawings). Several fiber-tube guide elements <b>71</b> may be positioned next to each other (side-by-side) along the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> providing fibers access to the upper level <b>5</b> at discrete points along the length of the drawer. For that purpose the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> provides a slot <b>72</b> for receiving the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b>. A notch <b>82</b> fixes the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> onto holes (not shown) in the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b>. The fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> is detachable fixed to the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">The fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> has a block-shaped body with a lower side <b>73</b> and a upper side <b>74</b>. The open ends of the slots <b>72</b> for fixing the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> to the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are facing the lower side <b>73</b> of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b>. The upper side <b>74</b> provides three parallel channels <b>75</b> for receiving fiber tubes (not shown). Each channel <b>75</b> provides two little notches one on each side of the channel <b>75</b> for fixing the tubes to the channel <b>75</b>. The tubes may also be held into the channels <b>75</b> by any other appropriate means, such as for example by gluing.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The side of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is the side that faces the rear side of the drawer <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the side of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is the side that faces the inside of the drawer <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the support system <b>7</b> according to the invention. The rear side of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> provides a rounded surface <b>78</b>. The radius of the surface <b>78</b> is selected such that the minimum bend radius of fibers being lead through tubes is considered. This may be important because of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> being positioned at the rear end <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b> which may be moved relative to its housing <b>2</b> thereby pulling at fibers that are lead from the storage level <b>4</b> to the upper level <b>5</b> of the drawer <b>3</b>. The side of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> provides two flat L-shaped tube-holders <b>76</b> and <b>77</b>. The short legs of the holders <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> are fixed to the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> and the long legs are facing each other thereby providing retention for fiber-tubes going to the channels <b>75</b>. The short legs of the holders <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> are arranged parallel to each other but angled for example relative to the upper side <b>74</b> of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b>. This arrangement provides the possibility of smoothly guiding fibers from, for example, a horizontal orientation the fibers might have while being stored on the storage level <b>4</b> to an orientation they need to have for being guided through the channels <b>75</b> to the support system <b>7</b> according to the invention. The arrows C, D, E and F indicate possible ways a fiber-tube might be guided along the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b>. The arrows D and E indicate ways of fiber-tubes that are held by holders <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> and guided through channels <b>75</b> of the same fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b>. The arrows C and F indicate ways of fiber-tubes that are held by holders <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> from other fiber-tube guide elements <b>71</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) than the channels they are guided through.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">On the opposite side, that can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> provides a fiber retainer <b>79</b>. The retainer <b>79</b> extends over the whole length of the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> and is connected on both sides with the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b>. The fiber-tubes that are being guided by the fiber-tube guide element <b>71</b> may end as soon as they have reached the upper side <b>74</b>, e.g. the end of the channels <b>75</b> facing the interior of the drawer <b>3</b>. The retainer <b>79</b> only retains fibers and no fiber-tubes. The fibers being retained by the fiber retainer <b>79</b> may directly be led to the support system <b>7</b> according to the invention, e.g. through a strain relief element <b>61</b> of a strain relief module <b>51</b> and from there onto a fiber tray <b>10</b>.</p>

The slot <b>72</b> is accessible from above through an opening <b>83</b>. A tool <b>84</b> may be inserted through the opening <b>83</b> for opening the engagement of the notch <b>82</b> with the rear side <b>6</b> of the drawer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective view of a fan out element <b>91</b> that is located next to the opening through which fibers enter the optical fiber organizer <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The fan out element <b>91</b> has an essentially flat appearance and is rectangular shaped. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> does show the front side of the fan out element <b>91</b>. On the left side of the fan out element <b>91</b> in FIG. <b>14</b>&#x2014;the entering or incoming side <b>92</b>&#x2014;cable containing several fibers may enter the fan out element <b>91</b> either from the direction indicated by the arrow G or from the direction indicated by the arrow H. The fan out element <b>91</b> provides several channels <b>94</b> for the entering cables&#x2014;from the direction G and from the direction H, whereby the channels <b>94</b> from both directions cross each other at a first reference line a and meet each other at a second reference line b. The channels <b>94</b> end up in four essentially parallel channel sections <b>95</b> behind the reference line b. Each channel <b>94</b> provides means for fixing the cable sheath in the shape of noses <b>96</b> such that the fibers may enter the fan out element <b>91</b> protected. The channels <b>94</b> and <b>95</b> are shaped to assure the minimum bend radius of fibers. Behind a third reference line c the fibers may leave their cable sheath and be separated into further channels <b>97</b>&#x2014;that lead to the leaving side <b>93</b> of the fan out element <b>91</b>. The channels <b>97</b> are oriented such that the incoming fiber directions G and H are approximately perpendicular to the leaving fiber direction indicated by the arrow I. Channels <b>97</b> provide means for fixing fiber-tubes through which the separated fibers may be guided from the fan out element <b>91</b> into the optical fiber organizer <b>1</b> in the shape of two parallel notches <b>98</b>. The fan out element <b>91</b> provides a safe transition between incoming fiber cable and the fiber-tube of the optical fiber organizer <b>1</b>. The fan out element <b>91</b> comprises openings <b>99</b> for fixing the fan out element <b>91</b> to a holder (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The openings <b>99</b> are configured such that it is possible to stack several single fan out elements <b>91</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> on top of each other as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. A hold down device <b>101</b> is provided as a break out piece at the fan out element <b>91</b>. After breaking out the hold down device it may be press-fitted with its protrusions <b>102</b> into the additional openings <b>103</b> of the fan out element <b>91</b>. The hold down device <b>101</b> serves as device for holding down cables in the channel sections <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a perspective view of a stack of fan out elements for fibers entering the optical fiber organizer <b>1</b> according to the invention mounted on a holder <b>104</b>. The holder <b>104</b> is L-shaped. On its short leg it provides an opening <b>107</b> for fibers leaving the fan out element <b>91</b> and entering the optical fiber organizer <b>1</b>.
