<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a combined offshore system for generating electricity from wave motion, primarily ocean or sea waves as well as from wind, the extracted energy being converted into useful energy. Existing devices will be used to convert the wave energy into useful energy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference is made to the following publications: U.S. Pat. No. 6,476,511 describes an apparatus for extracting power from ocean waves that comprises a number of buoyant cylindrical body members connected together at their ends to form an articulated chain-like structure. Each pair of cylindrical members is connected to an adjacent pair by a coupling member, which permits relative rotational movement of the cylindrical members about at least one transverse axis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 2003145587 describes a wind and wave energy plant, comprising a windmill with a rotor and a wave-actuated water pump that can drive a turbine. In this patent it is disclosed how by means a firmly anchored mill tower, it is possible to achieve a combination of a better utilization of the wind energy, as the mill rotor is raised to a height with strong winds, and at the same time a better utilization of the wave energy, as by pumping seawater into the mill tower and by storing the water there it is possible to achieve a large pressure drop across the turbine wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO2006010783 describes wind, wave and current power stations with different foundation solutions and methods for manufacture, transport, installation and operation of these power stations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In plants for extraction of energy from wind and waves, the final price of the energy produced depends partly on the construction costs and partly on the overall efficiency. The known plants are generally rather complex and therefore expensive to construct, and moreover the efficiencies achieved are not optimum.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the present invention is to provide a combined offshore system for generating electricity, consisting of an offshore placed windmill unit with a generator for extracting power from wind and transferring it into electricity, an electricity export cable connected to the windmill for exporting produced electricity to offshore or onshore consumers and at least one offshore wave power unit for extracting power from waves, the electricity produced by the wave power unit being transferred via the same electricity export cable as the electricity generated by the windmill unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Power transmission from offshore turbines and generators is generally through an undersea cable, which is more expensive to install than cables on land, and may use high voltage direct current operation if significant distances are to be covered&#x2014;which then requires yet more equipment. The offshore environment can also be corrosive and abrasive in salt water locations so the maintenance is a key issue in such installations. Repairs and maintenance are usually much more difficult, and generally more costly, than for onshore turbines. Offshore wind turbines are equipped with extensive corrosion protection measures like coatings and cathodic protection. Also the permitting procedure for installing a wave power unit can be significantly reduced in time and costs if it is not a stand alone unit but when it can be integrated into an existing or already planned windmill park or coupled to one or more wind mill units. The present invention therefore, presents the advantage for one or more offshore power units for an easier and economic permission procedure, installation, power production by using a pre-existing grid of export cables.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another advantage of the present invention is that it enables simplified maintenance. In fact, according to the present invention a combined offshore system is installed by installing/mooring a wave power unit nearby an already placed wind mill unit, between which an energized connection is established, the wave power unit protecting the windmill from destructive water waves as well as offering a more protected landing area for a maintenance vessel around the windmill.</p>

Attached to the windmill <b>1</b>, are two wave power units <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>&#x2032; each provided with a buoyancy modules <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032;. Each buoyancy module <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; is provided with a taut mooring leg <b>6</b> attached to the sea bed and each buoyancy module <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; is also moored to the windmill <b>1</b> via a taut cable <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows that each buoyancy module <b>4</b> is connected to the windmill via an energized connection <b>5</b>. This energized connection can be an electricity cable or a conduit carrying a fluid (hydraulics, air, seawater) that is pressurized by a linear power take off system that is placed between the buoyancy module and the taut mooring leg <b>6</b> of the wave power unit. Alternatively, the linear power take off system can be based on tubes or rolls made of Electro Active Polymers (EAP) materials as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,038,357 or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/684,426. Due to the waves, the wave power unit will start rotating as shown by the arrow <b>11</b> like a Bristol cylinder and activates the linear power take off system that is connected to the taut mooring lines. The advantage of this configuration is that the windmill unit can be used as a mooring system for the wave power unit and that for example the electricity converting equipment of the wave power unit such as the generator, the transformer and/or the turbine can all be placed within the fixed windmill <b>1</b>. The advantage of a configuration according the invention is that the maintenance or change out of this equipment is simplified as it is in a steady, non-moving and dry environment above water level. Another advantage is that by removing this equipment from the wave power unit, the wave power unit itself and its mooring system can be of a much lighter, simpler, more effective and less costly construction which simplifies the offshore installation of it as well.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a front view of another embodiment according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a windmill <b>1</b>, fixed to the seabed, connected to an export cable <b>2</b> installed on the seabed and delivering electricity produced to an offshore consumer, like a platform, or to onshore consumers. Attached to the windmill <b>1</b> are two wave power units <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>&#x2032; each provided with a hose pump system <b>9</b>. Each power unit <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>&#x2032; is moored to the sea bed and is attached to the windmill <b>1</b> to fix its position relatively to the windmill. The hose-pump is a slender hollow elastomeric cylinder capable of pumping fluid when it is extended and contracted. In this embodiment, the hose-pump is connected to a buoy <b>13</b>; hence wave action can be harnessed to produce pressurized fluid via cyclic extensions and contractions of the stretchable hose pump. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the wave action (see arrow <b>10</b>) causes the hose-pump <b>9</b> to go up and down (arrow <b>12</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows that each wave power unit is connected to the windmill <b>1</b> via an energized connection <b>5</b>. This energized connection can be a conduit carrying the fluid that is pressurized, this pressurized fluid being converted into electricity via a hydro-power turbine and generator (not shown) within the windmill <b>1</b>. Alternatively, the energized connection is an electricity cable which transfers electricity produced by the turbine and generator placed within the wave power unit, to the windmill unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows another embodiment according to the present invention where the windmill is floating and is taut-moored to the seabed. In this embodiment, the windmill will react to the waves action (arrow <b>10</b>) as a point absorber. Point absorbers are usually axi-symmetric about a vertical axis. The windmill <b>1</b> will operate in a vertical mode and rises and falls with the passing waves and interacts with the seabed through the taut mooring lines <b>6</b> (see arrow <b>13</b>), which are connected to a linear power take off system which, as mentioned before, can be based on hydraulics, pressurized air or seawater, tubes or rolls made of Electro Active Polymers (EAP) materials. In this embodiment, the windmill is connected to a power export cable <b>2</b>. The export cable has a &#x201c;lazy S&#x201d; configuration as it extends toward the sea bottom via an intermediate buoy <b>19</b>. From the intermediate buoy the export cable stretches in a gentle curve toward the seabed bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another embodiment according to the present invention where the wave power unit is an articulated structure of interconnected buoyant bodies. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a windmill <b>1</b>, fixed to the seabed, connected to an export cable <b>2</b> installed on the seabed and delivering electricity produced to users and/or to shore. Attached to the windmill <b>1</b>, is a wave power unit <b>3</b> having an articulated structure of buoyant bodies <b>14</b>. The wave power unit <b>3</b> is attached to the windmill via a connector <b>15</b> that enables the wave power unit to freely weathervane so to orientate itself (see arrow <b>16</b>) in the most efficient direction depending on the wave direction (see arrow <b>10</b>). The wave power unit is also connected to the windmill via an (swiveling) energized connection <b>5</b>. This energized connection can be an electricity cable or a conduit carrying a fluid that is pressurized. In this embodiment, the wave power unit <b>3</b> consists of a series of semi-submerged cylindrical sections <b>14</b> linked by hinged joints. The wave-induced motion of these sections relatively to each other is transferred by hydraulic rams which pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors via smoothing hydraulic accumulators. The hydraulic motors drive electrical generators to produce electricity. Power from all the joints is fed down a single cable <b>5</b> to a junction on the windmill <b>1</b>. Several wave power units <b>3</b> can be connected together and linked to the windmill through a single cable <b>5</b>. Alternatively, other power take off systems can be used to transfer the relative motions of the buoyant bodies into power, like the use of Electro Active Polymer materials. Another alternative is to place the wave power unit in a fixed heading position to the waves by a mooring line that connects the free end of the wave power unit to the seabed; in this embodiment the wave power unit can be placed upwind of the windmill as well (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another embodiment according to the present invention where the wave power unit has a stand alone main buoyant structure <b>17</b> independently moored to the seabed with taut mooring lines <b>18</b> and placed at a submerged, wave active depth. The buoyant structure <b>17</b> can be provided with fixed buoyancy and with means to vary the surface of the buoyant structure that is exposed to the dynamic pressure of the wave, to optimize the surface for an efficient power take-off for more than one wave frequency and wave height and to maintain the tension in the taut mooring lines <b>18</b> under maximum allowable. Preferably the means to vary the surface of the buoyant structure consists of an expandable element with a variable geometry like inflatable bladders, which can be activated by a power control unit (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows a windmill <b>1</b>, placed at a horizontal distance of 5 m from the wave power unit and fixed to the seabed. The windmill unit is connected to an export cable <b>2</b> installed on the seabed for exporting electricity produced to users and/or to shore.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this embodiment, the wave power unit <b>3</b> is not attached to the windmill <b>1</b>. Each wave power unit <b>3</b> is connected to the windmill <b>1</b> via an energized connection <b>5</b>. This energized connection can be a conduit carrying a pressurized fluid as mentioned before, or an electricity cable. In this embodiment the energized connection <b>5</b> has a &#x201c;lazy S&#x201d; configuration where the energized connection <b>5</b> extends toward the connection with the windmill <b>1</b> via an intermediate buoy <b>19</b>. From the intermediate buoy <b>19</b> the energized connection <b>5</b> stretches in a gentle curve toward the windmill <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a detailed view of the electrical transformer equipment within the windmill according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a windmill <b>1</b>, fixed to the seabed, connected to an export cable <b>2</b> installed on the seabed and exporting electricity produced to users and/or to shore. The wind strikes the set of blades <b>20</b> mounted on a shaft <b>21</b> that is free to rotate. The wind hitting the blades generates a force that turns the shaft <b>21</b>, the shaft being linked to an electric generator <b>22</b> that converts the rotational kinetic energy to electricity. Electricity is transferred via an electricity cable <b>23</b> to a transducer <b>27</b> placed within the windmill, to which the electricity export cable <b>2</b> is connected. At the same time, the mechanical energy produced by the wave power unit is transferred via an energized connection <b>5</b> to a turbine <b>24</b> and generator <b>22</b> both placed within the windmill unit, to convert the mechanical energy into electricity. The electricity produced by this generator is than transferred to transducer <b>27</b> via an electricity cable <b>28</b>, and from the transducer exported via export cable <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As the power converting equipment of the wave power unit such as the generator <b>22</b>, the transformer and/or the turbine <b>24</b> can be placed within the dry environment of the fixed windmill <b>1</b> the inspection, maintenance or changed out of this equipment is eased. A clear advantage of removing this equipment from the wave power unit, is that the wave power unit and its mooring system can be of a much lighter, simpler, more effective an less costly construction, which will ease the offshore installation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a similar embodiment as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> except that the wave power unit has at least one mooring leg moored to the windmill <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also shows that a ship such as a maintenance vessel can moor alongside to the windmill <b>1</b> on the side were no wave power units are placed. The moored wave power units function as an effective break water as they extract energy out of the waves. By placing a wave power unit next to the windmill, the windmill is protected against wave impacts and create a more protected landing area for a maintenance vessel <b>25</b> is formed around the windmill with reduced wave heights. Hence, due to this calm landing zone, the maintenance vessel will have an easier access to the combined offshore power plant and the windmill unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> are showing different top views of arrangements according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows several aligned cylindrical wave power units <b>3</b> that are placed perpendicular to the wave direction (see arrow <b>10</b>), creating a calm water landing zone for a maintenance vessel. It is shown how different power units can be interconnected to each other by an energized connection line <b>26</b>, which will transfer the energy produced by one power unit <b>3</b><i>a </i>to another power unit <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The wave power unit <b>3</b><i>b </i>transfers the combined energy produced by the two units via the energized connection <b>5</b> to the windmill, where the energy (electricity or pressurized fluids) is converted so it can be exported via the export cable <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also shows that several wave power units (<b>3</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c</i>) can each be connected to the windmill <b>1</b> via an independent energized connection <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an embodiment where a group of wave power units as well as a single wave power unit are connected to the windmill <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an embodiment according to the present invention where a bundle of wave power units is connected to the windmill only via one single energized connection <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In all figures from <b>8</b> to <b>10</b>, it is also shown that whatever the configuration chosen, the wave power units can be placed so that they can act as a breakwater and create a calm water landing zone around the windmill <b>1</b> for maintenance vessel <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows another embodiment where several interconnected wave power units are directly connected in point <b>30</b> to the export cable <b>2</b> via a single energized connection <b>5</b>. In case the energized connection is an electricity cable, the connection point <b>30</b> can be just in the form of a submerged electrical connector or for example in the form of a fixed platform that is provided with a central transformer and other electrical equipment that is needed for transferring the electricity produced by the wave power units via the export cable <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the energized connection <b>5</b> is transferring a produced pressurized fluid, the connection point <b>30</b> can be provided with a turbine, a generator, a transformer and other electrical equipment that is needed to be able to convert the power generated by the wave power units into electricity and deliver it via the export cable <b>2</b></p>
