<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application claims priority of Taiwan Patent Application No. 98105609, filed on Feb. 23, 2009, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a system for displaying images including a display panel, and more particularly to a touch display panel with an in-cell capacitive induction touch structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, induction methods of in-cell touch display panels comprise an optical induction or an electrostatic induction method. The optical induction touch panel utilizes photo sensors at the pixels to respond to ambient lights, such that the functions of touch panels can be achieved. However, optical induction is easily affected by the brightness of ambient lights and limited by the area of a pixel. When the resolution of an optical induction touch display panel is high and the area of a pixel is small, signals sensed by optical induction are reduced. Additionally, aperture ratio of the optical induction touch display panel decreases due to the photo sensors at the pixels. Thus, problems exist for the optical induction touch display panels.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another type of touch panel is an in-cell electrostatic induction touch panel, which utilizes capacitance produced by touching of the touch panel to achieve the functions of touch panels. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plane view of a conventional electrostatic induction touch panel <b>100</b> is shown. The conventional electrostatic induction touch panel <b>100</b> has a plurality of rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>12</b> and <b>18</b>. The rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>12</b> are arranged in a column, which are connected by an X-axis electrode <b>10</b> and coupled to an X-axis circuit <b>14</b>. The rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>18</b> arranged in a row are connected by a Y-axis electrode <b>16</b> and coupled to a Y-axis circuit <b>20</b>. The rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>12</b> and the X-axis electrode <b>10</b> are disposed in the same conductive layer. The rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>18</b> and the Y-axis electrode <b>16</b> are disposed in a conductive layer other than the rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>12</b> and the X-axis electrode <b>10</b>. The materials of the conductive layers may be indium tin oxide (ITO). Therefore, the conventional electrostatic induction touch panel <b>100</b> needs two ITO conductive layers therein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cross section of an upper substrate <b>102</b> of the conventional electrostatic induction touch panel <b>100</b> along the line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown. The upper substrate <b>102</b> has a capacitor structure required by the electrostatic induction touch panel therein. First, the X-axis electrode <b>10</b> and the rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>12</b> are formed on a glass substrate <b>22</b>, and the X-axis electrode <b>10</b> is covered by a dielectric layer <b>24</b>. Then, the Y-axis electrode <b>16</b> and the rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>18</b> are formed on the dielectric layer <b>24</b>. A dielectric layer <b>26</b> is formed to cover the Y-axis electrode <b>16</b> and the rhombus electrically conductive structures <b>18</b>. Next, a color filter layer <b>28</b> is formed on the dielectric layer <b>26</b> and a common electrode layer <b>30</b> is formed on the color filter layer <b>28</b> and the dielectric layer <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The functions of the electrostatic induction touch panels are achieved by detecting capacitance produced by touching of the touch panel, wherein the detected capacitance is provided from the touching areas and the electrically conductive layers of the touch panel. However, the conventional in-cell electrostatic induction touch panel <b>100</b> has two conductive layers, for example, the electrodes <b>10</b> and <b>16</b>, such that parasitic capacitances are produced between the two conductive layers <b>10</b> and <b>16</b> and the common electrode layer <b>30</b>. Additionally, there is only one dielectric layer <b>26</b> disposed between the Y-axis electrode <b>16</b> and the common electrode layer <b>30</b>, such that the parasitic capacitance produced is large. The actually detected capacitance of the touch panel is easily interfered with by the parasitic capacitance, which reduces the sensitivity of the detected signals. Thus, the sensitivity of the detected signals of the conventional in-cell electrostatic induction touch panel <b>100</b> is poor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, a display panel with an in-cell capacitive induction touch structure that can improve the above mentioned problems is desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention provides a system for displaying images including a touch display panel. The touch display panel comprises a first substrate.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following description is of the best-contemplated mode of carrying out the invention. The description is provided for illustrating the general principles of the invention and is not meant to be limiting. The scope of the invention is best determined by reference to the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment of the invention, a touch display panel with an in-cell capacitive induction touch structure only utilizes one transparent electrode layer as touch induction areas to achieve the functions of the touch panel. In the touch display panel, the parasitic capacitance can be reduced and the sensitivity of detected signals can be enhanced. Moreover, utilizing only one layer of transparent electrode layer also can reduce the impact on the optical characters of the panel, for example, brightness, contrast, or uniformity of the displaying images of the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plane view of an in-cell capacitive induction touch structure of a touch display panel <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the invention is shown. The touch display panel <b>300</b> has a plurality of touch areas <b>310</b>, which are arranged into a matrix to form an electrode array <b>312</b> and have a type of button shown on the display panel <b>300</b>. In the display panel <b>300</b>, the plurality of touch areas <b>310</b> at X-axis direction and that at Y-axis direction both are disposed in the same electrode layer. The touch areas <b>310</b> at X-axis and Y-axis directions are co-planar and electrically insulated with each other. In an embodiment of the invention, each touch area <b>310</b> can be a circular button, which has a diameter between about 5 to 15 mm. For example, each touch area <b>310</b> may be a circular button having a diameter of 10 mm. Although each touch area <b>310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circular button, one skilled in the art would understand that any one of the plurality of touch areas <b>310</b> may be a button with a shape of an ellipse, a square, a rectangle, a triangle, a polygon or any other shapes. In addition, a width of the touch area <b>310</b> may be between about 5 to 15 mm. Moreover, the electrode array <b>312</b> can be arranged by a shape of a circle, an ellipse, a square, a rectangle, a triangle, a polygon or any other shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a cross section of the touch display panel <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the invention along the line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown. The display panel <b>300</b> has a display area <b>330</b> and a peripheral area <b>340</b> surrounding the display area <b>330</b>. A transparent electrode layer <b>303</b> is formed on a first substrate <b>301</b>. The transparent electrode layer <b>303</b> may be formed from indium tin oxide (ITO) or indium zinc oxide (IZO). The portions of the transparent electrode layer <b>303</b> corresponding to the display area <b>330</b> are patterned to form the plurality of touch areas <b>310</b>. The touch areas <b>310</b> are used for a lower electrode of the in-cell capacitive induction touch structure. When the touch areas <b>310</b> of the touch display panel <b>300</b> are touched, for example, when user fingers (used for an upper electrode of the in-cell capacitive induction touch structure) touch the touch areas <b>310</b>, a capacitance is produced between the static carried by the fingers and the touch areas <b>310</b> to form the in-cell capacitive induction touch structure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, the transparent electrode layer <b>303</b> is covered with a dielectric layer <b>305</b>. In an embodiment of the invention, a color filter layer <b>311</b> can be formed on the dielectric layer <b>305</b> and then the color filter layer <b>311</b> is covered with another dielectric layer <b>307</b>. The dielectric layers <b>305</b> and <b>307</b> may be silicon oxides, silicon nitrides, organic compounds or combinations thereof. After forming the dielectric layers <b>305</b> and <b>307</b>, openings <b>321</b> and <b>323</b> are formed in the dielectric layers <b>305</b> and <b>307</b> at the peripheral area <b>340</b> respectively. The opening <b>323</b> has a size larger than the size of the opening <b>321</b>. An opening <b>320</b> comprises the openings <b>321</b> and <b>323</b> to expose the transparent electrode layer <b>303</b>.
