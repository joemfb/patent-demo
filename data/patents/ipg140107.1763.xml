<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is related to the field of orthopedic supports, and more particularly, to orthopedic supports having a splint for supporting a portion of a wearer's anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Stays or splints are commonly employed with orthopedic supports to stabilize or immobilize a joint of a wearer. Splints may be rigid for providing more support or relatively flexible for providing mobility, and frequently splints are used to support the medial and lateral sides of the joint. For instance, the medial and lateral sides of the ankle or knee commonly need to be supported due to the frequent injuries incurred from lateral forces applied to the joint. Splints may be utilized to prevent injury of a joint or to rehabilitate a joint caused by a prior injury.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Splints may be configured to provide varying degrees of support depending on the severity of the injury and the amount of mobility desired. For instance, splints for treating less serious injuries may provide less lateral stability and, thus, more mobility. While splints may be used to provide lateral stability, too much stability may sacrifice comfort and mobility for the wearer. In particular, supports that are to be used in everyday activities for treating acute or less severe injuries should provide moderate support while allowing the wearer to participate in activities without discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would therefore be advantageous to provide an orthopedic support that imparts increased comfort and/or support for the wearer without sacrificing mobility. In addition, it would be advantageous to provide an orthopedic support that includes a splint that may be easily manufactured and used for various orthopedic applications. Moreover, it would be advantageous to provide an orthopedic support that may be secured at a desired tension to achieve a desired amount of support.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above and other needs may be met by embodiments of the present invention which, in one embodiment, provides an orthopedic support for supporting a portion of a limb of the wearer. The orthopedic support generally includes a sheet of flexible material for conforming to a portion of the wearer's anatomy. The orthopedic support could be utilized for supporting a variety of limbs or portions of limbs, such as the wrist, knee, elbow, or ankle of a wearer. For example, an ankle support may be provided that includes a splint configured to be positioned on a medial side of the wearer's ankle. Thus, the splint may be configured to resist inversion of the ankle, which may prevent ankle injuries such as sprains. Surprisingly, no splint is necessary on the lateral side of the wearer's ankle. The ankle support may be ambidextrous and include an adjustable tension system coupled to the sheet of material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one embodiment, the splint has an undulating profile configured to conform to the wearer's calf, medial malleolus/subcutaneous bursa, and arch. Thus, the splint may have respective curvatures for conforming to each of the calf, medial malleolus/subcutaneous bursa, and the arch. The portion of the splint configured to conform to the arch may have varying configurations. For example, the end of the splint may be tapered. Or, the splint may have a hinged portion that is configured to provide rotation for facilitating flexion of the wearer's ankle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The splint may include a cushioning material, such as a gel, foam, air bladder, or beading configured to be oriented towards the wearer during use. The cushioning material may be applied to the splint or integrally defined on the splint. For example, a polymeric splint may be formed by injection molding and have different materials of varying durometer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The splint may be secured to the sheet of material using various fastening techniques, such as hook and loop fasteners, straps, buckles, and the like. In another variation, a strapping system may be integrated with a tension system for the sheet of material. For example, the strapping system may include one or more straps having J-hooks at each of its free ends that are configured to engage a tension system such that tightening of the tension system results in tightening of the straps. Alternatively, the splint may be inserted within a pocket defined between sheets of material. The pocket may be located on an inner surface of the sheet of material and include an opening or slit for receiving the splint. There may be a pair of pockets on the sheet of material such that the splint may be interchangeable for ambidextrous use.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to additional aspects, the orthopedic support may include an adjustable tension system that is coupled to the sheet of material and configured to secure the sheet of material about the portion of the wearer's anatomy. For instance, the adjustable tension system may be configured to tension the sheet of material so as to draw a pair of opposing lateral edges towards one another. In addition, the adjustable tension system may be located at any desired position when the orthopedic support is worn, such as a dorsal, palmar, medial, lateral, posterior, or anterior portion of the wearer's anatomy. Furthermore, the orthopedic support may include one or more adjustable tension systems.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the adjustable tension system includes a tightening mechanism comprising a spool and a cable coupled to the spool and the sheet of flexible material. The tightening mechanism may be configured to rotate the spool such that rotation in a first direction winds the cable about the spool so as to increase tension in the cable and secure the sheet of flexible material on the portion of the wearer's anatomy. The orthopedic support may include a plurality of guides for guiding the cable between the lateral edges of the sheet of material. The adjustable tension system may also include a release mechanism configured to disengage the spool so as to allow rotation of the spool in a second opposite direction to unwind the cable from the spool and decrease tension in the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present invention may provide many advantages. For instance, the orthopedic support may be an ankle support capable of being used during everyday activities and for treatment of acute ankle injuries. The ankle support may include a splint that is configured to be positioned on only a medial side of the ankle and prevent inversion that may lead to ankle injuries. In particular, the curvature of the ankle support is configured to conform to the ankle so as to provide comfort, while at the same time providing support and resistance to inversion. Moreover, the splint may be ambidextrous and may be used on the medial sides of both the left and right ankles. The ankle support may incorporate an adjustable tension system that allows a wearer to achieve a desired level of support. In addition, the ankle support may include a strapping system or pocket to facilitate positioning of the splint adjacent to the wearer's ankle.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, the present invention provides an orthopedic support that includes a sheet of flexible material for wrapping about and conforming to a portion of a wearer's anatomy. The orthopedic support includes a splint configured to provide lateral stability for supporting the wearer's joint. In addition, the orthopedic support may include an adjustable tension system for securing the orthopedic support on a wearer's limb. Although reference is made to an ankle support below, the orthopedic support could be adapted for use on various limbs or portions of a limb of a wearer, such as, for example, on a wrist, knee, ankle, or elbow, back.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, an ankle support <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown. In general, the ankle support <b>10</b> includes a sheet of material <b>12</b> that is configured to extend about portions of the wearer's foot and lower leg to enclose the wearer's ankle. The sheet of material <b>12</b> may be any number of materials, such as a flexible and soft laminate material that provides moisture wicking and cushioning properties. For example, the laminate material could be a laminate of polyester, polyurethane foam, and polyester. Moreover, the sheet of material <b>12</b> may be a combination of materials, such as soft breathable material for positioning adjacent to the wearer's skin and less flexible material for providing support or reinforcement. Although the sheet of material <b>12</b> may be elastic, the sheet of flexible material could be inelastic or non-stretchable so as to facilitate tensioning of the ankle support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sheet of material <b>12</b> includes a medial portion <b>14</b> and a lateral portion <b>16</b> (note that the ankle support is ambidextrous and reference to the medial and lateral portions are for illustrative purposes only, as the ankle support may be worn on either the right or left ankle). The sheet of material <b>12</b> includes a distal edge <b>18</b> that is configured to provide an opening for receiving the wearer's foot and a proximal edge <b>20</b> for receiving the wearer's foot and ankle therethrough. The sheet of material <b>12</b> also includes a pair of lateral edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> that may be drawn towards one another as the adjustable tension system <b>50</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or <b>1</b>B) applies tension to the ankle support <b>10</b>. Moreover, the ankle support <b>10</b> could include a connector sheet <b>62</b> or tongue configured to extend at least partially between the lateral edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The connector sheet <b>62</b> may be attached along a portion or the entire length of the lateral edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Moreover, the sheet of material <b>12</b> may also include a heel opening <b>26</b> for receiving the wearer's heel and/or malleolus openings <b>28</b> for receiving the medial and lateral malleolus.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the ankle support <b>10</b> further includes a splint <b>30</b> coupled to the sheet of material <b>12</b> for providing stability. The splint <b>30</b> is positioned on the medial portion <b>14</b> of the sheet of material <b>12</b>. The splint <b>30</b> has an undulating profile between its proximal and distal ends for conforming to the ankle joint. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that the splint <b>30</b> includes a first portion <b>32</b> having a convex curvature for conforming to the calf, a second portion <b>34</b> having a concave curvature for conforming to the medial malleolus and subcutaneous bursa, and a third portion <b>36</b> having a concave curvature for conforming to the arch. The combination of the wearer's foot, leg, and splint <b>30</b> provides a generally triangular geometry that resists inversion or outward rotation of the ankle without the need for a splint on the lateral side of the wearer's ankle. Thus, the splint <b>30</b> is capable of providing increased comfort and decreased pressure on the calf, medial malleolus/subcutaneous bursa, and arch, while also preventing the ankle from inverting and potentially resulting in an ankle injury.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> demonstrates that the splint <b>30</b> may have a rectangular configuration in plan view. However, the splint <b>30</b> may have various configurations. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows that the third portion <b>36</b> may be tapered to decrease pressure on the arch, which may be indicated for those having pes planus or fallen arches. The splint <b>30</b> could also be curved rather than rectangular along its length, such by as having a slight curvature at its distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows that the third portion <b>36</b> may be pivotably connected to the second portion <b>34</b> at a joint or hinge <b>38</b>. Thus, as the wearer's foot flexes during use, the third portion <b>36</b> pivots at the joint <b>38</b>, which may allow the wearer to have a more natural gait. The second <b>34</b> and third <b>36</b> portions may be configured to pivot to various angles with respect to another (e.g., 0-270&#xb0;). In order to facilitate pivoting between the second <b>34</b> and third <b>36</b> portions, slots <b>40</b> may be defined in the second <b>34</b> and third <b>36</b> portions. The slots <b>40</b> may be defined such that the second <b>34</b> and third <b>36</b> portions are positioned proximate or adjacent to one another and may rotate without interference. The joint <b>38</b> could be any suitable device capable of securing the second <b>34</b> and third <b>36</b> portions together while also allowing pivoting therebetween. For instance, the joint <b>38</b> could be a rivet or similar fastener secured in holes <b>41</b> defined in the second <b>34</b> and third <b>36</b> portions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The splint <b>30</b> may be various materials that are capable of obtaining an undulating profile and provide adequate support. For instance, the splint <b>30</b> could be a metallic (e.g., aluminum), polymeric (e.g., nylon), or composite (e.g., carbon fiber) material, as well as combinations thereof. Moreover, the splint <b>30</b> may be formed using different techniques such as injection molding or compression molding or a combination of techniques, such as punching or stamping a metallic splint and bending the splint to a desired curvature. Furthermore, the splint <b>30</b> may be various sizes for accommodating different sizes and could also be custom molded for specific wearers.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The splint <b>30</b> may include a cushioning material, such as a gel, foam, air bladder, or beading configured to be oriented towards the wearer's skin during use so as to increase the comfort and provide pressure relief. The cushioning material may be applied to the splint, such as with an adhesive, or integrally defined on the splint. For example, a polymeric splint may be formed by injection molding and have different materials of varying durometer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The splint <b>30</b> may be secured to the sheet of material <b>12</b> using various techniques. For example, the splint <b>30</b> may be secured to the sheet of material <b>12</b> using hook and loop fasteners, straps, buckles, and the like. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> show that a plurality of non-elastic bands may be secured to the medial portion <b>14</b> of the sheet of material <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows that the non-elastic bands <b>42</b> are configured to receive the splint <b>30</b> and secure the splint to the sheet of material <b>12</b>. Although three non-elastic bands <b>42</b> are shown, there may be any number of bands, such as two or more. Moreover, to facilitate ambidextrous use, the ankle support <b>10</b> may include non-elastic bands <b>42</b> or other securing technique on both the medial <b>14</b> and lateral <b>16</b> portions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, the splint <b>30</b> may be inserted within a pocket <b>44</b> defined between sheets of material <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. The pocket <b>44</b> may be located on an inner surface of the sheet of material <b>12</b> and include an opening or slit <b>46</b> for receiving the splint <b>30</b>. There may be a pair of pockets <b>44</b> defined between sheets of material <b>12</b> such that the splint <b>30</b> may be interchangeable for ambidextrous use as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. The pocket <b>44</b> could also be defined on the outer surface of the sheet of material <b>12</b> and could be formed using various techniques, such as sewing, RF welding, or otherwise securing the pocket on the sheet of material <b>12</b>. When formed between two sheets of material <b>12</b>, the pocket <b>44</b> could also be sectioned off to define the pocket for receiving a splint <b>30</b> using similar techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a strapping system <b>46</b> that may be used to secure the splint <b>30</b> to the sheet of material <b>12</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The strapping system <b>46</b> may include one or more straps <b>47</b> having hooks <b>48</b> at each of its free ends, wherein the hooks may be J-shaped. The splint <b>30</b> may have guides <b>49</b> for receiving respective straps <b>47</b>. There may be any number of straps <b>47</b> employed to secure the splint <b>30</b> to the sheet of material <b>12</b>, such as two or more. According to one embodiment, the strapping system <b>46</b> may be integrated with an adjustable tension system <b>50</b>, which is explained in further detail below. The hooks <b>48</b> may be configured to engage the tensioning system <b>50</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) such that tightening of the tensioning system results in tightening of the straps <b>47</b>, thereby securing the splint <b>30</b> to the sheet of material <b>12</b>. For instance, the hooks <b>48</b> may be configured to engage a cable <b>56</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) integrated with the tension system. Thus, by adjusting the tension in the cable <b>56</b> with the tension system <b>50</b>, the tension in the straps <b>47</b> also adjusts such that the wearer is able to increase or decrease the level of support provided by the splint <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the ankle support <b>10</b> includes an adjustable tension system <b>50</b> for securing the sheet of material <b>12</b> to the wearer's ankle for supporting the ankle. In general, the adjustable tension system <b>50</b> includes a tightening mechanism <b>52</b> for securing the ankle support <b>10</b> to a portion of a wearer's anatomy and a release mechanism <b>54</b> for facilitating removal of the ankle support. The adjustable tension system <b>50</b> may be used to adjust the amount of support desired by a wearer. The adjustable tension system may also maintain the ankle support <b>10</b> in a ready-to-wear configuration, such that the support may be readily positioned and secured on the wearer's ankle. Furthermore, the tension system <b>50</b> may allow the wearer to apply even tension throughout the ankle support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tightening mechanism <b>52</b> may be a thumbwheel or other mechanism that may be rotated by the wearer in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to apply tension to the ankle support <b>10</b>. For example, the tightening mechanism <b>52</b> could include a spool to wind cable <b>56</b> thereabout. The release mechanism <b>54</b> may be a spool cover or similar mechanism configured to be depressed so as to disengage the tightening mechanism, which releases tension in the cable <b>56</b>. The tension in the cable <b>56</b> may cause the spool to spin freely and unwind the cable until there is no tension left in the cable. Thus, the release mechanism <b>54</b> may allow the wearer to release tension in the cable <b>56</b> wound about the spool so as to facilitate removal of the ankle support <b>10</b>. It is understood that alternative release mechanisms <b>54</b> may be utilized in alternative embodiments. For example, tension in the cable <b>56</b> could be released by rotating the tightening mechanism <b>52</b> in an opposite direction than that which the cable is wound about the spool.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively, there may be two tightening mechanisms <b>52</b>, one engaging a cable <b>56</b> controlling the tension of the top portion of the brace and one engaging a cable <b>56</b> controlling the tension of the bottom portion of the brace. This embodiment will allow the user to independently adjust the tension in the top and bottom portions of the brace. Both tightening mechanisms <b>52</b> may be present on the anterior or posterior portion of the brace. Alternatively, one tightening mechanism <b>52</b> may be present on the anterior and one on the posterior portion of the brace.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The cable <b>56</b> may be any suitable strand, lace, solid wire or polymer, monofilament material, or multifilament material that could be woven or braided. In addition, the cable <b>56</b> may be coated to increase its slidability and durability, such as with a polymeric coating. One or both ends of a cable <b>56</b> may be coupled to the tightening mechanism <b>52</b>, and the ankle support <b>10</b> may incorporate one or more cables. Alternatively, one or both ends of the cable <b>56</b> may be coupled to the ankle support <b>10</b> and wound about the spool rather than being directly coupled to the spool.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ankle support <b>10</b> may also include a plurality of guides <b>59</b>. The guides <b>59</b> may be cylindrical and hollow as well as configured to slidably receive the cable <b>56</b> therethrough. The guides <b>59</b> may be configured to guide the cable <b>56</b> at various locations on the sheet of material <b>12</b>. For instance, the guides <b>59</b> may be configured to create opposing points at one or more locations on the ankle support <b>10</b> in order to create tension in the cable <b>56</b>. Thus, a series of guides <b>59</b> may be used in any desired configuration to create even tension along the ankle support <b>10</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate that the guides <b>59</b> may be arranged along the lateral edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the sheet of material <b>12</b> so that the cable <b>56</b> extends in a crisscross pattern on the ankle support <b>10</b>. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that a circumferential guide <b>58</b> may extend about the sheet of material <b>12</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> demonstrate that the cable <b>56</b> may extend through the sheet of material <b>12</b> or have a circumferential guide positioned within the sheet of material between an inner and outer layer. The guides <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> could be secured to the ankle support <b>10</b> using various techniques, such as by injection molding or adhering the posts directly onto the sheet of material. Furthermore, the guides <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> could be various sizes and configurations, such as hooks, loops, or the like that are configured to receive the cable <b>56</b> and guide the cable about the sheet of material <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to one aspect, the ankle support <b>10</b> may include one or more cable guides <b>60</b> having an opening for receiving the cable <b>56</b> and guiding the cable between the lateral edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The cable guides <b>60</b> may be secured to the connector sheet <b>62</b> or may be held in position simply be threading the ends of the cable <b>56</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The adjustable tension system <b>50</b> may be attached to various locations on the sheet of material <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, and <b>6</b>, for example, the tension system <b>50</b> is positioned on a posterior portion of the sheet of material <b>12</b>, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> the tension system is located on the anterior portion of the ankle support <b>10</b>. The adjustable tension system <b>50</b> could be attached to any other desired location on the sheet of material <b>12</b>, such as the medial <b>14</b> and/or lateral <b>16</b> portions. Moreover, the ankle support <b>10</b> could include a connector sheet <b>62</b> or tongue configured to extend at least partially between the lateral edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and the adjustable tension system <b>10</b> could be attached to the connector sheet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>.</p>
