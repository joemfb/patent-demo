<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to security laminates and articles having retroreflective microspheres.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Documents of value such as passports, identification cards, driver's licenses, entry passes, ownership certificates, financial instruments, and the like, are often assigned to a particular person by personalization data. Personalization data, often present as printed images, can include photographs, signatures, fingerprints, personal alphanumeric information, and barcodes, and allows human or electronic verification that the person presenting the document for inspection is the person to whom the document is assigned. There is widespread concern that forgery techniques can be used to alter the personalization data on such a document, thus allowing non-authorized people to pass the inspection step and use the document in a fraudulent manner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A number of security features have been developed to help authenticate a document of value or object of value, thus assisting in preventing counterfeiters from altering, duplicating or simulating a document of value or object of value. Some of these security features may include overt security features or covert security features. Overt security features are features that are easily viewable to the unaided eye. Such features may include holograms and other diffractive optically variable images, embossed images, and color-shifting films. In contrast, covert security features include images only visible under certain conditions, such as inspection under light of a certain wavelength, polarized light, or retroreflected light. One example of a laminate that may include both overt and covert security features is 3M Confirm&#x2122; Security Laminate, which is commercially available from 3M Company of St. Paul, Minn. This security laminate may be used with documents of value, such as identification cards, badges, and driver licenses, or objects of value, and assists in providing identification, authentication, and to help protect against counterfeiting, alteration, duplication, and simulation. Another example of a laminate that includes both overt and covert security features is illustrated in U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2003/0170425 A1 &#x201c;Security Laminate&#x201d; (Mann et al.). Examples of some other devices are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,801,183 and 4,688,894.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO 09/105,142 describes an example of a security laminate which includes a first substrate having a first major surface and a second major surface. A plurality of retroreflective elements are affixed along the first major surface of the substrate. The retroreflective elements include a solid spherical core having an outer core surface, and the outer core surface provides a first interface. The retroreflective elements also include a first complete concentric optical interference layer having an inner surface overlying the core surface and an outer surface, the outer surface of the first complete concentric optical interference layer providing a second interface. The retroreflective elements further include a second complete concentric optical interference layer having an inner surface overlying the outer surface of the first complete concentric optical interference layer and an outer surface, the outer surface of the second complete concentric optical interference layer providing a third interface. The security laminate is retroreflective.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 01/29587 describes an exposed-lens retroreflective article exhibiting retroreflection under dry and wet conditions. The article comprises a first set of optical elements having a first reflective layer disposed on the embedded portion of the elements. The first set contributes mainly to dry retroreflection. The article further comprises a second set of optical elements having a second reflective layer behind a spacing layer. The second set contributes mainly to wet retroreflection. In one embodiment, the first and second sets of optical elements have substantially the same average diameters, refractive index, and density.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,791 describes a pavement marking article exhibiting dry and wet reflective characteristics. The article comprises a first set of optical elements having a refractive index between 1.9 and 2.0 protruding from a binder layer having particles of specular reflective pigment. These elements mainly contribute to dry reflection. The article further comprises a second set of optical elements having a refractive index between 2.2 and 2.3 which mainly contribute to wet reflection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the commercial success of available security features has been impressive, as the capabilities of counterfeiters continue to evolve, it is desirable to further improve the ability to indicate that a security feature has been tampered with or somehow compromised to help protect against counterfeiting, alteration, duplication, and simulation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a security laminate having a transparent binder layer, a first plurality of retroreflective microspheres in a first area, and a second plurality of retroreflective microspheres in a second area. The first plurality of retroreflective microspheres and the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres protrude from the binder layer, and the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres includes dry retroreflective microspheres and the second plurality of microspheres includes wet retroreflective microspheres. Under a first condition, the brightness of the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres is greater than the brightness of the second plurality of microspheres. Under a second condition, the brightness of the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres is greater than the brightness of the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres. The first condition may include retroreflective light and a first medium exhibiting a specified refractive index in contact with the first and second pluralities of retroreflective microspheres, and the second condition may include retroreflective light and a second medium exhibiting a specified refractive index in contact with the first and second pluralities of retroreflective microspheres. The first medium may exhibit a refractive index between 1.00 and 1.20, and the second medium may exhibit a refractive index between 1.25 and 1.35. In an exemplary embodiment, the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres includes retrochromic microspheres and/or one or more concentric optical interference layers. The security laminate may further include a substrate having indicia thereon positioned below the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres and second plurality of retroreflective microspheres. A security laminate of the present invention may be used to authenticate an object to which the security laminate is attached.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Many countries have passport offices, which will issue passport booklets to applicants. Typically, a passport includes multiple pages and one of the pages within the passport booklet is printed with personalization information about the specific applicant, such as their picture, full legal name, nationality, date of birth, etc., and certain passport identifying information, such as a machine-readable zone or barcode. After the information is printed, some passport offices will apply a security laminate over the printed information to assist in identifying and authenticating the passport. This security laminate may further help to indicate that the information may have been tampered with at a later date. This lamination process usually requires special equipment using heat and pressure to laminate the security film to the printed passport page. One example of such a security film is commercially available from 3M Company based in St. Paul, Minn. as 3M Confirm&#x2122; Security Laminate. This security film includes covert images that are visible when viewed with a 3M Retroviewer, which includes a focused light, which assists in identifying and authenticating a valid passport. In addition, if a counterfeiter tries to change the printed information under the laminated security film, the 3M Confirrn&#x2122;, the film will likely be damaged, possibly destroying the covert image, and thus indicating tampering has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Security laminates and security labels may also be used to verify the authenticity of an object of value. The security laminate may assist in indicating whether the object has been tampered with or whether the object is counterfeit. A security laminate or security label may be applied to any suitable object of value, and the authenticity of the object of value may be questioned if the security laminate or security label does not provide the expected overt or covert security feature.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Security features such as retroreflective patterns can be especially useful in protecting against counterfeiting, alteration, duplication, and simulation of documents of value and objects of value, especially where the retroreflective pattern provides a covert security feature. Many retroreflective security laminates provide an image, such as a retroreflective pattern, that is considerably brighter in retroreflective lighting than non-retroreflective portions of the laminate. Using a collimated light tool, such as a 3M Retroviewer, available from 3M Company of St. Paul, Minn., the identification of such an image allows for the immediate authentication of the laminate, while the absence of the image or the presence of a modified image would indicate tampering or falsification of the laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hiding power and contrast are often viewed as significant features in retroreflective security articles. Hiding power is the ability to hide underlying indicia when viewed under retroreflective lighting. The ability of retroreflective microspheres to hide indicia is related to the retroreflective brightness exhibited by the retroreflective microspheres under a particular condition. Indicia positioned below retroreflective microspheres may be partially or completely unreadable due to the retroreflective brightness of the microspheres, in which case the indicia is said to be hidden. Contrast is exhibited by a laminate that has areas of retroreflective microspheres over portions of the laminate such that when the laminate is viewed under retroreflective light, the reflection from the areas containing the retroreflective microspheres is significantly brighter than from the non-retroreflective areas of the laminate. Contrast can also be exhibited by a laminate containing different types of retroreflective microspheres wherein the different type of retroreflective microspheres reflect light differently under different viewing conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Poor hiding power may make authentication difficult, if data interferes with a retroreflective pattern and background, for example, or if a switching effect described herein is difficult to observe. Poor contrast, such as low retroreflective intensity or color difference relative to the background, for example, refers to a retroreflective pattern that is less discernable, and which may make authentication more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A security laminate or security label according to the present invention may be used with any suitable article. For example, security laminates and labels according to the present invention may be used with pharmaceuticals, chemical products, and electrical accessories packaged in paper board cartons or containers, bottles, squeeze tubes, LDPE and HDPE containers, and polybags, for example. Security laminates and labels may also be used with, for example, automotive parts and packaging, printing components such as cartridges, ribbons, printers and printer components, or computers and computer accessories, mobile phones and personal devices. Documents and articles of value including personalization data may also be secured using a security laminate or security label according to the present invention. Such items may include drivers' licenses, passports, license plates, insurance documents, and other certificates, security documents, or documents of value.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The retroreflective brightness of a beaded construction can depend strongly on the refractive index of the bead and the medium that light incident on the bead enters from. When the bead is exposed to dry conditions (e.g. air) the principles of optics predict the optimum refractive index for a microsphere having a specular reflector to be about 1.9 to 1.93. However when the microsphere surface is covered with water, the optimum refractive index is predicted to be much higher (2.55 to 2.65). Thus, by using a mixture of about 1.9 refractive index and about 2.55 to 2.65 refractive index microspheres with specular reflectors coated thereon, retroreflection in both dry and wet conditions can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention provides a security laminate having features that protect against counterfeiting, alteration, duplication, and simulation. In a first embodiment, a security laminate has a transparent binder layer, a first plurality of retroreflective microspheres in a first area, and a second plurality of retroreflective microspheres in a second area. The first plurality of retroreflective microspheres and the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres may, for example, include dry retroreflective microspheres and wet retroreflective microspheres, respectively. The first plurality of retroreflective microspheres and the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres affect incident light differently and thus, under different conditions, appear different to a viewer, as described below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>through <b>4</b><i>c</i>. As a result, the security laminate according to the present invention exhibits a &#x201c;switching effect,&#x201d; which may be observed by a viewer to authenticate an article to which the security laminate is affixed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a first exemplary embodiment, the switching effect provided by a security laminate is observed when, under a particular condition, the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres hide indicia below the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres, while indicia under the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres may remain viewable, and under a different condition, the effects are switched. That is, under the different condition, the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres will hide indicia below the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres, while indicia under the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres remains viewable.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a second exemplary embodiment, under a particular condition, the brightness of the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres is greater than the brightness of the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres. Under a different condition, the brightness of the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres is greater than the brightness of the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A viewer may authenticate an article to which a security laminate of the present invention is attached by observing this switching effect that occurs when the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres switches from at least partially hiding indicia below the first plurality of microspheres, for example, or switching from a high retroreflective brightness to a low or no retroreflective brightness, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a second exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a security laminate having a transparent binder layer and a plurality of retroreflective microspheres including dry retroreflective microspheres and wet retroreflective microspheres positioned in the same area of the security laminate. At least a portion of the plurality of retroreflective microspheres may comprise one or more concentric optical interference layers. The area of the security laminate having a plurality of such retroreflective microspheres exhibits different colors under different conditions, as described herein in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>through <b>6</b><i>c</i>. As a result, the area of the security laminate exhibits a switching effect by exhibiting a color or is transparent to a viewer under a first condition and a different color to the viewer under a second condition. A viewer may authenticate an article to which the security laminate is affixed by observing the switching effect described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides an illustrative embodiment of a retroreflective microsphere <b>100</b> that may be used with the security laminate of the present invention. The retroreflective microsphere <b>100</b> includes a transparent bead <b>110</b> that is substantially spherical. Light is reflected at interfaces between materials possessing different refractive indexes, for example, materials having a difference in refractive indexes of at least 0.1. A sufficient difference in the refractive indexes of the transparent bead <b>110</b> and a medium from which the retroreflective microsphere is protruding from may result in a reflection at first interface <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Incident light <b>130</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is directed at retroreflective microsphere <b>100</b>. A portion of the incident light <b>130</b> may be reflected at first interface <b>116</b>. Retroreflection results from the portion of incident light <b>130</b> that enters the transparent bead <b>110</b> and is focused by refraction onto the opposite side of the transparent bead <b>110</b>. The refracted light <b>135</b> encounters first interface <b>116</b> at the back of transparent bead <b>110</b>, some of refracted light <b>135</b> may be reflected back as reflected light <b>140</b> towards the front of the retroreflective microsphere <b>100</b> where it ultimately emerges from the retroreflective microsphere as retroreflected light <b>150</b> in a direction that is substantially anti-parallel to incident light <b>130</b>. A portion of incident light may not be reflected in the manner described but passes entirely through the transparent bead <b>110</b> (not shown). Another portion of the incident light may be reflected from the front surface of the retroreflective microsphere and never enters the transparent bead (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A security laminate according to the present invention may include retroreflective microspheres having one or more concentric optical interference layers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides an exemplary embodiment of a retroreflective microsphere having two concentric optical interference layers that may be incorporated in the security laminate of the present invention. The retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> includes a transparent bead <b>210</b> that is substantially spherical and has thereon a first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b>. The transparent bead <b>210</b> contacts first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> at a first interface <b>216</b>. A second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> overlies the first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b>. Second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> has an interior surface that contacts the exterior or outermost surface of first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b>, forming a second interface <b>226</b> and an exterior surface that forms the outermost surface of the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> and provides a third interface <b>224</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> and the second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> are substantially uniform over the surface of the transparent bead <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Light is reflected at interfaces between materials possessing different refractive indexes, for example, materials having a difference in refractive indexes of at least 0.1. A sufficient difference in the refractive indexes of the transparent bead <b>210</b> and first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> may result in a first reflection at first interface <b>216</b>. Similarly, a sufficient difference in the refractive indexes of first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> and second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> may result in a second reflection at second interface <b>226</b>. A sufficient difference in the refractive indexes of the second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> and any medium such as a gas, liquid, solid, or vacuum, contacting the second concentric optical interface layer <b>222</b> may result in a third reflection at the third interface <b>224</b> of the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Incident beam of light <b>230</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as being directed at retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b>. Incident light <b>230</b> is largely transmitted through both the second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> and the first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> and enters the transparent bead <b>210</b>. A portion of the incident light <b>230</b> may be reflected at third interface <b>224</b> or at second interface <b>226</b> or first interface <b>216</b>. Retroreflection results from the portion of incident light <b>230</b> that enters the transparent bead <b>210</b> and is focused by refraction onto the opposite side of the transparent bead <b>210</b>. The refracted light <b>235</b> encounters first interface <b>216</b> at the back of transparent bead <b>210</b>, some of refracted light <b>235</b> is reflected back as reflected light <b>240</b> towards the front of the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> where it ultimately emerges from the retroreflective microsphere as retroreflected light <b>250</b> in a direction that is substantially anti-parallel to incident light <b>230</b>. Similarly, another portion of the focused light passes through the first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> and is reflected back as reflected light <b>242</b> at second interface <b>226</b>. Reflected light <b>242</b> ultimately emerges from the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> as retroreflected light <b>252</b> in a direction that is substantially anti-parallel to incident light <b>230</b>. Still another portion of the focused light passes through both of the concentric optical interference layers <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> and is reflected back at third interface <b>224</b> as reflected light <b>244</b>. The exterior surface of the second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> forms third interface <b>224</b> with the medium in which the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> is disposed, such as a gas, liquid, solid, or vacuum. Reflected light <b>244</b> ultimately emerges from the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> as retroreflected light <b>254</b> in a direction that is substantially anti-parallel to incident light <b>230</b>. A portion of incident light is not reflected in the manner described but passes entirely through the concentrically coated bead (not shown). Another portion of the incident light is reflected from the front surface of the retroreflective microsphere and never enters the transparent bead (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Interference between reflected light <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> and in turn retroreflected light <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> may give rise to a change in intensity or color of the retroreflected light. A plurality of retroreflective microspheres, such as retroreflective microspheres <b>200</b>, can provide bright retroreflection, including high coefficient of retroreflection, and/or retrochromic properties that enhance the appearance of an article or provide a desirable covert color, design, message or the like. A desired interference effect can be obtained by manufacturing the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> with concentric optical interference layers <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> of different materials and by selecting the thicknesses and refractive indexes of those materials so that the aforementioned retroreflected light <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> desirably interfere with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the materials, thicknesses and refractive indexes for the concentric optical interference layers <b>212</b> and <b>222</b>, and retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> can provide retroreflected light <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> that is brighter than retroreflected light, in the form of higher coefficient of retroreflection, for example, from uncoated beads, for example. Constructive interference between reflected light <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> and in turn retroreflected light <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> gives rise to increases in the brightness or intensity of the retroreflected light, for example visible retroreflected light. In some embodiments, coating thicknesses for the two optical interference layers can be optimized to provide maximum retroreflectivity when the layers are alternating layers of silica and titania and where the transparent bead comprises a glass bead having a diameter measuring from about 30 &#x3bc;m to about 90 &#x3bc;m. In such embodiments, a first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> of silica having a thickness between about 85 and 115 nm, and typically about 110 nm, and a second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> of titania having a thickness between about 45 nm and 125 nm, and typically about 60 nm, has provided significantly enhanced coefficient of retroreflection (Ra) when the retroreflective elements are partially embedded as a monolayer in acrylate adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Reflection of light at an interface between materials is dependent on the difference in the refractive indexes of the two materials. Materials for the transparent beads and the optical interference layers may be selected from any of a variety of materials, as described herein. The materials may be selected to provide a sufficient difference in refractive indexes between that of the transparent bead <b>210</b> and first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b>, between the first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> and second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b>, and between the second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b> and a medium which the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> is exposed to, for example. Each of these differences should be at least about 0.1. In some embodiments, each of the differences between the adjacent layers should be at least about 0.2. In other embodiments, the differences are at least about 0.3, and in still other embodiments, the differences are at least about 0.5. The refractive index of first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b> may be either greater than or less than the refractive index of transparent bead <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the choice of refractive index, and the corresponding choice of materials used, will be determined by the medium that contacts the exposed surface of the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> to form third interface <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The refractive indexes of transparent bead <b>210</b>, first concentric optical interference layer <b>212</b>, second concentric optical interference layer <b>222</b>, the binder layer in contact with the retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b>, and the medium that contacts the exposed surface of retroreflective microsphere <b>200</b> are desirably selected to control the focal power of the retroreflective element as well as the strength of reflections from interfaces <b>216</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Completely concentrically coated retroreflective microspheres with an exposed surface contacted by air and a rear surface surrounded by a medium having a refractive index of about 1.55, such as a polymer binder, and illuminated with white light, the photopically weighted net intensity of reflected light, to the extent that it is determined by the sequence of transmission and reflection events for antiparallel rays of retroreflected light as they enter and leave the retroreflective element, can vary with coating thickness or thicknesses. The term &#x201c;photopically weighted net intensity of reflected light&#x201d; refers to the relative fraction of white light intensity, weighted by the luminosity function, that remains after incident light on a retroreflective element is partially transmitted into the retroreflective element, partially reflected at the back of the retroreflective element, and partially transmitted upon leaving the retroreflective element antiparallel to the incident light direction, accounting only for losses of intensity that result from interfacial reflections and interference effects. When a thin single interference layer of a given material is chosen resulting in a certain index difference at each of the two reflecting interfaces, for example, silica on a 1.93 refractive index transparent bead, the photopically weighted net intensity of reflected light can vary by a factor of at least about 6 depending on the thickness of the coating. The photopically weighted net intensity of reflected light produced by the three interfaces established by two coating layers, for example, of amorphous silica and titania on a 1.93 refractive index transparent bead, can vary by a factor of at least 12, depending on the exact thickness of the two concentric coatings. For some choices of coatings and thicknesses, the photopically weighted net intensity of reflected light can be reduced versus an uncoated retroreflective element.</p>

Under a different condition, the brightness of the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres <b>420</b> is greater than the brightness of the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres <b>410</b>. In essence, a viewer observes a switching effect when the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres exhibit a brightness greater than the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres, due to its effect on incident light under a particular condition, and switches to exhibit a brightness less than the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres due to its effect on incident light under a different condition.</p>

When viewed under ambient or diffuse lighting, the first and second plurality of retroreflective microspheres in a first area <b>430</b> and second area <b>440</b>, respectively, will appear substantially transparent. As a result, the layer below the retroreflective microspheres and binder layer is viewable.

When viewed in retroreflective mode, the retroreflective brightness of the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres <b>410</b> is greater than the retroreflective brightness of the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres. Due to the retroreflective brightness, the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres <b>410</b> at least partially hides the first portion of the indicia <b>451</b>, and the second portion of the indicia <b>452</b> is viewable.

The second plurality of retroreflective microspheres exhibit a retroreflective brightness lower than that of the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres <b>410</b> due to the refractive index of the second medium in contact with the first and second pluralities of retroreflective microspheres.

Due to the retroreflective brightness, the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres <b>420</b> at least partially hides the second portion of the indicia <b>452</b>, and the first portion of the indicia <b>451</b> is viewable.

A higher proportion of wet retroreflective microspheres may result in a switching effect that is more easily observed by a viewer.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The authenticity of a document of value, for example, to which a security laminate according to the present invention is affixed, can be determined by observing the color switching effect described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">An article may be authenticated by observing, under particular conditions, the color exhibited by the area having the plurality of retroreflective microspheres. In an exemplary method, an article may be authenticated by providing a security laminate as described herein, where an area is provided on the security laminate having a plurality of retroreflective microspheres including dry retroreflective microspheres and wet retroreflective microspheres. The color of the area having the plurality of retroreflective microspheres is observed after the security laminate is exposed to a particular condition. For example, a method according to the present invention of authenticating an article includes exposing the security laminate to a first condition and observing the area having a plurality of retroreflective microspheres for a color under the first condition, and exposing the security laminate to a second condition and observing the area having a plurality of retroreflective microspheres for a color under the second condition. The article may then be authenticated, if, under a first condition, the area of the security laminate exhibits a color, and under a second condition, the area of the security laminate exhibits a different color.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In an exemplary embodiment, the first condition includes retroreflective light and a first medium exhibiting a specified refractive index in contact with the first plurality of retroreflective microspheres, and the second condition includes retroreflective light and a second medium exhibiting a specified refractive index in contact with the second plurality of retroreflective microspheres. The first medium may be air, or any other suitable medium exhibiting a refractive index between 1.00 and 1.20, for example. The second medium may be water, Fluorinert Electronic Liquid FC-43, available from 3M Company of St. Paul, Minn., or any other suitable medium exhibiting a refractive index between 1.25 and 1.35.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In all embodiments of a security laminate or method of authenticating an article described herein, the ability to observe a switching effect under particular conditions is increased with increased retroreflective brightness of the retroreflective microspheres. The ability of a retroreflective microsphere to hide indicia, for example, positioned below the microsphere, is also increased with increased retroreflective brightness. Materials, thicknesses and refractive indexes for the retroreflective microsphere or the one or more complete concentric optical interference layers may be selected to provide higher retroreflective brightness. Retroreflective microspheres having one or more complete concentric optical interference layers typically exhibit higher retroreflective brightness than uncoated microspheres. Constructive interference between reflected light from the microsphere, for example reflected light <b>240</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>242</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and in turn retroreflected light <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> and <b>254</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> gives rise to increases in the brightness or intensity of the retroreflected light. In some embodiments coating thickness of the complete concentric optical interference Layers can be optimized to provide maximum retroreflectivity. For example, an exemplary embodiment may include three alternating optical interference layers of silica, titania, and silica. The microsphere may be a glass bead having a diameter measuring between approximately 30 &#x3bc;m and 90 &#x3bc;m and having a refractive index between approximately 1.90 and 1.95. In this embodiment, a first optical interference layer may be of silica having a thickness between approximately 95 nm and 120 nm, a second optical interference layer of titania having a thickness between approximately 45 nm and 80 nm, and a third optical interference layer of silica having a thickness between approximately 70 nm and 115 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The construction of retroreflective microspheres may influence whether the retroreflective microspheres exhibit a retrochromic effect. For example, retroreflective microspheres including two complete concentric optical interference layers on a transparent bead having a refractive index of approximately 1.9 may produce significant color when viewed in retroreflective mode where the first complete concentric optical interference layer is silica of a thickness of approximately 110 nm and the second complete concentric optical interference layer is titania of a thickness approximately between 100 nm and 215 nm. Where the titania layer is less than 100 nm, little or no color is observed. It will be appreciated that other materials and constructions of retroreflective microspheres will also provide color or enhanced retroreflective brightness in addition to the foregoing constructions. All such embodiments, in addition to other embodiments described herein, are suitable to be included with a security laminate according to the present invention. The presence of color may increase contrast making the switching effects described herein more apparent and thus facilitating authentication of an article.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The distance from which a security laminate according to the present invention is observed may affect the ability to view the retroreflective brightness and color described herein. In an exemplary embodiment, the retroreflective brightness and color described herein are best observed at a distance of approximately 4 to 6 inches from the security laminate. At significantly greater distances, for example, a distance of several feet, the retroreflective brightness of the security laminate, for example, or the hiding effect described herein, will appear less pronounced. The ability to easily observe the retroreflective brightness and associated switching effect described herein is related to the collimation of the light incident upon the security laminate. If the security laminate is illuminated with highly collimated light, and viewed at an angle close to the angle of illumination, the retroreflective effects described herein may be more easily observed and at greater distances.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In addition to the aforementioned benefits of individual features of a security laminate according to the present invention, security laminates of the present invention provide several benefits unaddressed by traditional security laminates. The security laminate exhibits a switching effect that may be used to authenticate documents of value and other articles. The switching effect may be apparent when water, or another suitable medium, is applied to the security laminate and viewed in retroreflective mode. The security of the article to which the security laminate is affixed is enhanced both by the presence of the covert switching effect as well as the application of water, or other suitable liquid. Application of water to authenticate documents of value may result in damage to a document, for example, having a paper or multilayer substrate. As a result, a security laminate having a security feature incorporating the use of water or other suitable liquid would thus not be suspected by potential counterfeiters.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The security laminate of the present invention may provide a low-cost security laminate with a defined life span. The security laminate provides a low-cost authentication tool for preventing counterfeiting, altering, duplicating or simulating of a document or object of value that may be suitable for single or multi-use applications. Tampering of the security laminate may be readily apparent if the appropriate switching effect is not observed during authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The operation of the present invention will be further described with regard to the following detailed examples. These examples are offered to further illustrate the various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques. It should be understood, however, that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The following procedures were employed for all examples. In the examples, all items identified as &#x2018;3M&#x2019; are available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Procedure 1: Preparation of Retroreflective Beads</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Retroreflective elements with multiple complete concentric optical interference layers were formed by depositing metal oxide (titania or silica) coatings onto transparent bead cores using an atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition process (APCVD). Specifics regarding the bead coating process are in accord with the process disclosed in WO 09/105,142, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. Multiple coatings were deposited by repeating the procedure for samples of retroreflective microspheres (beads) having previously deposited coatings.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Procedure 2: Retroreflected Brightness Measurement</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The brightness of the light retroreflected (coefficient of retroreflection (Ra)) from a layer of beads was determined. A single uniform layer of beads were made by sprinkling beads onto an adhesive tape. Sample constructions were prepared by manually pressing and partially embedding the beads in the adhesive of a transparent tape (3M Scotch 375 Clear Tape), and placing the tape, bead side up, on top of a sheet of paper having a dark (black) background. Beads were typically embedded so that on an average slightly less than 50% of the microsphere diameter was embedded in the adhesive of the tape. The coefficient of retroreflection in Cd/m<sup>2</sup>/lux was determined according to the procedure established in Procedure B of ASTM Standard E 809-94a (Jan. 1, 2008), measured at an entrance angle of &#x2212;4.0 degrees and an observation angle of 0.2 degrees. Measurements of retroreflected brightness under &#x2018;dry&#x2019; condition were conducted with the samples exposed to ambient air. Measurements of retroreflected brightness under &#x2018;wet&#x2019; condition were made by applying a layer of liquid over the sample so that the beads were completely covered by the liquid. For the &#x2018;wet&#x2019; condition, different liquids were used to compare the effect of refractive index. Water with a refractive index of 1.33 and 3M Fluorinert Electronic Liquid FC-43 with a refractive index of 1.29 were used.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The bead cores used in the preparation of Examples 1-3, referred to herein as Type A bead cores, were transparent glass beads having a refractive index of about 1.93, an average diameter of about 60 &#x3bc;m, and an approximate composition of 42.5% TiO<sub>2</sub>, 29.4% BaO, 14.9% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 8.5% Na<sub>2</sub>O, 3.3% B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and 1.4% K<sub>2</sub>O by weight. Examples 2-3 were prepared according to Procedure 1 and comprised multiple concentric interference layers.

Procedure 3: Dry Retrochromic Retroreflective Beads
</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Dry retrochromic retroreflective elements, hereinafter referred to as Type C beads, were prepared according to Procedure 1. Type A bead cores were coated to provide a first complete concentric optical interference layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>, a second complete concentric optical interference layer of TiO<sub>2</sub>, and a third complete concentric optical interference layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>. The individual layer thicknesses, as measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, were 100 nm 1<sup>st </sup>layer SiO<sub>2</sub>, 60 nm 2<sup>nd </sup>layer TiO<sub>2 </sub>and 100 nm 3<sup>rd </sup>layer SiO<sub>2</sub>. Samples were prepared as set forth in Procedure 2. A strong yellow color was observed in &#x2018;dry&#x2019; condition retroreflective viewing. In ambient light &#x2018;dry&#x2019; condition viewing, three-layer retroreflective elements and the Type A bead cores appeared to be colorless.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Procedure 4: Wet Retrochromic Retroreflective Beads</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Wet retrochromic retroreflective elements, hereinafter referred to as Type D beads, were prepared according to Procedure 1. Type B bead cores were coated to provide a first complete concentric optical interference layer of TiO<sub>2 </sub>and a second complete concentric optical interference layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>. The individual layer thicknesses as measured by SEM imaging were 60 nm 1<sup>st </sup>layer TiO<sub>2 </sub>and 100 nm 2<sup>nd </sup>layer SiO<sub>2</sub>. Samples were prepared as set forth in Procedure 2. A violet color was observed in retroreflective viewing for the resulting retroreflective elements when covered with a layer of water. In ambient light &#x2018;wet&#x2019; viewing condition, the coated retroreflective elements and the Type B bead cores appeared to be colorless.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Procedure 5: Extrusion Process for Substrate</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Films of Primacor 3340 ethylene acrylic acid copolymer (available from Dow Chemical Company, Midland Mich.) were produced using a cast film extrusion process. Primacor resin pellets were fed into a 1.9 cm (&#xbe; in) single screw extruder manufactured by C.W. Brabender Instruments Inc., South Hackensack, N.J., with a melt temperature of about 200&#xb0; C. (392&#xb0; F.). A horizontal die was used to cast the extruded film onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) base film approximately 15 cm (6 in) wide and 0.05 mm (0.002 in) thick traveling at approximately 3 meters/min (10 ft/min). The resulting film construction was run between a steel chill roll and a rubber backup roll to provide a resin layer having a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm (0.004 in).</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Procedure 6: Bead-Printing Process Using UV-Curable Inks</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Samples were prepared by stamp printing. A stamp was used to print retroreflective elements in an image pattern onto a substrate (substrate was sheet label stock 7708A, Self Adhesive Laser Labels from DesktopLabels, Minneapolis, Minn.). The stamp was used to print a layer of UV-curable binding resin (available under the designation &#x201c;9800CL&#x201d; from 3M Company) with no colorant added to the resin onto the substrate. Immediately following the ink printing, using any of the beads identified above, i.e. Type A beads with or without coatings, Type B beads with or without coatings, Type C beads or Type D beads, beads were carefully sprinkled over the desired regions of the ink printing to form an image pattern of retroreflective elements. The samples were then passed under a strong UV light source (American Ultraviolet Company, Lebanon Ind.) at 100 fpm, exposing the sample to 0.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Procedure 7: Bead-Printing Process Using Hot Melt Adhesive</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Samples were made by heat laminating Primacor substrate film, made per Procedure 5, using a Diletta CPL 90 (temperature set at 135&#xb0; C., speed setting of 2) onto the sheet label stock described in Procedure 6. Using any of the beads identified above, i.e. Type A beads with or without coatings, Type B beads with or without coatings, Type C beads or Type D beads, the beads were carefully sprinkled onto the resin side of the substrate to form a bead image pattern. The substrate was then heated for 45 seconds in a convection oven set at a temperature of 425&#xb0; F.</p>
