<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods and communication devices in a communication system, in particular, to methods and communication devices for signaling control information in a communication system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multi-antenna techniques may significantly increase the data rates and reliability of a wireless communication system. Performance of the system is in particular improved if both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. This use of multiple antennas results in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication channel and such systems and/or related techniques are commonly referred to as MIMO.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN), also called for LTE, is a standard that is currently under development. A core component in LTE is the support of MIMO antenna deployments and MIMO related techniques. In particular, for the downlink a spatial multiplexing mode with channel dependent precoding is supported. The spatial multiplexing mode is aimed for high data rates in favorable channel conditions. In this mode, an information carrying symbol vector S<sub>k </sub>is on the base station (eNodeB in LTE) side multiplied by an N<sub>T</sub>&#xd7;r precoder matrix denoted as
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W</i><sub>N</sub><sub><sub2>T</sub2></sub><i>&#xd7;r. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The matrix is often chosen to match the characteristics of the N<sub>R</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>T </sub>MIMO channel, where N<sub>R </sub>and N<sub>T </sub>represents the number of receive and transmit antennas, respectively. The r symbols in S<sub>k </sub>each correspond to a layer and r is referred to as the transmission rank. LTE uses OFDM and hence the N<sub>R</sub>&#xd7;1 vector received by the user equipment (UE) for a certain resource element on subcarrier k (or alternatively data resource element number k), assuming no inter-cell interference, is thus modeled by
<br/>

<br/>
where e<sub>k </sub>is a noise vector obtained as realizations of a random process.
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The UE may, based on channel measurements in the forward link, transmit recommendations to the base station of a suitable precoder to use. A single precoder that is supposed to cover a large bandwidth (wideband precoding) may be fed back. It may also be beneficial to match the frequency variations of the channel and instead feed back a frequency-selective precoding report, e.g. several precoders, one per subband.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the field of high rate multi-antenna transmission, one of the most important characteristics of the channel conditions is the so-called channel rank. Roughly speaking, the channel rank may vary from one up to the minimum number of transmit and receive antennas and characterizes how many layers the channel can support for a transmission. In conjunction with precoding, adapting the transmission to the channel rank involves using as many layers as the channel rank. This is facilitated by feedback information from the receiver to the transmitter, Such feedback information may comprise not only which precoder or precoders to use but also a recommendation of the transmission rank (possibly implicitly as part of the precoder information) and quality assessments of the layers/codewords. The latter is often referred to as CQI, Channel Quality Indication while the feedback information related to transmission rank may be referred to as rank indication (RI) which may be used in conjunction with precoder matrix indicator(s) (PMIs) to unambiguously point out one or more precoder matrices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The payload size of the feedback information may be particularly large if frequency-selective precoding is used. Several precoders/PMIs may then need to be signaled and this may lead to a large signaling overhead. In order to avoid such a large signaling overhead also for the forward link signaling (e.g. in the downlink from eNodeB to UE), it is possible for the transmitter to exploit the fact that the receiver knows what it recommended and hence, instead of explicitly signaling one or more of the recommended precoders, confirm to the receiver that the data transmission is using the same precoders and transmission rank as the receiver recommended. This is often referred to as precoder confirmation/verification and is part of the control information associated with a data transmission in the forward link.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In practice, the feed back reports are far from ideal due to time-variations of the channel and feedback delay, bit errors in the feedback link and mismatch between the assumptions on certain parameters the receiver use for computing/selecting feedback information and what the actual parameter values at the transmitter are. The scheduling bandwidth is one important example of such a parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In LTE, the User Equipment, UE, reports a single recommended rank to the base station (eNodeB in LTE) obtained by inspecting the channel quality as seen over the maximum possible scheduling bandwidth (which may have been semi-statically configured to be smaller than the system bandwidth). The actual bandwidth used when the UE is scheduled might however be considerably smaller. In scenarios with a frequency-selective channel, this means that there is a great risk that the effective rank on the scheduled bandwidth might be entirely different from the &#x201c;average&#x201d; transmission rank recommended by the UE.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of embodiments to efficiently improve the signaling between a user equipment and a base station.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments disclose a method in a second communication device for signalling control information associated with transmission of data over a wireless channel. The second communication device receives feedback data from a first communication device, wherein the feedback data comprises an indication of recommended precoders and a recommendation of a first transmission rank to possibly use during transmission of data. The second communication device further determines a second transmission rank to use for transmitting data, and transmits a confirmation message to the first communication device The confirmation message comprises a confirmation that the transmission of data from the second communication device is using at least parts of each recommended precoder associated with a frequency resource that falls within the transmission of data and comprising an indicator of the second transmission rank to use.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a basic concept of embodiments to mitigate the problems described above by adding efficient support in the forward link signaling for rank override when precoder report verification is used and in particular in conjunction with frequency-selective precoding. Such rank override support may e.g. include selecting which columns of the recommended precoder matrices to use and also the possibility to signal which layer(s)/codeword(s) should be used and additional or modified codeword to layer mappings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, a second communication device is disclosed comprising a receiving arrangement adapted to receive feedback data from a first communication device. The feedback data comprises an indication of recommended precoders and a recommendation of a first transmission rank to possibly use during transmission of data. The second communication device further comprises a control unit arranged to determine a second transmission rank to use for transmitting the data, and a transmitting arrangement adapted to transmit a confirmation message to the first communication device. The confirmation message comprises a confirmation that the transmission of data is using at least parts of each recommended precoder associated with a frequency resource that falls within the transmission of data and an indicator of the second transmission rank to use.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, embodiments disclose a method in a first communication device for setting the first communication device to an operational mode according to signaled control information associated with transmission of data over a wireless channel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first communication device determines recommended precoders and a first transmission rank to possibly use when transmitting data from a second communication device. Feedback data comprising an indication of recommended precoders and the first transmission rank to use during transmission of data is transmitted from the first communication device to the second communication device. The first communication device then receives, from the second communication device, a confirmation message comprising a confirmation that transmission of data from the second communication device is using at least parts of each recommended precoder associated with a frequency resource that falls within the transmission of data and an indicator of the second transmission rank to use. The first communication device then sets itself up in the operational mode to use the at least parts of the confirmed precoder and the second transmission rank to receive and decode transmission of data from the second communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, the confirmation message may comprise an indicator of a confirmation of precoders/precoder matrix indicators (PMI) and a transmission rank indicator (TRI) indicating a second transmission rank to be used for the associated data transmission from the second to the first device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some embodiments disclose a first communication device comprising a control unit arranged to determine recommended precoders and a first transmission rank to possibly use when transmitting data from a second communication device. The first communication device further comprises a transmitting arrangement adapted to transmit feedback data to the second communication device. The feedback data comprises an indication of the recommended precoders and the first transmission rank to possibly use during transmission. The first communication device further comprises a receiving arrangement arranged to receive, from the second communication device, a confirmation message. The confirmation message comprises a confirmation that transmission of data from the second communication device is using at least parts of each recommended precoder associated with a frequency resource that falls within the transmission of data and an indicator of the second transmission rank that is used. The control unit is further arranged to setup the first communication device in an operational mode to use the at least parts of each confirmed precoder and the second transmission rank during transmission to receive data transmission from the second communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments disclosed herein propose an efficient way to introduce support for rank override when precoder reporting verification is used. The need of rank override is believed to be common in practice so it is important that efficient support exists to keep the performance of the system high.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein a communication device may be a wireless communications device. In the context of the invention, the wireless communication device may e.g. be a node in a network such as a base station, a controller, a combination thereof or the like, a mobile phone, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) or any other type of portable computer such as laptop computer.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The wireless network between the communication devices may be any network such as an IEEE 802.11 type WLAN, a WiMAX, a HiperLAN, a Bluetooth LAN, or a cellular mobile communications network such as a GPRS network, a third generation WCDMA network, or E-UTRAN. Given the rapid development in communications, there will of course also be future type wireless communications networks with which the present invention may be embodied.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a schematic overview of a first communication device <b>10</b> communicating with a second communication device over an air interface <b>31</b> is shown. The first communication device is illustrated as a UE, such a mobile phone, PDA or the like, and the second communication device is illustrated as a base station, such as a eNodeB, NodeB or the like. It should, however, be understood that the terminology such as base station and UE should be considering non-limiting and does in particular not imply a certain hierarchical relation between the two; in general &#x201c;base station&#x201d; could be considered as the first communication device <b>10</b> and &#x201c;UE&#x201d; the second communication device <b>20</b>, and these two devices communicate with each other over some radio channel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the illustrated example, the user equipment <b>10</b>, UE, based on channel measurements in the forward link, transmits recommendations to the base station <b>20</b> of suitable precoders to use. It may be beneficial to match the frequency variations of the channel and feed back a frequency-selective precoding report, e.g. several precoders, one per subband.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Channel dependent precoding as above typically requires substantial signaling support, particularly for frequency-selective precoding. Not only is feedback signaling in the reverse link, as mentioned previously, needed, but typically also signaling in the forward link is required to indicate which precoder was actually used in the forward link transmission since the forward link transmitter might not be certain that it obtained a correct precoder report from the (forward link) receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One way of reducing the signaling overhead in the forward link is to signal some kind of precoder verification/confirmation, e.g., whether the transmitter used the same precoders as fed back by the receiver or not. A single bit could be used for this purpose; a value of 1 could mean that the transmitter follows the feed back information slavishly while a value of 0 could mean that instead another, possibly fixed precoder is used. The value zero would for example be used if the feedback information could not be correctly decoded at the transmitter. Obviously, all this assumes decoding errors in the feedback information can be detected, so the feedback information has to be coded accordingly, e.g. including a CRC, Cyclic Redundancy Check. An alternative to a fixed precoder is to signal a single &#x201c;wideband&#x201d; precoder, as exemplified in Table 1. Several variants of precoder report verification/confirmation schemes may be used. Compared with explicitly signaling the frequency-selective precoding report in the forward link, verification/confirmation approaches may substantially reduce the signaling overhead in the forward link. The table 1 below shows an example of forward link signaling to support precoder report verification. K denotes the signaled precoder-related message number in the forward link.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The encoded bits originating from the same block of information bits are referred to as a codeword. This is also the terminology used in LTE to describe the output from a single HARQ process serving a particular transport block and comprises turbo encoding, rate matching, interleaving etc. The codeword is then modulated and distributed over the antennas. It may make sense to transmit data from several codewords at once, also known as multi-codeword transmission. The first (modulated) codeword may for instance be mapped to the first two antennas and the second codeword to the two remaining antennas in a four transmit antenna system. In the above context of precoding, the codewords are mapped to layers instead of directly to the antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the field of high rate multi-antenna transmission, one of the most important characteristics of the channel conditions is the so-called channel rank. Roughly speaking, the channel rank may vary from one up to the minimum number of transmit and receive antennas. Taking a 4&#xd7;2 system as an example, i.e. a system with four transmitting antennas and two receiving antennas, the maximum channel rank is two. The channel rank varies in time as the fast fading alters the channel coefficients. Moreover, it determines how many layers, and ultimately also codewords, that may be successfully transmitted simultaneously. Hence, if the channel rank is one at the instant of transmission of two codewords mapping to two separate layers, there is a strong likelihood that the two signals corresponding to the codewords will interfere so much that both of the codewords are erroneously detected at the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In conjunction with precoding, adapting the transmission to the channel rank involves typically using as many layers as the channel rank. In the simplest of cases, each layer would correspond to a particular antenna. But the number of codewords may differ from the number of layers, as in LTE. The issue then arises of how to map the codewords to the layers. Taking the current working assumption for the 4 transmit antenna case in LTE as an example, the maximum number of codewords is limited to two while up to four layers may be transmitted. A fixed rank dependent mapping according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is used. In box B<b>1</b>, rank <b>1</b> is shown wherein one codeword CW is used and one layer L<b>1</b> is transmitted. In box B<b>2</b>, rank <b>2</b> is shown wherein two codewords CW<b>1</b>, CW<b>2</b> are used and two layers L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> are transmitted. In box B<b>3</b>, rank <b>3</b> is shown wherein two CWs CW<b>1</b>, CW<b>2</b> are used and the second CW is split into two layers L<b>21</b>, L<b>22</b> via a serial to parallel converter S/P, thereby, transmitting on three layers L<b>1</b>, L<b>21</b>, L<b>22</b>. In box <b>4</b>, rank <b>4</b> is shown wherein each CW CW<b>1</b>, CW<b>2</b> is transmitted on parallel layers via a S/P, thereby, transmitting on four layers L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>21</b>, L<b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The receiver typically feeds back not only precoder information but also a recommended transmission rank (possibly implicitly as part of the precoder information) and quality assessments of the layers/codewords. The latter is often referred to as CQI. In practice, the feed back reports are far from ideal due to time-variations of the channel and feedback delay, bit errors in the feedback link and mismatch between the assumptions on certain parameters the receiver use for computing/selecting feedback information and what the actual parameter values at the transmitter are. The scheduling bandwidth is one important example of such a parameter. Traffic patterns and limited data buffers size may constitute additional reasons for the base station to wish to use another transmission rank than what the UE has recommended. This is a problem in relation to the previously mentioned precoder confirmation functionality which does not support that the eNodeB uses another transmission rank than what the UE recommended.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The base station <b>20</b> may override the rank recommended by the UE in order to achieve some margin against the rank variations over frequency. This may be possible when explicitly signaling the precoder and rank in the downlink, i.e., forward link. However, for the precoder report verification schemes, so far they only consider to signal to the UE that the base station has followed the UE recommendation, meaning that the UE recommended precoders have to be followed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Such rank override support may e.g. include selecting which columns of the recommended precoder matrices to use and also the possibility to signal which layer(s)/codeword(s) should be used and additional or modified codeword to layer mappings. The latter may be useful even when performing rank override without precoder report confirmation/verification.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To support rank override when precoder report verification is used, additional messages may be signaled in the forward link to specify which rank to use and possibly also which layers, i.e. columns of the recommended precoder(s) to use. The principle is explained by means of examples below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Inspired by a possible use in LTE, the focus is on when precoder report verification is combined with the possibility to signal multiple precoders The case of up to two layers, for example, two Tx base station or two Tx forward link transmitters, is given in Table 2. As seen, messages give the possibility to select which column of each precoder should be used for the transmission from the Tx base station. In general, a column subset of each precoder could be specified. Another example of messages is given in Table 3 where up to 4 layers, for example, a four Tx base station or a four Tx forward link transmitter, are considered and the fixed codeword to layer mapping present in LTE is taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Messages may be coded arbitrarily, for example, by simply stating the message number or allocating separate bits for each or of some of the messages, or combinations thereof. Further, the same column numbers, that is, layers, are selected for all relevant precoders over frequency when performing rank override. This strongly limits the number of messages. Extensions may be possible where the same column numbers are not used for all the precoders.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the recommended rank is lower than the rank stated in the message, the precoder columns could conceivably be taken from the corresponding generating matrix (which always has four columns) instead of from the recommended matrices (which are column subsets of the generating matrices in LTE).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The following table 2 shows an example of a forward link signalling supporting rank override. Also in this example, k denotes the signalled precoder-related message number in the forward link.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It would also be possible to add codeword-to-layer mappings to improve rank override even further. Particularly important mappings to add are those that make the codeword to layer mapping as &#x201c;complete&#x201d; as possible. A complete mapping is loosely taken to mean a mapping in which it is always possible to override the rank downwards with as few changes of which layers a certain codeword connects to. One way to strive for that is to ensure that there are messages so that a codeword can always be transmitted by itself on the same layers as if the codeword is transmitted in conjunction with other codeword(s). Upon inspecting the codeword to layer mapping in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the mappings in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are also useful when overriding the rank in order to strive for completeness.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein examples of codeword CW to layer mappings are shown. In the illustrated examples Rank one is shown in the upper left box B<b>1</b> and Rank two is shown in the upper right box B<b>2</b>. Rank three is shown in the lower left box B<b>3</b> and Rank four is shown in the lower right box B<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> examples of codeword CW to layer mappings are shown. In the illustrated different examples of rank two, as well as rank three, are shown using different layer configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In box B<b>11</b>, rank two is shown using two layers L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>. In box B<b>12</b>, rank two is shown using two layers L<b>12</b>, L<b>21</b>. In box B<b>13</b>, rank two is shown using two layers L<b>21</b>, L<b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In box B<b>14</b>, rank three is shown using three layers L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>2</b>. In box B<b>15</b>, rank three is shown using three layers L<b>1</b>, L<b>21</b>, L<b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Some or all of the above mappings shall be available for rank override if the CQIs are reported per codeword (as opposed to per layer) as in LTE. Consider for example the codeword to layer mapping in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and assume a feedback report recommending rank four but the base station wishes to override to rank two. Since the CQI is tied to the codeword and not the layers, the base station does not know the CQI for codeword <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in the rank two case. But if we make the upper left mapping in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, B<b>11</b>, available for override, then rank override may be accomplished without introducing additional link adaptation errors due to having to split one CQI into two. In addition, a message could be added to indicate that rank override should be performed to this particular mapping.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Additional mappings and corresponding messages for the purpose of rank override could also be added to better support rank override from rank four to rank three. A simple solution would be to add the mapping where codeword <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> connect to layer L<b>11</b>+L<b>12</b> and L<b>21</b>, respectively. An alternative is to specify which layers (i.e. columns) the codeword(s) should be mapped to in the message. These messages may for example say
