<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT/SE2008/051562, filed 23 Dec. 2008, which designated the U.S., the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method and an arrangement for determining an admission control threshold for use in an admission control procedure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Presently, the usage of radio spectrum is liberalized in that frequency bands are sometimes not exclusively assigned to one particular transmission system or in that frequency bands are sometime only assigned to one particular transmission system for a limited period of time. A reason for this is that frequency bands, assigned by licenses to licensees, are often not used during certain periods. For example, one possible approach pursued in regulations is to license the frequency band, or spectrum resource, to a licensee (primary user), while at the same time allow other users, or secondary users, to use the frequency band under the condition that the secondary users do not cause harmful interference to the system operation of the primary user. In future, there will be multitude of spectrum usage regimes applied for different portions of the electro-magnetic spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first example of such a usage regime, or spectrum resource usage regime, is dedicated licensed spectrum operation, in which the licensee receives an exclusive license for using a certain spectrum portion, or frequency band, for a certain period of time in a certain region (e.g. 2G/3G cellular communication systems of today).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, a second regime is licensed spectrum operation with opportunistic spectrum access by secondary users, in which the primary user receives a non-exclusive license for using a certain spectrum portion for a certain period of time in a certain region, while other systems are allowed to use the licensed spectrum under a secondary license and/or under certain usage rules. For example, the other systems (secondary users) need to sense or detect if the licensee (primary user) is using the spectrum and if primary usage is detected, the secondary user has to withhold from or cease spectrum usage if the interference caused from the secondary system to the primary system exceeds a certain threshold (e.g. secondary usage of white space spectrum in US TV bands, as developed in IEEE 802.22).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, a third regime is licensed spectrum operation with allowance for spectrum trading, in which the licensee receives an exclusive license for using a certain spectrum portion for a certain period of time in a certain region with the option for renting out the usage of the licensed spectrum in exclusive secondary licenses. For example, a primary licensee has the spectrum usage right for a certain spectrum portion in a specific region for 20 years, but is only using the spectrum at certain time periods. The primary user can then lease the temporal/regional usage of the spectrum resources to secondary users on, for example, a yearly or monthly basis, or only during daily time periods, for example, during night.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, as a variety of the third regime, an exclusive license for using a certain spectrum portion for a certain period of time in a certain region may be provided directly by a spectrum usage regulatory body for providing spectrum licenses, which would correspond to the primary user in the example above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, a fourth regime is un-licensed spectrum operation, in which the usage of a certain spectrum portion in a certain region is allowed to any system which fulfils certain usage policies, such as maximum allowed transmission power or sharing rules.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an ad-hoc network, the network does not have an infrastructure. An exemplifying ad hoc network comprises a plurality of mobile stations, which may leave or attach to the network at will. Also, in this ad-hoc network there is a need for admission control. In order to perform admission control, one of the mobile stations needs to be configured as an admission control resource management node, a so called super node of the cluster of mobile terminals forming the ad-hoc network. Notably, admission control is hence performed in one of the mobile terminals. Alternatively, admission control may be performed in each mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the independence of spectrum usage from specific service types (e.g. broadcasting, cellular communication services), it is possible for telecommunication systems to combine the usage of a multitude of spectrum portions, as long as the corresponding spectrum usage regime for each spectrum portion is applied. In such a system, a spectrum resource aggregation function of a mobile network performs aggregation of different spectrum resources and performs common resource management for these resources. One spectrum resource can, for example, be the licensed spectrum of the operator of the mobile network with exclusive usage right according to a dedicated licensed spectrum operation, another spectrum resource can be licensed with a temporarily exclusive usage right according to a secondary license that was bought from another mobile network operator or TV broadcast operator, a third spectrum resource may be non-exclusively licensed by another system (e.g. a TV broadcast operator or a radar system) which is used by the mobile network opportunistically, and a fourth spectrum resource may be an unlicensed spectrum resource that is used by an unknown amount of systems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Throughout the disclosure of this application, the term &#x201c;spectrum-on-demand system&#x201d; shall be understood as comprising a mobile network system, which makes use of spectrum resources that are not assigned to the mobile network operator under a primary exclusive license, possibly but not necessarily, in addition to any primary spectrum resources.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a spectrum-on-demand system, the resources comprising the different resource components provided by the individual spectrum resources are managed by a common resources management unit or center. This does not exclude that further resource management functions are performed within each system resource, like for example, power control, congestion control and more. This common resource management unit includes functions like admission control of services and service allocation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Admission control is part of most communication networks. The basic functionality of admission control is to allow as many services into the system as can be supported by the spectrum resources such that the minimum service requirements are still met. If all resources are occupied, any further service requests will be rejected. The following condition needs to be fulfilled at all times:</p>

where s<sub>j </sub>is the amount of resources required for serving a session j, A<sub>t </sub>is the admission threshold denoting the maximum amount of occupied resources before admission control rejects the admittance of new services, C<sub>tot </sub>is the total capacity of resources managed by the admission control and A<sub>m </sub>is an admission control margin. The admission control threshold compensates that the amount of resources required for a service s<sub>j </sub>is not constant, as it may change e.g. with fluctuations of the radio channel due to mobility, fading or varying interference, or user mobility. An admission control margin, A<sub>m </sub>balances this uncertainty/estimation error. In addition, the admission control margin, A<sub>m </sub>can be used to account for fractional loading requirements, i.e., when a given gross capacity cannot be loaded to 100% due to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the carried traffic. The total capacity C<sub>tot </sub>depends on the resources that are allocated to the system. In mobile networks, total capacity is capacity of the spectrum resource allocated to the used access technology. Mobile networks may also combine a multitude of spectrum resources. This is, for example, the case when a mobile network operator has different spectrum licenses for different spectrum portions and uses the same access technology on multiple carriers. As a further example, a mobile network operator may have different spectrum licenses for different spectrum portions, in which it operates different access technologies like a GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network in the GSM frequency band, a UMTS Radio Access Network in the UMTS frequency band, and a LTE Radio Access Network in new IMT frequency bands. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the total capacity that is used for admission control in such a system with multiple spectrum resources is determined as the sum of the capacities of the different spectrum resources.
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Using this common admission control approach for multiple spectrum resources in a spectrum-on-demand system may cause service degradation or inefficient utilization of spectrum resources. Hence, there is a need for an improved procedure for determining the admission control threshold.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present invention is to improve reliability of a service of a spectrum on demand system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect of the invention, the object is achieved by a method for determining an admission control threshold for use in an admission control procedure of a first radio communication system. The admission control procedure manages a first spectrum resource, wherein the first spectrum resource (R<b>1</b>) has a first spectrum resource capacity and a first available spectrum resource capacity. The first available spectrum resource capacity is available for use by the first radio communication system and the first available spectrum resource capacity has a time dependence. In a step, the admission control procedure determines the admission control threshold based on the first spectrum resource capacity and a measure of the time dependence of the first available spectrum resource capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It shall be noted that the term &#x201c;capacity&#x201d; or &#x201c;spectrum resource capacity&#x201d; is intended to be interpreted as capacity of a spectrum resource, as defined by a frequency range or a bandwidth of the spectrum resource. Hence, the capacity of a spectrum resource does not vary with an amount of services using the spectrum resource. Expressed differently, the spectrum resource capacity is independent of a number of user equipments using the spectrum resource at issue. Nevertheless, an &#x201c;available capacity of a spectrum resource&#x201d;, &#x201c;available spectrum resource capacity&#x201d; or &#x201c;availability of a spectrum resource capacity&#x201d; may vary due to, for example, license agreements, as described above. Thus, available capacity of a spectrum resource may vary in time. Expressed differently, an available capacity of a spectrum resource has time dependence. In this context, the terms &#x201c;available&#x201d; and &#x201c;availability&#x201d;, when used in conjunction with capacity to form the expression &#x201c;available capacity&#x201d; and &#x201c;availability of a spectrum resource capacity&#x201d; is the spectrum resource capacity reduced by capacity occupied by other communications systems than the one at issue, i.e. the first radio communication system. The spectrum resource capacity may be occupied due to license agreements that are limited in time or usage by other communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Notably, available spectrum resource capacity is greater than (or equal to) free spectrum resource capacity, which may be used by a service of the first radio communication system. &#x201c;Equal to&#x201d; applies to the case when no services are active. For the purpose of indicating free spectrum resource capacity, the terms &#x201c;free capacity&#x201d; and &#x201c;remaining capacity&#x201d; of a spectrum resource may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect of the invention, the object is achieved by an arrangement for determining an admission control threshold for use in an admission control procedure of a first radio communication system. The admission control procedure manages a first spectrum resource, wherein the first spectrum resource has a first spectrum resource capacity and a first available spectrum resource capacity. The first available spectrum resource capacity is available for use by the first radio communication system and the first available spectrum resource capacity has a time dependence. The arrangement comprises a determining unit configured to determine the admission control threshold based on the first spectrum resource capacity and a measure of the time dependence of the first available spectrum resource capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Since the admission control threshold is determined based on the first spectrum resource capacity and a measure of the time dependence of the first available spectrum resource capacity, an improved measure of a first available spectrum resource capacity, having a time dependence (time variance), is obtained. In this manner, availability in time of the first spectrum resource capacity in addition to the capacity of the spectrum resource is taken into account when determining a total system capacity for use in an admission control procedure. Thus, it is ensured that a spectrum resource, utilized by a service, is reliably available for at least a certain period of time. Preferably, the period is long enough for a service, executed in the first radio communication system, to finish its operation. As a result, the present solution provides improved reliability of a service of a spectrum on demand system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Advantageously, the present solution provides means for how admission control may be applied to a spectrum-on-demand system, in which spectrum resources are aggregated within a mobile network, and in which spectrum resources may have different availability according to different spectrum usage regimes like opportunistic spectrum access, secondary spectrum licenses and/or un-licensed spectrum access.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplifying telecommunication system <b>100</b>, in which a plurality of spectrum resources R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b> are used by two radio communication networks <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>. The telecommunication system <b>100</b> comprises a radio resource management node <b>101</b> configured to manage a set of spectrum resources, comprising said plurality of spectrum resources R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b>. At least one of the spectrum resources has a first spectrum resource capacity and a first available spectrum resource capacity. The first available spectrum resource capacity has a time dependence. Furthermore, in this example, it is assumed that none of the spectrum resources R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b> is licensed under an exclusive license. A first radio communication network <b>130</b>, also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, comprises a first core network node <b>110</b>, a first radio base station <b>111</b> and a first communication device <b>112</b>. A second radio communication network <b>140</b>, also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, comprises a second core network node <b>120</b>, a second radio base station <b>121</b> and a second communication device <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is to be understood that the radio resource management node may be a mobile terminal, a radio base station or a dedicated radio resource management network node or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another exemplifying telecommunication system, not shown, comprises a plurality of core network nodes forming a core network. A plurality of radio access networks shares the core network, wherein each radio access network comprises a number of radio base stations. In this example, the core network may comprise, or be co-located with, the radio resource management node. Alternatively, the radio resource management node may be comprised in a management network, connecting to all nodes in the radio access network(s). Moreover, the radio resource management node may be included in one of the radio access networks, for example, as included or co-located with a radio base station. It may be preferred that the radio resource management node is directly connected to the radio base stations, not necessarily via a core network node.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a simplified combined signalling and flow chart of the system <b>100</b> in operation. The following steps may be performed. <b>210</b> Optionally, in a step <b>210</b>, the communication device <b>112</b> sends a service request to the radio resource management node <b>101</b> via the first core network node <b>110</b> and the first radio base station <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">In some embodiments, the service request may be triggered by the network, for example, in the form of an incoming multi-media session setup. In this case, the step <b>210</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the service request may be triggered by a change of the number of spectrum resources assigned to the radio resource management node <b>101</b>. For example, when a spectrum resource is added (for example, due to a short term spectrum license or the discovery of unused spectrum resources) or deleted (for example to due the expiry of a short term spectrum license or the detection of a primary spectrum user becoming active), the radio resource management node <b>101</b> will need to update the value of the admission control threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><b>220</b> In a step <b>220</b>, the radio resource management node <b>101</b> determines the admission control threshold based on the capacities of said plurality of spectrum resources and a measure of any time dependence of availability of the capacities of said plurality of spectrum resources.
<br/>
<b>230</b> In a step <b>230</b>, the radio resource management node <b>101</b> assigns at least one of said plurality of spectrum resources to the service executed in the communication device <b>112</b>, if a capacity, calculated as the sum of capacities occupied by services already allowed to access one or more of said plurality of spectrum resources, is less than the admission control threshold. Optionally, more than one spectrum resource may be assigned to a service.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments of the method in the system <b>100</b>, the first core network node <b>110</b> performs the step <b>220</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments of the method in the system <b>100</b>, it is assumed that admission control, using the proposed method of determining an admission control threshold, only is applied to services with minimum service requirements (in 3GPP terms, only services for which bearers with Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) are used).

If the primary user utilizes the spectrum only for a portion of a certain period of time, the reliability factor &#x3c1;<sub>i </sub>may be set to a percentage being determined as the ratio of the portion of the certain period of time to the certain period of time.

In this manner, chances of interference between the rotation beam and the base station is reduced further, since the rotating beam is required to be located not only merely out side the coverage area <b>604</b>, but also a certain margin distance (derivable from the margin added to the angle &#x3b1;) away from the coverage area <b>604</b>. If the rotation frequency of the beam is f, the time the radar beam needs to cross an exclusion sector being equal to (&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;)/(2*&#x3c1;i*f). A reliability factor, &#x3c1;<sub>i</sub>, would then be calculated as 1&#x2212;(&#x3b1;+&#x3b2;)/(2*&#x3c1;i).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the system accesses spectrum resources that it has leased (rented) from a primary system, having a license with allowance for spectrum trading. In this case, the reliability factor of the spectrum band will be equal to one during the time the spectrum is leased and set to zero when the leasing period expires.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a system which uses opportunistic access to the spectrum bands, i.e. uses spectrum sensing to determine if the primary user is active or not, the probability of missed detection, &#x3c1;<sub>m</sub>, should be considered when deciding on the availability of the bands. The secondary system fails in the spectrum sensing in such a way that it misses that the primary system is active in the band. The result of this will be that the secondary system will erroneously consider the band to be free for use. By weighting the fraction of time the system perceives the primary system to be active in the band, {circumflex over (&#x3c1;)}<sub>i</sub>, by a factor that compensate for the uncertainty in the detection, that is

the secondary system takes into account the possibility that spectrum usage by the primary system may be missed.

If it is then further assumed that any change to the spectrum usage pattern would be announced well in advance before becoming effective, the reliability factor would be set to one until the beginning of a certain (previously agreed) &#x201c;transition period&#x201d; that is needed/desired by the primary user e.g. in order to set up and test equipment, etc. Starting with the transition period, the reliability factor would be set to 0.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In this formula only guaranteed or reliable spectrum resources contributes to the determination of the admission control threshold. The non-reliable spectrum resources indicated by <b>310</b>, which may be time varying, are only used to increased performance of GBR and/or Non-GBR services. As a consequence, only spectrum resource capacities that are reliable at all times, i.e. are not time varying, add to the calculation of the admission control threshold. When the non-reliable spectrum resources vanish no dropping of GBR services will occur, see arrow <b>312</b>. It may be noted that this example may be considered as a special case of the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be achieved if &#x3c1;<sub>i</sub>, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, is set to zero in case that the reliability {circumflex over (&#x3c1;)}<sub>i </sub>is below a certain reliability threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is shown a further example on how the present solution may be implemented in a procedure for determining an admission control threshold and for controlling admission of a service requesting to use a spectrum resource. A<sub>t </sub>is deterministically adapted to the deterministic availability of on-demand spectrum resources, as e.g. specified in a secondary license. For example, the secondary spectrum resource may be counted as a reliable spectrum resource in a first time interval, T<sub>1</sub>-T, and its reliability is steadily decreased in the time span T before the expiry of the secondary license. In this manner, the probability of dropping of GBR services may be kept low, since the slope of A<sub>t </sub>is preferably adjusted such that most services may finish before the system runs out of spectrum resource capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, it may be preferred that A<sub>t </sub>is set to a level A<sub>1 </sub>an additional time period before the end of time period T<sub>1</sub>. Thus, the additional time period before expiry of the time period T<sub>1 </sub>provides further time for services to finish operation. Thereby, reliability of the services may be further improved.</p>
