<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Stage Application of International Patent Application No. PCT/US09/39266, filed Apr. 2, 2009, which claims the benefit of Australian Provisional Application No. 2008901586; filed Apr. 2, 2008, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to transcutaneous energy transfer in implantable medical devices and, more particularly, to an adjustable transcutaneous energy transfer system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Medical devices having one or more implantable components, generally referred to as implantable medical devices, have provided a wide range of therapeutic benefits to patients over recent decades. Implantable medical devices often include one or more instruments, apparatus, sensors, processors, controllers or other functional components that are permanently or temporarily implanted in a patient. The implanted components are used to, for example, diagnosis, monitor, or treat a disease or injury, or to modify the patient's anatomy or a physiological process. Many of these implantable components receive energy (i.e. power and/or data) from external components that are part of, or operate in conjunction with, the implantable component. Implantable hearing prostheses that treat the hearing loss of a prosthesis recipient are one particular type of implantable medical devices that are widely used today.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hearing loss, which may be due to many different causes, is generally of two types, conductive and sensorineural. In some cases, a person suffers from hearing loss of both types. Conductive hearing loss occurs when the normal mechanical pathways for sound to reach the cochlea, and thus the sensory hair cells therein, are impeded, for example, by damage to the ossicles. Individuals who suffer from conductive hearing loss typically have some form of residual hearing because the hair cells in the cochlea are undamaged. As a result, individuals suffering from conductive hearing loss typically receive an implantable hearing prosthesis that generates mechanical motion of the cochlea fluid. Some such hearing prosthesis, such as acoustic hearing aids, middle ear implants, etc., include one or more components implanted in the recipient, and are referred to herein as implantable hearing prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In many people who are profoundly deaf, however, the reason for their deafness is sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when there is damage to the inner ear, or to the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain. As such, those suffering from some forms of sensorineural hearing loss are thus unable to derive suitable benefit from hearing prostheses that generate mechanical motion of the cochlea fluid. As a result, implantable hearing prostheses that deliver electrical stimulation to nerve cells of the recipient's auditory system have been developed to provide the sensations of hearing to persons whom do not derive adequate benefit from conventional hearing aids. Such electrically-stimulating hearing prostheses deliver electrical stimulation to nerve cells of the recipient's auditory system thereby providing the recipient with a hearing percept.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As used herein, the recipient's auditory system includes all sensory system components used to perceive a sound signal, such as hearing sensation receptors, neural pathways, including the auditory nerve and spiral ganglion, and parts of the brain used to sense sounds. Electrically-stimulating hearing prostheses include, for example, auditory brain stimulators and cochlear prostheses (commonly referred to as cochlear prosthetic devices, cochlear implants, cochlear devices, and the like; simply &#x201c;cochlear implants&#x201d; herein.)</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Oftentimes sensorineural hearing loss is due to the absence or destruction of the cochlear hair cells which transduce acoustic signals into nerve impulses. It is for this purpose that cochlear implants have been developed. Cochlear implants provide a recipient with a hearing percept by delivering electrical stimulation signals directly to the auditory nerve cells, thereby bypassing absent or defective hair cells that normally transduce acoustic vibrations into neural activity. Such devices generally use an electrode array implanted in the cochlea so that the electrodes may differentially activate auditory neurons that normally encode differential pitches of sound. Auditory brain stimulators are used to treat a smaller number of recipients with bilateral degeneration of the auditory nerve. For such recipients, the auditory brain stimulator provides stimulation of the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a hearing prosthesis is provided. The cochlear implant comprises: an internal coil assembly implantable in a recipient; and an external data coil assembly positioned in a housing worn by the recipient, wherein the data coil assembly is configured to be inductively coupled to the internal coil assembly in order to transcutaneously transfer data to the internal coil assembly, wherein one or more elements of the data coil assembly are physically adjustable with respect to the housing to alter the inductive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a transcutaneous energy transfer system for an implantable medical device is provided. The system comprises: an internal coil assembly implantable in a recipient; and an external data coil assembly positioned in a housing worn by the recipient and configured to be inductively coupled to the internal coil assembly in order to transcutaneously transfer data to the internal coil assembly, wherein one or more elements of the data coil assembly are physically adjustable with respect to the housing to alter the inductive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a still other aspect of the present invention, a method for using a hearing prosthesis comprising an internal coil assembly implantable in a recipient, and an external data coil assembly positioned in a housing worn by the recipient and configured to be inductively coupled to the internal coil assembly is provided. The method comprises: receiving an indication of the strength of the inductive coupling between the data coil assembly and the internal coil assembly; and physically adjusting one or more elements of the data coil assembly with respect to the housing to alter the inductive coupling between the data coil assembly and the internal coil assembly.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Aspects of the present invention are generally directed to a transcutaneous energy transfer system for transferring data between components of an implantable medical device. The system comprises an internal coil assembly configured to be implanted in a recipient, and an external data coil assembly configured to be positioned in a housing worn on the recipient's head. The data coil assembly is further configured to be inductively coupled to the internal coil assembly. The inductive coupling is used to transcutaneously transfer data from the data coil assembly to the internal coil assembly. One or more elements of the data coil assembly are physically adjustable with respect to the housing to alter the inductive coupling between the data coil assembly and the internal coil assembly. Specifically, the external data coil assembly comprises a wire antenna coil having multiple turns of wire wound around a core. The position of at least one of the antenna coil and the core is physically adjustable with respect to the device housing to adjust the strength of the coupling between the data coil assembly and internal coil assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used therein, the transcutaneous transfer of energy refers to the transfer of data or power from an external device to an implanted device via a magnetic induction link. For example, transcutaneous energy transfer includes the inductive transfer of data over a weakly coupled magnetic induction link (by modulation of the H-field), or the transcutaneous transfer of power via a closely-coupled magnetic induction link operating in the reactive near field. The magnetic induction power and data links operate at radio frequencies (RF). Embodiments of the present invention will be primarily discussed herein with reference to the transcutaneous transfer of data via a magnetic induction link. However, it should be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention may be used for other types of transcutaneous energy transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although embodiments of the present invention are described herein primarily in connection with one type of implantable medical device, namely a cochlear prosthesis (commonly referred to as a cochlear prosthetic device, cochlear implant, cochlear device, and the like; simply &#x201c;cochlear implants&#x201d; herein), it would be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in any implantable medical device now known or later developed. Implantable medical devices envisaged by the present invention include, but are not limited to, cardiac monitors and defibrillators; glucose meters; implantable drug pumps; neural stimulators, including vision and hearing prostheses such auditory brain stimulators, or other devices that electrically, acoustically or mechanically stimulate components of the recipient's outer, middle or inner ear. It would also be understood that the present invention, though particularly applicable to implantable medical devices, may also be applied to a wide variety of other medical devices that do not include an implantable device.</p>

For ease of illustration, the recipient's head and ear are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating the inductive transfer of data from external data coil assembly <b>354</b> of BTE <b>342</b> to internal coil assembly <b>464</b> of implantable component <b>444</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As is well known, the inductive transfer of data refers to the transfer of energy from one element, such as a coil antenna, to another coil antenna through an inductive coupling between the antennas. Inductive coupling, sometimes referred to as magnetic coupling, between two coil antennas occurs when a varying magnetic field exists between the antennas. That is, coil antennas are inductively coupled when a change in current flow through one antenna, referred to as the transmitting antenna, induces a voltage across the ends of the other antenna, referred to as receiving antenna, via an magnetic field generated by the transmitting coil antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, external data coil assembly <b>354</b> functions as a transmitting antenna. As noted, data coil <b>368</b> is a wire antenna coil comprised of multiple turns of electrically insulated single-strand or multi-strand wire. A current through the turns of data coil <b>368</b> will generate a magnetic field <b>555</b> having exemplary magnetic field lines <b>552</b>. The time-varying magnetic flux associated with magnetic field <b>555</b> results in a voltage over internal coil <b>472</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As is well known, a generated magnetic field is substantially symmetrical about a longitudinal axis extending approximately through the geometric center of the area bounded by the turns of the transmitting coil. This axis is referred to herein as axis of symmetry <b>582</b>. Thus, as used herein, axis of symmetry <b>582</b> refers to a longitudinal axis through the center of data coil <b>368</b>, as well as the symmetrical axis of magnetic field <b>550</b>. For ease of illustration, only the half of magnetic field <b>550</b> which is in the direction of implantable component <b>444</b> is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Also as known, a magnetic field such as field <b>550</b> attenuates as the distance from data coil <b>368</b> increases. Furthermore, magnetic field lines <b>552</b> follow a certain pattern depending on, for example, the orientation, position, geometry, arrangement, etc., generally and collectively referred to as the configuration of, external data coil assembly <b>354</b>. Thus, only a fraction of the magnetic flux generated by external data coil assembly <b>354</b>, represented by field lines <b>552</b>, will reach internal coil <b>472</b>. The more magnetic flux that reaches internal coil <b>472</b>, the better or stronger data coil <b>368</b> and internal coil <b>472</b> are coupled. The coupling strength between coils <b>368</b>, <b>372</b> may be expressed by a coupling factor k. The coupling factor is a value between zero and one. A coupling factor of 1 indicates a perfect coupling between coils <b>368</b>, <b>372</b> (i.e. all flux generated by external data coil assembly <b>354</b> is received by internal coil <b>472</b>), while a coupling factor of zero indicates that coils <b>368</b>, <b>372</b> are independent (i.e. no magnet flux generated by external data coil assembly <b>354</b> is received by internal coil <b>372</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the illustrative embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, external data coil assembly <b>354</b> is configured such that there is a strong inductive coupling between data coil <b>368</b> and internal coil <b>472</b>. That is, a significant portion of magnetic flux generated by external data coil assembly <b>354</b> is received by internal coil <b>472</b>, resulting in a large coupling coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The external coil and internal coils of conventional cochlear implants and other implantable medical devices typically each have a fixed configuration. In other words, the orientation, position, arrangement, etc. of conventional transmitting and receiving coils in a medical device used to inductively transmit data are fixed during manufacture, and are not adjustable at a later time. However, the fixed coil configurations may make it difficult for a surgeon to obtain a strong inductive coupling between transmitting and data coils of the implantable medical device. For example, most implantable medical devices are designed to be implanted in a variety of recipients, and are typically not designed and/or constructed to be implanted in a specific recipient. As such, due to, for example, different patient head sizes, skull shapes, skin/tissue thickness, ear location, surgeon preference of implant location, etc., the use of fixed coil configurations in a generic device may provide a sufficiently strong inductive coupling only in certain recipients, and may make it difficult to obtain the desired coupling between the transmitting/receiving coils in other recipients. Furthermore, in such devices, slight movements/vibrations of the BTE due to the loose attachment of the BTE to the recipient's ear could cause undesirable changes in the inductive coupling between fixed coil configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Embodiments of the present invention avoid the above and other drawbacks by providing the ability to alter the inductive coupling between data coil <b>368</b> and implanted internal coil <b>472</b>. In embodiments of the present invention, the configuration of external data coil assembly <b>354</b> is physically adjustable in order to alter the inductive coupling between coils <b>368</b>, <b>372</b>. Specifically, the orientation or physical position of at least one of data coil <b>368</b> and core <b>366</b> is physically adjustable with respect to housing <b>325</b> to alter the coupling between coils <b>368</b>, <b>372</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described in detail below, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, data coil <b>368</b> and the core of external data coil assembly <b>354</b> may be adjusted in a variety of manners to alter the magnetic coupling between coils <b>368</b>, <b>372</b>. Also as described below, the physical adjustment of the elements may have different affects on the magnetic field that is generated by the external data coil assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the coupling between coils <b>368</b> and <b>372</b> is altered by changing the orientation or position of axis of symmetry <b>582</b> of magnetic field <b>550</b>. In other embodiments, the coupling between coils <b>368</b> and <b>372</b> is altered by changing the flow of magnetic flux within magnetic field <b>550</b>. The flow of magnetic flux within magnetic field <b>550</b> is visualized by magnetic field lines <b>552</b>. Thus, changing the flow of magnetic flux within magnetic field <b>550</b> may be viewed as a change in the location of magnetic field lines <b>552</b> within the field. The above and other methods for altering the inductive coupling are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> illustrate embodiments of the present invention in which the inductive coupling between data coil <b>368</b> and internal coil <b>472</b> may be altered through adjustment of the orientation of axis of symmetry <b>582</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates an exemplary starting position of external data coil assembly <b>354</b> within housing <b>325</b> of BTE <b>342</b>. Specifically, BTE <b>342</b> and external data coil <b>368</b> are positioned substantially vertically with each of the wires coils of the data coil being substantially parallel to a recipient's head. Thus, axis of symmetry <b>582</b> is substantially co-axial with a horizontal axis (not shown) that extends through the recipient's skull. For ease of illustration, magnet field lines <b>552</b> have been omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>. However, it would be appreciated that magnetic field lines <b>552</b> would be substantially symmetrical about axis of symmetry <b>582</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As noted above, the starting position of data coil <b>368</b> may not provide a desired inductive coupling for all recipients between the data coil and implanted internal coil <b>372</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref> illustrate adjustments of the orientation of axis of symmetry <b>582</b> in order to alter the coupling between coils <b>368</b>, <b>372</b>. Specifically, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref>, one or more elements of external data coil assembly <b>354</b> are physically adjusted to shift the orientation of axis of symmetry <b>582</b> by an angle theta (&#x3b8;) from horizontal axis <b>680</b>. As would be appreciated, axis of symmetry <b>582</b> may be shifted by any number of angles &#x3b8;, and the shift may be vertical shifts (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref>), or may be horizontal or lateral shifts from horizontal axis <b>680</b>.

In such embodiments, axis of symmetry <b>582</b> would be shifted a horizontal angle &#x3b8;, and by a vertical angle &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As noted, one or more elements of external data coil assembly <b>354</b> are adjusted in order to provide the change in orientation of axis of symmetry <b>582</b> described above.

As noted, axis of symmetry refers to a longitudinal axis extending approximately through the geometric center of the area bounded by the turns of data coil <b>368</b>. Thus, a change in the orientation of coils <b>368</b> with respect to housing <b>325</b> by an angle &#x3b8; results in a corresponding change in the orientation of axis of symmetry by an angle &#x3b8;.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating the inductive coupling between an external data assembly <b>354</b> of BTE <b>342</b> and internal coils <b>472</b> of two implantable components <b>444</b> of a cochlear implant. In these embodiments, the cochlear implant comprises a bilateral system having a first implantable component <b>444</b>A positioned near the right side of the recipient's skull, referred to as right implantable component <b>444</b>A. The cochlear implant further comprises a second implantable component <b>444</b>B positioned near the left side of the recipient's skull, referred to as left implantable component <b>444</b>B.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the embodiments of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, data coil <b>368</b> is strongly coupled to internal coil <b>472</b>A of right implantable component <b>444</b>A. That is, a significant amount of magnetic flux generated by external data coil assembly <b>354</b> is received by internal coil <b>472</b>A so as to enable inductive data transmission between data coil <b>368</b> and internal coil <b>472</b>A. However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, data coil <b>368</b> is weakly coupled to internal coil <b>472</b>B of left implantable component <b>444</b>A. That is, a low amount of magnetic flux generated by external data coil assembly <b>354</b> is received by internal coil <b>472</b>B, thus preventing inductive data transmission between data coil <b>368</b> and internal coil <b>472</b>B. As described below, one or more components of external data coil assembly <b>354</b> are adjustable to alter the inductive coupling between data coil <b>368</b> and coils <b>472</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates the cochlear implant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> in which data coil <b>368</b> is sufficiently coupled to both internal coils <b>472</b>A and <b>472</b>B so as to enable inductive data transmission between all coils.

The physical adjustment of one or more elements of data coil assembly <b>354</b> to change the orientation of data coil <b>368</b> and thus axis of symmetry <b>582</b> is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The change in the orientation of axis of symmetry <b>582</b> also changes the flow of magnetic flux within magnetic field <b>550</b>, shown by the change in location of magnetic field lines <b>552</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Thus, as shown, the change in orientation of axis of symmetry <b>582</b> causes additional magnetic flux to be received by internal coil assembly <b>464</b>B.
