<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a portable terminal. More particularly, the present invention relates to a waterproof structure in a portable terminal including a pair of housings provided in wiring for interconnecting circuit devices installed in the housings.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a &#x201c;portable terminal&#x201d; refers to an apparatus carried with a user to perform communication with another user or a mobile communication service provider. The term &#x201c;portable terminal&#x201d; also refers to an apparatus providing a particular function, such as outputting an electronic note, providing a portable game console, or a multimedia player, etc., in addition a communication apparatus for providing the aforementioned mobile communication functions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Based on their outward appearance, such portable terminals can be classified into, for example, bar-type terminals, flip-type terminals, folder-type terminals, and sliding-type terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The bar-type terminal typically has a simple structure in which input/output devices are mounted in a single housing. Recently, there has emerged a terminal structured such that a keypad and a display device are implemented with a touch screen, and transmitting and receiving units are disposed at both sides of the touch screen, respectively. Such bar-type terminals permit both a communication function and a multimedia function to be used in a single terminal with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The flip-type terminal is structured such that a flip for opening or closing an input device, such as a keypad installed on a bar-type terminal, thereby preventing malfunction of the input device. As input/output devices become implementable with a touch screen, the flip-type terminal is gradually disappearing from the market.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The folder-type or sliding-type terminal can be carried with a pair of housings overlapping each other, and can be opened or closed by folding/unfolding one of the housings by rotation relative to the other or by sliding the housing relative to the other. The folder-type or sliding-type terminal includes various arrangements of input/output devices based on of a pair of housings, and is easy to carry because the housings overlap each other during the carrying.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a mobile communication services using the portable terminals have been diversified to include multimedia contents, such as games, moving pictures, and broadcasting, causing the portable terminals to come into widespread use by significant portions of the population. The widespread use of the portable terminals has also caused a trend in which users of the portable terminals value the terminals as personal ornaments in addition for use with services provided through the portable terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As users carry portable terminals most of the time, and now that some of the users consider their portable terminal to also function as ornaments, interest in waterproofing the portable terminal is increasing. In a portable terminal having a single housing, such as a bar-type terminal, a waterproof structure can be provided by using a sealing member, such as a double-sided tape, or a gasket arranged only on bonded portions between cases of the housing and bonded portions between a window and the case installed in positions corresponding to a display device. However, a separate waterproof structure has to be provided to a speaker phone or a microphone.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the other hand, in a portable terminal having a pair of housings, such as a folder-type terminal, circuit devices installed in the respective housings are interconnected by using a flexible printed circuit. In a path for wiring the flexible printed circuit, many difficulties exist in providing a waterproof structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Detailed descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for clarity and conciseness when their inclusion might obscure appreciation of the subject matter of the present by the person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3B</figref>, in a waterproof structure <b>100</b> for a portable terminal (not shown) according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a waterproof member in substantial contact to the outer circumferential surface of a flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> substantially contacts to the circumference of the inlet of a wiring hole <b>115</b> formed in a housing <b>101</b>, such that a gap between the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> and the wiring hole <b>115</b> is sealed and movement of the waterproof member is prevented. The portable terminal includes at least a pair of housings and the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> is intended to interconnect circuit devices installed in the respective housings.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The housing <b>101</b> receives various circuit devices, such as a control circuit, a communication circuit, a storage device, etc., in an inner space <b>119</b> thereof, and is coupled to another housing (not shown) to form the portable terminal. Inside the housing <b>101</b> are provided a partition wall forming the inner space <b>119</b> and a receiving partition wall <b>111</b> forming a receiving recess <b>113</b> for receiving the waterproof member.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">That is, the receiving recess <b>133</b> is a space that is defined and surrounded by the receiving partition wall <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the receiving partition wall <b>111</b> is formed the wiring hole <b>115</b> for providing a wiring path of the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b>. The wiring hole <b>115</b>, extending from the receiving recess <b>113</b>, communicates with the inner space <b>119</b> of the housing <b>101</b>. That is, the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> is preferably inserted from outside into or withdrawn to outside from the inner space <b>119</b> of the housing <b>101</b> through the wiring hole <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The receiving partition wall <b>111</b> also has a through hole <b>117</b> therein that extends from the receiving recess <b>113</b> and communicates with the outside. The through hole <b>117</b>, like the wiring hole <b>115</b>, provides the wiring path of the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and installed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the current exemplary embodiment, since the receiving recess <b>113</b> is provided by forming the receiving partition wall <b>111</b> to install the waterproof member, the through hole <b>117</b> which also provides the wiring path of the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> is additionally formed. Thus, the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b>, after sequentially passing through the through hole <b>117</b>, the receiving recess <b>113</b>, and then the wiring hole <b>115</b> from outside, is inserted into the inside of the housing <b>101</b>, or is withdrawn from the inside of the housing <b>101</b> to the outside in a reverse sequence from the wiring hole <b>115</b> to the through hole <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the waterproof member preferably includes a first sealing member <b>121</b><i>a </i>and a second sealing member <b>121</b><i>b </i>received in the receiving recess <b>113</b>, and may further include a clamp <b>123</b> for fixing contacting the first sealing member <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second sealing member <b>121</b><i>b </i>to the inside of the receiving recess <b>113</b>. The first sealing member <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second sealing member <b>121</b><i>b </i>may be comprised of an elastic material, for example, silicone or urethane, and are received within the receiving recess <b>113</b> and facing each other, such that they contact to both surfaces of the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is preferable that sizes of the first sealing member <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second sealing member <b>121</b><i>b </i>can be larger than that of the receiving recess <b>113</b>. The reason for the large sealing member sizes is because that as the first sealing member <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second sealing member <b>121</b><i>b</i>, when received in the receiving recess <b>113</b>, are compressed, they contact to both surfaces (upper and lower, see partially exploded view of the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> in which their outer circumferential surfaces closely contact to the inner wall of the receiving recess <b>113</b>, leading to improvement in waterproof performance. In other words, the first sealing member <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second sealing member <b>121</b><i>b </i>substantially contact to both surfaces of the flexible printed circuit <b>102</b> on their facing surfaces and substantially contact to the circumferential portion of the inlet of the wiring hole <b>115</b> on their side surfaces so as to be prevented from movement and form a seal.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At least one of the first sealing member <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second sealing member <b>121</b><i>b </i>can be integrally provided integrated with the housing <b>101</b> by double injection, and such a sealing member may be installed as being adhered to a bottom surface of the receiving recess <b>113</b> and a portion of the circumference of the inlet of the wiring hole <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The clamp <b>123</b> is bound to the housing <b>101</b> by an engagement unit <b>125</b> such as a screw or other type of fastener.

In the waterproof member <b>203</b> is formed a slit <b>233</b> penetrating the waterproof portion <b>235</b> from the body portion <b>231</b>. The flexible printed circuit <b>202</b> is coupled in such a way to pass through the slit <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The waterproof portion <b>235</b> is formed so as to be larger in size than the wiring hole <b>215</b>, such that when the waterproof portion <b>235</b> is inserted into the wiring hole <b>215</b>, its outer circumferential surface makes pressurized contact with the inner wall of the wiring hole <b>215</b> sufficient to prevent movement and thus form a seal, and the inner wall of the slit <b>233</b> also substantially contacts both surfaces of the flexible printed circuit <b>202</b> to prevent movement. This formation of the waterproof portion <b>235</b> is intended to improve waterproof performance in the wiring hole <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, in the current exemplary embodiment, on the outer circumferential surface of the waterproof portion <b>235</b> and the inner wall of the slit <b>233</b> are formed sealing protrusions <b>239</b><i>a </i>and <b>239</b><i>b</i>, end portions of which closely contact to the inner wall of the wiring hole <b>215</b> and the both surfaces of the flexible printed circuit <b>202</b>, respectively. By way of example, the sealing protrusion <b>239</b><i>a </i>formed on the outer circumferential surface of the waterproof portion <b>235</b> is depicted as three protrusions formed in a band shape on the circumference of the waterproof portion <b>235</b>. The number of sealing protrusion <b>239</b><i>a </i>is not limited to what is shown and described herein, and it is within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims that the actual number is subject to consideration of the required waterproof performance desired, the length of the waterproof portion <b>235</b>, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sealing protrusion <b>239</b><i>b </i>formed on the inner wall of the slit <b>233</b> is in this example formed in a band shape and positioned corresponding to the sealing protrusion <b>239</b><i>a</i>. In this way, the end portions of the sealing protrusion <b>239</b><i>a </i>and the sealing protrusion <b>239</b><i>b </i>closely contact to the inner wall of the wiring hole <b>215</b> and the both surfaces of the flexible printed circuit <b>202</b>, thereby improving waterproof performance.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">That is, the size of the waterproof portion <b>235</b> may be larger than that of the wiring hole <b>215</b> so that the waterproof portion <b>235</b>, when inserted under pressure in order to fit, can substantially contact the inner wall of the wiring hole <b>215</b> by its elastic force such that a seal is formed and movement of the waterproof portion is prevented. In the current exemplary embodiment, however, waterproof performance is further improved by using the sealing protrusions <b>239</b><i>a </i>and <b>239</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The waterproof member <b>203</b> may include, for example, engagement pieces <b>237</b> extending from the body portion <b>231</b>, and the engagement pieces <b>237</b> are fixed to the inside of the housing <b>201</b> by means of an engaging means such as a screw, fastener, clamp, or possibly by an adhesive.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref> show a waterproof structure <b>300</b> for a portable terminal according to a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A waterproof member of the waterproof structure <b>300</b> is shown in a state of being assembled onto a flexible printed circuit <b>302</b>, is assembled to a wiring hole <b>311</b> formed in a housing <b>301</b> of the portable terminal, an example of which is shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the housing <b>301</b> may have a partition wall inside, similar to the previous exemplary embodiments, but in the current exemplary embodiment, the housing <b>301</b> has a wiring hole <b>311</b> penetrating therethrough from an outer surface to an inner surface without a separate partition wall.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The waterproof member preferably includes a pair of coupling members <b>331</b> and a pair of sealing members <b>333</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The coupling members <b>331</b> may be comprised of a rigid synthetic resin such as polycarbonate, and the sealing members <b>333</b> may be comprised of an elastic material such as silicone or urethane, just to name a few possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, one of the coupling members <b>331</b> has fusion protrusions <b>335</b> at the bent end portions thereof and the other has fusion grooves <b>337</b> at the bent end portions thereof and in alignment with the fusion protrusions. The coupling members <b>331</b> are coupled to each other, facing each other and having the sealing members <b>333</b> therebetween. The fusion protrusions <b>335</b> are placed in the fusion grooves <b>337</b>, respectively. The flexible printed circuit <b>302</b> is wired between the sealing members <b>333</b>. That is, the sealing members <b>333</b> substantially contact both surfaces of the flexible printed circuit <b>302</b> such that the flexible printed circuit <b>302</b> is unable to move.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The coupling members <b>331</b> in this example can be bonded to each other, for example, by ultrasonic fusion.

In this way, the sealing members <b>333</b> and the coupling members <b>331</b> are fixed to the flexible printed circuit <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The sealing members <b>333</b> and the coupling members <b>331</b> during a state of being fixed to the flexible printed circuit <b>302</b> are inserted and fixed to the wiring hole <b>311</b>.

When the coupling members <b>331</b> are comprised of rigid synthetic resin, the waterproof performance between the outer circumferential surfaces thereof and the inner wall of the wiring hole <b>311</b> may be degraded.
