<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-183703, filed Jul. 15 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a magnetic random access memory (MRAM: Magnetic Random Access Memory). In particular, the present invention relates to a domain wall motion type MRAM.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An MRAM is a promising nonvolatile memory from a viewpoint of high integration and high-speed operation. In the MRAM, a magnetoresistance element that exhibits a &#x201c;magnetoresistance effect&#x201d; such as TMR (Tunnel MagnetoResistance) effect is utilized. In the magnetoresistance element, for example, a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ: Magnetic Tunnel Junction) in which a tunnel barrier layer is sandwiched by two ferromagnetic layers is formed. The two ferromagnetic layers include a magnetization fixed layer (pinned layer) whose magnetization direction is fixed and a magnetization free layer (free layer) whose magnetization direction is reversible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known that a resistance value (R+&#x394;R) of the MTJ when the magnetization directions of the pinned layer and the free layer are &#x201c;anti-parallel&#x201d; to each other becomes larger than a resistance value (R) when the magnetization directions are &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; to each other due to the magnetoresistance effect. The MRAM uses the magnetoresistance element having the MTJ as a memory cell and nonvolatilely stores data by utilizing the change in the resistance value. For example, the anti-parallel state is related to data &#x201c;1&#x201d; and the parallel state is related to data &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Data writing to the memory cell is performed by switching the magnetization direction of the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally known methods of data writing to the MRAM include an &#x201c;asteroid method&#x201d; and a &#x201c;toggle method&#x201d;. According to these write methods, a magnetic switching field necessary for switching the magnetization direction of the free layer increases in substantially inverse proportion to a size of the memory cell. That is to say, a write current tends to increase with the miniaturization of the memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a write method capable of suppressing the increase in the write current with the miniaturization, there is proposed a &#x201c;spin transfer method&#x201d; (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Publication JP-2005-93488 (PTL1)). According to the spin transfer method, a spin-polarized current is injected to a ferromagnetic conductor, and direct interaction between spin of conduction electrons of the current and magnetic moment of the conductor causes the magnetization to be switched (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Spin Transfer Magnetization Switching&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,834,005 (PTL2) discloses a magnetic shift resister that utilizes the spin transfer. The magnetic shift resister stores data by utilizing a domain wall in a magnetic body. In the magnetic body having a large number of separated regions (magnetic domains) caused by forming constricted sections, a current is so supplied as to pass through the domain wall and the current causes the domain wall to move. The magnetization direction in each of the regions is treated as a record data. For example, such a magnetic shift resister is used for recording large quantities of serial data.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A &#x201c;domain wall motion type MRAM&#x201d; that utilizes the domain wall motion based on the spin transfer is described in Japanese Patent Publication JP-2005-191032 (PTL3), International Publication WO2005/069368 (PTL4), Japanese Patent Publication JP-2006-73930 (PTL5), Japanese Patent Publication JP-2006-303159 (PTL6) and so on. The domain wall motion type MRAM is typically provided with a &#x201c;magnetic recording layer&#x201d; in which the domain wall moves, instead of the free layer. More specifically, the magnetic recording layer has a magnetization switching region corresponding to the free layer whose magnetization direction is reversible and a magnetization fixed region whose magnetization direction does not substantially change. The pinned layer is connected to the magnetization switching region through a tunnel barrier layer. At a time of data writing, a write current flows in an in-plane direction in the magnetic recording layer, and the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region is changed due to the domain wall motion.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a structure of a magnetic recording layer <b>110</b> described in International Publication WO2005/069368 (PTL4). The magnetic recording layer <b>110</b> consists of three sections having different thicknesses. More specifically, the magnetic recording layer <b>110</b> consists of a first magnetization fixed section <b>111</b> that is the thickest, a second magnetization fixed section <b>112</b> that is the next thickest, and a connector section <b>113</b> that is the thinnest and disposed between them. The first magnetization fixed section <b>111</b> and the second magnetization fixed section <b>112</b> are respectively provided with fixed magnetizations whose directions are opposite to each other. The reason why the first magnetization fixed section <b>111</b> and the second magnetization fixed section <b>112</b> are different in the thickness is to utilize, at a time of initialization, difference in coercivity to magnetize the respective with the fixed magnetizations whose directions are opposite to each other. In the case of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two differences in level (one is at a boundary between the connector section <b>113</b> and the first magnetization fixed section <b>111</b>, and the other is at a boundary between the connector section <b>113</b> and the second magnetization fixed section <b>112</b>) function as pinning potentials for a domain wall <b>114</b>, namely trapping sites for trapping the domain wall <b>114</b>. For example, the domain wall <b>114</b> is trapped at the boundary between the connector section <b>113</b> and the magnetization fixed section <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In should be noted that, in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a magnetic body having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to a film surface) is used as the magnetic recording layer <b>110</b>. To use the magnetic body having the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is preferable in terms of reduction in current (current density) required for the domain wall motion. According to International Publication WO2005/069368 (PTL4), for example, a current value of a write pulse is as small as about 0.35 mA (corresponding to current density=105 A/cm2).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the typical domain wall motion type MRAM, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the magnetic recording layer is provided with the constricted section or the difference in level and thereby the pinning potential for pinning the domain wall is obtained. Meanwhile, with respect to a magnetic shift register and a magnetic storage utilizing the domain wall motion, there is proposed a method of controlling a position of domain wall without forming the constricted section (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Publication JP-2008-34808 (PTL 7)).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a structure of a magnetic storage utilizing the domain wall motion that is described in Japanese Patent Publication JP-2008-34808 (PTL 7). The magnetic storage has a magnetic wire <b>140</b> that is provided with a plurality of magnetic domains <b>130</b>. The magnetic wire <b>140</b> has a domain wall <b>135</b> that moves due to a pulse current or a pulse magnetic field. The movement distance of the domain wall <b>135</b> is controlled by strength and width of the pulse magnetic field or the pulse current.

The relationship is calculated by a simulation. As represented by a curve CA in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is a tendency that a moving speed of the domain wall becomes 0 and the domain wall stops at specific pulse current application times. According to the technique described in Japanese Patent Publication JP-2008-34808 (PTL 7), the domain wall position is controlled by setting the pulse current application time to the specific times.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">The inventors of the present application have recognized the following points. To form the constricted section on the magnetic recording layer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is getting difficult with miniaturization of element. That is, if a width of the magnetic recording layer becomes smaller with the miniaturization of element, it becomes impossible to form a minute constricted section with the current photolithography accuracy. To put it the other way around, to form the constricted section on the magnetic recording layer acts to constrict the miniaturization and high-integration of element. Moreover, in order to form the two differences in level on the magnetic recording layer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is necessary to repeat exposure process at least two times. This means increase in the number of processes and thus causes increase in manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">It can be considered to apply the domain wall position controlling method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> to the domain wall motion type MRAM. That is, it can be considered to control the movement distance of the domain wall by setting the pulse current application time (pulse width) to the specific values and without forming the constricted section or the difference in level on the magnetic recording layer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">However, according to a simulation executed by the inventors of the present application, it has been found that the relationship between the domain wall position and the pulse current application time does not necessarily become as represented by the curve CA in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> but in some cases it becomes as represented by a curve CB. In the case of the curve CB, the domain wall continues to move without stopping, although there are increase and decrease in the moving speed of the domain wall. In particular, the tendency that the domain wall continues to move without stopping has been found to be conspicuous in a case of the magnetic recording layer having the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy by which the current density required for the domain wall motion can be reduced. Therefore, it is not preferable to apply the domain wall position controlling method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> to the domain wall motion type MRAM that uses the magnetic recording layer having the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, even if the relationship as represented by the curve CA can be obtained, the fact that the movement distance of the domain wall is fixed to a predetermined value is not adequate to the MRAM for which reduction in a cell size is required.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">An object of the present invention is to provide a technique that can easily achieve domain wall introduction and domain wall position control with respect to a magnetic recording layer having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a domain wall motion type MRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">In a first aspect of the present invention, a domain wall motion type MRAM is provided. The MRAM has: a magnetic recording layer being a ferromagnetic layer having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; a pair of current supply terminals connected to the magnetic recording layer for supplying a current to the magnetic recording layer; and an anti-ferromagnetic layer being in contact with a first region of the magnetic recording layer. The first region includes a part of a current supply region of the magnetic recording layer that is between the pair of current supply terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">In a second aspect of the present invention, an initializing method for a domain wall motion type MRAM is provided. The MRAM has: a magnetic recording layer being a ferromagnetic layer having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; a pair of current supply terminals connected to the magnetic recording layer for supplying a current to the magnetic recording layer; and an anti-ferromagnetic layer being in contact with a first region of the magnetic recording layer. The first region includes a part of a current supply region of the magnetic recording layer that is between the pair of current supply terminals. The initializing method includes: (A) a step of applying a first external magnetic field in a first direction perpendicular to a film surface such that a magnetization direction of the magnetic recording layer is turned to the first direction; and (B) a step of applying a second external magnetic field in a second direction opposite to the first direction such that a magnetization direction of a region of the magnetic recording layer other than the first region is turned to the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">According to the present invention, it is possible to easily achieve the domain wall introduction and the domain wall position control with respect to the magnetic recording layer having the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the domain wall motion type MRAM. Since there is no need to provide the magnetic recording layer with the constricted section, the miniaturization and high-integration of element become possible. Moreover, since there is no need to provide the magnetic recording layer with the difference in level, the increase in the manufacturing costs can be prevented.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">An MRAM according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings. The MRAM according to the present exemplary embodiment is a domain wall motion type MRAM that uses a magnetic layer having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The MRAM has a plurality of magnetic memory cells that are arranged in an array form. Each of the magnetic memory cells includes a magnetoresistance element that exhibits the magnetoresistance effect.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">1. Magnetic Memory Cell</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of the magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> (magnetoresistance element) according to the present exemplary embodiment. The magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> has a magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> and a pinned layer <b>30</b> that are ferromagnetic layers and a tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> that is a non-magnetic layer. The tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> being a non-magnetic layer is a thin insulating film such as an Al2O3 film and an MgO film. The tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> is sandwiched by the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> and the pinned layer <b>30</b>, and the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> and the pinned layer <b>30</b> form a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">The magnetization direction of the pinned layer <b>30</b> is not changed by data write/read operations. It is therefore desirable that the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer <b>30</b> is greater than that of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. This can be achieved by varying the material and composition between the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> and the pinned layer <b>30</b>. This can also be achieved by stacking an anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>36</b> for pinning the magnetization direction of the pinned layer <b>30</b> on a surface of the pinned layer <b>30</b> on the opposite side of the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Moreover, the pinned layer <b>30</b> may be formed to be a laminated film of a ferromagnetic layer <b>33</b>, a ferromagnetic layer <b>34</b> and a non-magnetic layer <b>31</b> sandwiched between the ferromagnetic layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. Here, Ru, Cu and the like can be used as material of the non-magnetic layer <b>31</b>. The magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> are anti-parallel to each other. A leakage magnetic field from the pinned layer <b>30</b> can be suppressed by making the respective magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> substantially equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">The magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> is a ferromagnetic layer in which a domain wall moves. The magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment is formed of a perpendicular magnetic film that has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a direction (Z-axis direction) perpendicular to a film surface. In the case of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> having the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, a current density required for domain wall motion can be reduced, which is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">The magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> preferably includes at least one material selected from Fe, Co and Ni. Moreover, if the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> includes Pt or Pd, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is more stabilized, which is preferable. In addition to that, desired magnetic characteristics can be achieved by adding B, C, N, O, Al, Si, P, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Au, Sm and the like. Concrete examples of the material of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> include Co, Co-Pt, Co&#x2014;Pd, Co&#x2014;Cr, Co&#x2014;Pt&#x2014;Cr, Co&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Ta, Co&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;B, Co&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Pt&#x2014;B, Co&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Ta&#x2014;B, Co&#x2014;V, Co&#x2014;Mo, Co&#x2014;W, Co&#x2014;Ti, Co&#x2014;Ru, Co&#x2014;Rh, Fe&#x2014;Pt, Fe&#x2014;Pd, Fe&#x2014;Co&#x2014;Pt, Fe&#x2014;Co&#x2014;Pd and Sm&#x2014;Co. Besides, a layer including at least one material selected from Fe, Co and Ni and another layer may be stacked. In this case, concrete examples of the stacked film include Co/Pd, Co/Pt, Co/Ni, Fe/Au and the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is preferable that the pinned layer <b>30</b> also has the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and is formed of the same material as in the case of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. Such materials as CoFe and CoFeB exhibiting great TMR effect may be used for a part of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> and the pinned layer <b>30</b>, particularly for a section being in contact with the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">The magnetization direction of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> having the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy becomes the +Z-direction or the &#x2212;Z-direction perpendicular to the film surface. More specifically, the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> includes a first region R<b>1</b> whose magnetization direction is a first direction perpendicular to the film surface and a second region R<b>2</b> whose magnetization direction is a second direction perpendicular to the film surface. The first direction and the second direction are opposite to each other. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first direction is the &#x2212;Z-direction and the second direction is the +Z-direction. Moreover, the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> includes a magnetization switching region <b>13</b> that is sandwiched between the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b>. That is, the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> are respectively located on both sides of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>. The magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> can be switched between the +Z-direction and the &#x2212;Z-direction. Therefore, in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, the domain wall can be formed at a first boundary B<b>1</b> between the first region R<b>1</b> and the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> or at a second boundary B<b>2</b> between the second region R<b>2</b> and the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>. A method of introducing the domain wall into the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> (i.e. initializing method) will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">According to the present exemplary embodiment, the data writing is achieved by the domain wall motion method. That is, at the time of data writing, the domain wall moves within the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> and thereby the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is changed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is connected to the pinned layer <b>30</b> through the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b>, and the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>, the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> and the pinned layer <b>30</b> form the MTJ. A resistance value of the MTJ varies depending on the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>, namely whether the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> and the magnetization direction of the pinned layer <b>30</b> are &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; or &#x201c;anti-parallel&#x201d; to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">In order to move the domain wall in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, it is necessary to supply a write current in the in-plane direction in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. A pair of current supply terminals is provided for achieving the write current flowing in the in-plane direction. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pair of current supply terminals consisting of a first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b </i>is connected to the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. The current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be formed on the upper side or the lower side of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, and can be formed through via formation process, grinding process and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">The pair of current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>is used for supplying a current to the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. By using the pair of current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to supply the write current in a region between the current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. That is, the write current can flow in the in-plane direction within the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. The region of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> between the two current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, namely, the region through which the write current flows is hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;current supply region RA&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">The current supply region RA in which the write current flows is the region in which the domain wall can move. Therefore, at least the above-mentioned magnetization switching region <b>13</b> needs to be included in the current supply region RA. The first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b </i>are respectively provided on both sides of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> such that the current supply region RA includes the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>. As described above, the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> are respectively located on the both sides of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>. That is to say, the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a </i>is provided on the side of the first region R<b>1</b> of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, while the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b </i>is provided on the side of the second region R<b>2</b> of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. In other words, the first region R<b>1</b> is closer to the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a </i>than to the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b</i>, while the second region R<b>2</b> is closer to the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b </i>than to the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">Moreover, the first region R<b>1</b> and second region R<b>2</b> whose respective magnetization directions are opposite to each other serve as spin supply sources for supplying spin electrons having opposite spins to the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> at the time of the domain wall motion. Therefore, at least a part of the first region R<b>1</b> and at least a part of the second region R<b>2</b> are included in the current supply region RA. In other words, the first region R<b>1</b> includes a part of the current supply region RA, and preferably it is directly connected to the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Also, the second region R<b>2</b> includes a part of the current supply region RA, and preferably it is directly connected to the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">The magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment further has an anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> that is so formed as to be in contact with the first region R<b>1</b> of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> is stacked on the first region R<b>1</b> of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. Such materials as PtMn, NiMn, IrMn, FeMn, NiO and CoO can be used for the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b>. A role of the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> is to apply an exchange bias field to the first region R<b>1</b> to fix the magnetization direction of the first region R<b>1</b> in the above-mentioned first direction (e.g., the &#x2212;Z-direction). In other words, a region of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> whose magnetization direction is fixed in the first direction due to contact with the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> substantially corresponds to the first region R<b>1</b>. It should be noted that no anti-ferromagnetic layer is provided on the side of the second region R<b>2</b> of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">The anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> may be formed on the lower side of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. Such a process can be simply considered that a material film for the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> is first deposited, then patterning of the material film is performed, and after that a material film for the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> is deposited. In this case, however, the deposition process for the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> and the deposition process for the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> are not successively performed, and there is fear that magnetic coupling between the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> and the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> becomes insufficient. It is therefore preferable to utilize a base layer <b>46</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The base layer <b>46</b> is formed of such material (e.g., Ta, NiFe) that enhances magnetic characteristics of the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> and enhances the magnetic coupling between the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> and the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. The base layer <b>46</b> is patterned to have a shape equivalent to that of the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. After the base layer <b>46</b> is formed, respective material films for the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> and the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> are deposited successively. If a planarization process such as etching back and CMP is performed after the formation of the base layer <b>46</b>, a cross-sectional shape becomes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. If the planarization process is omitted, a cross-sectional shape becomes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. In either case, a section of the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> formed on the base layer <b>46</b> only has effective magnetic characteristics. Therefore, the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> can play substantially the same role as that of the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, by using the base layer <b>46</b>, it is possible to apply the exchange bias field only to a part (the first region R<b>1</b>) of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> while ensuring the successive deposition of the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> and the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">2. Initialization of Magnetic Recording Layer</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">Next, a method for initially introducing the domain wall into the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described. Such the domain wall introducing processing is hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;initialization&#x201d;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a method of initializing the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment. Here, let us consider a case where the pinned layer <b>30</b> has greater coercivity than the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> and the magnetization direction of the pinned layer <b>30</b> does not change during the initialization process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">Step S<b>1</b>:</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">First, a first external magnetic field Hz<b>1</b> in a first direction (the &#x2212;Z-direction) perpendicular to the film surface is applied. As a result, the magnetization direction of whole of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> is turned to the first direction (the &#x2212;Z-direction).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">Step S<b>2</b>:</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">Next, a second external magnetic field Hz<b>2</b> in a second direction (the +Z-direction) opposite to the first direction is applied. It should be noted here that magnetization reversal is less likely to occur in the first region R<b>1</b> being in contact with the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> than in the other region, due to exchange coupling with the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b>. It is therefore possible by adjusting the magnitude of the second external magnetic field Hz<b>2</b> to reverse the magnetization direction of only the region other than the first region R<b>1</b> without reversing the magnetization direction of the first region R<b>1</b>. Alternatively, the magnitude of the second external magnetic field Hz<b>2</b> may be gradually increased from zero. In either case, the magnetization direction of the region other than the first region R<b>1</b> in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> is reversed and turned to the second direction (the +Z-direction). As a result, a domain wall DW is formed at the first boundary B<b>1</b> between the first region R<b>1</b> and the region other than the first region R<b>1</b>. That is to say, the domain wall DW is introduced into the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">Step S<b>3</b>:</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">When the application of the second external magnetic field Hz<b>2</b> is stopped, the domain wall DW is settled in the vicinity of the first boundary B<b>1</b>. The reason why the domain wall DW is not settled on the first boundary B<b>1</b> at this time is that the first boundary B<b>1</b> does not serve as artificial pinning potential for trapping the domain wall DW, which is different from the case of the difference in level between the ferromagnetic layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> schematically shows the pinning potential in cases where a magnetic layer MA (ferromagnetic layer or anti-ferromagnetic layer) is stacked on the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. A boundary of a region of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> on which the magnetic layer MA is stacked is the first boundary B<b>1</b>. In a case where the magnetic layer MA is a ferromagnetic layer, a leakage magnetic field from the ferromagnetic layer causes a position of the first boundary B<b>1</b> to be a local minimum point of the pinning potential. In a case where the magnetic layer MA is an anti-ferromagnetic layer, however, there is no leakage magnetic field and thus the position of the first boundary B<b>1</b> does not become a local minimum point of the pinning potential although a potential difference is generated at the first boundary B<b>1</b>. Therefore, an equivalent state in terms of energy is obtained when the domain wall DW is located anywhere other than the first region R<b>1</b>. However, in an actual magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, there exist random pinning potentials caused by edge roughness at a time of patterning, distribution of lattice defects, grain boundaries and the like. Therefore, when the application of the second external magnetic field Hz<b>2</b> is stopped, the domain wall DW is settled at a local minimum point in the vicinity of the first boundary B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">According to the present exemplary embodiment, as described above, the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> is so provided as to be in contact with a part of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> and it is thus possible to easily achieve the initialization of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">3. Data Writing/Reading Operations</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">Next, data writing with respect to the magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows data writing with respect to the magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">The pinned layer <b>30</b> is connected through the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> to the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> included in the current supply region RA of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. More specifically, the pinned layer <b>30</b> has a lamination structure of the ferromagnetic layer <b>34</b>, the non-magnetic layer <b>31</b> and the ferromagnetic layer <b>33</b>, and the ferromagnetic layer <b>34</b> among them is connected to the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> through the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b>. The resistance value of the MTJ, namely, the record data varies depending on whether the magnetization directions of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> and the ferromagnetic layer <b>34</b> are &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; or &#x201c;anti-parallel&#x201d; to each other. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the parallel state is related to data &#x201c;0&#x201d; and the anti-parallel state is related to data &#x201c;1&#x201d;. In the data &#x201c;0&#x201d; state, the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is the &#x2212;Z-direction, and the domain wall DW is located at the second boundary B<b>2</b>. On the other hand, in the data &#x201c;1&#x201d; state, the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is the +Z-direction, and the domain wall DW is located in the vicinity of the first boundary B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">The data writing is achieved by the domain wall motion method utilizing the spin transfer. The write current flows not in a direction penetrating through the MTJ but planarly in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. The write current is supplied to the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> by using the above-mentioned current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">At a time of writing the data &#x201c;1&#x201d;, a first write current IW<b>1</b> flows from the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a </i>through the current supply region RA to the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b</i>. In this case, spin electrons are injected into the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> from the second region R<b>2</b> having the magnetization in the +Z-direction. The spin of the injected electrons drives the domain wall DW at the second boundary B<b>2</b> toward the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is switched to the +Z-direction. Typically, the movement of the domain wall DW stops at the first boundary B<b>1</b> due to the pinning potential shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Then, when the supply of the first write current IW<b>1</b> is stopped, the domain wall DW is settled at a position in the vicinity of the first boundary B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">Note that there may be a case where the domain wall DW is driven to within the first region R<b>1</b>, depending on the magnitude of the first write current IW<b>1</b>. In this case, however, exchange energy is lost. Moreover, since the first write current IW<b>1</b> flows in the current supply region RA, the domain wall DW is prevented from departing from the current supply region RA. That is, there is no chance that the domain wall DW moves beyond the position of the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Where the domain wall DW is eventually settled after the first write current IW<b>1</b> is turned OFF depends on the exchange energy, a magnitude of the random pinning potential, a magnitude, a rise time and a fall time of the write current and the like. The domain wall DW may be settled within the first region R<b>1</b> or may return back to the outside of the first region R<b>1</b>. In either case, the write/read operation is not affected as long as the domain wall DW is settled at the random pinning potential in the vicinity of the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">On the other hand, at a time of writing the data &#x201c;0&#x201d;, a second write current IW<b>2</b> flows from the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b </i>through the current supply region RA to the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a</i>. In this case, spin electrons are injected into the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> from the first region R<b>1</b> having the magnetization in the &#x2212;Z-direction. The spin of the injected electrons drives the domain wall DW located in the vicinity of the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a </i>toward the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b</i>. As a result, the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is switched to the &#x2212;Z-direction. When the supply of the second write current IW<b>2</b> is stopped, the domain wall DW is settled at a certain position within the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. The position at which the domain wall DW is settled is the second boundary B<b>2</b>. Since the second write current IW<b>2</b> flows in the current supply region RA, the domain wall DW is prevented from departing from the current supply region RA. That is, there is no chance that the domain wall DW moves beyond the position of the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b</i>. In this manner, the present exemplary embodiment utilizes the fact that the write current does not flow beyond the current supply terminal and hence the movement of the domain wall is restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a graph showing a write current pulse at the time of data writing to the magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the write current pulse is set such that its fall time is longer than its rise time. Such the setting is effective for settling the domain wall DW stably at a random potential in the vicinity of the current supply terminal after the write current is turned OFF. The reason is that the current-driven motion of the domain wall DW depends on time variation of the write current. That is, to make the fall time longer is effective for increasing dissipation rate of the current-driven energy to facilitate convergence of the motion of the domain wall DW.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">A data read operation is as follows. At the time of data reading, a read current is so supplied as to flow between the pinned layer <b>30</b> and the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>. For example, the read current flows from any of the current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>to the pinned layer <b>30</b> through the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> and the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b>. Alternatively, the read current flows from the pinned layer <b>30</b> to any of the current supply terminals <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>through the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> and the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>. Based on the read current or a read potential, the resistance value of the MTJ is detected and the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is sensed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">4. Effects</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0079">According to the present exemplary embodiment, as described above, the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> is so provided as to be in contact with a part of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> in the domain wall motion type MRAM. Due to this simple structure, it is possible to easily achieve the domain wall introduction and the domain wall position control with respect to the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080">According to the present exemplary embodiment, there is no need to provide the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> with the constricted section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As a result, the miniaturization and high-integration of element become possible. Moreover, there is no need to provide the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> with the difference in level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As a result, the increase in the manufacturing costs can be prevented. Furthermore, there is no need to adopt the method of controlling the domain wall position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Therefore, it is possible to well control the domain wall position in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> having the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0081">Moreover, in the case where the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b> is formed on the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, there is no leakage magnetic field from the anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>45</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The leakage magnetic field may affect the domain wall motion in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. From a view point of write characteristics, the configuration according to the present exemplary embodiment by which the leakage magnetic field is prevented is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">5. Modification Examples</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">The magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment can be modified variously. Various modification examples will be described below. It should be noted that the same reference numerals are given to the same components as those described above, and an overlapping description will be omitted as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">5-1. First Modification Example</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a first modification example. In the first modification example, a part of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> is formed to be wider than the other portion. The wide portion is used as the above-mentioned second region R<b>2</b>. The wide second region R<b>2</b> is adjacent to the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> across the second boundary B<b>2</b>. When the write current flows in the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>, the current density in the wide second region R<b>2</b> becomes lower than the current density in the adjacent magnetization switching region <b>13</b>. As a result, the domain wall DW is less likely to intrude into the second region R<b>2</b>. That is, the domain wall DW certainly stops at the second boundary B<b>2</b> between the second region R<b>2</b> and the adjacent region. Consequently, the control of the position of the domain wall DW becomes more precise.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086">From a view point of stopping the movement of the domain wall DW, the width of the second region R<b>2</b> just needs to be large at least at the second boundary B<b>2</b>. In other words, the width of the second region R<b>2</b> at the second boundary B<b>2</b> just needs to be larger than a width of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> at the second boundary B<b>2</b>. As a result, the current density of the write current decreases across the second boundary B<b>2</b> from the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> towards the second region R<b>2</b>, and thus the domain wall movement stops at the second boundary B<b>2</b>. The width of the second region R<b>2</b> may become smaller or larger as away from the second boundary B<b>2</b> outward.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087">5-2. Second Modification Example</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a second modification example. In the second modification example, the first region R<b>1</b> is formed to be wider than the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>, similarly to the first modification example. That is, the first region R<b>1</b> is adjacent to the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> across the first boundary B<b>1</b>, and the width of the first region R<b>1</b> at the first boundary B<b>1</b> is larger than a width of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> at the first boundary B<b>1</b>. As a result, the current density of the write current decreases across the first boundary B<b>1</b> from the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> towards the first region R<b>1</b>, and thus the domain wall movement certainly stops at the first boundary B<b>1</b>. The width of the first region R<b>1</b> may become smaller or larger as away from the first boundary B<b>1</b> outward. It is also possible that the width of the second region R<b>2</b> is the same as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and only the first region R<b>1</b> is formed to be wide.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">5-3. Third Modification Example</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a third modification example. In the third modification example, the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> is not in direct contact with the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. Instead, the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> is in contact with a sensor layer <b>39</b> that is a ferromagnetic layer different from the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. That is, the pinned layer <b>30</b> is connected to the sensor layer <b>39</b> through the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b>, and the pinned layer <b>30</b>, the tunnel barrier layer <b>32</b> and the sensor layer <b>39</b> form an MTJ. The magnetization direction of the sensor layer <b>39</b> is reversible, and the sensor layer <b>39</b> plays a role of a magnetization free layer (free layer) of a typical MRAM. The sensor layer <b>39</b> is electrically connected to the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> through the isolation metal layer <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">According to the present modification example, the sensor layer <b>39</b> is magnetically coupled with the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> included in the current supply region RA of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. That is, the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is reflected in the magnetization direction of the sensor layer <b>39</b>. When the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is switched, the magnetization direction of the sensor layer <b>39</b> also is switched accordingly. Therefore, to sense a magnetization state of the sensor layer <b>39</b> by using the MTJ means to sense a magnetization state of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. That is, according to the present modification example, the magnetization state of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> is remotely sensed by using the sensor layer <b>39</b> that is magnetically coupled with the magnetization switching region <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">In the present modification example, the pinned layer <b>30</b> and the sensor layer <b>39</b> may have the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as in the case of the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the pinned layer <b>30</b> and the sensor layer <b>39</b> may have in-plane magnetic anisotropy. In the case of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the pinned layer <b>30</b> and the sensor layer <b>39</b> respectively have magnetizations in in-plane directions. It should be noted that, in the case of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy, it is necessary to displace a center of the sensor layer <b>39</b> from a center of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> in order to reflect the magnetization direction of the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> in the magnetization direction of the sensor layer <b>39</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the sensor layer <b>39</b> and the pinned layer <b>30</b> are formed at a position displaced in the Y-direction from the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b>. In other words, the sensor layer <b>39</b> and the pinned layer <b>30</b> are so formed as to partially overlap with the magnetization switching region <b>13</b> (current supply region RA).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">In the present modification example, the MTJ (pinned layer <b>30</b>, sensor layer <b>39</b>) used for the data reading is separated from the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> in which the write current flows. In other words, the MTJ contributing to read characteristics is separated from the magnetic recording layer <b>10</b> contributing to write characteristics. It is therefore possible to optimize the read characteristics and the write characteristics independently of each other, which is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">6. Configuration of MRAM</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an example of a configuration of an MRAM according to the present exemplary embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an MRAM <b>60</b> has a memory cell array <b>61</b> in which a plurality of magnetic memory cells <b>1</b> are arranged in a matrix form. The memory cell array <b>61</b> includes not only the magnetic memory cells <b>1</b> used for the data recording but also reference cells <b>1</b><i>r </i>which are referred to at the time of data reading. A structure of the reference cell <b>1</b><i>r </i>is the same as that of the magnetic memory cell <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096">Each magnetic memory cell <b>1</b> has select transistors TR<b>1</b> and TR<b>2</b> in addition to the magnetoresistance element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. One of source/drain of the select transistor TR<b>1</b> is connected to the first current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and the other thereof is connected to a first bit line BL<b>1</b>. One of source/drain of the select transistor TR<b>2</b> is connected to the second current supply terminal <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and the other thereof is connected to a second bit line BL<b>2</b>. Gates of the select transistors TR<b>1</b> and TR<b>2</b> are connected to a word line WL. The pinned layer <b>30</b> of the magnetoresistance element is connected to a ground line and an initialization power source through interconnections.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097">The word line WL is connected to an X selector <b>62</b>. In the data writing and reading, the X selector <b>62</b> selects a word line WL connected to a target memory cell <b>1</b><i>s </i>as a selected word line WLs. The first bit line BL<b>1</b> is connected to a Y-side current termination circuit <b>64</b>, and the second bit line BL<b>2</b> is connected to a Y selector <b>63</b>.

The Y-side current termination circuit <b>64</b> selects a first bit line BL<b>1</b> connected to the target memory cell <b>1</b><i>s </i>as a selected first bit line BL<b>1</b><i>s. </i></p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">A Y-side current source circuit <b>65</b> supplies or draws a predetermined write current (IW<b>1</b>, IW<b>2</b>) with respect to the selected second bit line BL<b>2</b><i>s </i>at the time of data writing. A Y-side power source circuit <b>66</b> supplies a predetermined voltage to the Y-side current termination circuit <b>64</b> at the time of data writing. As a result, the write current (IW<b>1</b>, IW<b>2</b>) flows into the Y selector <b>63</b> or flows out from the Y selector <b>63</b>. The above-mentioned X selector <b>62</b>, Y selector <b>63</b>, Y-side current termination circuit <b>64</b>, Y-side current source circuit <b>65</b> and Y-side power source circuit <b>66</b> constitute a &#x201c;write current supply circuit&#x201d; for supplying the write currents IW<b>1</b> and IW<b>2</b> to the magnetic memory cells <b>1</b>.</p>
