<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to semi-automatic pistols. More particularly, the present invention is directed to semi-automatic pistols having improved feeding and extraction of ammunition and improved jamming avoidance.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is highly desirable for semi-automatic pistols to have precise controlled timing of all the elements of its firing cycle. Such a design would provide improved feeding and extraction of ammunition, avoidance of jamming, particularly between ammunition and the pistol's barrel during a firing sequence, and provide improved case extraction and round in-feeding during a firing sequence.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a semi-automatic pistol is provided which includes a barrel having a bore, a chamber, an outside surface, a front end and a chamber end, a frame, and a slide adapted for linear motion along the frame during a firing sequence. The slide has a forward end and a block end, the forward end having an upper cam follower surface on an inside surface adjacent to the barrel and a lower cam follower surface on the inside surface adjacent to the barrel. The barrel has three cam surfaces, including a ramp cam surface adjacent to the chamber end of the barrel to effect locking and unlocking of the barrel relative to the slide during the firing sequence, a bottom cam surface and a top cam surface. The bottom cam surface and the top cam surface each are on the outside surface of the barrel and extend from the front end toward the chamber end of the barrel. The bottom cam surface has an undulating surface that moves against the lower cam follower surface of the slide and the top cam surface has an undulating surface that moves against the upper cam follower surface of the slide to cause oscillation of the barrel while the slide moves from a battery position to a fully retracted position and back to the battery position during the firing sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Preferably, movement of a trigger of the pistol to a firing position causes the slide to retract relative to the frame and a ramp cam follower on the frame to move against the ramp cam surface to cause the chamber end of the barrel to move downward relative to the frame to release the barrel from fixed engagement with the slide to allow the slide to begin movement to a retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A barrel for a semi-automatic pistol is also provided which includes a bore, an outside surface, a front end and a chamber end. The barrel has a bottom cam surface and a top cam surface. The bottom cam surface and the top cam surface are each on the outside surface of the barrel and extend from the front end toward the chamber end of the barrel. The bottom cam surface and said top cam surface each have an undulating surface to cause oscillation of the barrel while the slide moves from a battery position to a fully retracted position and back to the battery position during a firing sequence. The barrel may also include a ramp cam surface adjacent to the chamber end of the barrel to effect locking and unlocking of the barrel relative to a slide of the pistol during a firing sequence.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention will be illustrated in more detail with reference to the following embodiments, but it should be understood that the present invention is not deemed to be limited thereto. Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout the several views, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a semi-automatic pistol <b>10</b> having a barrel <b>12</b> with synchronized cams in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The barrel <b>12</b> can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. The barrel <b>12</b> has a central bore <b>14</b>, an outside surface <b>16</b>, a front end <b>18</b> and a chamber end <b>20</b>. As can be seen in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b>-<b>10</b>, the semiautomatic pistol <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>22</b>, a slide <b>24</b>, a firing pin assembly <b>26</b>, a trigger <b>28</b> and other elements common to semiautomatic pistols. The pistol <b>10</b> has a firing sequence typical to semi-automatic pistols and, therefore, will not be described in detail here. The slide <b>24</b> slides on rails that provide for linear motion of the slide <b>24</b> along the frame <b>22</b> during a firing sequence. The slide <b>24</b> has a forward end <b>30</b> and a block end <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with the present invention the barrel <b>12</b> is caused by elements of the frame <b>22</b> and slide <b>24</b> to follow a unique movement during a firing sequence to provide improved feeding and extraction of ammunition, and avoidance of jamming. Specifically, the forward end <b>30</b> of the slide <b>24</b> has an upper cam follower surface <b>34</b> on an inside surface <b>36</b> adjacent to the barrel <b>12</b>. Additionally, the forward end <b>30</b> of the slide <b>24</b> has a lower cam follower surface <b>38</b> on an inside surface <b>36</b> adjacent to the barrel <b>12</b>. The barrel <b>12</b> preferably has three cam surfaces. First, the barrel <b>12</b> has a ramp cam surface <b>40</b> adjacent to the chamber end <b>20</b> of the barrel <b>12</b> to effect locking and unlocking of the barrel <b>12</b> relative to the slide <b>24</b> during a firing sequence. Second, the barrel <b>12</b> has a bottom cam surface <b>42</b> on its bottom side <b>44</b>. Third, the barrel has a top cam surface <b>46</b> on its top side <b>48</b>. The bottom cam surface <b>42</b> and the top cam surface <b>46</b> are each on the outside surface of the barrel <b>12</b> and extend from the front end <b>18</b> toward the chamber end <b>20</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>. The bottom cam surface <b>42</b> and the top cam surface <b>46</b> each have an undulating surface relative to the longitudinal axis of the barrel <b>12</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-10</figref> to cause oscillation of the barrel <b>12</b> while the slide <b>24</b> moves from a battery position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to a fully retracted position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and back to the battery position during a firing sequence of the pistol. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref> depict this movement of the barrel <b>12</b> during various instances in the firing sequence, as will be described in more detail below. Each undulating surface begins at the front end <b>18</b>, curves outwardly relative to the longitudinal axis of the barrel <b>12</b>, then curves inwardly relative to the longitudinal axis of the barrel <b>12</b>, then curves outwardly relative to the longitudinal axis of the barrel <b>12</b> and then curves inwardly relative to the longitudinal axis of the barrel <b>12</b>, to cause oscillation of the barrel <b>12</b> while the slide <b>24</b> moves from a battery position to a fully retracted position and back to the battery position during a firing sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the pistol <b>10</b> in battery (i.e., firing) position. As can be seen, the cartridge <b>58</b> is in the chamber <b>60</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>, the breech face end <b>50</b> of the barrel <b>12</b> is abutted against the slide block <b>52</b>, and protuberances <b>54</b> on the slide are engaged with mating grooves <b>56</b> on the barrel <b>12</b> to secure the barrel <b>12</b> to the slide <b>24</b>. Ramp cam follower <b>66</b> on the frame <b>22</b> (a pin integral to frame <b>22</b>) is stationary at the right side of the ramp cam surface <b>40</b> on the bottom of the barrel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pistol <b>10</b> immediately subsequent to firing, shown in an unlocked position with the slide partially retracted as it moves rearward. Here, comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, movement of the trigger <b>28</b> of the pistol to a firing position causes the slide <b>24</b> to begin is rearward travel during a firing sequence such that the ramp cam surface <b>40</b> of the barrel <b>12</b> moves against the ramp cam follower <b>66</b> on the frame <b>22</b> to cause the front end <b>18</b> of the barrel to move upward and the chamber end <b>20</b> of the barrel <b>12</b> to move downward relative to the frame <b>22</b> to release the barrel <b>12</b> from fixed engagement with the slide <b>24</b> to allow the slide <b>24</b> to begin movement to a retracted position. The ramp cam follower <b>66</b> is now located on the left side of the ramp cam surface <b>40</b> on the bottom of the barrel <b>12</b> (i.e., the barrel <b>12</b> has moved relative to the ramp cam follower <b>66</b> on the frame). As can be seen, the bullet <b>62</b> has left the casing <b>64</b> of the cartridge <b>58</b> in the chamber <b>60</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>, the breech face end <b>50</b> of the barrel <b>12</b> has moved slightly downward off the block <b>52</b>, and protuberances <b>54</b> on the slide are disengaged with mating grooves <b>56</b> on the barrel <b>12</b>. The slide <b>24</b> has begun its rearward travel. The upper cam follower surface <b>34</b> begins to follow the top cam surface <b>46</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>, and lower cam follower surface <b>38</b> begins to follow the bottom cam surface <b>44</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>, causing the barrel <b>12</b> to begin its undulating movement during a firing sequence. The top cam surface <b>46</b> and the bottom cam surface <b>44</b> may act on their respective cam follower surfaces <b>34</b>, <b>38</b> simultaneously at certain points of the travel or the top cam surface <b>46</b> and the bottom cam surface <b>44</b> may act independently during any specific point of the firing sequence. That is, all cam surfaces and mating cam follower surfaces need not be in contact with one another at all points of the firing sequence. See the slide <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pistol <b>10</b> shown in a case pre-ejected position with the slide <b>24</b> further retracted from the frame <b>22</b> as compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as it moves rearward during a firing sequence. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pistol <b>10</b> shown in a case ejected position, with the slide further retracted (but not fully retracted) as it moves rearward. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pistol <b>10</b> shown in an open rear position with the slide fully retracted. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pistol <b>10</b> shown in a feed-in position, with the slide in a partially retracted position, as it moves forward during a firing sequence. As can be seen when comparing these figures to one another and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the upper cam follower surface <b>34</b> generally follows the top cam surface <b>46</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>, and lower cam follower surface <b>38</b> generally follows the bottom cam surface <b>44</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>, causing the barrel <b>12</b> to oscillate during a firing sequence. Again, during any particular point in the firing sequence, the top cam surface <b>46</b> may not necessarily be in contact with the upper cam follower surface <b>34</b> and the bottom cam surface <b>44</b> may not necessarily be in contact with the lower cam follower surface <b>38</b>.</p>
