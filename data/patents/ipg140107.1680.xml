<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a dual differential semi-active actuator for interaction tasks and fast motion. More specifically, the invention relates to a dual differential semi-active actuator fit for robotic interaction tasks, force control tasks or fast motion tasks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most modern robotic systems are fast and repeatable position controlled machines. However, despite extensive R&#x26;D efforts, they mostly remain confined to controlled areas where they execute specific pre-programmed actions. Furthermore, they still display limited performances in tasks such as grinding, polishing, surface following and complex assembly. Moreover, even if many economically interesting man-machine interaction applications have been identified (physical therapy, training assistance, surgery assistance, manual tasks teaching, sport training, ortheses and prostheses motorization, haptics, teleoperation of interacting machines, etc.), very few have been implemented successfully.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Over the last 25 years, some researchers tried to identify and revise design paradigms with one objective in mind: to create robotic systems capable of safe and versatile interactions, which led to the development of interaction control theory. Unfortunately, classic actuators proved to be unfit for its usage and unfit for safe and versatile interaction, primarily because of high output impedance (inertia and friction) and because of the usual non-collocation of sensing and actuating transducers when force feedback is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A safe and versatile actuator, fit for a variety of interaction tasks, should possess at least four basic characteristics: 1) high force or torque density; 2) sufficient force bandwidth; 3) very low output impedance; and 4) high-fidelity force display capability. However, no classic actuator simultaneously exhibits all of these basic characteristics.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">Non-restrictive illustrative embodiments of the actuator according to the present invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">Generally speaking, the actuator according to the non-restrictive illustrative embodiments of the present invention relates to a new type of actuation mechanism using two semi-active actuators coupled to an input velocity source and to an output using two mechanical differentials. The configuration is such that the actuator's output force (or torque) is controlled in both directions by a combination of the braking forces of the semi-active actuators. The concept enables: 1) high force or torque density; 2) high bandwidth; 3) very low output impedance; and 4) high-fidelity force display capability. These characteristics enable precise force control, fast velocity control in addition to safe and versatile robotic interactions.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Introduction to Actuator Theory</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">An actuator is a mechanism that transforms, in a controllable manner, a particular form of energy (thermal, electrical, chemical, hydraulic, mechanical, etc.) into mechanical power and vice versa. In the present disclosure, an actuator can be, in particular but not exclusively, an aggregation of several subsystems including, for example:</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">control electronics;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">power electronics;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">energy transducer(s);</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">state sensor(s); and</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">transmission mechanism(s).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">A n degree of freedom robotic system is connected to a load via n power exchange (interaction) ports. The state of each interaction port is defined via two variables: a generalized force and a generalized speed. It is impossible to control independently the two interaction state variables of a given port. Classic control focuses on one of the two variables.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">For velocity (or position) control, the actuator ideally acts as a velocity source interacting with a force load. The actuator should control the speed profile transmitted to the load despite any force encountered. Real actuators designed to reach performances close to an ideal velocity source are often implemented using high mechanical impedance (inertia, friction, stiffness) components. This impedance eases the rejection of force disturbances. Flow controlled hydraulic transducers and high ratio geared electromagnetic (EM) motors are good examples. High performance velocity control is also possible with low output impedance actuators however, higher force bandwidth is necessary to counteract disturbances efficiently. Velocity control of a direct-drive EM motor is a good example.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">For force control, the actuator ideally acts as a force source interacting with a velocity load. The actuator should control perfectly the force (or torque) profile transmitted to the load despite output motion. Real actuators designed to reach performances as close as possible to an ideal source of force are implemented using components with very low mechanical impedance. Output impedance can be viewed as the sensitivity of output force to output motion and is therefore detrimental. A second issue is that, if high-fidelity force control is desired, the transmission between the force generation phenomenon and the system's output should add little un-modeled force noise. Because most high force density actuators present a high impedance (inertia and friction), and because there is substantial hard-to-model force noise added by the transmissions, force control can often be a challenge.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">A large class of robotic tasks is realized with low power exchange: picking and placing light objects, slowly assembling simple parts, pushing on a rigid wall. For these simple tasks, classic feedback based control of velocity or force is generally sufficient if the appropriate actuator is used. However, for complex robotic tasks with non negligible power exchanges (manipulation, locomotion, high power haptics, etc.), the lack of precise interaction models, the difficulties to precisely measure the task associated physical quantities in real-time and the non-collocation of sensing and actuating transducers have negative effects on the performance of simple force or simple velocity controllers that tend to display instabilities and which are therefore inadequate for safe and versatile interactions. To cope with these issues, researchers proposed a new approach named &#x201c;interaction control&#x201d; that refers to the regulation of the robot's dynamic behavior at its ports of interaction. It involves specifying a relationship between motion and force and implementing a control law that attempts to minimize deviation from this relationship. This relationship can be expressed, for example, as a desired port impedance (Z<sub>ref</sub>), which specifies the desired output force (F) function of the measured speed ({dot over (x)}) expressed as</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0050">In robotic systems, safety issues arise when forces are not controlled or limited to acceptable levels. During an unexpected impact or during an inaccurate manipulation, even before any controller takes notice or can take effective actions, the natural impedance of the system, typically due in a large part to the actuators natural (effective) impedance, creates large loads. Once the controller takes notice, a large force bandwidth can then help in taking the appropriate counter-measures. Thus, a safe actuator should present very low natural impedance and high bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">In robotic interaction tasks, versatility can be defined as the ability to control accurately, and over a wide range, the interaction variables: force, speed or the impedance relationship. Accurate force or impedance control necessitates high-fidelity force display capabilities. The capacity to display low virtual impedances, even at high frequencies, requires low natural impedance and high bandwidth. Finally, high performance in velocity control, using an actuator with low natural impedance, is only possible if sufficient force bandwidth is available.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">The quest for safety and versatility justifies the need for low natural impedance, large bandwidth and accurate force display capabilities. High force density, on the other hand, is necessary to enable the integration in useful robotic systems and can also contribute to safety if the actuator body is put into motion by the system.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Actuators Designed for Interaction Control</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">Implementation of machines able to control their interactions safely and in a versatile manner begins with the use of actuators specially designed for that purpose, which is a relatively new research trend. The available publications show that they are difficult to implement. Existing actuators designed for interaction tasks can be categorized by the following.
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">

    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0054">Simple Impedance Control of an Electromechanical Actuator. The first attempt to interaction control was conducted using an EM motor with current being controlled in open loop and a standard gearbox. Open loop means inherent control stability. However, the gearbox amplifies the inertia and friction of the motor, reduces impact tolerance and introduces noise on the force. The performance was sufficient to confirm the promises of impedance control but is insufficient for most robotic applications.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0055">Force Feedback Actuators. They comprise a stiff force sensor placed in series with a classic high impedance actuator such as a geared EM motor. The interaction is controlled using force feedback to partially mask the natural output impedance at low frequencies. Unfortunately, the non-collocation of the sensing and actuating transducers limits stable feedback gains and stable interaction bandwidth. Furthermore, the high impedance can be a threat to safety.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0056">Impedance Controllable Direct Drive Actuators (DDA). Direct drive EM motors are usually low inertia devices which have a known relationship between the winding current and the output force. A fast and inherently stable force control can be achieved using a current feed-forward scheme. However, because no gearbox is used, the torque to weight ratio is small, which greatly limit the range of possible applications.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0057">Series Elastic Actuators (SEA). They use a compliant element placed between a high impedance actuator and a force sensor. By doing so, large amplitude bandwidth is traded for lower apparent inertia, better force resolution, improved control stability and better impact tolerance.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0058">Differential Elastic Actuators. Their working principle is similar to the SEA, but the use of a mechanical differential enables a simplified integration, especially for rotational actuators.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0059">Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA). These actuators are able to vary their natural output stiffness by mechanical means. Most VSA make use of two non-linear mechanical springs working in an antagonistic configuration. The resulting actuators are inherently stable and impact tolerant. The main drawback are mechanical complexity and lower force-density.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0060">Parallel Coupled Micro-Macro Actuators (PaCMMA) and Distributed Macro-Mini (DM<sub>2</sub>) Actuators. The PaCMMA and the DM<sub>2 </sub>actuator use a high power SEA in parallel with a low power DDA. The SEA contributes for &#x201c;low frequencies and high power&#x201d; forces while the DDA actuator contributes for &#x201c;high frequencies and low power&#x201d; forces. The system is controlled in a closed-loop fashion using a force sensor at the output. The dynamic performances are improved compared to the SEA, but complexity and volume are increased.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0061">Variable Damper Actuators (VDA). These actuators use a serially or differentially coupled rheological fluid clutch placed between a high impedance actuator and the load. The variable output force is obtained by modulating the clutching torque. Advantageously, the environment (the load) is isolated from the inertia of the high impedance actuator. However, to reverse output force, the input speed must be reversed, thus limiting the bandwidth when crossing zero force. Also, the clutch friction limits the capability to display accurately small forces.

<p id="p-0050" num="0062">Semi-active actuators are devices which can only dissipate mechanical energy. When compared to active actuators with similar forces, many are smaller, lighter and display lower output inertia. Different semi-active actuators may be used to embody the present invention such as, but not limited to: electrorheological or magnetorheological (MR) fluid brakes, dry friction brakes, magnetic particles brakes, electromagnetic hysteresis brakes, rotary dampers, etc. For simplicity, the following description is limited to MR brakes but it is to be understood that other types of semi-active actuators may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0063">The rheological behavior of MR fluids is modified by the application of a magnetic field. This change is manifested, when the fluid is sheared, by the development of a yield stress that is more or less proportional to the magnitude of the field. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown an illustrative example of a MR rotary brake <b>10</b> that utilizes one or more interspersed rotor <b>12</b> and stator <b>14</b> blades to shear MR fluid in gaps <b>13</b> therebetween, the multiple gaps <b>13</b> allowing for increased torque. The magnetic flux can be created using, for example, an electromagnetic coil <b>16</b>. Such MR brakes can present high torque to weight ratio, low inertia, high bandwidth, wide dynamic torque range and low power consumption. They can be used to create simple, quiet and rapid interfaces between electronics and mechanical systems. For the purpose of the following description, the symbol <b>20</b> illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will be used to schematically represent a semi-active actuator such as a MR brake or a MR clutch (in a linear configuration).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a graph of the typical braking torque T versus field strength H and angular speed &#x3c9;. The field dependant yield torque, which can be modulated using, for example, a tension or current feed-forward to the electromagnetic coil <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is T<sub>y</sub>(H). B and T<sub>f </sub>are viscous and dry friction terms. Note that a stiction phenomenon is visible at low speeds. Equation 1 is a good approximation of the output torque if there is sufficient relative motion between the rotor <b>12</b> and stator <b>14</b> blades. Equation 2 is the linear equivalent of Equation 1 (linear force F instead of torque T) where {dot over (x)} is the linear velocity and C is the linear coefficient for viscous friction.

The Opposed Semi-Active Sub-Actuators Concept
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0065">The opposed semi-active sub-actuators concept uses two similar semi-active clutches being driven at the same velocity but in opposite directions by an external velocity source [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5]. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the outputs of two semi-active actuators (SAA) <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are connected together to form the output member <b>47</b> of the opposed semi-active sub-actuators system <b>40</b>. The input member of the first SAA <b>42</b>, for example an MR clutch, rotates in a first direction <b>43</b>, for example a clockwise (CW) direction, while the input member of the second SAA <b>44</b>, for example an MR clutch, rotates in a second opposed direction <b>45</b>, for example a counterclockwise (CCW) direction. The first SAA <b>42</b> controls the CW output torque while the second SAA <b>44</b> controls the CCW output torque as long as the output member <b>46</b> does not rotate faster than the SAAs <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> input members (i.e. the frames of SAA <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0066">In addition to the fact that the load is isolated from the inertia of the velocity source, many advantages come with opposing two similar semi-active actuators. For example, because of the symmetry of the design, dry friction of the clutches (e.g. the first <b>42</b> and second <b>44</b> SAAs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is cancelled and is not transmitted to the output. If input speeds are similar, viscous drag is also balanced when output speed is zero. Stiction is eliminated because there is always a relative motion in the clutches. Because of these advantages, combined with the fact that clutching forces can, depending on the semi-active actuator technology, be controlled quickly and accurately by, for example, modulating the feed-forward tension or current to both semi-active actuators, this concept can be used to create a high performance (high force density, high bandwidth, very low output impedance and high-fidelity force display capability) inherently stable force source.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Mechanical Differential</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0067">Mechanical differentials are mechanisms possessing three ports among which force is distributed following a know relationship. Any speed reducer, including, among others, a standard gearbox, a harmonic drive, a cycloidal gearbox, a bar mechanism, a lead or ball screw with corresponding nut mechanism and a cable mechanism, can be used as a mechanical differential. A lever analogy can be used to explain the working principle of differential mechanisms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>illustrate such lever analogy without (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>) and with (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>) inertial effects considered. In the case where the inertial effects are not considered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>), the relationships between port O<sub>1</sub>, O<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>3</sub>, velocities {dot over (x)}<sub>1</sub>, {dot over (x)}<sub>2 </sub>and {dot over (x)}<sub>3 </sub>and forces F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3 </sub>are described by Equation 3 and Equation 4. If inertial effects are considered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>), as illustrated by the addition of lumped masses m<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>2 </sub>and m<sub>3</sub>, the force relationships can rather be as expressed by Equation 5.

In comparison, MR brakes are smaller and simpler since the output is the only rotating member.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0071">Because of the use of clutches, the opposed semi-active sub-actuators concept is complex to integrate. This drawback can be significantly reduced by using two differentially coupled brakes instead of the two serially coupled clutches. Accordingly, the present invention uses two semi-active actuators (brakes) coupled to an input velocity source and to the system's output using two mechanical differentials. The configuration is such that the system's output force can be controlled, in both directions, by a combination of the two braking forces.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0072">As previously mentioned, various semi-active actuator technologies may be used to embody the present invention. However, for the sake of simplicity, MR brakes will be used to illustrate the working principle.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0073">A possible configuration of the dual differential semi-active actuator concept is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> using the lever analogy to explain its working principle. A velocity source (not shown) moves the input ports O<sub>1 </sub>and O<sub>4 </sub>of two mechanical differentials <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> in opposed directions at velocity {dot over (x)}<sub>1</sub>. Pivots O<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>5 </sub>are connected to mechanically grounded brakes (not shown) producing the braking forces F(H<sub>1</sub>) and F(H<sub>2</sub>) as expressed by Equation 2. Pivots O<sub>3 </sub>and O<sub>6 </sub>are linked together and form the system's output. To consider inertial effects, lumped masses are added: m<sub>1 </sub>is associated with the velocity source inertia and a fraction of the differential mechanism inertia, m<sub>out </sub>is associated with the output link inertia and a fraction of the inertia of the mechanical differentials <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and m<sub>3 </sub>is associated with the inertia of a brake and a fraction of the differential mechanism. Both input speeds, both differential mechanisms and both brakes are considered similar to facilitate the description of the working principle and the highlight of possible advantages. If the input velocity is large enough to ensure that, despite output motion, both brakes output members are moving in opposite directions, the output force F<sub>out </sub>can be expressed by Equation 6 and Equation 7. It is a linear combination of the two controllable braking forces and of a term that is the natural output impedance Z<sub>out</sub>(s) where s is the Laplace complex argument.

<p id="p-0062" num="0074">The previous relationships illustrate some properties of this configuration of the actuation principle. As with the opposed semi-active sub-actuators concept, the symmetry of the design is such that dry friction terms of the MR brakes are not transmitted to the output. Viscous force is balanced when output speed is zero. Stiction problems are eliminated since there is always a relative motion in the brakes. Backlash is eliminated since the reaction force in each differential mechanism is always in the same direction. Furthermore, as seen in Equation 6 and Equation 7, output force is not affected by the motion of the input velocity source which, therefore, does not need to be precisely controlled. Another property is that because of the brakes very low output inertia, the natural output impedance (Z<sub>out</sub>) can be made very small compared to the one of classic actuators, such as a standard geared EM motor. Other advantages of an actuator based on this concept will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Possible Configurations</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0075">To simplify the description of the present invention, three illustrative configurations, among a plurality of possible ones, will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0076">More specifically, the first configuration, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, is equivalent to the configuration used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to introduce the dual mechanical differential concept with the addition of the two semi-active actuators, i.e. MR brakes <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, connected to pivots O<sub>3 </sub>and O<sub>6</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0077">In the second configuration, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the input velocity ports O<sub>1 </sub>and O<sub>4 </sub>of the two differentials <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> move in the same direction while pivots O<sub>3 </sub>and O<sub>5 </sub>are connected to the two MR brakes <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively, and pivots O<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>6</sub>, are linked together to form the system's output. Because of the dual differential configuration, the output force is still controllable in both directions.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0078">As for the third configuration, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the input velocity ports O<sub>1 </sub>and O<sub>4 </sub>of the two differentials <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> also move in the same direction while pivots O<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>5 </sub>are connected to the two MR brakes <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively, and pivots O<sub>3 </sub>and O<sub>6</sub>, are connected to an external mechanism <b>60</b> (represented by a third lever) to form the system's output. The external mechanism <b>60</b> is necessary so that braking forces have opposed effects on the output force.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0079">These illustrative configurations can be implemented using, for example, a cable mechanism, a lead or ball screw with corresponding nut mechanism, a bar mechanism, a cycloidal gearbox, an epicyclic gearbox, a standard gearbox, a harmonic drive, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0080">The output force may be controlled by, for example, modulating the feed-forward tension or current to both semi-active actuators. Alternatively, the output force may also be controlled using a torque feedback control scheme with a force or torque sensor between the output and the load.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0081">It should be noted that, as long as the output force is controllable in both directions using the two braking forces provided by the MR brakes <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, lever <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> lengths may be varied independently and port O<sub>1 </sub>to O<sub>6 </sub>functions (link to input velocity source, link to brake or link to system's output) may be permuted without departing from the spirit and nature of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0106">It is to be understood that although reference has been made primarily to an EM motor as a velocity source in the above-described illustrative embodiments, such a velocity source for the purpose of the present invention refers to any source of mechanical power that can provide motion such as, for example, powered geared or direct-drive EM motors, piezoelectric motors, hydraulic motors or actuators, pneumatic motors or actuators, combustion engines, turbines, etc.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Advantages of the Dual Differential Semi-Active Actuator Concept</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0107">Common advantages of the dual differential semi-active actuator concept include the following.
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0108">Forces can be controlled with a large bandwidth if the actuator makes use of fast semi-active actuators such as well designed MR brakes. The design is thus suitable for fast force, impedance or position control tasks. Large bandwidth is also useful for safety issues encountered in robotic interaction applications.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0109">Output impedance can be exceptionally low because it can be largely decoupled from the velocity source. A low output inertia actuator performs better at controlling low forces and impedances and can perform interaction tasks more safely. Furthermore, small inertia improves the ability to accelerate and decelerate quickly and enables faster motion and increased productivity.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0110">The actuator force or impedance can, for example, be controlled by modulating the feed-forward current or tension in the MR brakes. This control does not rely on a force feedback loop that can be destabilized by structural modes between the actuating and sensing transducers. Stability concerns have limited force and impedance control performances of many previous approaches relying on force feedback.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0111">The actuator can display high-fidelity force control over a wide dynamic force range. In geared motors, the force amplification transmission adds a lot of hard-to-model noise on the force output. This noise comes from kinematic imperfections, backlash, stiction and non-linear friction. The proposed concept can make use of high force-density semi-active actuators to generate large forces directly and without a need for substantial further force amplification. Consequently, the brakes can be linked to the output through minimal gearing and, therefore, if the braking forces can be controlled accurately, the actuator displays high-fidelity force control over a wide dynamic range.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0112">Backdrivability is a measure of the minimum force required to move the output when no force is generated by the actuator. This notion has often been used to discuss the performance and safety of impedance and force controlled actuators. Because of natural low output impedance, the design is very backdrivable.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0113">The design is robust and impact tolerant. The output force is always controlled, even during impact events where the excess energy is simply dissipated in the brakes. No fragile transmission components or sensors are subject to impulse forces commonly encountered when interacting with unknown environments.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0114">The proposed concept could be fabricated at a reasonable cost. The decoupling effect previously mentioned makes it possible to use a low quality input velocity source such as one with large inertia, long time constants or imprecise velocity control. Furthermore, the associated gearing of the reduction and inversion stage can present a lot of non-linear friction. None of these are transmitted to the actuator output. Additionally, the gearing can be machined with large tolerances since the backlash is eliminated by the internal opposition of forces.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0115">The elimination of backlash is beneficial to improve the precision of position control tasks. It further enables high inertia mismatch between the actuator and the load without compromising the stability of position or velocity controllers.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0009" num="0116">The actuator is suitable for redundant actuation. A robotic system has redundant actuation if the number of actuators is greater than the number of degrees of freedom. Redundant actuation is known to improve task end-effector stiffness of parallel manipulators, remove uncontrolled behavior at singularities and permit a more homogeneous force output in the task space. Classic (stiff) actuators cannot easily be used for redundant actuation because any error in the position will result in large internal forces which can destabilize or harm the system. The proposed dual differential semi-active actuator is fit for redundant actuation since it is easily backdrivable.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0010" num="0117">Another advantage of the principle is the possibility to use a mechanical bus to convey mechanical power to the different actuated joints. Generally, an actuated system with multiple degrees of freedom has a motor for each joint. Each actuator transforms the energy from an initial type (for example electrical energy) into mechanical energy. Each actuator requires a certain weight and volume to perform the transformation. A mechanical bus is a concept that allows the use of a single mechanical energy source to actuate a plurality of joints, thus lowering, for some applications, overall complexity, volume and mass.
