<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention involves an electrophotographic image forming device, and especially involves a toner cartridge for an electrophotographic image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Arts</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional invention relates to an electrophotographic image forming device, such as a laser printer, a copier or a facsimile machine, in which a toner cartridge is used, which is removable from or mountable to the electrophotographic image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional toner cartridge comprises integral toner cartridges and separated toner cartridges. An integral toner cartridge or process cartridge is at least provided with a photosensitive member, a developing member, and a developer; a separated toner cartridge is at least provided with a developing member and a developer, and the drum unit used together with the separated toner cartridge is at least provided with a photosensitive member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front view of a process cartridge in conventional art, which adopts contact developing mode. The process cartridge comprises a main part <b>10</b>, a first lateral plate <b>11</b>, and a second lateral plate <b>12</b>; the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b> are separately fixed at the two ends of the main part <b>10</b>; the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b> are removable from or mountable to the two ends of the main part <b>10</b>, or form as one body with the main part <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view of the direction A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; as shown in the figure, the main part <b>10</b> of the process cartridge is at least provided with the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b>, the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b>, a toner feeding component <b>15</b>, and a developer (not shown in the figure). After the process cartridge is mounted to an electrophotographic image forming device, the electrophotographic image forming device receives the data from the outside; the laser scanning component of the electrophotographic image forming device scans the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b> of the process cartridge, so as to make an electrostatic latent image to be formed on the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b>; the toner feeding component <b>15</b> receives the power and electric voltage from the electrophotographic image forming device, and feeds the developer stored in the process cartridge to the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b>; with the power and electric voltage provided by the electrophotographic image forming device, the developer is adsorbed to the surface of the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b>; by contacting the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b> closely, the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b> transports the developer to the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b>, and makes the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member developed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b> are respectively provided with the photosensitive member fixing positions <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the developing member fixing positions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the process feeding component fixing positions <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b>, the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b>, and the toner feeding component <b>15</b> are respectively fixed to the process cartridge via the photosensitive member fixing positions <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the developing member fixing positions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the toner feeding component fixing positions <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>on the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b>. For the distances between the photosensitive member fixing positions <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the developing member fixing positions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the toner feeding component fixing positions <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>have been determined when the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b> are made, the center distances between the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b>, the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b>, and the toner feeding component <b>15</b> have been set as fixed values. The manufacturing accuracy of the fixing positions (<b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>) for positioning the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b> and the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b> on the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b> directly affects the working quality of the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b> and the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b>, therefore affect the working quality of the electrophotographic image forming device; any small error that occurs to manufacture the fixing positions for positioning the first embodiment of photosensitive member <b>13</b> and the first embodiment of developing member <b>14</b> on the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b>, will all affect the working quality of the process cartridge, and serious error will even cause that the process cartridge can not operate properly. So, the requirement to the manufacturing accuracy of the first lateral plate <b>11</b> and the second lateral plate <b>12</b> will be very high.</p>

Specially, the second embodiment of photosensitive member <b>33</b> is one of the organic photosensitive drums; the second embodiment of developing member <b>34</b> is one of the magnetic rollers, and the magnetic roller is composed of a magnetic core and a magnetic sleeve; the developer is a kind of magnetic toner.</p>
