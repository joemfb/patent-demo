No. 12/054,752 titled &#x201c;POUCH TYPE LITHIUM SECONDARY BATTERY&#x201d; filed on Mar. 25, 2008, which claims the benefit of Korean Application No. 10-2007-72187 filed on Jul. 19, 2007 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present invention relate to a pouch type lithium secondary battery, and more particularly, to a pouch type lithium secondary battery that can minimize a size of a cell.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a lithium secondary battery uses a non-aqueous electrolyte because the lithium actively reacts with water. The electrolyte may be a solid polymer containing lithium salts or a liquid in which the lithium salts are dissociated from an organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lithium secondary battery can be divided according to a kind of electrolyte used, i.e., lithium metal and lithium ion batteries, both of which use a liquid electrolyte, and lithium ion polymer batteries, which use a solid polymer electrolyte. The lithium ion polymer battery can be divided into a complete solid type lithium ion polymer battery containing no organic electrolyte and a lithium ion polymer battery using a gel type polymer electrolyte containing an organic electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the lithium ion polymer battery, a multi-layer film pouch can be used instead of a metal can as used in the lithium metal and lithium ion batteries. The multi-layer film pouch may be formed of a metal foil and at least one polymer film covering the foil. When such multi-layer film pouch is used, the weight of the secondary cell can be greatly reduced compared to the use of a metal can. Aluminum is usually used as the metal forming the foil in the multi-layer film pouch. The polymer film that forms an inner layer of the pouch film protects the metal foil from the electrolyte and prevents an electrical short between electrode tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The pouch type lithium secondary battery may be formed by sealing an electrode assembly, which includes a cathode, a separator, and an anode stacked and/or wound, in a pouch. Then, the sealed pouch type bare cell is manufactured by bonding upper and lower pouch films to open peripheral parts by heating.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the pouch type bare cell, generally two electrode tabs connected to the electrode assembly extend from the electrode assembly to the outside of the pouch type bare cell. A protection tape is provided to a portion where the two electrode tabs and pouch contact, thereby keeping the two electrode tabs insulated from the pouch during sealing. A stepped part is formed for each electrode tab. The stepped part has a width narrower than that of the protection tape at a sealing portion where the protection tape is provided in the pouch. In the stepped part, a region corresponding to the electrode tab is less pressurized. Thus, a possibility of the electrical short between the metal layer of the pouch and the electrode tabs becomes low and sealing pressure is substantially applied to the peripheral region of the stepped part, thereby improving the safety of the sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the size of the pouch type lithium secondary battery is greatly minimized, the width of the battery in a longitudinal direction of a withdrawn surface of the electrode tab becomes gradually shorter. In the battery having the short width, a gap between the withdrawn electrode tabs becomes very narrow.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the battery having a narrow gap between the electrode tabs, it is difficult to exactly set the electrode tab at a position where the stepped part is formed during a sealing process. Accordingly, when the electrode tab is not properly set at the stepped part-forming position, the electrode tab is electrically shorted or defects in sealing occur.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Particularly, in the battery having a short width between the electrode tabs, it is difficult to weld the electrode tabs to an electrode plate and maintain a proper seal around the electrode tab while reducing distribution of gaps between the electrode tabs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE ASPECTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to aspects of the present invention, a pouch type lithium secondary battery can improve reliability of a product by stabilizing quality of a sealing portion of a pouch case where electrode tabs are withdrawn.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to aspects of the present invention, a pouch type lithium secondary battery can improve efficiency of a manufacturing process by improving workability of assembling and sealing process of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pouch type lithium secondary battery, which includes: an electrode assembly including electrode tabs respectively connected to two electrodes, the two electrodes having different polarities; and a case to house the electrode assembly such that the electrode tabs extend to the outside of the case, wherein one stepped part through which the two electrode tabs simultaneously extend is formed in a sealing portion of the case.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an aspect of the present invention, the two electrode tabs may be surrounded by an insulating member; the two electrode tabs and the insulating member may be located in an internal region of the stepped part; and outer portions of the insulating member may be formed in the sealing portion of the case outside of the stepped part.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect of the present invention, each of the two electrode tabs may be respectively surrounded by an insulating member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an aspect of the present invention, adjacent side edges of each of the insulating members between the two electrode tabs may overlap in the region of the stepped part.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an aspect of the present invention, the insulating members may be respectively wound on the two electrode tabs such that adjacent side edges contact; or, the insulating members may be wound on the two electrode tabs with their adjacent side edges being spaced apart; or, the insulating members may be wound on the two electrode tabs with their adjacent side edges being interlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an aspect of the present invention, the two electrode tabs may be surrounded by one insulating member.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an aspect of the present invention, the insulating member may be a tape.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to an aspect of the present invention, the two electrode tabs may be fixed in one combining member; the combining member may include tab holes through which the two electrode tabs extend; and the combining member may be made of an insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an aspect of the present invention, the two electrode tabs may be respectively attached to uncoated parts of two electrode plates of the electrode assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>100</b> includes an electrode assembly <b>110</b> and a case <b>120</b> in which the electrode assembly <b>110</b> is sealed and housed. The electrode assembly <b>110</b> includes a battery unit <b>111</b>, a cathode tab <b>112</b> and an anode tab <b>113</b> respectively connected to two electrodes of the battery unit <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The battery unit <b>111</b> includes a cathode plate <b>116</b>, an anode plate <b>117</b>, and a separator <b>118</b> disposed between the cathode plate <b>116</b> and the anode plate <b>117</b>. The battery unit <b>111</b> is assembled by interposing the separator <b>118</b> between the cathode plate <b>116</b> and the anode plate <b>117</b> and winding the cathode plate <b>116</b>, the anode plate <b>117</b>, and the separator <b>118</b> together. The cathode plate <b>116</b> of the battery unit <b>111</b> is connected to the cathode tab <b>112</b>, and the anode plate <b>117</b> is connected to the anode tab <b>113</b>. The cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> are respectively connected to external terminals (not shown). Protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> are wound on the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> respectively so as to insulate the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> from the case <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The case <b>120</b> includes a lower case <b>122</b> which houses the battery unit <b>111</b>, and an upper case <b>121</b> which seals an upper surface of the lower case <b>122</b>. A sealing part <b>123</b> is formed on three edges about the periphery of the upper and lower cases <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> at which a seal is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref> show the pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>100</b> in which the electrode assembly <b>110</b> is housed inside the case <b>120</b> and the case <b>120</b> is closed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, in the pouch type lithium secondary battery, a stepped part <b>124</b> is formed corresponding to a portion at which the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> extend through the sealing part <b>123</b> from the inside of the case <b>120</b> to the outside of the case <b>120</b> between the upper case <b>121</b> and the lower case <b>122</b> of the case <b>120</b>. The stepped part <b>124</b> is formed in the sealing part <b>123</b> of the upper case <b>121</b> and the lower case <b>122</b> corresponding to the portion of the sealing part <b>123</b> through which both the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> extend. Although the stepped part <b>124</b> is shown as being oppositely formed in a central edge of the three edges about the periphery of the upper and lower cases <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> in which the seal is formed, the stepped part <b>124</b> is not limited thereto such the stepped part <b>124</b> may be formed in anyone of the three edges about the periphery of the upper and lower cases <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>. Further, there need not be only three edges in which the seal is formed such that all of the periphery may be sealed in such a fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>100</b>, the battery unit <b>111</b> is housed inside the lower case <b>122</b>, and the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> are withdrawn outside the lower case <b>122</b>. Thus, the upper case <b>121</b> seals the lower case <b>122</b>. The cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> are wound with the protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> at portions of the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> which contact the upper and lower cases <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and are sealed at the sealing part <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the sealing part <b>123</b> of the case <b>120</b> as described above, the stepped part <b>124</b> is formed at the portion where the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> are withdrawn. The cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> are located together at the stepped part <b>124</b>. The stepped part <b>124</b> is formed by pressing the withdrawn portion of the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> in the sealing part <b>123</b> by upper and lower jigs after the sealing part <b>123</b> of the upper and lower cases <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> is sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The stepped part <b>124</b>, where the cathode and anode tabs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> are located together, reduces concentration of pressure on regions corresponding to the cathode tab <b>112</b> and anode tab <b>113</b>, thereby reducing the danger of an electrical short between an externally exposed metal layer of the case <b>120</b> and the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b>. In addition, a sealing pressure may be increased on the region of the sealing part <b>123</b> except for the stepped part <b>124</b>, thereby improving sealing safety of the sealing part <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, width D of the stepped part <b>124</b> formed on the sealing part <b>123</b> is wider than a distance D<b>1</b> between the outer edges of the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b>, thereby preventing an electrical short between the cathode and anode tabs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> at the time of forming the stepped part <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The width D of the stepped part <b>124</b> is formed so as to be narrower than a distance D<b>2</b> between outer edges of the protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, thereby allowing an error tolerance with regard to the setting position where the cathode and anode tabs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> and the protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> are withdrawn from the sealing part <b>123</b> and preventing sealing defects.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, in the pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>100</b>, the cathode tab <b>112</b> is wound with the protection tape <b>114</b>, and the anode tab <b>113</b> is wound with the protection tape <b>115</b>. That is, the cathode and anode tabs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> are withdrawn through the sealing part <b>123</b> and wound with the protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, and the cathode and anode tabs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> are located in the region of the stepped part <b>124</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, inside edges of the protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> contact and overlap each other in the stepped part <b>124</b>. The internal region of the stepped part <b>124</b>, i.e., the region of the stepped part <b>124</b> between the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b>, is sealed by the overlapping protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The protection tapes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> may be wound on the cathode and anode tabs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> located in the stepped part <b>124</b> in various configurations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref> show various modification examples of the type of the protection tape wound on the two electrode tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which inside edges of protection tapes <b>114</b>A and <b>115</b>A wound on the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode <b>113</b> tab contact each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which inside edges of protection tapes <b>114</b>B and <b>115</b>B wound on the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode <b>113</b> tab are spaced apart from each other by a distance d. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which inside edges of protection tapes <b>114</b>C and <b>115</b>C wound on the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode <b>113</b> tab are engaged with each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a magnification view of &#x2018;VIII&#x2019; portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the protection tape <b>114</b>A and the protection tape <b>115</b>A surround the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> respectively with their adjacent side edges contacting each other. The two adjacent side edges, i.e., the inside edges, contact each other in the state that the protection tapes are wound on the electrode tabs. Or, the adjacent side edges may be partially overlapped as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. When the stepped part <b>124</b> is formed on the sealing part <b>123</b> in the state in which the protection tape <b>114</b>A and protection tape <b>115</b>A contact each other or are partially overlapped, the protection tapes <b>114</b>A and <b>115</b>A seal the internal region of the stepped part <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrating another modification example, the protection tapes <b>114</b>B and <b>115</b>B surround the cathode tab <b>112</b> and the anode tab <b>113</b> respectively with their adjacent side edges being spaced with the distance d. The distance d is formed as a very fine gap because of the small width between the cathode and anode tabs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. Also, in the state that the protection tapes <b>114</b>B and <b>115</b>B are provided with the distance d therebetween, the stepped part <b>124</b> is formed at the sealing portion <b>123</b> and thus, the protection tapes <b>114</b>B and <b>115</b>B seal the internal region of the stepped part <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrating still another modification example, a projection part <b>114</b>C&#x2032; of the protection tape <b>114</b>C and a projection part <b>115</b>C&#x2032; of the protection tape <b>115</b>C are formed so as to interlock between the protection tape <b>114</b>C of the cathode tab <b>112</b> and protection tape <b>115</b>C of the anode tab <b>113</b>. That is, the projection part <b>114</b>C&#x2032; and a groove part <b>114</b>C&#x2033; are alternatively formed at an inside edge of the protection tape <b>114</b>C of the cathode tab <b>112</b>, and the projection part <b>115</b>C&#x2032; and a groove part <b>115</b>C&#x2033; are alternatively formed at an inside edge of the protection tape <b>115</b>C of the anode tab <b>113</b>. Further, the projection part <b>114</b>C&#x2032; is inserted into the groove part <b>115</b>&#x2033;, and the projection part <b>115</b>C&#x2032; is inserted into the groove part <b>114</b>C&#x2033;. Thus, two facing side edges of the protection tapes <b>114</b>C and <b>115</b>C are engaged with each other in an interlocking shape.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A narrow and long path is formed in the region between adjacent side edges of the protection tape <b>114</b>C of the cathode tab <b>112</b> and protection tape <b>115</b>C of the anode tab <b>113</b> by the combination structure of the interlocking shape. Thus, when sealing process is performed, the sealing is completed even if only a part of the narrow and long path between the protection tapes <b>114</b>C and <b>115</b>C includes the interlocking shape.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view illustrating a pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>200</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>200</b> is constructed so as to surround a cathode tab <b>212</b> and an anode tab <b>213</b> with one protection tape <b>214</b>. When the cathode and anode tabs <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> are surrounded by the one protection tape <b>214</b>, a gap between the cathode and anode tabs <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> is constantly kept. In addition, it is possible to easily set the two electrode tabs <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> at a sealing portion <b>223</b> of a case <b>220</b>. Further, sealing stability is improved in an internal region of a stepped part <b>224</b> formed at the sealing portion <b>223</b> of the case <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show other examples related to an example embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which an electrode tab is attached to a battery unit according to an example embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a pouch battery in which the electrode assembly assembled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is housed in a pouch case and sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, a pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>300</b> is formed by disposing cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> with one combining member <b>314</b> in advance. The combining member <b>314</b> includes tab holes <b>314</b><i>a </i>and <b>314</b><i>b </i>passing through the rectangular body of the combining member <b>314</b>. The cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> respectively extend through the tab holes <b>314</b><i>a </i>and <b>314</b><i>b</i>. The combining member <b>314</b> may be made of an insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">An assembling process of the pouch type lithium secondary battery <b>300</b> will be explained below. First, a separator <b>316</b> is interposed between a cathode plate <b>315</b> and an anode plate <b>317</b> and then a battery unit <b>311</b> is wound. After winding of the battery unit <b>311</b> is finished, the cathode tab <b>312</b> is attached to an uncoated part of the cathode plate <b>315</b>, where an electrode active material is not formed on the cathode plate <b>315</b>. The anode tab <b>313</b> is attached to an uncoated part of the anode plate <b>316</b> on which an electrode active material is not formed. Because the cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> are disposed in the combining member <b>314</b> in advance, a gap between the cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> is constantly kept. Thus, disruption of the gap between the cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">An electrode assembly <b>310</b> with the cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> is received in a lower case <b>322</b>, and an upper case <b>321</b> is sealed to the lower case <b>322</b>. The combining member <b>314</b> fixing the cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> are sealed in the sealing portion <b>323</b>. One stepped part <b>324</b> is formed in the sealing portion <b>323</b>, and thus, the combining member <b>314</b> is sealed in an internal region of the stepped part <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> of the electrode assembly <b>310</b> are withdrawn in parallel through the sealing portion <b>323</b> of the case <b>320</b> during the receiving process in the lower case <b>322</b> of the case <b>320</b>. As such, the cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> are attached to an outermost part of the battery unit <b>311</b>. Accordingly, there is an advantage in that it is easy to control positions of the cathode and anode tabs <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> when the electrode assembly <b>310</b> is received in the lower case <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to aspects of the present invention, workability of attaching the electrode tab to the electrode plate is improved in the short width type battery. In addition, sealing is improved at the sealing portion of the electrode tab and case in sealing of the upper and lower cases. Further, it is easy to control the position of the electrode tabs in the state in which the electrode assembly is housed in the case.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, the pouch type lithium secondary battery according to aspects of the present invention produces the following and/or other effects: First, the quality of the sealing portion of the pouch case where the electrode tabs are withdrawn is stabilized, thereby improving reliability of the secondary battery. Second, workability of assembling and sealing process of the battery is improved, thereby improving efficiency of a manufacturing process.</p>
