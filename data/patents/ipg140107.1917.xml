<p id="p-0004" num="0001">The present invention relates to a coloring composition, an azo compound and an ink.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0002">As computers are spread, inkjet printers have been recently widely used for printing on, for example, paper, film, or fabric at home besides offices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0003">An inkjet recording method may be a manner of discharging liquid drops by applying pressure by a piezo element, a manner of discharging liquid drops by generating bubbles in an ink by heat, a manner using an ultrasonic wave, or a manner of absorptively discharging liquid drops by an electrostatic force. As an ink for inkjet recording, an aqueous ink, an oily ink, or a solid (melt type) ink is used. Among these inks, the aqueous ink is mainly used from the viewpoints of production, handling property, odor, safety, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0004">A colorant used in the ink for the inkjet recording needs to ensure high solubility to a solvent, recording at a high concentration, favorable colors, excellent fastness to light, heat, air, water, or chemicals, good settlement to an image-receiving material, low spreading, excellent preservation as an ink, non-toxicity, high purity, and availableness at low price. However, it is very difficult to find a colorant satisfying the requirements at a high level.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0005">In order to improve image preservation properties, particularly light fastness of an image, many suggestions have been conventionally made. For example, Patent Document 1 describes a coloring material (colorant) that may improve light fastness of an image and at the same time form an image with excellent color strength, especially, in a yellow ink having low light fastness of an image, among cyan, magenta and yellow inks. Also, Patent Document 2 describe a method of using an ink including a first coloring material with excellent image fastness, combined with a second coloring material having a different structure from the first coloring material so as to improve light fastness of an image, and form an image excellent in hue, and at the same time to suppress clogging of an ink supply path or improve storage stability.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">However, upon investigation by the present inventors, it has been found that even though the technologies described in the Patent Documents, as exemplified above, are used, the following problems still exist.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">As a requirement for long-term storage preservation of an ink has been recently especially increased, it has been determined that in the use of the ink containing the coloring material described in Patent Document 1, there is a problem of the compatibility of a long-term storage stability of the ink and a concentration change of an inkjet recording image under high humidity. Also, upon investigation by the present inventors on the technology described in Patent Document 2, it has been determined that the second colorant having a similar structure to the first coloring material may significantly deteriorate inkjet image preservation properties (light fastness, ozone gas fastness, high-humidity preservation, heat fastness) depending on the kind or amount of the corresponding chemical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Also, in an ink, there may exist impurities caused from remaining matters that cannot be removed during preparation of, for example, a coloring material, or there may be impurities which are thought to be eluted to the ink from a member constituting an ink cartridge or an ink supply path. Meanwhile, like Patent Document 2, there is generally known a method of using a structural analog of a colorant together with additives in an ink for the purpose of improving the characteristics of an inkjet ink (for example, adjustment of a liquid property, and improvement of an image preservation property). The material mixed with the ink may be a cause of clogging of an ink supply path, or reduction of an ink supply characteristic, and further ink storage stability, and thus, is considered as a problem to be solved from the viewpoint of reliability, especially, in the performance of recently required high-resolution recording. However, in general, it is difficult to remove such a material. Even if it can be removed, a considerably high cost is required. Accordingly, the addition of an excessive purification process may interrupt products from being supplied to users at a low cost, and may be a serious problem in practical use.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a coloring composition and an azo compound useful in a yellow ink composition or an ink for inkjet recording, which may provide an image excellent in light fastness, ozone gas fastness and moisture fastness, and form an image excellent in hue, and at the same time may suppress clogging of an ink supply path or sufficiently satisfy storage stability.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Based on the above described problems of the conventional technologies, the present inventors thought that a coloring material used for a yellow ink needs to be investigated in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described above, among respective yellow, magenta, and cyan inks widely used as inks for inkjet recording, especially, the yellow ink shows a tendency to be degraded in light fastness of a formed image. Accordingly, the present inventors carried out various investigations on the coloring material used for the yellow ink. As a result, they spotlighted that, especially, the compound of Formula (Y) below described in Patent Document 1, especially the compound of Formula (Y-1) below, is excellent in light fastness and color strength.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also, the present inventors prepared a coloring composition containing only the compound of Formula (Y) as a coloring material, and an ink using the coloring material, and then investigated various images formed using the ink, clogging of an ink supply path, or storage stability. As a result, although the ink for inkjet recording, obtained using the coloring composition containing only the compound of Formula (Y) as the coloring material, has a performance exceeding a predetermined level, they concluded that the ink is still insufficient to satisfy recent high requirements, especially, in storage stability of the ink for inkjet recording. Especially, it was found that when an inkjet recording device was left for a long time without being used in a state where the ink was mounted in the inkjet recording device, a reduction in a discharging property or a reduction of storage stability of the ink occurred, depending on the inkjet recording device.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On these phenomena, the present inventors investigated in detail. After the inkjet recording device was left for a long time without being used in a state where the ink containing a high content of the compound of Formula (Y) was mounted in the inkjet recording device, it was observed through a recording head that foreign materials generated within a nozzle. As a result of investigation into the foreign materials, it was found that the materials were generated by crystal precipitation of a colorant. It was found that when the recording head in which such foreign materials generate is used, a discharging property is reduced and also storage stability of an ink is reduced by the foreign materials.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other words, in an image formed using the ink containing the compound of Formula (Y), a conventional technology was insufficient to compatibly satisfy all performances such as an excellent image preservation property, an excellent color reproduction range, suppression of clogging of an ink supply path, and storage stability. More specifically, the conventional technology was insufficient to provide an ink that satisfies the following three performances at once. In conclusion, it is required to improve image fastness of a printed matter obtained using the ink containing the specific coloring material to satisfy a recent required high level, expand a red color reproduction range in an image formed by combination of the ink with a cyan or magenta ink, and also satisfy suppression of clogging of an ink supply path or storage stability.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to solve the aforementioned technical problems occurred when using the compound of Formula (Y), the present inventors have reviewed and implemented the present invention. That is, in the present invention, the aforementioned technical problems may be solved by the coloring composition and ink containing a compound represented by the following Formula (Y) as a first coloring material and at least one compound selected from the following Group A as a second coloring material in a specific mass ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0109">Further, the coloring composition of the present invention may be used for an ink composition or an inkjet ink. The concentration of the colorant in the inkjet ink is preferably 1% by mass to 12% by mass, more preferably 2% by mass to 8% by mass, and particularly preferably 3% by mass to 6% by mass from the viewpoint of the viscosity of the ink or the concentration of a printed matter.</p>

Specifically, the content (% by mass) of the second coloring material is preferably 0.001% by mass to 2.0% by mass, more preferably 0.005% by mass to 1.5% by mass, still more preferably 0.01% by mass to 1.1% by mass, and particularly preferably 0.05% by mass to 0.8% by mass based on the total mass of the coloring composition.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0111">Further, with respect to other coloring materials, the content of the second coloring material in this case is more preferably set as follows. It is preferred that the content in the case of using any of the at least one compound selected from the Group A alone, and the total content in the case of using in combination of two or more selected from them are set so as to satisfy the aforementioned range, respectively. By setting the contents of the first coloring material and/or the second coloring material within the aforementioned range, it is possible to satisfy the light fastness and hue of images, as well as the reliability of the ink using the coloring composition, such as the storage stability and the recording durability.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0112">Compound 1 in Group A is preferably contained in an amount of 0.001% by mass to 1.0% by mass, and more preferably 0.1% by mass to 1.0% by mass based on the total mass of the coloring composition.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0113">Compound 2 in Group A is preferably contained in an amount of 0.003% by mass to 3.0% by mass, and more preferably 0.1% by mass to 3.0% by mass based on the total mass of the coloring composition.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0120">Based on the total mass of the coloring composition, the mass ratio of the content (% by mass) of the second coloring material to the content (% by mass) of the first coloring material (the second coloring material/the first coloring material) is required to be 0.001 to 1.0.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0121">Furthermore, in the present invention, the mass ratio of the content (% by mass) to the content (% by mass) of the first coloring material (the second coloring material/the first coloring material) is preferably 0.001 to 0.3. By setting the mass ratio of the contents of the coloring materials within the aforementioned range, it is possible to form an image having a high level of light fastness, which far surpasses the performance expected from the combination of the solubility and light fastness possessed by the first coloring material and the solubility and light fastness possessed by the second coloring material. Further, it is possible to obtain an image of more preferable hues. The mass ratio of the content (% by mass) of the second coloring material to the content (% by mass) of the first coloring material (the second coloring material/the first coloring material) is more preferably 0.001 to 0.2, still more preferably 0.01 to 0.2, and even still more preferably 0.02 to 0.12. By setting the mass ratio of the contents of the coloring materials within the aforementioned range, it is possible to form an image having an especially high level of light fastness even in the aforementioned mass ratio of the contents. Further, it is possible to obtain an image of particularly preferable hues, and it is also possible to satisfy the reliability as an ink.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0122">If the mass ratio is 0.001 or more, the storage stability of the ink solution is enhanced, and if the mass ratio is 1.0 or less, the stability of the coloring composition in an aqueous solution is excellent. By setting the mass ratio of the contents of the coloring materials, it is possible to achieve an ink solution storage stability and an image fastness of printed matters at a high level, which surpasses the performance expected from the combination of the solubility and image fastness possessed by the first coloring material and the solubility and image fastness possessed by the second coloring material. Further, it is possible to obtain an image of preferable hues and satisfy the reliability as an ink.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0123">The present inventors presume as follows on the reason that a synergy effect is exhibited by using the first coloring material and the second coloring material in a specific mass ratio, thereby compatibly combining impartment of the storage stability of an ink and the image fastness of printed matters. Since the first coloring material originally tends to have low solubility in a water-based medium, when an ink using the coloring composition containing these compounds is imparted to a recording medium, association or agglomeration of the coloring materials occurs rapidly immediately thereafter. The association or agglomeration tends to enhance the fastness of the coloring materials on the recording medium forming an image. On the other hand, however, excessive association or agglomeration may lower the solubility in an aqueous solution and an ink solution in some cases. In this regard, it is considered that, when the first coloring material and the second coloring material coexist, the first coloring material is formed in an optimum state of association or agglomeration with respect to light fastness, thereby enhancing the light fastness of an image.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0124">Further, the present inventors presume as follows on the reason that a synergy effect is exhibited by using the first coloring material and the second coloring material in a specific mass ratio, thereby achieving the reliability of the ink using the coloring composition. As described above, there is a case where impurities, which are thought to be eluted from a member constituting an ink cartridge or an ink supply path, are incorporated into an ink, and cause clogging of the ink supply path, or reduction of an ink supply characteristic and further ink storage stability. The present inventors have reviewed, and as a result, have considered that, when a second coloring material having a similar structure to that of the first coloring material is coexistent in an ink, the tinctorial strength is not reduced, and the first coloring material can be suppressed from crystallization, thereby enhancing the storage stability of the ink considerably. That is, with respect to the reliability of the ink which could not be achieved by using the first coloring material alone as a coloring material, by combining the second coloring material, it is possible to obtain effects which surpass expectations, and achieve a sufficient reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0125">Further, the sum (% by mass) of the contents of the first coloring material and the second coloring material is preferably 1.00% by mass to 12.00% by mass, and particularly preferably 3.00% by mass to 8.0% by mass based on the total mass of the coloring composition. If the sum of the contents is 1.00% by mass or more, the light fastness and color strength are obtained sufficiently, and if the sum of the contents is 12.00% by mass or less, the inkjet discharging property is excellent, without precipitation of impurities in the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0126">Further, in the case where the coloring composition of the present invention is a yellow ink as an ink for inkjet recording, a preferable hue as a yellow ink has the following two meanings. That is, it means that an image formed by only a yellow ink is not tinged with red or green. Furthermore, in this connection, it means that, when forming a secondary colored image by using a yellow ink, that is a red or green image, the image has a hue not impaired in any of red and green color reproduction range.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0127">[Ink for Inkjet Recording]</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0128">Hereinafter, an ink for inkjet recording, obtained using the coloring composition of the present invention, will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0129">The ink for inkjet recording (hereinafter, may be simply referred as &#x201c;ink&#x201d;) may be prepared by dissolving and/or dispersing a coloring material 1 and a coloring material 2 of the present invention in a hydrophobic medium or an aqueous medium.

<p id="p-0109" num="0130">The drying preventing agent is appropriately used for the purpose of suppressing an ink discharge hole of a nozzle used in an inkjet recording method from being clogged due to the dryness of the ink for inkjet.</p>

It is preferred that the drying preventing agent is contained in the ink in an amount of 10% by mass to 50% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0132">The permeation promoting agent is appropriately used for the purpose of allowing the ink for inkjet to be permeated through paper well. As the permeation promoting agent, alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, di(tri)ethylene glycol monobutylether and 1,2-hexanediol, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium oleate, a non-ionic surfactant or the like may be used. If the aforementioned permeation promoting agent is included in the ink in an amount of 5% by mass to 30% by mass, there is generally a sufficient effect, and it is preferred to use the permeation promoting agent in the range of the addition amount not causing spreading of print and print-through of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0133">The UV absorbent is used for the purpose of improving a preservation property of an image. As the UV absorbent, a compound absorbing UV to emit fluorescence, that is, a so-called fluorescent brightening agent, may be used which is represented by a benzotriazole-based compound described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos.

Especially, from the viewpoints of discharge stability and storage stability of the ink for inkjet, a pH adjusting agent having a buffer action is preferred, and potassium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate is preferably used. Potassium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate is more preferred. The use of the pH adjusting agent having the buffer action may suppress a pH change of the ink solution for inkjet with the elapse of time, and thus may solve problems such as discharge poorness of the ink caused by an increase in viscosity of the ink solution due to a decrease of pH of the ink solution, and decomposition of a dye with the elapse of time due to an increase of pH.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0151">The inkjet recording method of the present invention donates energy to the ink, and forms an image on known image-receiving materials, that is, plain paper, resin-coated paper, exclusive inkjet paper described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. H8-169172, H8-27693, H2-276670, H7-276789, H9-323475, S62-238783, H10-153989, H10-217473, H10-235995, H10-337947, H10-217597, and H10-337947, film, paper for use in electrophotography, fabric, glass, metal, ceramic, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0152">When an image is formed, a polymer fine particle dispersion (also known as polymer latex) may be used in combination in order to impart a glossiness or a water fastness, or improve a weather fastness. The polymer latex may be added to the image-receiving material before, after or simultaneously with application of a colorant, and accordingly, may be added into image-receiving paper, or an ink, or used alone as a liquid. Specifically, the methods described in Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2000-363090, 2000-315231, 2000-354380, 2000-343944, 2000-268952, 2000-299465, and 2000-297365, and the like may be preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0153">Hereinafter, the recording paper and the recording film used to perform inkjet printing by using the ink of the present invention will be described. In the recording paper and the recording film, a support is formed of a chemical pulp such as LBKP and NBKP, a mechanical pulp such as GP, PGW, RMP, TMP, CTMP, CMP and CGP, a used-paper pulp such as DIP, or the like, and, if necessary, a matter manufactured by various kinds of devices such as a fourdrinier machine and a rotoformer machine by mixing additives known in the art, such as a pigment, a binder, a sizing agent, a settlement agent, a cationic agent, and a strength additive for paper, may be used. In addition to the aforementioned support, any matter of a synthetic paper and a plastic film sheet may be used, and it is preferred that the thickness of the support ranges from 10 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m, and the basis weight thereof ranges from 10 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to 250 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0154">The support may be provided with an ink-receiving layer and a back coat layer at once, or may be provided with an ink-receiving layer and a back coat layer after a size press or an anchor coat layer is fanned by starch, polyvinyl alcohol or the like. Further, the support may be subjected to planarization treatment by a calendar device such as a machine calendar, a TG calendar, and a soft calendar. In the present invention, paper and plastic films in which polyolefins (for example, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutene, and a copolymer thereof) are laminated on both surfaces thereof are more preferably used as the support. It is preferred that a white pigment (e.g., titanium oxide or zinc oxide) or a coloring dye (e.g., cobalt blue, navy blue or neodymium oxide) is added to polyolefins.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0155">The ink-receiving layer formed on the support contains a pigment or an aqueous binder. As the pigment, a white pigment is preferred, and examples of the white pigment may include an inorganic white pigment such as calcium carbonate, kaolin, talc, clay, diatomite, synthetic amorphous silica, aluminum silicate, magnesium silicate, calcium silicate, aluminum hydroxide, alumina, lithopone, zeolite, barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc sulfide and zinc carbonate, and an organic pigment such as a styrene-based pigment, an acrylic pigment, a urea resin and a melamine resin. As the white pigment contained in the ink-receiving layer, a porous inorganic pigment is preferred, and in particular, for example, synthetic amorphous silica having a large fine pore area is appropriate. As the synthetic amorphous silica, any of silicic acid anhydride obtained by a dry manufacturing method and water-containing silicic acid obtained by a wet manufacturing method may be used.

The aqueous binder may be used either alone or in combination of two kinds or more thereof. In the present invention, among them, polyvinyl alcohol or silanol denatured polyvinyl alcohol is particularly suitable from the viewpoints of the attachment property to the pigment and the stripping fastness of an ink-receiving layer. The ink-receiving layer may contain a mordant, an insolubilizer, a light fastness improving agent, a surfactant or other additives in addition to the pigment and the aqueous binder.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0157">It is preferred that the mordant to be added to the ink-receiving layer is immobilized. To this end, a polymer-mordant is preferably used.

Nos. 2,484,430, 2,548,564, 3,148,061, 3,309,690, 4,115,124, 4,124,386, 4,193,800, 4,273,853, 4,282,305 and 4,450,224. An image-receiving material including the polymer-mordant described on pages 212 to 215 of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H1-161236 is particularly preferred. If the polymer-mordant described in the aforementioned patent document is used, an image having an excellent image quality may be obtained, and at the same time, the light fastness of the image is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0158">The insolubilizer is effective to insolubilization of the image, and it is particularly preferred that the insolubilizer is a cation resin. The cation resin may be polyamidepolyamineepichlorohydrin, polyethyleneimine, polyaminesulfone, dimethyldiallylammonium chloride polymer, cation polyacrylamide, colloidal silica or the like. Among the cation resins, polyamidepolyamineepichlorohydrin is particularly appropriate. The content of the cation resin is preferably 1% by mass to 15% by mass and particularly preferably 3% by mass to 10% by mass based on the total solid of the ink-receiving layer.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0159">Examples of the light fastness improving agent may include zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, hindered amine-based antioxidant, a benzophenone-based or benzotriazole-based UV absorbent, and the like. Among them, zinc sulfide is particularly appropriate.</p>

The surfactant is described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. S62-173463 and S62-183457. An organic fluoro compound may be used instead of the surfactant. It is preferred that the organic fluoro compound is hydrophobic. Examples of the organic fluoro compound include a fluorine-based surfactant, an oil phase fluorine-based compound (for example, fluorine oil), and a solid type fluorine compound resin (for example, a tetrafluoroethylene resin). The organic fluoro compound is described in Japanese Patent Publication No. S57-9053 (8th to 17th columns), and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. S61-20994 and S62-135826. Examples of other additives to be added to the ink-receiving layer may include a pigment dispersant, a thickener, an antifoaming agent, a dye, a fluorescent brightening agent, a preservative, a pH adjusting agent, a matting agent, a hardening agent and the like. Also, the ink-receiving layer may have one layer or two layers.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0161">The back coat layer may be provided into the recording paper and the recording film, and the component that may be added to the layer may be a white pigment, a water-based binder or other components.

<p id="p-0142" num="0163">Polymer latex may be added to a constitutional layer (including the back coat layer) of the inkjet recording paper and the recording film. Polymer latex is used for the purpose of improvement in physical properties of the layer, such as dimensional stabilization, curling prevention, attachment prevention, and crack prevention of the layer. Polymer latex is described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. S62-245258, S62-136648 and S62-110066. When polymer latex having a low glass transition temperature (40&#xb0; C. or less) is added to the layer including the mordant, cracks or curling of the layer may be prevented. Further, even though polymer latex having a high glass transition temperature is added to the back coat layer, curling may be prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0168" num="0189">(1) Light Fastness</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0190">The ink obtained from each of Examples 1 to 40 and Comparative Examples 1 to 14 was mounted in an inkjet recording device (trade name: PIXUS iP8600; manufactured by Canon) using heat energy. The recording condition was set as follows: temperature 23&#xb0; C., RH 55%, recording density 2,400 dpi&#xd7;1,200 dpi, and discharge amount 2.5 pL.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0191">On a recording medium (trade name: Canon photo paper glossy pro [platinum grade] PT-101; manufactured by Canon), an image was formed at a recording duty of 50%. The image was air-dried at the temperature of 23&#xb0; C. and 55% RH for 24 hours. On the image portion of a recorded matter obtained through this process, an optical density was measured (referred to as &#x201c;optical density before the test&#x201d;). Also, this recorded matter was exposed using a super Xenon tester (trade name: SX-75; manufactured by Suga Test Co., Ltd.), under conditions of irradiation intensity 100 kilo lux, bath internal temperature 24&#xb0; C., and RH 60% for 72 hours. Then, on the image portion of the record matter, an optical density was measured (&#x201c;optical density after the test&#x201d;). Also, the optical density was measured using a spectrophotometer (Spectorolino; manufactured by Gretag Macbeth) under conditions of light source D50 and field of view 2&#xb0;. From the obtained optical density values before and after the test, a residual ratio of the optical density was calculated based on the following equation, and evaluation of light fastness was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0192">The light fastness was based on the following criteria. The evaluation result is noted in Table 11.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0193">In the present invention, in the following criteria, AA and A were set as acceptable levels, and B and C were set as unacceptable levels.</p>

<p id="p-0178" num="0199">(2) Hue</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0200">The ink obtained from each of Examples 1 to 40 and Comparative Examples 1 to 14 was mounted in an inkjet recording device using heat energy (trade name: PIXUS iP8600; manufactured by Canon). The recording condition was set as follows: temperature 23&#xb0; C., RH 55%, recording density 2,400 dpi&#xd7;1,200 dpi, and discharge amount 2.5 pL. Then, on the same recording medium as that above, an image was formed at a recording duty of 60%. The image was air-dried at the temperature of 23&#xb0; C. and 55% RH for 24 hours. On the image portion of a recorded matter obtained through this process, a hue angle was measured using a spectrophotometer (Spectorolino; manufactured by Gretag Macbeth), and evaluation of a hue was performed. The hue was based on the following criteria. The evaluation result is noted in Table 11. In the present invention, in the following criteria, AA, A, and B were set as acceptable levels, and C was set as an unacceptable level.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0201">AA: hue angle of 88&#xb0; or more and 90&#xb0; or less.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0202">A: hue angle of 85&#xb0; or more and less than 88&#xb0;, or greater than 90&#xb0; and 92&#xb0; or less.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0203">B: hue angle of 83&#xb0; or more and less than 85&#xb0;, or greater than 92&#xb0; and 94&#xb0; or less.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0204">C: hue angle of less than 83&#xb0;, or greater than 94&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0205">(3) Storage Stability of Ink</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0206">The ink obtained from each of Examples 1 to 40 and Comparative Examples 1 to 14 was filled in an ink cartridge for an inkjet recording device (trade name: PIXUS iP8600; manufactured by Canon), and an ink supply hole was closed so that the ink within the ink cartridge may be not evaporated. The ink cartridge was put in an airtight container, and stored in a thermostatic oven at the temperature of 60&#xb0; C. for 3 months. Then, the ink cartridge was taken out from the thermostatic oven, and mounted in a head cartridge of the inkjet recording device, and then stored at the temperature of 35&#xb0; C. and RH 10% for 2 weeks in the state where discharge holes of the head cartridge were exposed. Then, the head cartridge was mounted in the inkjet recording device as above, and subjected to suction predetermined times, so as to determine restorability. In this manner, evaluation of storage stability of the ink was performed. Also, the suction is one of functions provided to the inkjet recording device (trade name: PIXUS iP8600; manufactured by Canon), which is, &#x201c;cleaning of print head&#x201d;. The storage stability was based on the following criteria. The evaluation result is noted in Table 11. In the present invention, in the following criteria, AA and A were set as acceptable levels, and B and C were set as unacceptable levels.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0207">AA: all of discharge holes were restored to a state where discharge can be carried out without a problem after suction 4 or less times.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0208">A: all of discharge holes were restored to a state where discharge can be carried out without a problem after suction 5 times.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0209">B: all of discharge holes were restored to a state where discharge can be carried out without a problem after suction 6 times.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0210">C: discharge holes through which discharge cannot be carried out even after suction 7 or more times.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0211">(4) Recording Durability</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0212">The ink obtained from each of Examples 1 to 40 and Comparative Examples 1 to 14 was mounted in a position of a yellow ink of an inkjet recording device using heat energy (trade name: BJ F890; manufactured by Canon). Then, on the whole surface of a recording medium with an A4 size (trade name: Office Planner: manufactured by Canon), an image was recorded at a recording duty of 100%, and evaluation of recording durability was performed. The recording durability was based on the following criteria. The evaluation result is noted in Table 11. In the present invention, in the following criteria, AA and A were set as acceptable levels, and B and C were set as unacceptable levels.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0213">AA: twist or blur did not occur even after recording of 20,000 sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0214">A: slight blur occurred due to minute twist after recording of 15,000 to 19,999 sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0215">B: slight blur occurred due to minute twist after recording of 10,000 to 14,999 sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0216">C: blur occurred or non-discharge occurred due to disconnection before recording of less than 10,000.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0217">(5) pH Stability of Ink</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0218">The pH of the ink obtained from each of Examples 1 to 35 was measured using a pH meter (HM-30G (manufactured by DKK-TOA Corp.), electrode: combination electrode GST-5721C, temperature: 25&#xb0; C.). After pH measurement, the storage stability test described in (3) was performed. After the test, the pH was measured again.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0219">Also, the inks of Examples 41 to 61, obtained by adding the pH adjusting agents noted in Table 12 to the inks of Examples 1 to 35 were subjected to the same measurement. In the present invention, in the following criteria, AA, A, and B were set as acceptable levels, and C was set as an unacceptable level.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0220">AA: pH difference between before and after the test pH is less than 0.10</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0221">A: pH difference between before and after the test pH is 0.10 or more and less than 0.15</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0222">B: pH difference between before and after the test pH is 0.15 or more and less than 0.20</p>

<p id="p-0205" num="0226">Although the inks in Examples 8 to 17, Examples 25 to 28, and Examples 36 to 40 were ranked A in evaluations on both the storage stability of an ink and the recording durability, it was determined that the inks in Examples 1 to 7, Examples 18 to 24, and Examples 29 to 35 were superior because the counteraction in an ionic hydrophilic group is a single K<sup>+</sup> ion system.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0227">Also, although the inks in Examples 1 to 18 and Examples 25 to 40 were ranked A in evaluation on the light fastness of a recording image, it was determined that the inks in Examples 19 to 24 were superior in the grade of the light fastness because the content (% by mass) of the first coloring material is high in each of the inks.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0228">Also, although all of the inks in Examples 33 to 40 were ranked A in evaluation on the hue of a recording image, the inks in Examples 1 to 32 were superior in the grade of the hue because the content (% by mass) of the second coloring material is low in each of the inks.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0229">All of the inks of Examples 41 to 61, obtained by adding the pH adjusting agents to the inks of Examples 1 to 35, were ranked AA or A in the pH stability. Thus, it was determined that the pH stability was improved as compared to the inks not added with the pH adjusting agents in Examples 1 to 35.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0230">From the results in Table 11 and 12, it can be found that the system using the coloring composition (the ink for inkjet recording) of the present invention is superior in light fastness, hue, storage stability of an ink, recording durability of an ink, pH stability of an ink of an inkjet recording image.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0210" num="0231">The coloring composition and the azo compound of the present invention may provide an image excellent in preservation properties (especially, light fastness, ozone gas fastness and moisture fastness), and form an image excellent in hue, and at the same time may suppress clogging of an ink supply path or sufficiently satisfy storage stability.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0232">The present invention has been described in detail with reference to specific embodiments, but it is apparent to the person with ordinary skill in the art that various changes or modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0233">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2010-294320 and 2011-142323 filed on Dec. 28, 2010 and Jun. 27, 2011, respectively in the JPO, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety</p>
