<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An air-balanced engine assembly is configured to operate efficiently while producing a reduced level of harmful emissions. The engine assembly includes a two-stroke internal combustion engine with multiple power cylinders and intake and exhaust manifolds that fluidly communicate with the cylinders. The engine assembly also includes an air balancing assembly with valves that control intake air flow from the intake manifold to the cylinders. The valves cooperate to balance intake air flow among the cylinders and are configured to substantially equalize trapped equivalence ratios among the cylinders.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61/101,957, which was filed on Oct. 1, 2008 contemporaneously with application for U.S. patent Ser. No. 12/243,833, entitled TURBOCHARGER BOOSTER SYSTEM, and application for U.S. patent Ser. No. 12/243,816, entitled VARIABLE GEOMETRY TURBOCHARGER. All of the foregoing are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to reciprocating internal combustion engines. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention concern a reciprocating engine and a cylinder balancing system that equalizes trapped equivalence ratio among power cylinders of reciprocating engines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Large bore reciprocating internal combustion engines have long been used to provide power in various applications, such as electrical power generation, maritime power generation, and other industrial applications. For instance, large bore reciprocating engines are ubiquitous throughout the natural gas transmission industry as a source of power for large natural gas compressors. A vast number of legacy reciprocating engines have been in operation for at least 50-60 years, due in part to their reliability and the high cost of replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although functionally reliable, prior art large bore reciprocating engines used for natural gas compression suffer from various limitations. In particular, legacy reciprocating engines typically fail to meet current federal emissions regulations and operational efficiency requirements. As originally configured by manufacturers, legacy reciprocating engines generally produce an unacceptable amount of NO<sub>X </sub>emissions. Furthermore, aftermarket systems designed for legacy engines, and intended to reduce harmful emissions, fail to sufficiently improve performance. For instance, aftermarket fuel control systems are integrated into legacy engines to balance peak cylinder pressure across multiple cylinders, but generally cannot effectively reduce NO<sub>X </sub>emissions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention provide an air-balanced engine that does not suffer from the problems and limitations of the prior art engines set forth above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A first embodiment of the present invention concerns a reciprocating internal combustion engine which broadly includes a plurality of combustion cylinders, an intake manifold, and a plurality of independently variable air balancing valves. The plurality of combustion cylinders are spaced along an engine axis, with each of the combustion cylinders having a combustion chamber and an intake port that fluidly communicates with the combustion chamber to permit a flow of intake air into the combustion chamber. The intake manifold is in fluid communication with the intake ports and is configured to supply intake air for the intake ports. The plurality of independently variable air balancing valves are each in fluid communication with the intake manifold and configured to control the flow of intake air from the intake manifold through a respective intake port. Each air balancing valve is configured to divert intake air not passing into the respective intake port to another intake port via the intake manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second embodiment of the present invention concerns a method of operating a reciprocating internal combustion engine to substantially equalize trapped equivalence ratio among a plurality of power cylinders. The method broadly includes the steps of determining an operational air flow rate of each of the intake air flows received by corresponding power cylinders during substantially steady-state engine operation, comparing the determined operational air flow rates, and adjusting an air balancing system in response to the comparison step to change the operational air flow rate of at least one of the power cylinders relative to another of the power cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third embodiment of the present invention concerns a method of distributing intake air among a plurality of power cylinders in a reciprocating internal combustion engine. The method broadly includes the steps of locating air intake valves between the intake manifold and a respective power cylinder, and adjusting the air intake valves to control intake air flow to the intake port of each power cylinder and thereby balance intake air flow among the power cylinders.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, an air-balanced gas engine assembly <b>20</b> is operable to compress and transmit natural gas along a natural gas transmission line (not shown). The engine assembly <b>20</b> is particularly suited to operate efficiently while producing a minimal amount of harmful gas emissions, such as NO<sub>X </sub>emissions, from engine operation. The illustrated engine assembly <b>20</b> is preferably used for gas transmission, but the principles of the present invention are applicable for other internal combustion engine applications, such as marine power, electricity generation, and other industrial power applications, that require an efficient and low-emission internal combustion engine. The air-balanced gas engine assembly <b>20</b> broadly includes an integral gas engine-compressor <b>22</b> and an air balancing system <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>, the integral gas engine-compressor <b>22</b> is fluidly coupled to the natural gas transmission line to compress and transmit natural gas. The illustrated integral gas engine-compressor <b>22</b> broadly includes a reciprocating two-stroke internal combustion engine <b>26</b> and a gas compressor assembly <b>28</b>. The illustrated engine-compressor <b>22</b> is a Cooper GMV integral engine, but could be another type of integral gas engine-compressor. Also, it is within the ambit of the present invention where the engine-compressor <b>22</b> comprises a reciprocating engine without a gas compressor. Furthermore, the principles of the present invention are equally applicable to four-stroke engines as well as the illustrated two-stroke internal combustion engine <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The internal combustion engine <b>26</b> is a conventional large-bore engine, i.e, an engine much larger than a conventional automotive engine, and serves to power the gas compressor assembly <b>28</b>. In the usual manner, the internal combustion engine <b>26</b> includes a crankcase <b>30</b> and a crankshaft <b>32</b> rotatably mounted in the crankcase <b>30</b>. The engine <b>26</b> further includes cylinder heads <b>34</b> mounted on the crankcase <b>30</b> to provide a left side cylinder bank <b>36</b>, with cylinders <b>36</b><i>a,b,c,d,e </i>spaced along an engine axis, and a right side cylinder bank <b>38</b>, with cylinders <b>38</b><i>a,b,c,d,e </i>also spaced along the engine axis. For each cylinder bank <b>36</b>,<b>38</b>, adjacent cylinders present a spacing L between cylinder center lines of about forty-eight (48) inches. The cylinders <b>36</b><i>a,b,c,d,e </i>and cylinders <b>38</b><i>a,b,c,d,e </i>each present a combustion chamber <b>40</b> and intake and exhaust ports <b>42</b>,<b>44</b> that fluidly communicate with the combustion chamber <b>40</b>. The engine <b>26</b> further includes pistons <b>46</b> slidably received in the chambers <b>40</b> and drivingly connected to the crankshaft <b>32</b> by power connecting rods <b>48</b>. The illustrated pistons <b>46</b> have a piston diameter of about fourteen (14) inches. The crankshaft <b>32</b> and power connecting rods <b>48</b> cooperatively provide a throw of about fourteen (14) inches. However, the pistons <b>46</b> and other components of the engine <b>26</b> could be alternatively sized without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The engine <b>26</b> also includes a gas fuel system <b>50</b> with gas injection valves <b>52</b> fluidly communicating with the chambers <b>40</b> and fuel supply lines <b>54</b> that provide gas to the gas injection valves <b>52</b>. The engine <b>26</b> further includes a cooling system <b>56</b> with lines <b>58</b> that carry cooling fluid to and from passages in the crankcase <b>30</b> and cylinder heads <b>34</b>. A foundation <b>60</b> receives the crankcase <b>30</b> and thereby supports the engine <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, the engine <b>26</b> includes an intake assembly <b>62</b> and an exhaust assembly <b>64</b> that fluidly communicate with intake and exhaust ports <b>42</b>,<b>44</b>. The exhaust assembly <b>64</b> includes an exhaust manifold <b>66</b> that extends along the engine axis between the cylinder banks <b>36</b>,<b>38</b>. In the usual manner, the exhaust manifold <b>66</b> is fluidly connected to the exhaust ports <b>44</b> by exhaust runners <b>68</b> so that exhaust gases flow out of the cylinders, through respective exhaust runners <b>68</b>, and then through the exhaust manifold <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The intake assembly <b>62</b> includes a plenum <b>70</b>, a pair of intake manifolds <b>72</b> fluidly connected to the plenum <b>70</b> at manifold inlets, and a plurality of intake runners <b>74</b>. The intake manifolds <b>72</b> each present a diameter of about twelve (12) inches and a manifold length that ranges from about twelve (12) feet to about twenty (20) feet, but the manifolds <b>72</b> could be alternatively sized. The illustrated engine <b>26</b> has been found to operate with intake manifold air flow rates that range from about 498 scfm to about 643 scfm and manifold static pressures that range from about 6.7 psig to about 9.2 psig. The intake runners <b>74</b> fluidly connect the intake manifolds <b>72</b> and the intake ports <b>42</b>, with intake air being configured to flow from the plenum <b>70</b>, flow downstream through the intake manifolds <b>72</b>, and then into the cylinders by passing through respective intake runners <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The conventional engine <b>26</b> combines intake air from the intake assembly <b>62</b> and fuel from the gas fuel system <b>50</b> in the cylinders to support combustion, with the air flow rate, the fuel flow rate, and the scavenging efficiency of each cylinder providing a trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6;. The trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6; is the ratio of the actual fuel-to-air ratio in the cylinder to the stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio. Importantly, it has been determined that NO<sub>X </sub>production is a function of trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6;. As will be discussed in greater detail, the present invention is configured to substantially balance air flow among cylinders and is configured to substantially equalize the trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6; among cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the gas compressor assembly <b>28</b> is conventional and includes a compressor housing <b>76</b> attached to the crankcase <b>30</b> and supported by the foundation <b>60</b>. The compressor housing <b>76</b> includes a plurality of compressor cylinders <b>78</b> spaced along the engine axis and extending in a lateral direction. The cylinders <b>78</b> present ports <b>80</b> that fluidly communicate with a gas manifold <b>82</b>. The gas compressor assembly <b>28</b> also includes double-acting pistons <b>84</b> slidably received in respective cylinders <b>78</b>. The pistons <b>84</b> are each drivingly connected to the crankshaft <b>32</b> by a compressor rod <b>86</b>, a crosshead <b>88</b>, and a master connecting rod <b>90</b> so that rotation of the crankshaft <b>32</b> causes the pistons <b>84</b> to reciprocate and compress natural gas in the usual manner.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, the illustrated intake runners <b>74</b> include a wall <b>92</b> that presents a passage <b>94</b>, and an inlet <b>96</b> and outlet <b>98</b> that are fluidly connected by the passage <b>94</b>. While the illustrated passage <b>94</b> has a rectangular cross section, the passage <b>94</b> could have an alternative cross-sectional shape, such as a circular shape. The rectangular cross section presents a passage width W of about ten (10) inches and a passage height H of about five (5) inches to provide an actual flow area of about 50 square inches when measured perpendicular to the passage axis. However, the passage <b>94</b> could have different dimensions. While each cylinder <b>36</b>,<b>38</b> is preferably attached to a corresponding intake runner <b>74</b> so that each intake port <b>42</b> is thereby in direct fluid communication with a corresponding passage <b>94</b>, the principles of the present invention are applicable where one or more cylinders <b>36</b>,<b>38</b> are each directly attached to and receive intake air via multiple intake runners <b>74</b>. Furthermore, one more of the intake runners <b>74</b> could provide intake air to multiple cylinders <b>36</b>,<b>38</b>, e.g., where the intake runner <b>74</b> has a single air inlet <b>96</b> and multiple air outlets <b>98</b>, with each air outlet <b>98</b> being in fluid communication with a respective intake port <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The illustrated engine <b>26</b> has been found to normally produce imbalanced intake air flows among power cylinders. The cylinders are spaced along the downstream manifold direction, with more intake air generally being provided to upstream cylinders, such as cylinders <b>36</b><i>a</i>,<b>38</b><i>a</i>, and less intake air generally being provided to downstream cylinders, such as cylinders <b>36</b><i>e</i>,<b>38</b><i>e</i>. It has been found that each intake port <b>42</b>, intake runner <b>74</b> and the intake manifold <b>72</b> cooperatively provide an air intake restriction, which imparts a corresponding pressure drop in air flow, from the manifold inlet to the corresponding intake port <b>42</b>. Due to the shape and size of the intake manifolds <b>72</b> and intake runners <b>74</b>, the air intake restrictions are generally different for each of the cylinders <b>36</b><i>a,b,c,d,e</i>. For instance, the air intake restriction for cylinder <b>36</b><i>a </i>is less than the air intake restriction for cylinder <b>36</b><i>e </i>because air travels a shorter distance to cylinder <b>36</b><i>a </i>compared to cylinder <b>36</b><i>e</i>, i.e., cylinder <b>36</b><i>e </i>is spaced about 16 feet farther downstream than cylinder <b>36</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, the pressure and mass flow rate of intake air supplied to cylinder <b>36</b><i>a </i>tends to be greater than the pressure and mass flow rate of air supplied to cylinder <b>36</b><i>e</i>. For example, it has been found that a steady-state pressure drop of about 3 inches Hg to about 5 inches Hg occurs from cylinder <b>36</b><i>a </i>to cylinder <b>36</b><i>d</i>. Similarly, each of the cylinders <b>38</b><i>a,b,c,d,e </i>is associated with different air intake restrictions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The imbalance of air intake restrictions across cylinders <b>36</b>,<b>38</b> has been found to contribute to an imbalance of air flow into the cylinders <b>36</b>,<b>38</b> of the conventional engine <b>26</b>, with a corresponding imbalance of trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6;. Furthermore, it is apparent that cylinders should be independently controlled to overcome this imbalance. As will be discussed further, elements of the air balancing system <b>24</b> are operably coupled to the intake runners <b>74</b> and serve to selectively open and close each of the passages <b>94</b> to control intake air flow to the intake ports <b>42</b>. In this manner, the air balancing system <b>24</b> serves to correct the imbalance of pressure and air flow rate created by the air intake restrictions, and is configured to equalize the trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6; among cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It has also been determined that conventional fuel control systems, which are designed to reduce emissions, do not effectively balance trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6;. Fuel control systems generally monitor peak cylinder pressures and attempt to balance peak cylinder pressures by injecting more fuel when the cylinder pressure is low or injecting less fuel when the cylinder pressure is too high. Again, the variable intake restrictions discussed above normally result in more intake air being delivered to upstream cylinders, with those cylinders having a relatively high cylinder pressure, and less intake air being delivered to downstream cylinders, with those cylinders having a relatively low cylinder pressure. In response to the imbalanced cylinder pressures, fuel control systems attempt to balance pressures by reducing the fuel injected into upstream cylinders (i.e., the cylinders with more intake air) and increasing the fuel injected into downstream cylinders (i.e., the cylinders with less intake air). Once the fuel control system has balanced peak cylinder pressure, upstream cylinders will have a very lean fuel-to-air mixture and downstream cylinders will have a very rich fuel-to-air mixture. Consequently, fuel control systems have been found to produce an imbalance in trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6; and NO<sub>X </sub>production among cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>, the air balancing system <b>24</b> is configured to control air intake flow into the engine <b>26</b> and exhaust flow from the engine <b>26</b>. The air balancing system <b>24</b> broadly includes a turbocharger <b>100</b> and an intake balancing assembly <b>102</b>. The illustrated turbocharger <b>100</b> includes a centrifugal compressor <b>104</b> and a turbine <b>106</b> that drives the compressor <b>104</b>. In the usual manner, the compressor <b>104</b> includes an axial inlet that receives ambient air and a radial discharge that fluidly communicates with and discharges compressed air into the plenum <b>70</b>. However, the compressor <b>104</b> could be alternatively configured without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The turbine <b>106</b> includes an axial inlet that is configured to receive engine exhaust gases and a radial discharge through which the engine exhaust gases exit the turbine <b>106</b>. The inlet of the turbine <b>106</b> is fluidly attached to the exhaust manifold <b>66</b> and receives engine exhaust gases from the exhaust manifold <b>66</b>. The illustrated turbocharger preferably includes variable compressor vane geometry that can be adjusted to permit efficient engine and turbocharger operation under a range of environmental conditions. Additional features of this preferred turbocharger <b>100</b> are disclosed in greater detail in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application entitled VARIABLE GEOMETRY TURBOCHARGER.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">While the illustrated turbocharger <b>100</b> is preferred, a conventional turbocharger could be used with the engine <b>26</b>, or another type of supercharger could be used, such as a blower driven by the crankshaft <b>30</b>. Also, the principles of the present invention are applicable where the engine <b>26</b> is not provided with a supercharger, or where multiple superchargers supply compressed air to the engine <b>26</b>. While the turbocharger <b>100</b> generally serves to increase intake air flow to all cylinders <b>36</b>,<b>38</b>, it is also within the ambit of the present invention where one or more superchargers are configured to selectively provide different amounts of intake air to particular cylinders to correct the imbalance of pressure and mass flow rate created by the air intake restrictions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The air balancing system <b>24</b> could also include other components for augmenting intake air flow to the engine <b>26</b>, such as an intercooler. In particular, a preferred turbocharger boosting system (not shown) can be operably coupled to the turbine <b>106</b> of turbocharger <b>100</b> to increase the amount of heat into the turbine <b>106</b> and thereby increase the compressor speed to provide additional intake air flow to the engine <b>26</b>. In particular, the turbocharger boosting system includes a gas burner (not shown) operable to be installed in the exhaust assembly <b>64</b>, e.g., in the exhaust manifold <b>66</b> adjacent the turbine <b>106</b>, to add heat to the exhaust gases prior to the exhaust gases reaching the turbine <b>106</b>. Additional details of the preferred turbocharger boosting system are disclosed in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application entitled TURBOCHARGER BOOSTER SYSTEM.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, the intake balancing assembly <b>102</b> broadly includes valves <b>108</b>, valve actuators <b>110</b>, and air velocity sensors <b>112</b>. The valve actuator <b>110</b> preferably includes an electric motor, such as a servo, and a mounting bracket, with the motor being mounted to the side of the intake runner <b>74</b> and drivingly attached to the valve <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The air velocity sensor <b>112</b> is preferably a hot wire anemometer operable to measure air flow velocity, and is installed in the illustrated intake runners <b>74</b>. Additionally, a static pressure sensor and temperature sensor (both not shown) are also installed in each intake runner <b>74</b>. The velocity sensor <b>112</b>, pressure sensor, and temperature sensor are configured to cooperatively provide a mass flow sensor assembly to measure the mass flow rate of air through the corresponding intake runner <b>74</b>. In particular, the temperature and pressure sensors are used to determine the air density, and the velocity measurement and runner size determine the volumetric air flow rate. However, it is also within the scope of the present invention to use other types of flow meters, such as a vane air flow meter or a Karmen vortex meter, to determine the air mass flow rate. Furthermore, while the illustrated sensor <b>112</b> is preferably installed in the intake runner <b>74</b>, flow measurements can be taken at other locations to determine air mass flow rate. By measuring the air mass flow rate, the illustrated intake balancing assembly <b>102</b> can be used to determine the amount of trapped air mass in each cylinder <b>36</b>,<b>38</b>. However, trapped air mass can be determined using other methods and sensors without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, trapped air mass can be calculated by measuring in-cylinder compression pressures during engine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each valve <b>108</b> is preferably associated with a corresponding intake port <b>42</b> and cylinder and includes a throttle plate <b>114</b> attached to a rod <b>116</b>. The throttle plate <b>114</b> is pivotally mounted in a corresponding intake runner <b>74</b> by mounting ends of the rod <b>116</b> in bushings <b>118</b>. The throttle plate <b>114</b> preferably comprises a flat plate with an outermost rectangular edge and presents a plate width PW and a plate height PH. The throttle plate <b>114</b> preferably has a thickness of about one-eighth (&#x215b;) inch, a plate width PW of about eight (8) inches, and a plate height PH of about three (3) inches. The throttle plate <b>114</b> is positioned within the passage <b>94</b> so that the edge extends along the inner surface of the wall <b>92</b> of the intake runner <b>74</b>. In this manner, the throttle plate <b>114</b> and intake runner <b>74</b> cooperatively form an annular gap G that surrounds the throttle plate <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The valve <b>108</b> is preferably pivotal from a closed position, where the throttle plate <b>114</b> is positioned substantially perpendicular to the axis of the passage <b>94</b> to minimize the annular gap G, to a fully open position, where the throttle plate <b>114</b> extends substantially parallel to the passage axis to maximize the annular gap G. In the closed position, the annular gap G preferably presents a substantially constant gap width about the throttle plate <b>114</b> of about one (1) inch (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). As discussed above, the passage presents a passage flow area of about 50 square inches. In the closed position, the throttle plate <b>114</b> presents an effective plate area, measured perpendicular to the passage axis, of about 24 square inches. Consequently, the effective plate area is about half of the passage flow area when throttle plate <b>114</b> is in the closed position. As the throttle plate <b>114</b> is opened, the effective plate area decreases. While it has been found that this valve configuration permits a desired range of valve operation, the annular gap G could be alternatively sized without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The illustrated valve <b>108</b> operates as a variable flow restriction in the passage <b>94</b>. In particular, the valve <b>108</b> is configured to produce a maximum pressure drop that ranges from about 4 inches Hg to about 6 inches Hg. In other words, the valve <b>108</b> provides an effective flow area of the passage <b>94</b>, which is a product of the actual flow area of the passage <b>94</b> and an experimentally determined discharge coefficient of the valve <b>108</b>. The intake ports <b>42</b> of the cylinders also have a non-dimensional discharge coefficient that can be calculated based on port open fraction. For the illustrated engine <b>26</b>, the intake port discharge coefficients alone range from about 0.3 to about 0.4. In combination, the intake port <b>42</b> and the valve <b>108</b> have a discharge coefficient that ranges from about 0.076 to about 0.14, with these values corresponding to the valve <b>108</b> being in the closed position and the open position, respectively. These values were determined over intake manifold air flow rates that range from about 500 scfm to about 600 scfm and manifold static pressures that range from about 7.0 psig to about 9.0 psig.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the valve <b>108</b> swings from the closed position to the open position, the effective flow area gradually increases. It has been determined that the change in effective flow area is directly proportional to the actual air mass flow rate. In particular, a 10% change in effective flow area results in a 10% change in air mass flow rate. Furthermore, the illustrated valve <b>108</b> permits a variation of air mass flow rate through each passage <b>94</b> of about 12.4%. It has been surprisingly discovered that a 10% variation in air mass flow rate results in a variation in NO<sub>X </sub>production of up to about 85% for the illustrated engine <b>26</b>. Moreover, a variation in air mass flow rate over a range of about 5% to about 12% results in a variation in NO<sub>X </sub>production over a range of about 65% to about 92%.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While each valve <b>108</b> controls flow through a single corresponding passage <b>94</b> and into a corresponding intake port <b>42</b>, the principles of the present invention are applicable where multiple valves <b>108</b> are used to control air intake flow through one of the passages <b>94</b> and into the corresponding intake port <b>42</b>. Furthermore, a single valve <b>108</b> could control air intake flow through multiple passages <b>94</b> and into multiple intake ports <b>42</b>, particularly where such a configuration serves to balance intake air flow among multiple cylinders <b>36</b>,<b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The intake balancing assembly <b>102</b> is used to balance intake air flow among the cylinders and is configured to substantially equalize trapped equivalence ratio &#x3c6; among the cylinders. In particular, the mass flow sensor assemblies are operable to take air flow measurements in each passage <b>94</b> to determine the air mass flow rate into each intake port <b>42</b>. The measured mass flow rates can then be compared, either manually or automatically, to adjust the valves <b>108</b> relative to one another. For instance, one valve <b>108</b> could be opened to permit additional flow through the corresponding passage <b>94</b> where the flow rate through that passage <b>94</b> is not as high as the flow rate in another passage <b>94</b>. Similarly, another valve <b>108</b> could be closed to further restrict flow through the corresponding passage <b>94</b>, where the flow rate through that passage <b>94</b> is too high compared to the flow rate in another passage <b>94</b>. Furthermore, multiple valves <b>108</b> can be adjusted at the same time to adjust flow rates in multiple passages <b>94</b>. It is within the scope of the present invention where such adjustments are made either manually or automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While the assembly <b>102</b> is configured to substantially equalize the air mass flow rates and the trapped air mass in each cylinder, the principles of the present invention are applicable where the assembly <b>102</b> provides different air flows to each cylinder to substantially equalize the trapped equivalence ratios. Also, the illustrated assembly <b>102</b> is configured to be operably coupled with the gas fuel system <b>50</b> to cooperatively control and equalize trapped equivalence ratios. For instance, the gas fuel system <b>50</b> can adjust the fuel flow rate into one or more selected cylinders, with the valves <b>108</b> also adjusting air flow into one or more selected cylinders. Such adjustments could be made simultaneously to equalize trapped equivalence ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The intake balancing assembly <b>102</b> is typically installed as an aftermarket upgrade to the engine <b>26</b>, but could be installed as part of an original equipment engine package. In particular, the illustrated engine <b>26</b> and other similar engines present a severely confined space, i.e., along the intake runners <b>74</b>, between the intake manifold <b>72</b> and corresponding cylinders. However, the valves <b>108</b> and sensors <b>112</b> are specifically configured to be installed and operate in the confined location between the intake manifold <b>72</b> and the corresponding cylinders without altering the intake manifold <b>72</b> and the cylinders. In this manner, the intake balancing assembly <b>102</b> has been found to provide a relatively low-cost aftermarket solution for improving engine performance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In operation, engine performance is monitored by the intake balancing assembly <b>102</b>. The assembly <b>102</b> can measure intake air flow rates into the cylinders. Furthermore, the measured values can be compared and used to adjust the assembly <b>102</b>, e.g., by controlling the position of one or more valves <b>108</b>, to balance the air flow rates among the cylinders. The balancing process can be conducted generally for changes in engine load or environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature or humidity. Furthermore, the process can be conducted at periodic intervals or dynamically as changes occur.</p>
