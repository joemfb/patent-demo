<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to systems and methods for delivering drugs to a patient. In particular, the present invention relates to systems and methods for subcutaneous infusion of drugs or substances and using energy sources to improve effectiveness of the infused drugs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Diabetes is a very serious illness affecting millions of people today. Many diabetic patients require injection of insulin to maintain proper levels of glucose in their blood in order to survive. Such injections of insulin are done using drug delivery systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many medical treatment systems and methods involve drug delivery systems that employ subcutaneous infusions of therapeutic fluids, drugs, proteins, and other compounds. Such delivery systems and methods, especially in the area of insulin delivery, have made use of subcutaneous catheters and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pumps. In conventional insulin pumps, the pump is configured to be attached to a disposable thin plastic tube or a catheter through which insulin passes into the tissue. The catheter can be inserted transcutaneously, typically on the patient's abdomen, and is changed every two to three days. New types of insulin pumps, such as the OmniPod pump manufactured by Insulet Corporation, do not have an external catheter and, but rather, a catheter port that is embedded into the pump mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In many instances, the patients require insulin delivery around the clock to keep proper levels of glucose in their blood. Insulin can be delivered at a basal rate or in bolus doses. The basal rate represents insulin that is continuously delivered to the patient. Such continuous delivery of insulin keeps patient's blood glucose in the desired range between meals and over night. The bolus dose is an amount of insulin delivered to the patient matching a dose of carbohydrates consumed by the patient to address increased glucose levels as a result of the ingested food. Some conventional pump mechanisms are configured to react upon command, or by way of an algorithm, to the increase in glucose levels by delivering a bolus dose of insulin that matches the rise in the level of glucose and prevents large glucose excursions. However, many conventional subcutaneous drug delivery systems are incapable of quickly matching or preventing the rise of blood glucose. The delay in such matching is also true in case of the &#x201c;rapid-acting&#x201d; insulin. Some of the reasons for this delay include a lag in the absorption of insulin from the injection site and the time it takes for complex insulin molecules to break down into monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, since blood glucose levels rise immediately following the meal, the delay in matching insulin to the rising levels causes post prandial hyperglycemic events (i.e., when levels of blood glucose are above normal) to occur. Further, occasionally after a certain period of time passes (e.g., 2-3 hours) after a meal, the blood glucose levels drop yet insulin concentrations in the blood rise followed by the peak of the systemic insulin effect and result in causing hypoglycemic events (i.e., when levels of blood glucose are below normal) to occur. Both hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events are highly undesirable. Additionally, since the local blood perfusion at the insulin infusion region has large variations depending on the ambient temperature and other parameters, it induces large variations to said delay of the peak of time profile of the insulin action. Those variations in the insulin peak action period further increase the variability in the blood glucose level.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, it is desirable to provide a system and a method that provides efficient and timely delivery of the drug to the patient. In particular, it is desirable to provide a system and a method for delivering insulin to the patient that improves effectiveness of insulin in the blood to maintain normal levels of blood glucose and prevent or reduce hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention relate to systems, devices and methods for delivery of drugs, substances and/or chemicals (together &#x201c;drugs&#x201d; or &#x201c;substances&#x201d;) to a patient and for improving the effectiveness of such drugs once they are delivered. In some embodiments, of the present invention, a device for improving performance of catheter-based drug delivery devices is provided. The catheter can be an adjunct to a pump or embedded into the pump mechanism. In such embodiments, the device can be applied to the vicinity of the tissue region of the patient into which a drug (e.g., insulin) is delivered, to expose the tissue region to a treatment as heat, cooling, temperature control, mechanical vibrations, suction, massaging, acoustic stimulation (e.g., ultrasound), electromagnetic radiation, electric field, magnetic field, radio frequency irradiation, microwave irradiation, electrical stimulation, or the like, or any combination of the above treatments to improve the drug's pharmacokinetic and for pharmacodynamic profile. The tissue treatment element may stimulate or inhibit tissue by introducing secondary substances for example including but not limited to drugs, medicament, chemical, biologically active bacteria, biologically inactive bacteria or the like or also any combination of the above treatments to improve the drug's pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such a device, according to some embodiments of the present invention, can also be part of a catheter which has one section inside the tissue and another section that connects to a unit outside the tissue (i.e., a transcutaneous delivery system). As can be understood by one skilled in the art, properties (such as amplitude, phase, frequency, etc.) of the individual excitation source(s), the combination of excitation sources, the relative ratio and timing between the various excitation sources, may be controlled by a processor in order to achieve a desired response of the tissue region next to the catheter. The sources can also be adjusted according to the chemical/physical properties of the infused substance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, of the present invention, a device for supplying energy to a tissue region (or infused region) can be configured to monitor and control the properties of the excitation sources (such as amplitude, phase, intensity, frequency, etc.). Based on the monitoring, the information can be provided to a controller (&#x201c;controller&#x201d;, also referred to as a &#x201c;processing unit&#x201d;) that uses the information to reduce the variability of the drug delivery process. In such embodiments, the device can be configured to monitor properties of the tissue next to the catheter element (e.g., such as temperature). Based on such monitoring, the information can be provided to the controller that utilizes the information to improve the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile of the drug in the desired direction as well as performance and reduce variability of the drug delivery process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The device according to some embodiments of the present invention can be configured to either automatically detect the drug delivery through the catheter by the delivery apparatus, get a signal from the drug delivery device, get the signal from a separate button or switch to initiate a protocol of exposing the infused tissue region to the above described treatments or tissue stimulations. The device can then be configured to begin operating by applying a stimulation or a treatment to the tissue. The tissue response to the stimulation enhances the functionality of a drug delivery pump by enhancing the kinetics of molecule transport between the catheter tip placed inside the tissue to the various compartments of the tissue region around it and to the blood system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the applied treatment may reduce the variability of the drug absorption in the blood or lymph system and its local and systemic effects. For example, heating the tissue region in the vicinity of the area of drug delivery (i.e., infused region) to a preset regulated temperature during the drug infusion and absorption into the blood may make local blood perfusion at that region more reproducible and the drug absorption process more uniform and reproducible as well. Also, by reducing the delay between the drug delivery into the tissue and absorption into the blood system, the variability of the drug action induced by the delayed profile can be reduced. The temperature of the region adjacent to the infusion region can be regulated for longer periods, but the cost may be the energy source volume and weight. Therefore, for minimization of the energy source size the heating period should be optimized in relation to the period of the drug infusion and absorption into the blood.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the tissue treatment or stimulation device may be triggered manually by the user. The user may activate the treatment device or devices before or after the pump activation to enhance the tissue response to the delivered drug. In such embodiments, this can be done by pressing a button or a sequence of buttons on the tissue treatment device. In some embodiments, in case of communication between the drug delivery device and the treatment device, the treatment can be triggered manually by pressing a button or a sequence of buttons on the drug delivery device. For example, in case of an insulin pump, the pump may have a special button for triggering a &#x201c;fast bolus&#x201d; compared to the other bolus options provided by the pump. The fast insulin bolus mode can be configured to start one of the disclosed treatments in parallel to application of the insulin bolus infusion for a given period of time, such as 30 minutes (for example). This improves or modifies (in an advantageous manner) insulin's pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics, tissue blood perfusion and/or absorption in the blood and is highly attractive in conjunction with high glycemic index food. Application of a &#x201c;fast bolus&#x201d; may be useful in consumption of high glycemic index food where larger rapid glucose excursions occurs, but also in most of the cases of using insulin boluses for prandial coverage. Application of a &#x201c;fast bolus&#x201d; can be initiated by pressing a special sequence of buttons or choosing a bolus mode using the pump display and buttons. In some embodiments, the user may trigger the tissue treatment or stimulation before the application of the bolus to further improve the treatment effect. In some embodiments, the user may trigger the tissue treatment or stimulation together with the infusion of the insulin bolus before the meal to further increase the treatment effect. In some embodiments, the tissue treatment or stimulation may be triggered after the bolus to save battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some embodiments of the present invention also provide methods for monitoring tissue parameters non-invasively or invasively using the catheter or both invasively and non-invasively, and using the information to control activation of the device of the present invention</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some embodiments of the present invention also provide methods for improving or modifying a drug's pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile in order to reduce time to peak action in the blood of the injected material by applying a modulation pattern to the pump. With this modulation, the infusion fluid is slightly pulled in and out of the tissue during or after the drug infusion process. In such embodiments, this method may not require an addition of any other devices to the current infusion pump rather it can be configured to modulate drug flow from the drug delivery element or pump.</p>

The terms &#x201c;targeted area&#x201d; or &#x201c;targeted areas&#x201d;, or &#x201c;target site&#x201d;, as used herein, are defined to include a systemic bloodstream of a human body, areas of a human body which can be reached by a systemic bloodstream including, but not limited to muscles, brain, liver, kidneys, etc., and body tissue regions proximate a location of an administered drug.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Some embodiments of the present invention provide automatic regulation of a measurand level in a user body by controlling the amount of infused drug that influence measured level at the user body. For example, there are many attempts to compose an &#x201c;artificial pancreas&#x201d; to control blood glucose level, since the development of continuous glucose monitors. In this case, any delay such as delay of the insulin absorption and action time, any variability in this delay and any variability in the residual insulin level in the body induces an error for the control algorithm that will result in less tight glucose regulation. Thus, by applying tissue treatment to the insulin delivery site as described by the methods and devices in the present application a better accuracy and robustness of a control algorithm that uses glucose sensor readings can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some embodiments of the present invention provide for an implantable drug delivery device for the automatic and direct introduction of a drug to a target site, wherein the drug may be introduced to an implanted compartment from an external drug source.

An implanted sensor may be coupled to the controller for further control of the drug dosage and delivery time. The sensor may indicate to the controller the level of a measurand. For example, the measurand may be indicative of the glucose level, cholesterol level or the like, at least partially based on which the controller determines the required treatment protocol, for example including but not limited to the drug dosage to be delivered, timing of the drug delivery or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The sensor may, according to some embodiments, be external to the drug delivery member and used externally to measure a measurand for example the blood glucose level.

Insulin production may be achieved by an active process, for example including but not limited to the activity of beta cells, genetically transformed cells, tissues, or the like live cultures or cells able to produce insulin, on demand. The trigger for producing and administrating the correct dose of insulin is the glucose level which may for example be sensed by the beta cells themselves. The tissue or skin treatments or stimulation methods can be used to treat or stimulate a tissue region to which insulin is infused by the insulin producing cells.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the insulin producing cells may be covered or encapsulated to prevent the immune system from attacking the implanted cells. In some embodiments, the insulin producing cells may be disposed in an implanted closure or housing with additional components. In some embodiments, such as in case of implanted beta cells or other drug producing cells, the tissue treatment element may be used to control tissue conditions that could improve the production of the implanted cells. For example, by improving local perfusion the cell has increased availability of oxygen, glucose and other required building blocks. By improving the local perfusion also the beta cells or other glucose sensing element can react without unwanted delays to fast glucose variations, since the delay of the glucose transport for the blood system to the ISF compartment and to the sensor is reduced when local blood perfusion is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The tissue treatment element, according to some embodiments, is used to stimulate tissue at the delivery site to improve insulin uptake in the body.

Furthermore the type of tissue treatment employed may include at least one or more of nociceptive axon reflex, heat, cold, intermittent temperature change, ultrasound, optical, massage, physical stimulation, vibration, suction, IR, microwave, RF, optical, infusion of one or more additional substances, or the like. These treatments may be applied on the external skin surface, in internal tissue, or subcutaneous tissue in order to bring about an effect.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A tissue treatment protocol may be carried out at the target site or in its vicinity. One tissue treatment protocol may be heating to temperature of about 39.5&#xb0; C. which is applied for short bursts for a period of 2-60 seconds every few minutes, evoking vasodilatation that improves the drug pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics in the drug infused tissue region. However, the specific treatment protocol parameters related to tissue type, threshold levels, burst timing, resting period, heat levels, heating power, time required for temperature rise and fall, and so forth, are variable and controllable. Some embodiments, whether as systems or methods of the present invention, provide for a system and/or method that are customized for an individual and feature a user specific treatment protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Heat (and the heating process) may be applied to the vicinity of the drug infused tissue region. In some cases, such as for the infusion of some types of insulin and/or other proteins to the tissue heating to a temperature above some limiting level, such as for example 37&#xb0; C., the heating is applied only to the vicinity of the drug infused tissue and not to the drug infused tissue region itself. This limitation of the heating area and/or volume prevents heating the drug above a limiting temperature that can denature or modify the drug itself. Heating the drug infused region vicinity induces a vasodilatation response also in the drug infused tissue region as was shown by W. Magerl et. al., Journal of Physiology, 497.3, pp 837-848 (1996), which discloses that heating the skin can induce vasodilatation in human at a distance of even 30 mm also due to activation of the nociceptive axon reflex. Heat may be applied according to many methods and devices described herein and/or in the applications incorporated herein by reference, including but not limited to one or more of direct heating through thermal energy, which can be generated electrically, such as using a resistor, or chemically, such as using exothermic reaction, and/or applying other forms of energy, including but not limited to ultrasound, optical radiation, electromagnetic radiation, microwave, RF (radio frequency) energy and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The human neural response to thermal stimulation includes several mechanisms such as the Nociceptive Axon Reflex that induce vasodilatation among other effects. The neural thermal response may vary widely between individuals. Therefore, in some embodiments, the system and method of the present invention feature a customized, calibrated, individualized tissue treatment that may be adjusted in one or more aspects to a specific individual to provide optimal drug delivery for an individual through the application of optimized tissue treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The neural thermal stimulation protocol may be calibrated for individual patient to optimize the stimulation protocol according to their own nociceptive axon reflex activation threshold. For example, W. Margerl et. al. discloses that the vasodilatation evoking temperature after 64 seconds of heating can vary between 37-43&#xb0; C. for different subjects, therefore individualized control of tissue heating may improve the efficiency, the accuracy and/or the repeatability of a drug delivery system with the required control of a tissue treatment element. Calibration can be achieved relative to a specific tissue targeted site. They also showed that in some cases short periods of heating can also evoke vasodilatation for a period of few minutes. Therefore it may be possible to control the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties of a drug delivered to a tissue region, with the introduction of heat to evoke vasodilatation, eventually leading to improved drug uptake. However, heat can also be problematic as it may affect or even degrade the function of the drug itself. Thus heating for short time intervals with one to few minutes pause between them may induce less excessive heat to the tissue and prevent heating the infused drug itself, in cases heating the drug is unwanted effect, or can reduce the system power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A method for calibrating the treatment device is to initiate tissue stimulation gradually in the first instant of use of the treatment device and measure the treatment effect on the tissue, such as vasodilatation, using a specific sensor, including, for example (but not limited) a Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) that is connected to the processor unit that controls the treatment device. The controller unit determines what level of tissue treatment to apply, to optimize the treatment effect without causing any adverse effects. For example, in the case where the tissue treatment employed is applying heat having the desired effect of increasing vasodilatation, the tissue treatment element may gradually heat the tissue until a predefined safety limit and measure the local tissue vasodilatation. The level of blood perfusion and vasodilatation can be measured by Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) or by other sensors accepted or known in the art. Another option for measuring the blood perfusion is using an optical sensor for measuring tissue absorption and/or scattering, for example at the wavelength range of about 700 to about 1000 nm, which relates to the hemoglobin concentration at the probed tissue region. The processing unit may use the sensor information to determine the threshold temperature that evokes the neural response which induces the required vasodilatation level.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The calibration process may be carried out with an individual to determine the limits of the vasodilatation neural response and also the level of discomfort the individual is willing to endure. The process also determines the temperature threshold that is safe. For example, the various parameters, may include (but not limited to) burst timing, timing and length of resting period, heat levels, temperature, or current type. These parameters may be changed in order to personalize the treatment protocol relative to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Another method for calibrating the treatment device may be to initiate application of tissue stimulation gradually. For example, the first time that the treatment device is used for an individual, tissue stimulation is applied gradually and then the treatment effect on the tissue is measured, by, for example, vasodilatation, using a specific sensor as described above until the required level of induced vasodilatation is achieved or the maximal safety temperature is reached. The processing unit uses this information regarding the baseline for the individually adjusted treatment level to determine the future tissue treatment levels for that specific patient.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the controller may have access to various treatment protocols and historical data (which may be locally stored in a memory connected to the controller) relative to the different situation sensed by at least one or more sensor. The controller may also employ learning algorithms, including, for example (but not limited to), artificial intelligence methods to adjust or adapt the treatment protocols to be more specific or tailored to the drug delivery needs and of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the automated calibration process may be repeated periodically, for example every 6-12 hours, to compensate for changes that might have an influence on the temperature threshold of the neural thermal response, such as the axon reflex response of the individual. Any of the parameters, including but not limited to one or more of burst timing, timing and length of resting periods, heat levels, temperature or current type (for example) may be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the calibration process is repeated every time (or shortly before) the drug delivery or the tissue treatment element is operated. For example, the calibration process may be repeated during insulin bolus injection to ensure an appropriate induced vasodilatation response.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, event related calibration may be used to prevent or reduce the occurrence of gradually appearing variations in the neural response, such as axon reflex, due to variations of factors that influence the neural response, for example including but not limited to levels of nitric oxide and/or noradrenaline at the target tissue site.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, when tissue treatment, such as heating, is applied to the treatment area, a treatment parameter, for example temperature, may gradually be adjusted by the device's controller while measuring the desired tissue parameters such as vasodilatation, which may use Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF), to create a feedback calibration loop. Once vasodilatation reaches an intended value, the amount or rate of tissue treatment is stabilized to maintain that level of dilatation over a period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the calibration process is repeated also during the tissue treatment or stimulation. In this case, the treatment, such as heating, after initiation as previously described, is then regulated to maintain the desired tissue parameter(s), such as vasodilatation level, stabilized to a target level, more during the entire treatment. Stabilizing the desired tissue parameter, such as vasodilatation level, stabilizes also the absorption of drug in the blood and improves the consistency and reproducibility of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Controlling the tissue treatment level according to the desired tissue parameter(s), such as the vasodilatation level for example, may also reduce the power consumption of the treatment device according to some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, in case of heating, since a short period of heating to a certain temperature above the threshold temperature initiates the axon reflex response and vasodilatation, there may not be a need to keep the temperature high for a long period, because of the lag effect of the axon reflex. Reduction of the temperature also reduces power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, calibration processes are repeated also during the treatment. In such a case, the treatment, such as drug administration, is started. The stimulatory effect is then calibrated with regard to the effect of drug administration, so that the level of drug (for example) may and be used to calibrate the desired amount of stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, the neural response that induces vasodilatation is stimulated by applying a mechanical force to the vicinity of the drug infused region, including but not limited to one or more of pressure, massage, vibration, suction and/or other known in the art mechanical stimulation. These tissue treatments or stimulation are known to stimulate the nociceptive axon reflex as well. Among the advantages of mechanical stimulation is that mechanical stimulation does not damage the drug, whereas for example heating above 37&#xb0; C. might damage insulin. The calibration of the applied mechanical force may be performed by using one of the procedures described above.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, the neural response that induces vasodilatation may be additionally stimulated by infusion of one or more additional substances which may include any known peripheral vasodilator, such as tolazine, naftidrofuryl or suloctidil, to the vicinity of the drug infused region. In some embodiments, the additional substance infused into the vicinity of the measured tissue region modifies the drug pharmacokinetic and/or local blood perfusion with or without the creation of a chemical or other reaction between the drug and said one or more substances. This effect may be additive or synergistic to the above described forms of stimulation. For instance, nitroprusside, which induces vasodilatation, can improve blood perfusion in the drug infused tissue region. Another example is capsaicin that stimulates a neural response through the VR<b>1</b> receptor and produces a similar response to thermal stimulation. The calibration of the level of the applied additional one or more substances may be performed by using one of the procedures described above. In some embodiments, the neural response that induces vasodilatation may be additionally stimulated by applying electrical current (which is known to increase tissue blood flow) to the vicinity of the drug infused region. The calibration of the level of the applied electrical current may be performed by using one of the procedures described above.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the neural response that induces vasodilatation may be stimulated through a combination of the above suggested stimulation types. For example, by combining low temperature heat (for example below 37&#xb0; C.) and mechanical stimulation, a better neural response may be achieved without damaging the drug molecule because of excessive heat. Another non-limiting example involves combining low temperature heat (for example below 37&#xb0; C.) and infusion of an additional substance for obtaining a neural response without damaging the drug molecule because of excessive heat. Another non-limiting example involves combining application of a low level of thermal stimulation (for example below 37&#xb0; C.) and application of electrical current to increase tissue blood perfusion more efficiently, without damaging the drug molecule because of excessive heat.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the induced neural response, such as the nociceptive axon reflex, may also induce widening of the capillary pores and increasing the capillary wall permeability. This effect is also significant for improving the absorption of said drag through the capillary wall.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In any of the embodiments of the present invention, the tissue treatment element may be used to treat a tissue region to which insulin is infused during basal or bolus insulin delivery. One possible effect of the tissue treatment is improving the efficiency of absorption of the insulin into the blood and/or lymphatic systems, thereby reducing the amount of the insulin needed to create the desired metabolic effect. Without being limited by a single hypothesis, the undesired adverse effects of the excess insulin levels, such as excess weight gain, may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Another effect of the tissue treatment according to some embodiments is improving and reducing the amounts and the duration that the insulin remains at the tissue infused region, since it is absorbed faster in the blood and/or lymphatic systems. Without being limited by a single hypothesis, the undesired local adverse effects of the excess insulin levels, such as the lipohypertrophy or local irritation may be reduced. Also, another possible benefit to using the tissue treatment element of the present invention is the induced increase in local blood perfusion, which reduces the local inflammation effects seen in current infusion sets. Another possible benefit to treating the tissue target area is the reduction of the short and long term local effects of insulin on the insulin infusion site, therefore the tissue treatment element may (and) lengthen the duration of using the same delivery site and may increase the longevity of the functionality of the infusion set.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some the embodiments of the present invention, the stimulation protocol, may be determined by the controller, depending on the drug delivery mode used. For example, tissue stimulation methods may be activated for a drug delivery protocol of elective or preprogrammed boluses for brief periods to provide a boost to insulin absorption. In some embodiments, tissue and/or skin treatment methods may form a part of all or some of the elements of complex pre programmed boluses, including but not limited to split wave, square root and other bolus patterns. The stimulation may be activated for the initial phase of a standard bolus protocol, specifically for pre-programmed components of a split bolus or at intervals of interest of the square bolus. Stimulation may also be activated by a pre-programmed duty cycle independent of the bolus type. Moreover, the intermittent activation can be synchronized with individual bolus delivery components of the basal rate.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Although the foregoing has been described with respect to drug delivery of insulin for the treatment of diabetes, this is a non limiting example of the present invention. Any additional chronic or acute condition may be treated with the drug delivery device of the present invention, for example including but not limited to hypoxia, anemia, cholesterol, stroke, heart or the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Method and System for Drug Delivery</heading>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The present invention relates to devices for improving, modifying and/or stabilizing pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile of a drug infused into the tissue by a catheter and absorbed into the blood or lymphatic system. The devices described in some of the embodiments of the present application apply additional treatment or stimulation to the vicinity of the drug delivery site. The treatment can be one or combination of the following tissue treatment treatments modalities: heating, modifying temperature, massaging, mechanical vibration, acoustic vibration, ultrasound, suction, infusion of an additional substance or chemical, applying a low electric field, applying a low magnetic field, light irradiation, infrared (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) irradiation, microwave (&#x201c;MW&#x201d;) irradiation, etc. In some embodiments, the device has a catheter for insertion within the tissue to infuse a substance into the infused tissue region. The infused tissue region (i.e., the infused region) can be one of the skin layers or the subcutaneous tissue or deeper tissue elements within any organ or viscera.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The catheter may also have a securing mechanical part that adheres to the skin and secures the catheter into its location and prevent it from being pulled out accidentally. The proximal end of the catheter may be connected to a drug delivery device which controls the infusion profile of the drug. In some embodiments, the drug delivery device also controls the additional treatment applied to the infused tissue region. In those embodiments, there is a communication channel between the drug delivery device and the treatment device. The communication can be either wired or wireless. Portions of the treatment device can be disposed inside the drug delivery device or outside of it. In some embodiments, the drug delivery device is a drug delivery pump, such as an insulin pump.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments, the present invention is a device controlled by a pump that infuses a drug into a tissue region, which applies an additional treatment to the vicinity of the drug delivery site. In some embodiments, the pump's electronic processing unit operates based on a predetermined protocol or algorithm, any additional inputs and/or a drug-infusion profile of the applied treatment. In some embodiments, the pump's electronic processing unit communicates with the treatment device processing unit, which operates based on a predetermined protocol or algorithm and according to a drug infusion profile of the applied treatment. In some embodiments, the device regularly queries the pump's status using the pump's built-in communication capability. Based on the received data, the device operates in accordance with a predetermined protocol or algorithm of the applied treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the devices are neither controlled by the pump nor have any communications with the drug delivery pump. Instead, the devices detect the drug-delivery profile through the catheter and apply the treatment according to a predetermined protocol or algorithm. In such embodiments, the treatment device includes a sensor that can detect the drug infusion flow inside the catheter and deliver the information to the device processing unit, which operates based on a predetermined protocol or algorithm and on an infusion profile of the applied treatment. The drug flow can be detected by any conventional sensors, such as an optical sensor that detects the drug flow in a transparent catheter, a laser Doppler sensor, an ultrasonic Doppler sensor, a pressure sensor, a conductivity sensor, an inductance sensor that can measure changes in the flow rate of the infusion fluid under induced magnetic field. In some embodiments, the drug flow sensor detects not only the existence of a drug infusion flow, but also the infusion rate and uses that information in the treatment algorithm. In some embodiments, the drug infusion sensor detects the electromagnetic or acoustic emission of the drug delivery pump motor or electronics. In some embodiments, the device senses some additional parameters of the tissue and uses that information as well in the treatment algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some embodiments, tissue treatment controls the temperature of the tissue region into which the drug is delivered. In some embodiments, temperature control can be to set a profile of temperature rise in a known rate, temperature stabilization at a known period and ending the profile by returning to the natural tissue temperature. This profile can be induced by a heater that heats the drug infused tissue region. Other temperature profiles for treatment or excitation of the drug infused tissue region are possible as well. For example, a cooling profile for decreasing blood perfusion or to induce a specific pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile for the drug or heating for short time intervals to further improve drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. In some embodiments, the temperature profile can be applied to a larger region than the drug infused tissue region. Doing so may improve blood perfusion also in the vicinity of the drug infused tissue region and by way of a further increase drug absorption rate into the circulation by increasing the available absorption volume. In some embodiments, the temperature profile can be applied to a region smaller than the drug infused tissue region to save battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">A device for heating the tissue region into which the drug is delivered according to some embodiments of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this embodiment, the infusion catheter is combined with a heating element attached to the skin around the catheter. The treatment device is a flat circular structure <b>7</b> with an opening in its center for the catheter tube <b>5</b> for entering the subcutaneous tissue. The other end of the catheter is connected to the drug delivery pump. In the illustrated embodiments, the treatment device includes a heating element <b>2</b>, which may include a printed circuit board having the heating elements (e.g., resistors) provided thereon (as can be understood by one skilled in the art, other heating element types may be used). In some embodiments, the printed circuit board includes a temperature sensor <b>3</b>. In some embodiments, a cooling element may be included in the case where more demanding temperature profiles are used.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The heating element can include a controller that controls the heating element (e.g., on/off or increased/decreased power) in order to stabilize the skin temperature to the required temperature according to the algorithm. In some embodiments, the temperature can be between 32-40&#xb0; C. in order not to irritate the skin on the one hand and to have a sufficient effect on the tissue on the other hand. Temperature stabilization algorithms are well know in the art and can be executed by relatively simple controllers/processing units or ASICs. Skin or tissue damage depends on the applied temperature and the heat exposure time, so for a short period of few minutes even higher temperatures up to range of 42&#xb0; C. can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some cases lower heating temperatures may be required. For instance, Novolog (aspart) insulin can be exposed to maximal limiting temperature of 37&#xb0; C. (FDA document NDA 20-986/S-024, &#x201c;NovoLog Insulin aspart (rDNA) Injection&#x201d;, Jul. 26, 2004). In such an embodiment, the skin temperature can be slightly higher as long as the immediate vicinity of the insulin infusion site is below 37&#xb0; C. For this case, there is advantage in the heating configuration by the present invention and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, since the device warms the tissue and not the insulin, so minimal temperature modification is affecting the injected insulin per se while maximal heat stimulation is applied to the tissue, in order to increase local blood perfusion. Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the heating element <b>2</b> is not in contact with insulin infusion catheter <b>5</b>. For this reason, the present invention suggests also thermal isolation <b>7</b> between insulin catheter <b>5</b> and heating element <b>2</b>, such that the insulin is not overheated and minimally exposed to high temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, an additional or alternate temperature sensor <b>4</b> is located inside the catheter tube <b>5</b>. This temperature sensor allows better control of the temperature of the drug infused tissue region. Specifically, first, the insulin limiting temperature inside the tissue can be avoided even though higher temperatures can be used at the skin to get optimal stimulation of the blood perfusion in the region. Also, by regulating the temperature inside the drug infused region to a fixed optimal temperature, a better stabilization of the drug chemical processes, pharmacokinetics, absorption into the blood system and/or pharmacodynamics can be achieved. The local temperature variations in the drug infused region induced by ambient temperature variations as well as other factors induce variations in the blood absorption rate of the drug and induces larger variability of the drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. As mentioned before, in the case of insulin delivery, it is important to reduce the variability of the temporal profile of the insulin absorption into the blood and tighter local temperature control can be advantageous improve the glucose level regulation of diabetic patients.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments, the heating element <b>2</b> and one or two of the temperature sensors <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are connected to the drug delivery pump through cable <b>6</b>. In this embodiment, the drug delivery pump may include the power source and the controller of the treatment process.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In some embodiments, element <b>7</b> covering heating element <b>2</b> is thermally isolating. Specifically, element <b>7</b> reduces the heat dissipation to the environment in case of heating the tissue. As mentioned earlier, element <b>7</b> can also thermally isolate the drug in catheter <b>5</b> from being exposed to the increased temperature of the heater(s). In case of cooling of the drug infused tissue region, element <b>7</b> reduces heat transfer from the environment to the cooled tissue region. It can also ease the thermal stabilization of the infused tissue region, in case of changing environments and ambient temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In some embodiments, the heating device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is attached to the tissue with an adhesive layer (tape) <b>1</b>. The adhesive layer can also cover the heating element. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer may be a thermal conducting adhesive or a thin adhesive layer. The adhesive layer may be provided covered with a laminate (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that is peeled off by the user before insertion of the catheter and attachment of the heating device. Typically, for catheter insertion, the device is supplied with a sterile needle inside the catheter (not shown in the figure) that is pulled out after insertion of the catheter to the required tissue region.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments, the heating device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an adhesive thermally conducting layer in contact with the skin, an electrically isolating layer with temperature sensors, a heating layer, a thermally isolating layer and an adhesive layer for attaching heating device <b>2</b> to additional thermal isolation <b>7</b> if needed. All layers can be manufactured using printing techniques and mass production methods.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Another device for heating the tissue region into which the drug is delivered is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the infusion catheter contains a heating element <b>52</b> in a distal part <b>50</b>, which is close to the infused tissue region. The heating element can be made of a conductive wire with high enough resistance and good strength and durability. For instance, tungsten wires or deposition of thin copper strip are commonly used for this purpose. Heating element <b>52</b> may be embedded into the catheter tube during the manufacturing of the tube, using methods known in the art. For example, this can be done by wrapping the wire coil on a thin wall tube and then covering it with a second polymeric layer. The other side of the heating wire coil <b>51</b> is directed up in the tube as well. In some embodiments, the heating wire can be shaped in other forms such as a single loop or zigzag or whatever can be efficiently manufactured to provide the required heat for the infused tissue region. An advantage of heating inside the tissue is a smaller volume of tissue around the drug infused region is heated and hence requires less electric power. Also, the heated volume, usually in the subcutaneous tissue, is better isolated from the skin temperature which may vary with the ambient temperature. However, in this case, the catheter temperature can be limited to a temperature that will not alter the properties of the infused drug in case of drugs that are more sensitive to temperature increase then insulin. In the external heating configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the spatial temperature distribution may be such that the skin temperature and tissue regions around but not close to the catheter tip are at higher temperature without causing any damage to temperature sensitive drugs. In the external heating configuration, the drug exposure to the higher temperatures may be more limited, although the high temperature still affects a portion of the drug infused tissue region or the tissue regions around the drug infused tissue regions.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In some embodiments, temperature sensor <b>53</b> is located inside the catheter tube as well. This sensor monitors the infused tissue region temperature. This temperature sensor allows better control of the temperature of the infused tissue region. By better stabilization of the drug chemical breakdown and dissolution processes or pharmacokinetics or absorption kinetics into the blood system an improved and more reproducible pharmacodynamic profile can be achieved. In this device, the controller can be either in the treatment device or in the drug delivery pump and controls the heating current to stabilize the infused tissue region temperature to the required temperatures and durations according to the algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments, device element <b>56</b> that supports the catheter attachment to the body is thermally isolating to further reduce the power requirements of the heating element and by thus, battery weight. The heating device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is attached to the tissue with adhesive layer <b>55</b>. The adhesive layer can come covered with a laminate (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that is peeled off by the user before insertion of the catheter and attachment of the heating device. In some embodiments, another temperature sensor <b>54</b> may be in contact with the skin to improve the temperature stabilization algorithm. In some embodiments, only skin temperature is used in conjunction with the catheter heating element. In some embodiments, heating elements provided internally and externally of the tissue may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The other side of the catheter is connected to the drug delivery pump. In some embodiments, in this configuration as well as in other configurations detailed in the subject disclosure, all wires that connect the treatment device and the drug delivery pump may be embedded in the catheter tube connected to pump as shown in the tube cross section at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In some embodiments, the wires are attached to the outer side of the tube as shown in the cross-section illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Embedding or attaching the wires to the tube enables the device to be more comfortable for the user (e.g., to be worn and handled).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The wires shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are preferable connected to the drug delivery pump. In some embodiments, two connectors may be used for connection of the disposable catheter and treatment device to the drug delivery pump. The first connector connects the catheter tube to the pump as currently established, for instance, in many current commercial insulin pumps. A second connector may be used to connect the wires used by the treatment device for communication between the pump unit and the treatment device unit or power supply or connecting sensors used for sensing of tissue parameters and/or infusion parameters to the pump unit. The wire connector can be one of the known connectors for connecting electrical wires. In case of using two separate connectors for the electrical wires and the infusion tube, the wires can also be separated from the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the tube connector <b>102</b> and the electrical wires connectors <b>103</b>-<b>106</b> can be combined into a single housing <b>101</b>. The single connector housing option is more comfortable for the user to handle, i.e., to assemble and disassemble the catheter and the treatment device from the pump unit. The connector housing can also include a known prior art clip or locking mechanism that enables disconnection of the connector only when the locking mechanism is pressed or opened. Such locking mechanism can reduce also the chance of leakage of the infusion fluid from the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, four wires are used for controlling the treatment device by the pump unit and for connecting a sensor that measures the treatment level or effect in order to stabilize the treatment effect to the required level. In other cases of treatments, sensors and device configurations, a different number of wires may be connected through the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments, a similar connector can also be used on the treatment device's side. These embodiments may be more comfortable for the user in case of an infusion catheter and a drug delivery pump used for longer periods such as 2-3 days. For some time periods, the drug delivery pump can be detached from the user's body leaving a minimal weight and length of tubing in contact with the user's body. These embodiments can be useful and more comfortable for taking a shower. In such a case, the tubing and wires can include either a connector on both ends, a connector on the treatment device end only or a connector on the drug delivery pump device end only. In case of having a connector on the treatment device side, another alternative includes having a disposable tube connecting the treatment device and the drug delivery pump, where a reusable electrical cable is attached to the drug delivery pump and includes a connector for connecting to the treatment device. In some embodiments, the tube and wires may be disposable as with the catheter or its securing device, for instance, as the tube and catheter of common insulin infusion sets are designed.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In some embodiments, the treatment device can be made of two parts, one being disposable and one being reusable, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The disposable part includes the catheter <b>150</b> that is inserted into the tissue and the insertion mechanism (not shown in the figure). In some embodiments, the treatment device can also include the skin attachment part <b>151</b> and an adaptor mechanism <b>152</b> to connect the two parts. In some embodiments, the treatment device can include all or a portion of the treatment element such as the heating element (in the case of heat treatment or other elements for other tissue treatments or excitation methods of the present invention). In some embodiments, the treatment device may include one or more sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The reusable part <b>155</b> may include all or a portion of the treatment element. It may include a processing unit, one or more sensors and a power source. The power source can be a rechargeable battery. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, two parts are attached with a mechanical locking mechanism <b>153</b> and four pins <b>154</b> for electrical connections. In case of rechargeable battery, the user may have two alternating reusable units <b>155</b> whereas one is attached to the treatment device and one stays charging. When the battery in the treatment device is empty, damaged or the user is instructed (based on a specific battery schedule), the user switches between the two reusable units. The charger unit has the same mechanical and electrical connection as the disposable part <b>152</b> that easily fits the reusable unit <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some embodiments, the reusable part communicates via a communication channel with the drug delivery pump, using wired, wireless, wireline or any other connection. In some embodiments, the treatment device has no communication with the drug delivery pump. For example, only the catheter tube, which is not shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, can be connected to the drug delivery pump.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Consequently, in the case of an insulin pump, this device can be used with many of the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps presently on the market and for those in development, for similar purposes. The treatment device identifies by itself the infusion of an insulin bolus and starts the treatment protocol accordingly. The beginning of insulin infusion can be identified as described earlier by a sensor in the treatment device such as an optical sensor on the transparent tube, a laser Doppler sensor, an ultrasonic Doppler sensor, a pressure sensor connected to the tube, or a conductivity sensor in the tube, under applied magnetic field, or a temperature sensor of the infusion fluid in the tube. Alternatively, the treatment device can identify the pump motor electromagnetic emission or acoustic emission to detect the bolus period. The sensors that require contact with the infusion fluid, such as the conductivity sensor, are located in the disposable part <b>152</b>. The other sensors may be either in the disposable part or in the reusable part with a respective known in the art mechanical structure that allow them to measure the required infusion fluid parameter or parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In some embodiments, a separate unit which is attached to the insulin pump detects the delivery of an insulin bolus and transmits the information to the treatment unit to start treatment, either with wired or wireless communication. The separate unit may sense the electromagnetic or acoustic emission of the pump motor or read the pump buttons when pressed or read the pump display or pump other indicators or have an additional button disposed on the pump for manual operation of the tissue treatment device. In some embodiments, the reusable unit may have at least one user input (e.g., a button) for the user to use (e.g., press) when the user desires the treatment to start.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In some embodiments, the reusable part or the disposable part is connected with an electrical cable to a third unit that may include the power source, the control unit or other electronic parts of the device. In some embodiments, a single part disposable treatment device is electrically connected to the third unit.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">An alternate embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where the reusable part is shaped as a thin disk <b>160</b> inserted between the disposable part <b>163</b> and the skin. Thin disk <b>160</b> can be a heater with a temperature sensor used to aid in stabilizing the temperature of the skin around the catheter insertion area. In some embodiments, the temperature sensor can be part of a thermostat that automatically regulates the heating temperature by connecting and disconnecting the heater element power lines, or other self regulating heaters, such as PTC thermistors, and or increasing or decreasing the power supplied to the heater.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In some embodiments, the thin heater can be manufactured by printing technologies. In some embodiments, the thin heater can be of thickness of 0.1-0.5 mm. In some embodiments, a thicker heater with thickness of 0.5-2 mm may be used. Also, a thin disk can be more flexible and more comfortable for the user. Before insertion into the tissue, the reusable disk <b>160</b> can be adhered or attached to the disposable part <b>163</b> such that the treatment element of the reusable device is adhered to the skin above the drug infused tissue region. In some embodiments, a special mechanical jig is used for attaching reusable disk <b>160</b> to disposable part <b>163</b>. In some embodiments, an inserter, such as inserters used for insulin infusion sets, is used for entering both units to the tissue. The thin heater disk <b>160</b> and the catheter securing element <b>163</b> can be disposable.

<p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another embodiment in which the disposable part <b>752</b> includes the catheter tube <b>751</b>, the insertion mechanism, the skin adhering element <b>750</b> the drug container and passive parts of the drug pump. In this embodiment, the reusable part includes a processing unit, a pump motor and may include some of the sensors, as described in shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The power source can be either in the reusable part or the disposable part. In case of using a rechargeable battery, the battery can be located in the reusable part, as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In some embodiments, the disposable battery is located in the disposable unit. Prior to insertion of the catheter into the tissue, the disposable part <b>752</b> may be attached to the reusable part <b>753</b> such that schematic electrical connection pins <b>754</b> fit the disposable part electrical connection pins and such that mechanical pump operating mechanism <b>757</b> in the reusable part fits the passive parts of the drug pump in the disposable unit. The pump mechanism can be one of the many known in the art pumping mechanisms. For instance, in case of a peristaltic pump, the mechanical pump operating mechanism <b>757</b> in the reusable part can be part of the pressure wheel of the peristaltic pump that presses a tube in the disposable part.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Alternately, a mechanical pump operating mechanism <b>757</b> in the reusable part can be a cog-wheel that rotates a matching pump cog wheel in the disposable part or moves a linear slider, such that the disposable unit includes only low cost parts. In some embodiments, some of the more expensive parts of the drug delivery pump can be included in the reusable unit. In some embodiments, the disposable part <b>752</b> is attached to the reusable part <b>753</b> with a locking mechanism <b>756</b>. The reusable part <b>753</b> can be wirelessly or wired connected to the drug delivery pump or to a third unit or not connected and contain the power source as described before.

<p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention, in which there is a single disposable unit <b>702</b> including the drug delivery pump, the treatment device, the catheter tube <b>701</b>, the insertion mechanism, the skin adhering element <b>700</b> and the power source. The single unit pump and treatment device can perform the above described treatments. In some embodiments, in case of a single unit with a heat treatment that can be accomplished either by direct heating or by indirect heating such as a byproduct of radiation, the drug reservoir is thermally insulated from the heating element or from the heated regions. This is useful in the case of the insulin delivery because of insulin's sensitivity to high temperatures. In some embodiments, the drug reservoir has in also a temperature sensor to verify that the drug temperature is not exceeding the limiting temperature. The same thermal insulation of the drug reservoir can be used in embodiments described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The devices schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref> are examples of different combinations of disposable and reusable units that provide insulin delivery with treatment or excitation of the drug infused tissue region. As can be understood by one skilled in the art, other embodiments ranging from fully disposable units to fully reusable units (except the catheter that normally will be disposable) are also possible whereas each of the device components can be provided in the disposable or reusable units according to its way of implementation and its production cost.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In some embodiments, the third unit can be attached externally to the drug delivery device to improve user's comfort. In such a case, electrical wires can be attached to the catheter tube at a large portion of the catheter length and be separated only near the drug delivery device such that the drug catheter is connected to the drug delivery device and the wires are connected to the third unit. The third unit can include also power source and controller. When the drug delivery starts (e.g., drug bolus delivery), the third unit can detect operation of the drug-delivery device either actively by direct communication between the two units or by passively sensing some signals induced by drug delivery device when operated as described before, such as using the electromagnetic emission of the drug delivery device. In some embodiments, the third unit can be disposed in a bag, a pouch, a case, or a belt adaptor containing the drug delivery pump such as devices used for carrying insulin pumps. In such a case, the tube is connected to the insulin pump, while the wires are connected to the carrying device. The carrying device can also include a switch for manual start of the treatment or indicators for indicating that the treatment is applied or indicators that the battery power is adequate, too low or indicators that a problem occurred with the treatment, such as wire disconnection, etc. The switch or indicators, or a portion thereof, can be disposed also on the reusable unit or disposable unit or on the drug delivery pump.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In some embodiments, the devices by the present invention can have short range RF or IR communication with a data management and control unit, such as a Personal Digital Assistant (&#x201c;PDA&#x201d;) computer, to a personal cellular phone or to an application specific data managing device that supports managing drug therapy. In case of insulin delivery, a data managing device can obtain glucose readings either from a glucose sensor manually, through data communication or by reading glucose sensing strips. The data managing device can get the information about previously consumed carbohydrates and other food or drinks. The data managing device can also retain patient history and relevant parameters, such as weight, BMI, insulin resistance etc.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The data managing device can also calculate the optimal required amount of insulin and the optimal tissue treatment or excitation profile. This information can be sent wirelessly to the drug delivery pump and to the treatment device, for optimal drug delivery.

In some embodiments, the data management and control unit may only recommend to the user an optimal drug dosage, an optimal treatment and/or an excitation profile to be applied to the infused tissue region and the patient can approve the treatment before it starts. In some embodiments, the data management and control unit may recommend the user an optimal drug dosage only and the patient may approve the dosage before it starts and decide on best treatment or excitation to be applied to the infused tissue region. In some embodiments, the data management and control unit can be part of the drug delivery pump. In some embodiments, the data management and control unit can include a switch for manual start of the treatment, indicators for indicating that the treatment is applied, indicators that the battery power is adequate, too low or indicators for determining if a problem occurred with the treatment, such as wire disconnection, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In some embodiments, tissue treatment or stimulation can include (either alone or in combination with other stimulation) vibrating the tissue region into which the drug is delivered.

The vibrating treatment device with open cover, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, includes an electric motor <b>202</b> that rotates a disk <b>201</b> with asymmetric load.

By adhering the treatment device to the skin with an adhesive layer, the treatment device vibrates the tissue underneath the treatment device and the catheter tip. This vibration can have a frequency of about 1-50 Hz, which is commonly used for massaging tissue, an typically includes 60-300 rpm. As can be understood by one skilled in the art, other frequencies, or rotational velocities can be used as well. In some embodiments, the motor axis can be horizontal with the rotating disk vertical to the skin surface. In this case, the vibrations are vertical to the skin surface in addition to horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The vibrating treatment device with open cover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, includes an electromagnet <b>251</b> that pulls a ferromagnetic rod with two weights at either end thereof. A spring returns the rod to his initial location after the electromagnet is turned off. Thus, by applying a periodical signal to the electromagnet, the rod with its weights will vibrate at the periodic signal frequency and induce vibrations to the tissue underneath. To improve vibration efficiency, the rod, weights mass and the spring force can be designed to have a mechanical resonance frequency at the required frequency for massaging the infused tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">When the resonance frequency is applied to the electromagnet a larger amplitude vibrations is induced. By adhering the treatment device to the skin with an adhesive layer, the treatment device vibrates the tissue underneath the treatment device and the catheter tip. In some embodiments, the vibration axis can be designed to vibrate to other directions, such as vertical or perpendicular to the skin surface. In some embodiments, the vibration device can vibrate mainly the catheter tip either horizontally or vertically using vibration mechanisms that induce excitation of the tissue near the catheter tip.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">An alternate embodiment of tissue massaging is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. This embodiment can massage with lower frequency and larger amplitude as compared to the vibrating embodiments. The treatment device (which in this embodiment may be disposable) includes a catheter tip <b>351</b> for inserting into tissue (as before), located in the middle of a chamber <b>354</b> with rigid wall all around except of the skin side, which also includes a flexible membrane <b>350</b>. The flexible membrane is adhered to the skin as before with an adhesive layer, as part of the catheter insertion process described before, to secure the catheter in its position. Chamber <b>354</b> may be connected with additional tube <b>353</b> to the drug delivery pump <b>352</b>. The tissue massaging is established by pumping air in and out of chamber <b>354</b> through tube <b>353</b> via an additional pump in the drug delivery pump unit, according to a treatment or massaging protocol. In this case, the control of the treatment protocol is accomplished by the drug delivery pump unit and the disposable unit can be relatively simple and low cost. When the air is pumped out of chamber <b>354</b>, flexible membrane <b>350</b> curves into the chamber pulling the tissue adhered to it. When the air is pumped into the chamber, the flexible membrane curves out and pushes the tissue. This process is done periodically according to a typical frequency of about 0.01-10 Hz. Other frequencies are possible as well. In some embodiments, the chamber is filled with an incompressible fluid, such as water, and appropriate pump cause the fluid to flow in and out.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In an alternate embodiment, the flexible membrane can include a rigid surface which includes a plurality of openings and a flexible membrane covering the openings to improve adhesion to the skin, and to spatially modulate the skin massage. In yet another alternate embodiment, the flexible membrane outer surface can have small features (bumps) extending out of the surface to improve massaging effect to the tissue. In some embodiments, tube <b>353</b> can be connected to a third unit that controls and applies the massage treatment as described before.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Another embodiment of a treatment device is a suction device that provides suction of the tissue around the infusion catheter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Suction of a tissue region is known to improve blood perfusion in that tissue region. The treatment device (which is disposable) includes a catheter tip <b>401</b> for insertion into the tissue (as before), located in the middle of a chamber <b>404</b> with rigid wall all around except of the skin side, where an opening is included. The chamber walls are adhered to the skin with a circular adhesive layer <b>400</b> that seals the chamber rim to the skin. The adhesive layer is attached to the skin during the catheter-insertion process to secure the catheter in its position. Chamber <b>404</b> is connected with an additional tube <b>403</b> to the drug delivery pump <b>402</b>. The skin suction is accomplished by pumping the air out of chamber <b>404</b> through tube <b>403</b> via an additional pump provided in the drug delivery pump unit. In this case, the control of the treatment protocol is accomplished by the drug delivery pump unit and the disposable unit can be made simple and low cost. The suction is done according to a predetermined treatment protocol, for example&#x2014;a suction of 1 minute in duration can be applied after an insulin bolus injection to improve insulin absorption into the blood system. Another example is applying vacuum in chamber <b>404</b> for 30 seconds and then releasing the vacuum for additional 30 seconds. This process can be repeated several times in order to increase blood perfusion in the tissue region underneath the treatment device. In some embodiments, the chamber opening to the tissue can be made of a rigid surface with few openings to increase adhesion area to the skin and to spatially modulate the skin suction. In some embodiments, tube <b>403</b> can be connected to a third unit that controls and applies the suction treatment as described before.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In some embodiments, in order to modify the delivered-drug's pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile, a small modulation of the infusion process through the infusion catheter is induced. In other words, the infusion fluid is slightly pulled in and out of the tissue during or after the drug infusion process. This action induces an increased flow of interstitial fluid (&#x201c;ISF&#x201d;) around the catheter tip because of the variable induced pressure fields. The increased ISF flow increases the drug diffusion distance and reduces the time constant of the drug absorption into the blood system. The flow modulation can be done by the drug delivery pump by reversing the pump direction for short periods and small amount of pumped fluids. Also, the drug delivery pump can keep moving the infusion fluid in the catheter slightly in and out after the end of drug bolus infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-16</figref> illustrate two exemplary embodiments of methods to implement the above tissue treatment as an additive component to existing drug delivery pumps, without reversing the drug delivery pump direction. These embodiments include modulating the flow of the infusion fluid in the infusion catheter tube by two different modalities. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a wheel <b>503</b> is provided having its rotating axis off the wheel center. Thus, when the axis is rotating, one side of the wheel applies pressure to the proximal side of catheter tube <b>501</b> and pushes the infusion fluid forward. The other side of the wheel <b>503</b> releases the catheter tube <b>501</b> and retracts the infusion fluid a slightly backwards. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the fluid modulation is done by a piston <b>553</b> connected to the catheter tube <b>551</b> and moves up and down to induce in and out flow to the infusion fluid in the catheter tube <b>551</b>. In some embodiments, a proper air removal procedure and means should be used when the catheter is connected to the drug delivery pump <b>552</b> and before insertion ( ). In both embodiments, the modulation mechanism can be attached to the drug delivery pump, provided therein, in the disposable part or in a third unit connected to the infusion tube.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In some embodiments, the tissue treatment device can include an acoustic excitation element to stimulate the vicinity of the tissue region into which the drug is delivered, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In these embodiments, the infusion catheter is combined with the acoustic excitation element <b>2</b> attached to the skin around the catheter. The treatment device may include a flat circular structure <b>5</b> with a center opening for the catheter tube <b>3</b> that enters the subcutaneous tissue. The other side of the catheter may be connected to the drug delivery pump. The acoustic excitation element can be made of piezoelectric materials such as PZT or PVDF. The acoustic excitation can include low or high acoustical frequencies or higher frequencies in the ultrasonic region.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The acoustic excitation device is attached to the tissue with an adhesive layer. The adhesive layer can be either on the outer ring area <b>1</b> or cover also the acoustic excitation element with an acoustic conducting adhesive, such as adhesive hydrogels. The acoustic excitation element can also be covered with an acoustic conducting layer such as acoustic hydrogel or liquid. The adhesive layer may be provided covered with a laminate (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) that can be peeled off by the user before insertion of the catheter and attachment of the acoustic excitation device. Usually, for the catheter insertion, the device is supplied with a sterile needle inside the catheter (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) that is pulled out after insertion of the catheter. The acoustic excitation element can be either connected to the drug delivery pump using cable <b>4</b> or to a third unit or to an electronics disposed as part of the acoustic excitation treatment device, as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In some embodiments, the tissue treatment device can use optical radiation to stimulate the tissue region, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In these embodiments, the infusion catheter is combined with an optical radiation element <b>301</b> attached to the skin around the catheter. The treatment device may be a flat circular structure <b>302</b> with a central opening for the catheter tube <b>303</b> that enters the subcutaneous tissue. The other end of the catheter <b>303</b> is connected to the drug delivery pump. The optical radiation element can be made of known in the art light sources, such as LEDs, laser diodes, lamps, etc. The optical radiation can be in the visible or NIR or MIR regions. The light source may emit pulsed light or CW light and the pulsed light source may further emit pulses that are appropriate to generate photoacoustic or thermoacoustic signals on the catheter and/or in the tissue region close to the catheter. The optical radiation device is attached to the tissue with adhesive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The adhesive layer can be provided on the outer ring area <b>301</b> or cover the optical radiation element with an optically transparent in the relevant optical wavelengths adhesive. The adhesive layer is covered with a laminate (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) that is peeled off by the user before insertion of the catheter and attachment of the optical radiation device. Usually, for catheter insertion, the device is supplied with a sterile needle inside the catheter (not shown in the figure) that is pulled out after insertion of the catheter. In some embodiments, the light source can be disposed in the drug delivery device and delivered with an optical fiber or several fibers to the optical radiation treatment device. The optical radiation source can be either connected to the drug delivery pump using a cable, connected to a third unit or to an electronics disposed as part of the optical radiation treatment device, as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In an alternate embodiment, optical radiation tissue excitation device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, coats the catheter tip with an optical absorption coating <b>801</b> that absorbs the wavelength or some of the wavelengths of the optical radiation. The treatment device can be similar to the optical radiation treatment device described before. In this embodiment, the treatment device can be a flat circular structure <b>800</b> with a central opening for catheter tube <b>801</b> to enter the subcutaneous tissue. The other end of the catheter <b>802</b> is connected to the drug delivery pump. The treatment device may also includes optical irradiation elements schematically shown by <b>803</b> and <b>804</b>. The optical irradiation elements can be made of known in the art light sources, such as LEDs, laser diodes, lamps, etc. The light source may emit pulsed light or CW light and the pulsed light source may further emit pulses that are appropriate to generate photoacoustic or thermoacoustic signals on the catheter tip <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The optical irradiation wavelength can be either in the visible region or in the NIR. In some embodiments, using wavelengths range of 700-1000 nm provides relatively low absorption of the optical radiation in the tissue. Consequently, a larger portion of the illuminated radiation can be scattered in the tissue and absorbed in the catheter tip. The tip-absorbed optical radiation can induce a local hit around the catheter tip and efficiently heats the infused tissue region, as discussed above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Using shorter wavelengths in the visible region, but also in the 700-1000 nm region, can increase the portion of the radiation absorbed by the hemoglobin and consequently can heat more blood or hemoglobin reach regions in the irradiated tissue region. Using longer wavelengths in the NIR, MIR or FIR regions can increase the portion of the radiation absorbed by the water in the tissue and consequently can heat more of the water to reach regions in the irradiated tissue region. Also, in case of using light pulses to create photoacoustic excitation, the portion of excitation induced at the catheter tip, hemoglobin regions or water regions, such excitation can be according to the absorbed radiation distribution and the photoacoustic coefficient of each region. The produced photoacoustic signal can be measured using an acoustic sensor disposed skin attachment structure <b>800</b> and can be used for monitoring the energy absorbed in each of those regions or catheter tip <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, some of the wavelengths of the above mentioned regions can be used for better control of the heated or stimulated region of interest. In some embodiments, at least one of the wavelengths is absorbed by a catheter tip coating and at least one wavelength is not absorbed by the coating to better control of the heated or stimulated region. The algorithm to control tissue excitation can obtain information from tissue temperature sensors (disclosed above), acoustic sensor, optical sensor, the drug delivery profile and additional drug or tissue parameters. The algorithm can control wavelengths to regulate the drug absorption into the blood system.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In some embodiments, a device similar to the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 18</figref> can irradiate the drug infused tissue region, externally or internally, respectively, with radio frequency (RF) radiation or microwave (MW) radiation. Another embodiment can apply an electric field to the drug infused tissue region using, for instance, 2 electrodes similar to items <b>301</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, to apply the field to the skin or using electrodes disposed on the external side of the catheter tip inserted into the tissue. Also, the same device can be used to apply high or low frequency fields and even DC field. To improve the electrical contact the adhesive layer can be a conducting hydrogel or other known in the art materials to attach electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In some embodiments, an additional substance can be infused into the vicinity of the drug infused region, such that the additional substance modifies the drug pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile with or without the creation of a chemical or other reaction between the two substances. Specifically, the additional drug may influence either or both of the drug infused tissue region or improving the drug's pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics profiles. This effect is not necessarily due to a chemical reaction between the drug and the additional substance. In some embodiments, the additional substance improves local blood's perfusion in the vicinity of the drug infused region and accordingly, reduces the absorption time constant of the drug into the blood system. This effect may be additive or synergistic to the above described forms of stimulation. For instance, nitroprusside, which induces vasodilatation, can improve blood's perfusion in the drug infused tissue and improve the drug absorption into the blood system.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The additional substance can be infused into the drug infused region either through the same catheter or through an additional catheter, which can be attached or separated from the drug infusing catheter. In some embodiments, the catheter can be a double-lumen catheter with 2 openings inside the same tissue region or at two separate tissue regions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Openings <b>866</b> and <b>862</b> of the two lumens <b>865</b> and <b>864</b>, respectively, can be at different depths in the tissue. In the illustrated embodiment, the double lumen catheter is secured to the skin with a circular element <b>863</b> and an adhesive layer <b>860</b>. In some embodiments, the catheter can include an additional treatment element, as discussed above, such that the combination of the additional substance and the treatment provides the desired tissue stimulation or treatment. In an embodiment of a single-lumen catheter, the additional substance can be either mixed with the drug and delivered, pumped, infused, or injected together into the catheter tube. Alternatively, the additional drug can come from a different container with a separate pump or drug delivery device and mixed in the catheter tube according to the flow rates of the drug and the additional substance using an infusion algorithm of the two substances. In some embodiments, the two containers can be either disposed in the same housing, attached to each other or separated. Similarly, in case of double lumen tube, one lumen may be connected to the drug delivery device and the second lumen may be connected to the additional substance delivery device. In some embodiments, a combination of the above treatment methods and/or devices can be placed into a single device to improve its operation and efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In some embodiments, the catheter can be drawn at a 90&#xb0; penetration angle. As can be understood, other angles are possible. Smaller angles can improve attachment of the catheter, but insertion at such angles may be more irritating to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In some embodiments, a sensor can be added to the treatment device configuration. Alternatively, it can be added to general infusion sets, such as insulin infusion sets, and can be used to aid in detecting if the catheter securing element is lifted or starting to peel off the skin. The sensor can be provided in the catheter securing element so that it is in direct contact with the skin, indirect contact through the adhesive layer or other layers attached to the skin. The sensor can measure pressure or skin conductivity, impedance, and/or back-reflected optical or acoustic signal from the skin. A change of the contact level between the sensor and the skin will induce an electronic signal to either the treatment device or drug delivery device. Then, the device can either inform the user to fix the attachment of the securing element to the skin or to reinsert the catheter into the tissue in case it is detached or to pause or stop the drug delivery or the treatment till the catheter positioning is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some embodiments, the treatment device can be secured to the patient using a strap or a belt that holds the treatment device into its position. The strap can be placed around any part of the patient's body, depending on the location of the drug infused region and the patient's comfort. Using such a strap can reduce the chances of the catheter to be pulled out in more demanding situations, such as jogging. For example, the strap can be placed around the abdomen, leg, thigh, arm etc. In some embodiments, the strap can have a compartment, a pocket or an adaptor for holding the drug delivery device. In embodiments using a third unit that supports the treatment device, the third unit can be attached to the strap or even be embedded into the strap. The third unit can be embedded into the strap or belt, and may be connected to the catheter disposable unit by electrical wires using a connector at the wire end. In some embodiments, the drug delivery pump can be attached to the strap and connected to the catheter disposable unit with a tube for drug delivery. In some embodiments, the disposable unit can be attached to the strap to further reduce chances of the catheter being pulled in more demanding situations.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The power source can be a thin battery, such as the batteries manufactured by Power Paper Ltd. The electronics can be implemented on a flexible printed circuit known in the art to provide the required flexibility for the patient's comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">As can be understood by one skilled in the art, the above methods and devices for exciting the tissue are not limited to drug-delivery pumps and can be used with manual delivery of a drug, such as connecting a syringe (instead of a pump) to the proximal part of the catheter. In these embodiments, the catheter proximal part can end in a connector or a port that fits the syringe tip. Accordingly, the distal part of the catheter is inserted into the tissue as before. In some embodiments, the proximal part of the catheter tube is short, such as it is embedded into the treatment device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. In this case, treatment hardware, which includes treatment element <b>602</b>, processor <b>606</b>, power source and the abovementioned elements for tissue treatment or excitation, are disposed in the disposable catheter unit <b>603</b>, which includes the adhesive layer <b>600</b> for skin attachment and the catheter distal tip <b>601</b>. The syringe device can be either a regular syringe, an automatic syringe or other automated subcutaneous drug delivery devices that can provide a known volume of drug and can be connected to the catheter port for the drug delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In some embodiments, the catheter unit with syringe port can be divided into disposable part and reusable part. In some embodiments, the syringe port comes with a plug <b>607</b> that covers the syringe port when not in use. In this case, there is no drug delivery unit in the system, the treatment device can detect infusion of the drug and start the treatment accordingly. The drug infusion can be detected using the above mentioned methods, such as flow detection, pressure detection, conductivity detection or temperature detection. In some embodiments, a mechanical pressure sensor <b>604</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, can detect the insertion of the syringe into the port automatically, manually via a switch on the treatment device or wirelessly by a remote control. The injection detection sensor can be also an optical or RF vicinity sensor that detects a unique RF transmission from the syringe unit or a unique optical pattern or signal. The injection sensor can also get some information from the injection device by either RF communication or optical reader such as barcode reader. The information can include the drug type and dose. In some embodiments, the treatment device includes a processing unit <b>606</b> that can get that information and fit the treatment algorithm accordingly, as described before. The same treatment device with syringe port can be used for several injections according to each treatment profile and duration, battery capacity and other parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In some embodiments, tissue or skin treatments or stimulation methods can be used to treat or excite a tissue region to which a drug is injected. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the excitation device <b>652</b> is attached to the skin and has a circular opening for direct drug delivery with a syringe and a needle. This option can fit injection devices without a needle, such as jet injectors or tissue perforation technologies or alternatively micro-needles injection devices. Also, the injection syringe can have many forms for drug injection in addition to the standard syringe, such as automatic syringes etc. An advantage of the device is that it is attached to the tissue prior to the drug injection. The device stimulates the injected tissue region after the drug delivery process in order to improve the drug absorption into the blood system. The excitation profile and duration is accomplished according to an algorithm that fits the drug and possibly the patient, as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The detection of the injection can be done automatically by injection sensor <b>653</b>, manually via a switch on the treatment device, or wirelessly by a remote control.

<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The following example demonstrates a device that improves the functionality of existing pump-based insulin-delivery systems. Such system, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, includes an insulin pump <b>40</b> and an infusion-set <b>44</b> which delivers the pumped insulin into the tissue. The infusion set includes a tube <b>44</b> and a catheter <b>47</b>, which is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue. The device has two components: i) a flat heater <b>46</b>, which is attached to skin around the insertion point of the catheter, and ii) a controller unit <b>41</b>, which is disposed into the casing of the insulin pump unit. The controller unit has a switch/button <b>48</b> for manual operation and two indicators <b>49</b> for &#x201c;treatment is on&#x201d; and for battery status. The two components are connected by wires <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The controller monitors the activity of the insulin pump using an electronic sensing element and it also controls the activity of the heating element. The controller monitors the electromagnetic emission from the pump. During a bolus mode, the pump emits a well defined series of electromagnetic pulses at constant rate, shown as arrows <b>42</b>. For example during a bolus dose, the paradigm <b>722</b> insulin pump from Minimed emits specific pattern of electromagnetic pulses for each 0.1 unit of injected insulin at a rate of 0.1 unit per second. Counting those electromagnetic pulses enables one to determine the amount of injected insulin in the bolus initiate the operation of the heating element and adjust its parameters, such as the duration and heating temperature, accordingly. The temperature of the heater is controlled by the controller using a temperature sensor <b>45</b> located on the heating element. In this example the temperature of the heating element did not exceed 39&#xb0; C. to avoid damage to the infused insulin.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In some embodiments, the heating device can be operated manually. In this case, the controller controls the activity of the treatment element. Once a user injects a bolus of insulin using the insulin pump, the user also activates a switch/button <b>48</b> located on the controller to initiate the heating-element operation for a predetermined duration. The temperature of the heater is controlled by the controller using a temperature sensor located within the treatment element (heating element). In this example the temperature of the heating element does not exceed 39&#xb0; C. to avoid damage to the infused insulin.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The flat heating element used in this example has several layers. The upper layer is a polyethylene layer which seals the element. Below that layer, there is an etched circuit, below which there is a copper layer for heat distribution and mechanical support. Below that layer, there is another sealing polyethylene layer, below which there is an adhesive tape from 3M&#xae; which is bio-compatible. The heater has a thickness of less than 0.2 mm and his diameter is 3 cm. Thin electric wires of length of 60 cm with small connectors at both ends connected the heater to the controller unit. The power used for the heating can be 2 Watts. The heating was turned on and off by the controller to stabilize the skin temperature at 39&#xb0; C. The heat duration was set to 30 minutes, after which the temperature regulation was stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In general, the attachment and operation of the insulin delivery system with the heater is very similar to the operation of the insulin delivery system without the heater. The described device includes a case into which the insulin pump is inserted. The case contains also an electronic circuit and batteries to operate the controller and heater. Accordingly, the patient first connects the infusion set tube to the insulin pump. Then, the patient connects the electric wires connector to the electric connector on the heater. The patient then attaches the heater to the center of the catheter securing element using the adhesive tape of the catheter securing element. The insulin catheter is then inserted to the subcutaneous tissue either manually or using the catheter spring inserter. The mechanism of the catheter insertion is the same as usual using the same insertion module and following the same steps. The heater can be attached to the catheter securing element before insertion. The patient can connect the infusion set tube to the catheter. The patient connects the wires coming from the heater to a designated connector on the controller. The operation of the bolus is either automatic or manual as described before.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Another heater structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. In this case, the heater <b>34</b> is U shaped and attached to the skin around the insulin infusion set <b>30</b>. The advantages of this configuration are that the heater can be an independent unit that fits many of the commercial infusion sets and also the thermal insulation between the insulin and the heater is kept. The U shaped heater can be thin or thicker and be built in many ways known in the art. The U shaped heater shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is made of heat conducting metal and has a resistor <b>31</b> for heating and a temperature sensor <b>32</b> for controlling the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Another heater structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. In this case, the heater <b>37</b> is circular and attached to the insulin infusion set around the catheter prior to insertion into the body, as described above. The shape of the cuts <b>39</b> enable attachment of the heater to the infusion set prior to removing the catheter cover, although the catheter cover diameter may be larger then the central opening. It is important to remove the catheter cover or cup as the last operation before insertion of the catheter to the tissue because of safety and sterility issues. However, having the cuts <b>39</b> of the heater enable using a heater with an optimized central opening diameter without the limitations of the catheter cover. This is important in order to optimally heat the drug infused tissue vicinity on one hand and keep the thermal insulation between the insulin in the catheter and the heater on the other hand.

The thickness of this heater may be about 0.2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">To demonstrate the improvement of the insulin pharmacodynamics of the device described in this example, a euglycemic glucose clamp study was performed, using the following protocol. An insulin dependent diabetic volunteer treated with an insulin pump arrived after an overnight fast prior to taking a morning bolus with the pump. The subject lied down in supine position. The subject's blood glucose level was stabilized at 100 mg/dl. A bolus of insulin was given using the subject's insulin pump (0.15 U/kg). The pump was halted from the end of the bolus administration. A 20% dextrose drip was adjusted to keep the blood glucose level at about 100 mg/dl. Frequent blood sampling (every 5-10 min) was used for adjusting Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) as required for tight control of the euglycemic glucose level.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The above described procedure was performed in the same subjects under the same conditions with and without using the heating device. A typical result is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref><i>a</i>. The two graphs show the GIR in glucose milligrams per minutes per subject's kg vs. time. The solid line shows the GIR without the heating treatment, while the dashed line shows the GIR on the same subject with heating. It can seen that the time to peak action was significantly shorten from 75 min without heating <b>21</b> to 50 min with heating <b>20</b>. Also the GIR decrease, which is an indication for insulin clearance out of the circulation and cessation of it's systemic effects was much faster with heating <b>22</b> then without heating <b>23</b>. Both of those parameters are important for better control of the glucose level since the delay of the peak action may cause glucose rise immediately following meals and the residual insulin level in the tissue and in the blood may induces late hypoglycemia and promote an error in the estimation of the effect of the next insulin bolus. Those two parameters (the delay to insulin peak action and the residual insulin level), which are important for tight glucose level regulation are very important also when automatically controlling the subcutaneous insulin infusion rate using a continuous glucose sensor and a control algorithm. There are many attempts to compose such an &#x201c;artificial pancreas&#x201d; since the development of continuous glucose monitors. In this case, any delay such as the current delays of the insulin absorption and action time, any variability in this delay and any variability in the residual insulin level in the body induces an error for the control algorithm that will result in less tight glucose regulation. Thus, another use of the methods and devices by the present invention is to combine them with a glucose sensor, insulin delivery device and a control algorithm to provide a better accuracy and robustness of a closed loop glucose level control system.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The same protocol and meal tolerance test protocol, in which diabetic patients had liquid meal and used the same dose of insulin bolus (0.15 U/kg) using their insulin pump, again with and without heating the infused region using the same device. The insulin blood concentration was measured on blood samples using insulin immunoassay kit of DRG. The pharmacokinetics results or the profile insulin concentration in the blood after bolus infusion from both experiments is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref><i>b</i>. The graphs are the average of 11 subjects that had bolus of insulin 0.15 U/kg with and without the heating device. The graph shows clearly that the blood insulin concentration for the same amount of infused insulin is significantly higher at the initial 2 hours when using said heating device. The 1 hour area under the curve improvement or the amount of absorbed insulin in the blood is more then 30%. This improvement in the insulin pharmacokinetics leads to improvement in the insulin pharmacodynamics, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref><i>a</i>, reducing the time to onset of action, reducing the time to peak action and the other effects described before.</p>

<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Some embodiments of the present invention relate to apparatuses, methods and devices to improve and stabilize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug infused into the tissue by a catheter and absorbed into the blood system. The apparatus and devices described herein apply additional treatment or stimulation to the region of tissue where the drug is infused. The additional treatment includes electromagnetic radiation, which as described herein more includes light irradiation of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">According to some embodiments, there is provided a device for improving the performance of catheter based drug delivery devices, whether the catheter is an external element to the pump or an element embedded into a pump mechanism, which also combines electromagnetic radiation treatment, for example, from a source of electromagnetic radiation. Application of the electromagnetic radiation treatment may be performed, in some embodiments, substantially at the same time as the drug infusion operations are performed. The device described herein can also be part of the catheter which has one section inside the tissue and another section that connects to a unit outside the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">The electromagnetic radiation treatment is applied to a tissue region to which the drug is delivered to expose it to electromagnetic radiation and/or to an effect caused by electromagnetic radiation to improve the drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. The effect may include, but is not limited to, heating, acoustical stimulation, light based stimulation and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The present disclosure radiation treatment of a region of a tissue by any type of electromagnetic radiation in conjunction with the infusion of the drug into a body of a patient, including optical radiation, to cause different type of treatment effects (or stimulation).</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">For example, the described herein is the use of optical radiation to treat the skin so as to achieve improvement of pharmacokinetics and/or some other pharmaceutically related parameter for the administration of a drug through a pump system, for example through infusion. Treatment of tissues with optical radiation according to the present disclosure may be performed with light at a variety of wavelengths from infrared to low ultraviolet or shorter than ultraviolet wavelengths. Furthermore, a variety of instruments may be used for providing such light, including, but not limited to, lasers, such as laser diodes, including single elements or laser diode bars or arrays, VECSELs, or solid state lasers, fiber lasers, other types of lasers, LEDs, mercury arc lamps, xenon arc lamps, other types of lamps and the like. The light source may emit pulsed light or continuous wave light, or a combination thereof. If pulsed light is emitted, then, in some embodiments, one or more characteristics of the pulses are determined according to one or more pharmaceutical requirements of the drug being administered.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The instruments may emit a broad spectrum light and/or a narrow spectrum light. If the instruments emit a broader spectrum light than is required, one or more filters may be employed to reduce the spectrum of light treating the tissue. Radiation devices used to irradiate the tissue may also include mirrors, lenses, fiber optics and other like components to focus the light in a specific region or regions.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">In circumstances where the radiation unit generates light to be applied to the tissue, the light may include wavelengths in the range of from about 300 to about 3,000 nm. The light may be a broad spectrum light, including a majority of such wavelengths. In some embodiments, generated light includes radiation in the near infrared wavelengths and/or shorter wavelengths of light and/or longer wavelengths of light. For example, for near infrared light, the wavelengths include the wavelength range from about 700 to about 1000 nm. For light having longer wavelengths, the wavelengths are at the infrared region. Higher frequency electromagnetic radiation, such as electromagnetic waves in the Tera Hertz range (corresponding to waves in the millimeter range, microwaves or RF (radio frequency) are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">In some embodiments, low frequency RF energy is applied at a level (e.g., power level) which is non-ablative. For example, radiofrequency energy in the range of 50 to 2,000 kHz may be selected so as to be non-ablative for the subject. RF energy may be applied as a plurality of pulses. In some embodiments, a single or multiple electrodes may be used. The electrodes may contact the skin and may, in some implementations penetrate the skin. In some embodiments, a catheter is used for drug delivery with at least one electrode being incorporated in the catheter. Each electrode may be constructed from one or more conductive metals, including, but not limited to, platinum, iridium, gold, silver, stainless steel, Nitinol, or an alloy of these metals.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In some embodiments, the device includes a catheter inserted into the tissue to infuse a substance into that tissue region. The tissue region can be one of the skin layers or the subcutaneous tissue or deeper tissue elements within any organ or viscera.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The catheter may have also a securing mechanical part or device that adheres to the skin and secures the catheter into its location to prevent it from being pulled out accidentally. The proximal end of the catheter may be connected to a drug delivery device which controls the infusion profile of the drug. The drug delivery device controls also the additional treatment (e.g., irradiation) applied to the infused tissue area. The drug delivery device and the treatment module (e.g., the radiation unit) may be in communication with other to communicate data based upon which operations of the drug delivery device and the radiation unit may be performed. The communication may be either wired or wireless. Parts of the treatment device may be disposed inside the drug delivery device or outside of it. The drug delivery device may include a drug delivery pump, such as an insulin pump.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The pump may include an electronic processing unit to determine, according, for example, to a predetermined protocol, implemented procedure, any additional inputs and drug infusion profile when and to what extent electromagnetic radiation should be applied. The pump electronic processing unit may, in some embodiments, communicate with a processing unit of the treatment module. The processing unit of the treatment module determines according to a predetermined protocol, a procedure, and according to drug infusion profile when and to which extent the electromagnetic radiation should be applied. The pump electronic processing unit and/or the treatment device processing unit regularly query the status of the pump by, for example, using built-in communication capability of the pump. The received data is then used to determine the electromagnetic radiation treatment parameter(s).</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Sensors in communication with the source of electromagnetic radiation may detect the drug being delivered into the patient's body through the catheter. In response to the detected drug delivery, the treatment module applies a treatment (e.g., radiation) according to a predetermined protocol or procedure. In some embodiments, the treatment module includes a sensor that can detect the drug infusion flow inside the catheter and deliver the information to the device processing unit, which then determines the electromagnetic radiation treatment parameter(s). The drug flow may be detected, for example, optical sensors that detect the drug flow through the catheter (e.g., in circumstances in which a transparent or translucent catheter is used), a laser Doppler sensor, an ultrasonic Doppler sensor, a pressure sensor, a conductivity sensor and/or an inductance sensor that can measure changes in the flow rate of the infusion fluid, under induced magnetic field (for example). The drug flow sensor may detect not only the existence of a drug infusion flow, but also the infusion rate, and uses the information to determine, at least in part, the treatment procedure. The drug infusion sensor may detect the electromagnetic or acoustic emission of the drug delivery pump motor or electronics. In some embodiments, the devices detect additional parameters pertaining to the tissue and use that information as well to determine or control the treatment procedure (e.g., compute parameters germane to the treatment procedure).</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the light source can be disposed in a third unit (not shown) and the generated light can be delivered with an optical fiber, or several fibers, to the optical radiation element <b>301</b>. The third unit can be attached externally to the drug delivery device to improve the user's comfort. Under these circumstances, the fiber or fibers can be disposed proximate to the catheter tube <b>303</b>, for example, the optical fiber(s) can be attached to the outer shell defining the catheter tube <b>303</b> and extend along the tube. The optical fiber(s) and the tube <b>303</b> could then be separated at around the drug delivery device such that the drug catheter tube <b>303</b> would be extended and be coupled to the drug delivery device (not shown), and the fiber or fibers would be connected to a third unit that includes at least one light source. The third unit may also include a power source and a controller (not shown). When drug delivery starts, e.g., during a drug bolus delivery, the occurrence of the drug delivery operation can be communicated to the third unit, either actively by direct communication between the drug delivery device and the third unit, or passively through a signals generated by a sensor detecting the occurrence and/or commencement of the drug delivery operation e.g., electromagnetic emission by the drug delivery device.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The optical radiation element <b>301</b> can be disposed in a catheter securing unit such as shell (not shown) encasing the catheter tube <b>303</b>. One effect caused by the electromagnetic radiation is heating of the radiated tissue region. The application of electromagnetic radiation may be used to control the temperature of the tissue region into which the drug is delivered. Temperature control can be used for setting a profile of temperature rise at a known rate, followed by temperature stabilization for a pre-determined time period and concluding by returning to the tissue to its regular temperature. This profile can be applied by, for example, illuminating the drug infused tissue region with electromagnetic radiation. The temperature profile can be applied to a larger region than the drug infused tissue region to circumvent light scattering in the tissue. Doing so may improve blood perfusion in the vicinity of the drug infused tissue area, thus further increasing drug absorption rate into the blood system through increase of the available absorption volume. The temperature profile can be applied to a region smaller than the drug infused tissue region, thus enabling conservation of energy (e.g., in circumstances in which a battery with a limited energy capacity is used).</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Another exemplary device to perform irradiation of radiation at the area of a tissue into which the drug is delivered is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. As shown, a treatment device <b>2710</b> includes an infusion catheter <b>2703</b> and at least one radiation source element <b>2702</b> attached to the skin (not shown) in an area around the catheter <b>2703</b>. The treatment device <b>2710</b> further includes a circular structure <b>2705</b> with a hole <b>2711</b> in its center for the catheter tube <b>2703</b> that is subcutaneously inserted into the skin tissue. The other side of the catheter <b>2703</b> is connected to the drug delivery pump (not shown). Radiation source element <b>2702</b> may include one or more light sources <b>2712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">As further shown, a temperature sensor <b>2706</b> is disposed in contact with illuminated skin region to regulate the skin temperature to the required temperature according to a temperature control procedure or temperature profile. Regulation of the tissue temperature may be based on measured temperature values detected at a sensor <b>2706</b>. The temperature sensor <b>6</b> is connected to a controller unit <b>2713</b> disposed in the catheter <b>2703</b> or in the drug delivery device (not shown) and/or in an third unit (not shown). In some embodiments, the temperature is between 32-40&#xb0; C. This temperature range has been found to have sufficient effect on the tissue while not causing damage or injury to the tissue. Temperature stabilization profiles/procedures may be executed using controllers and/or ASICs. A skin cooling system may be used, as described, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,344,418, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The skin or tissue damage depends on the applied temperature and the heat exposure time. For an exposure period that is relatively short e.g., a few minutes, even higher temperatures, for example, temperatures of up to of 42&#xb0; C. may be used. Under some circumstances, lower temperatures may be required. For example, Novolog Insulin requires maximal temperature of 37&#xb0; C. in the insulin infused tissue region. However, under those circumstances, the skin temperature can be slightly higher than that, as the insulin infused tissue region could have a lower controlled temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">An additionally and/or alternatively, a temperature sensor (not shown) is located inside the catheter tube <b>2703</b>. This temperature sensor enables more direct control of the temperature of the drug infused tissue region, in turn enabling potentially better stabilization of the drug chemical processes or pharmacokinetics or absorption into the blood system or pharmacodynamics that can be achieved. In situations in which the drug delivered is insulin, it is important to reduce the variability of the temporal profile of the insulin absorption into the blood and to more closely regulate temperature control.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The at least one radiation source element <b>2702</b> and one or two of temperature sensors may be connected to the drug delivery pump through a cable <b>2704</b>. Under these circumstances, the drug delivery pump includes the power source and the controller of the treatment process (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">A circular structure <b>2705</b> that covers at least one radiation source element <b>2702</b> may be thermally isolating such that the flat circular structure <b>2705</b> reduces the heat dissipation to the environment in Use of the circular covering structure <b>2705</b> also facilitates the thermal regulation (e.g., stabilization) of the infused tissue area in situations in which the environments and/or ambient temperature undergo changes.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The at least one radiation source element <b>2702</b> generates radiation to treat the drug infused tissue area as described herein. In some embodiments, the tissue from any heat produced in the course of generating the actual radiation applied to the tissue. For example, if the radiation includes light, then the transformation of electrical energy into light energy, whether by radiation source resistance or non-radiative transitions. Under these circumstances, the combination of generated heating and radiation is applied to the tissue to better and/or more efficiently produce the desired effect.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">In some embodiments, the device <b>2710</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is attached to the skin with an adhesive tape <b>2715</b>. The adhesive layer <b>2701</b> of the tape <b>2715</b> can also cover the at least one radiation source element <b>2702</b>, for example, with a transparent adhesive. The adhesive tape <b>2715</b> is initially covered with a laminate (not shown) that is peeled off by the user before insertion of the catheter <b>2703</b> and the radiation source element <b>2702</b>. Generally, to facilitate catheter insertion the device is supplied with a sterile needle disposed inside the catheter <b>2703</b> (not shown) that is removed after insertion of the catheter <b>2703</b> into the required tissue area. The adhesive layer of tape <b>2715</b> may partially absorb the electromagnetic radiation to increase the outer layer of the skin heating, which may be required for certain heating depth distribution for optimization of heating profile and/or the heating efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, another exemplary treatment device is shown. The treatment device includes a catheter tube <b>2803</b> configured to direct electromagnetic radiation through the tube and to illuminate radiation emitted at the tube end <b>2801</b> at the drug infused tissue region (not shown) As shown, the light from the at least one radiation source <b>2806</b> is coupled into tube <b>2803</b> near the drug delivery device <b>2804</b> through a light coupler <b>2807</b>. The radiation source may be part of the drug delivery device <b>2804</b>. Alternatively, a radiation source <b>2806</b> can be housed in a separate third unit as shown, that is attached to the drug delivery device <b>2804</b>. To facilitate light coupling into the tube <b>2803</b>, the radiation source <b>2806</b> may be attached to the tube <b>2803</b> at the light coupler <b>2805</b>, and be otherwise disposed so as to be substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis of the tube, while the drug flowing from drug delivery device <b>2804</b> is enters the tube <b>2803</b> from the side. Generated light is thus directed through the length of tube <b>2803</b> until it decoupled at the tube end <b>2801</b> located proximate to the drug infused region. The decoupled radiation is subsequently absorbed by the tissue region. The generated light is directed through any bend in the tube <b>2803</b></p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The catheter tip <b>2801</b> may be secured to the skin using catheter securing device <b>2802</b> with an adhesive layer <b>2800</b>. In some embodiments, the securing device <b>2802</b> also includes at least one temperature sensor on the skin, the catheter, or at the drug infused tissue region to facilitate temperature regulation of the tissue. The temperature of the drug infused tissue region may be monitored non-invasively through the catheter, for example, by measuring the tissue IR emittance or by implementing other procedures for optical non-invasive temperature monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, an exemplary device to couple and direct light through a tube that also carries a drug is shown. In some embodiments, the light is guided inside the drug delivery tube <b>2919</b> by the tube walls <b>2916</b>. The material of tube walls <b>2916</b> is selected based on the type of light being guided and to provide acceptable light compensation performance for any light scattering that occurs.

Generated light rays <b>2914</b>, shown schematically by the bouncing line pattern is directed and/or controlled using optical device (e.g., lenses, couplers, etc.) or the waveguide <b>2913</b> to provide appropriate coupling efficiency into drug tube <b>2919</b>. The difference between the refraction index of the drug <b>2918</b> and the tube wall <b>2916</b> enable the light rays <b>2914</b> to propagate through the tube To achieve efficient guidance of the light, the core material in the waveguide (which in these circumstance will include the drug material <b>2918</b>) is required to have a higher index of refraction than the walls <b>2916</b> (the walls of the waveguide are referred to as the &#x201c;cladding&#x201d;). For example, in some embodiments, a drug is administered which, when diluted in water, has an optical index of refraction of approximately 1.33. If, under these circumstances, the tube wall <b>2916</b> is made from a polymer having an index of refraction of approximately 1.4-1.5, then light guidance will not be efficient (because the waveguide's wall have an index of refraction higher than that of the medium constituting the core). However, the efficiency of light guidance can be significantly improved by choosing polymers having a lower index of refraction for the tube wall <b>2916</b> and/or coating the inner side of the tube <b>2915</b> (i.e., the surfaces of the tube wall <b>2916</b>) with a thin layer of light reflecting coating <b>2920</b> that includes, for example, one or more metals such as aluminum, silver, gold, etc. The reflecting coating can be coated by a protection layer made of polymer or other biocompatible materials. Under these circumstances, the light will be guided through the resultant coated tube with very small loss. The external surfaces <b>2917</b> of the tube walls <b>2916</b> may also be coated with a reflective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The light wavelength is selected to have a very low absorption rate by water. Suitable light waves are those having wavelengths in the range of 300-1300 nm. The inner coating <b>2920</b> can be also of a polymer having a low index of refraction, to achieve better guidance of the light.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, showing another exemplary treatment device in which the drug delivery tube also functions as a waveguide, the outer side of the drug delivery tube <b>3029</b> can be coated with a reflecting coating <b>3027</b>.

The optical shaping coupling element <b>3023</b> is configured to optimize the coupling efficiency for light (shown schematically as the bouncing ray lines) <b>3024</b>. Under these circumstances, the light <b>3024</b> is guided through the drug solution <b>3028</b> (constituting the waveguide's medium core) and the transparent wall of the tube <b>3026</b>. The reflecting coating may also be covered by a protection layer. Such a waveguide implementation can also be used without coating the outer surfaces of the tube <b>3026</b> with the reflecting coating <b>3027</b> because the index of refraction of air (<b>1</b>) is smaller than the index of refraction of the polymer tube <b>3026</b>. However, any object touching the tube, for example, the abdomen of the patient could induce light leakage. In some embodiments, the tube wall <b>3026</b> is made of two layers with different indices of refraction such that the outer layer has smaller index of refraction and serves as cladding for the optical waveguide Similar to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the walls <b>3026</b> may also be coated with a reflective coating <b>3025</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, another waveguide implementation is shown. In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the light <b>3136</b> is shown schematically by bouncing line rays in the tube wall. A drug delivery device <b>3130</b>, a drug delivery tube <b>3139</b>, a tube connector <b>3131</b> and a radiation source <b>3132</b> may be similar to the respective components/modules described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>. The optical shaping coupling element <b>3134</b> is mounted in mechanical adapter <b>3133</b>. Reasonable (possibly optimal) light coupling efficiency can be achieved by structuring the waveguide section as a circular ring having a shape similar to the shape of the tube <b>3139</b> in cross-section. To couple the light into the circular ring waveguide, suitable optical elements, such as lenses, aspherical components, diffractive optical elements, fiber illuminators and/or mounted light sources having a circular shape may be used. For example, an optical shaping coupling element <b>3134</b>, e.g., a lens, can be used to cause light generated at the light source <b>3132</b> to be coupled into the circular ring-shaped waveguide. The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> may also be used without the inner coating <b>3135</b> and/or outer coating <b>3137</b> of the tube because the index of refraction of air (<b>1</b>) is smaller than the index of refraction of the polymer tube wall <b>3136</b>. In some embodiments, the index of refraction of the drug solution <b>3138</b> is also smaller than the tube wall's index of refraction. However, under those circumstances, any object touching the tube, such as, for example, the abdomen of the patient, will induce light leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">In some embodiments, the reflecting coating is covered also by a protection layer. The tube wall <b>3136</b> may be made of two layers having different indices of refraction such that the outer layer and the drug solution have smaller indices of refraction and serve as the cladding, while the inner layer of the wall functions as the waveguide core to guide the light. The tube wall <b>3136</b> may be made of three layers with different indices of refraction such that the outer layer and the inner layer have smaller indices of refraction and thus serve as the cladding, while the middle layer of the wall serves as the core to guide the light.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, an exemplary treatment device <b>3266</b> in which an electromagnetic radiation element is located within the catheter securing device and radiates the tissue through the catheter is shown. In this arrangement, an infusion catheter <b>3265</b> is combined with at least one optical radiation element <b>3264</b> that couples the light into a proximal part <b>3261</b> of the infusion catheter <b>3265</b>. A catheter securing device <b>3266</b> includes a circular structure <b>3263</b> with a hole <b>3267</b> in its center through which the catheter tube <b>3261</b> enters the subcutaneous tissue. The circular structure <b>3263</b> is attached to the tissue with an adhesive layer <b>3260</b>. The adhesive layer <b>3260</b> may be initially provided with a laminate (not shown) that is peeled off by the user before insertion of the catheter and the connection of the optical radiation element <b>3264</b>. Electromagnetic radiation source(s) can illuminate the drug infused tissue region through the skin. In this arrangement the adhesive layer <b>3260</b> can be either around the illuminated skin area or cover the illuminated skin area with an adhesive that is optically transparent in the relevant optical wavelength(s). The other side of the catheter <b>3265</b> is connected to a drug delivery device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Generally, for catheter insertion, the device may be supplied with a sterile needle (not shown) disposed inside the catheter that is removed after insertion of the catheter. The power source for the optical radiation element <b>3264</b> can be disposed in the catheter unit <b>3266</b>. Alternatively, the power source for the optical radiation element <b>3264</b> may be disposed in the drug delivery device and connected with a wire to the optical radiation element <b>3264</b>. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the power source for optical radiation element <b>3264</b> can be disposed in a third unit (not shown) connected with wires to the optical radiation element <b>3264</b>. In some embodiments, the third unit can be attached externally to the drug delivery device to improve the user comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, another exemplary treatment device that includes a waveguide to irradiate radiation at the drug infused tissue area through a catheter end is shown. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the electromagnetic radiation is light. However, other types of electromagnetic radiation may be used to irradiate the drug infused tissue area. As shown, light from the at least one light source <b>3305</b> is coupled into a catheter <b>3310</b>. The light source <b>3305</b> can be part of the catheter securing device <b>3304</b>, as shown, or alternatively may be detachable (similar to the arrangement shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). To facilitate light coupling into the catheter <b>3310</b>, the light source <b>3305</b> can be aligned on the same longitudinal axis of the catheter tube <b>3310</b>, while the drug enters catheter tube <b>3310</b> at the side of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">In some embodiments, the drug is imparted from the drug delivery device through a tube <b>3301</b>. The tube <b>3301</b> may include a connector <b>3315</b> having one section <b>3302</b> attached to the tube and a second matched section <b>3303</b> attached to the catheter <b>3310</b>. The light, schematically depicted by the bouncing ray lines is guided through the catheter <b>3310</b> until it exits at the catheter end contacting the tissue enters the drug infused area where it is absorbed by the surrounding tissue of the area.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the light is guided inside the catheter tube <b>3310</b> by the tube walls <b>3308</b>. The light is shaped and controlled (e.g., controlling the light's direction) using coupling optical component <b>3306</b> which may include a lens or some other type of optical device, or by a waveguide, to provide suitable coupling efficiency of the light into the catheter tube <b>3310</b>. The light controlled by the coupling optical component <b>3306</b> passes through a transparent wall <b>3320</b> inside the drug delivery tube <b>3301</b>. As previously explained, the light generally propagates within the tube <b>3301</b> because the difference between the refraction indices of the drug (functioning as the core medium) and the tube wall <b>3308</b>. Thus, the light guidance characteristics of the waveguide can be improved by choosing a lower index of refraction polymers for the catheter tube <b>3310</b> or coating the inner side <b>3307</b> of the catheter tube <b>3310</b> with a thin layer of light reflecting coating, including coating that include one or more of aluminum, silver or gold. The reflecting coating can be coated by a protection layer of polymer or other biocompatible materials. Under these circumstances, the light will be guided by the coated tube and sustain only small losses. The outer side <b>3309</b> of the catheter tube <b>3310</b> is generally not coated.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">In some embodiments, the light wavelength (or range) is selected so that small absorption of light by water results. For example, a suitable light wavelength range includes wavelengths in the range of 300-1300 nm. Use of light having a wavelength(s) in that range reduces light absorption by a solution containing the drug (which generally has a high concentration of water) thus preventing heating of the solution. These wavelengths may be used in situations in which the drug should not be heated above a maximum temperature, such as for drugs that include proteins for example.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">A catheter tip <b>3311</b> may be secured to the skin using the catheter securing device <b>3304</b> with an adhesive layer <b>3300</b> in a manner similar to that described in relation to other figures of the present disclosure. At least one temperature sensor (not shown) may be placed on one or more of the skin, the catheter, or the drug infused tissue region. The at least one temperature sensor is configured to regulate (e.g., stabilize) the tissue temperature. In some embodiments, the temperature of the drug infused tissue region is monitored non-invasively through the catheter <b>3310</b>, for example, by measuring the tissue IR emittance or other by using other optical non invasive temperature monitoring techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, in some embodiments, an outer side <b>3428</b> of the catheter tube can be coated with a reflecting coating <b>3429</b>. A tube <b>3421</b>, which delivers the drug from the drug delivery device (not shown) is coupled to a connector <b>3415</b> having sections <b>3422</b> and <b>3423</b>. The device further includes a radiation source <b>3425</b> similar to the radiation source depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. An optical shaping coupling element <b>3426</b> used to efficiently couple light into the catheter tube. As shown in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, light, depicted schematically by the bouncing ray lines <b>3430</b>, is guided in both the drug solution and the transparent walls of the catheter tube <b>3428</b>. The reflecting coating <b>3429</b> may be further covered by a protection layer. In the depicted arrangement, a coating may not be provided for inner walls <b>3427</b> of the catheter tube <b>3428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">The waveguide implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> can also be used without coating the outer side of the tube <b>3428</b> with a reflecting coating because the index of refraction of the air (<b>1</b>) is lower than the index of refraction of the tube <b>3428</b> (typically polymer based). However, when the light enters the catheter portion which is inside the tissue, the light will leak out of the waveguide because the tissue index of refraction is higher (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). The catheter portion at which the light should scatter out of the catheter tube may be coated with partially reflecting coating as will be described in greater detail below. In some embodiments, the tube wall <b>3428</b> is made of two layers with different indices of refraction such that the outer layer has smaller index of refraction and thus serves as cladding for the optical waveguide (not shown). In some embodiments, a catheter securing device <b>3424</b> with adhesive layer <b>3420</b> may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, another guidance device to implement a further guidance scheme is depicted. As shown, the light, represented schematically by the bouncing ray lines, is guided in a tube wall <b>3548</b> of a catheter <b>3551</b>. A tube <b>3541</b> from the drug delivery device includes an connector <b>3515</b> with having, for example, sections <b>3542</b> and <b>3543</b> (similar to the configuration of the corresponding connector depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). The treatment device also include a radiation source <b>3545</b> (similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). Also included is a catheter securing device <b>3544</b> with an adhesive layer <b>3540</b>. An optical coupling element <b>3546</b> may be configured to couple radiation from the radiation source <b>3545</b> to the circular ring-shaped structure that guides the radiation to its exit point at the end of the catheter tube. Such optical shaping and/or control to properly couple the radiation into the circular ring-shaped guide can be achieved using, for example, one or more optical elements, such as lenses, aspherical components, diffractive optical elements. Additionally, the required optical shaping and/or control can also be implemented by mounting light sources with a circular shape or by using fiber illuminators to couple radiation from the radiation source to the guide. The guidance scheme depicted in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> can be used without coating the tube <b>3551</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Alternatively, the outer wall <b>3549</b> of the catheter tube <b>3551</b>, or the inner wall <b>3547</b> of the catheter <b>3551</b>, or both, may be coated with a reflecting coating. The reflecting coating may be covered by a protection layer. In some embodiments, the catheter portion at which the light is emitted out of the catheter tube is coated with a partially reflecting coating. In some embodiments, the catheter tube wall <b>3548</b> is made of two layers with different indices of refraction such that the outer layer and the drug solution <b>3550</b> have smaller indices of refraction and thus serve as the claddings, while the inner layer of the wall <b>3548</b> serves as the waveguide core and guides the light. The second outer layer may cover only the catheter portion at which the light should be guided and ends at the catheter portion at which the light exits out of the catheter tube. In some embodiments, the tube wall <b>3548</b> is made of three layers with different indices of refraction such that the outer layer and the inner layer have smaller indices of refraction and serve as the claddings, while and the middle layer of the wall <b>3548</b> serves as the core to guide the light. The third outer layer may coat only the catheter portion at which the light should be guided and ends at the catheter portion at which the light exits out of the catheter tube <b>3551</b> (not shown). In some embodiments, the reflection coefficient of at least one of the reflecting layers is gradually decreased at the catheter portion at which the light exits out of the catheter tube to obtain more uniform illumination of the drug infused region (not shown). In some embodiments, the reflection coefficient of at least one of the reflecting layers is reduced in a specified profile at the catheter portion at which the light exits out of the catheter tube <b>3551</b> to get a required illumination profile of the drug infused region.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Any of the above mentioned configurations for coupling or decoupling (scattering) the light out of the catheter end can be used with all of the various locations of the light source as described in different herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, showing another exemplary treatment device, light can be guided in the catheter tube <b>3670</b> such that radiation (e.g., light), represented schematically by the bouncing ray lines, propagates in the drug containing fluid <b>3669</b> and/or in the tube walls <b>3667</b> and/or in special layers or structures or waveguides inside the tube <b>3670</b> or the tube wall <b>3667</b>, or in any combination thereof. The light can be guided until it reaches the catheter end where it is emitted out through the same opening from which the drug is delivered and infused into the body of the patient. As shown, the light is strongly scattered in the tissue and illuminates a region having an approximate spherical shape (not shown), with its center, for example, 0.5-1 mm beneath the catheter tip (not shown). In some embodiments, light is emitted from within catheter <b>3670</b>, through, for example, a radiation source <b>3665</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Similarly to some of the other device implementation described herein with respect to the other figures, the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> may include, for example, a catheter securing device <b>3664</b> with an adhesive layer <b>3660</b>. Additionally, drug is delivered through a drug delivery tube <b>3661</b> from a drug delivery device (not shown) that an includes a connector <b>3680</b> with sections <b>3662</b> and <b>3663</b> (similar to the sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">In some embodiments, a larger illuminated area is used, for example, to reduce the light intensity or lumens per unit area, for example, for safety reasons. Therefore, in some embodiments, the light may be emitted through a larger portion of the catheter tube <b>3670</b>. In some embodiments, the focused guidance of the light in the portion of tube <b>3670</b> within the tissue is reduced due, for example, to the contact of the catheter wall <b>3667</b> with the tissue or due to the fact that the waveguide layers and/or structures are altered to cause the light to leak out of the waveguide into the adjacent tissue. As previously explained, alteration of structure and/or material of the waveguide layers can be used to control the profile of the illumination of the radiation at the drug infused tissue area.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">In addition to changing the properties of the layers and/or structures, additional refractive or diffractive elements can be added to the catheter tube end to better control the spatial and angular distribution of the light emitted from the catheter end. For example, the inner side <b>3666</b> of the catheter <b>3670</b> and/or the outer side of the catheter surface can be made rough or diffusive to scatter the emitted light <b>3668</b>. The surface roughness of the catheter tube wall <b>3667</b> can be increased by, for example, embossing a pattern into the inner or outer sides. Such pattern embossing may be done during the catheter tube manufacturing process or at the end of the manufacturing process, for example, by pressing a patterned cylindrical mold within or on the tube <b>3670</b>, with some heating that softens the tube polymer. In some embodiments, the light angular and spatial distribution can be shaped by embossing a diffractive optical element pattern into the inner or outer sides. Diffraction optical element patterns, such as a grating, may be used for coupling light into or out of optical waveguides. All or a portion of the light may be emitted out of the end of catheter tube <b>3670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">The device may provide illumination to the tissue both from inside the catheter and through the skin by a combination of the techniques, structures and arrangements described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The devices described herein (according to some embodiments) may have short range RF or IR communication with a data management and control unit, such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a personal computer, a cellular telephone and/or to a dedicated device that supports managing the drug therapy. For example, if the drug is insulin, the data managing device may obtain the glucose readings from a glucose sensor, whether manually or automatically, or by reading glucose sensing strips. The device may also obtain information about consumed carbohydrates and other ingredients of food and/or drinks. The device may also store patient history and relevant parameters, such as weight, BMI, insulin resistance and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The data managing device may also calculate the optimal required amount of insulin and the optimal tissue radiation profile. This information can be sent wirelessly to the drug delivery pump and/or to the radiation device (for providing electromagnetic radiation), for optimal drug delivery. The radiation device may transmit tissue parameters measured by sensors disposed on it to the data management and control unit as additional information for determining one or more therapeutic parameters and/or for future statistics and data analysis. The data management and control unit may recommend an optimal drug dosage and optimal radiation profile to infused tissue region, which the patient (or other user) then approves before initiation of therapy. The data management and control unit may recommend an optimal drug dosage. In some embodiments, the data management and control unit may form part of the drug delivery pump.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, another exemplary treatment device with optical sensors is shown.

As further shown, the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> includes a disposable drug delivery pump configuration. In the depicted configuration, the drug delivery pump <b>3782</b> and at least one light source <b>3783</b> are disposed in a single housing <b>3781</b> attached to the skin with adhesive layer <b>3780</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">A light source <b>3783</b> generates light to illuminate the tissue.

Light is also reflected by a reflective coating for inner side <b>3787</b> of tube walls <b>3788</b>, although some may also scatter to the outside <b>3789</b> of tube walls <b>3788</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The light exits at catheter tip <b>3791</b> into the tissue (not shown). The light is then scattered into and off the tissue and reaches the optical sensors <b>3785</b> and <b>3786</b> through windows in the adhesive layer <b>3780</b> or, if the adhesive layer is transparent, through the adhesive layer. Measurements performed by the optical sensors <b>3785</b> and <b>3786</b> are used to determine the amount of absorbed light (based on the fact that the initial power of the light source is known). If wavelengths strongly absorbed by the hemoglobin such those as in the range of 600-1000 nm are used, the optical sensors <b>3785</b> and <b>3786</b> can provide information related to the hemoglobin concentration at the adjacent tissue region, which may thus provide information on the local blood perfusion. The blood perfusion information can be used to monitor radiation level, distribution or wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">The absorbed light level can also be evaluated by measuring the light which is back scattered into the optical waveguide formed by the catheter tube <b>3790</b>, guided by the waveguide and then coupled out of the waveguide using the same coupling optics previously described, or by using additional coupling optics into an optical sensor used for measuring the back scattered light (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">The above described methods, apparatus and devices for radiating the tissue are not limited to drug-delivery pumps, but can also be used with manual delivery of the drug, such as connecting a syringe instead of a pump to the proximal part of the catheter. Under such circumstances, the catheter proximal part may terminate in a connector or a port that fits the syringe tip. The distal part of the catheter is inserted into the tissue as previously described in relation to the exemplary drug-delivery arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Although the catheter was drawn with a 90&#xb0; penetration angle in the above embodiments, any suitable angle for catheter penetration may be selected.

<p id="p-0291" num="0290">In some embodiments, the present invention relates to devices for improving, modifying and/or stabilizing pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile of a drug infused into the tissue by a catheter and absorbed into the blood or lymphatic system. The devices described in some of the embodiments of the present application apply additional treatment or stimulation to the vicinity of the drug delivery site. The treatment can be one or combination of the tissue treatment treatments modalities described in U.S. Ser. No. 11/812,230, such as: heating, modifying temperature, massaging, mechanical vibration, acoustic vibration, ultrasound, suction, infusion of an additional substance or chemical, applying a low electric field, applying a low magnetic field, light irradiation, radiofrequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) irradiation, microwave (&#x201c;MW&#x201d;) irradiation, etc. In some embodiments, the device has a catheter for insertion within the tissue to infuse a substance into the infused tissue region. The infused tissue region (i.e., the infused region) can be one of the skin layers or the subcutaneous tissue or deeper tissue elements within any organ or viscera.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In many instances, the patients require insulin delivery around the clock to keep proper levels of glucose in their blood. Insulin can be delivered at a basal rate or in bolus doses. The basal rate represents insulin that is continuously delivered to the patient yet in practicality is delivered in small intermittent boluses. Such continuous delivery of insulin keeps the patient's blood glucose in the desired range between meals and over night. In many cases the basal insulin is delivered by insulin pumps in short infusion pulses every 1-5 minutes. In some embodiments, tissue or skin treatments or stimulation methods can be used to treat or stimulate a tissue region to which insulin is infused during basal insulin delivery. One possible effect of the tissue treatment, such as regulating the infused tissue region vicinity to a known temperature, is improving the stability of the insulin absorption to the circulatory system, and consequently improving the basal insulin pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics stability. Another possible effect of such a treatment is improving the efficiency of the absorption of the insulin and consequently reducing the amount of infused insulin needed to achieve the desired metabolic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">In addition the diabetic patient needs to infuse insulin bolus doses for matching a the carbohydrates consumed during meals. When a patient consumes food, his or her levels of glucose rise and the insulin bolus dose is supposed to match the rise in the level of glucose and to prevent large glucose excursions. However, many conventional subcutaneous drug delivery systems are incapable of quickly matching or preventing the rise of blood glucose known as post prandial hyperglycemia. The delay in such matching is also true in case of the &#x201c;rapid-acting&#x201d; insulin analogs. Some of the reasons for this delay include a lag in the absorption of insulin from the injection site and the time it takes for complex insulin molecules to break down into monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">It is well known in the art that there are some adverse effects for infusing large amounts of insulin which beside of regulating the glucose absorption has several additional hormonal effects, such as being growth factor. In some cases, the excess amounts of insulin cause indirectly an undesired weight gain of diabetic patients, specifically those with a tendency for developing hypoglycemia. In some cases the excess amounts of insulin at the infusion sight cause undesired local lipo-hypertrophy.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">In some embodiments, tissue or skin treatments or stimulation methods can be used to treat or stimulate a tissue region to which insulin is infused during basal or bolus insulin delivery. One possible effect of the tissue treatment is improving the efficiency of the absorption of the insulin into the blood or lymph systems and consequently reducing the amount of the insulin needed to create the desired metabolic effect. Consequently the undesired adverse effects of the excess insulin levels, such as excess weight gaining can be reduced. Another possible effect of the tissue treatment is improving and reducing the amounts and the durations that the insulin lasts at the tissue infused region, since it is absorbed faster in the blood or lymph systems. Consequently the undesired local adverse effects of the excess insulin levels, such as the lipo-hypertrophy or local irritation can be reduced. Another possible effect of the infused tissue region vicinity treatment is improving the local blood perfusion, which reduces the local inflammation effects of the infusion set or the puncturing or the insulin. Another possible effect of reducing the short and long term local effects of the insulin on the insulin infused tissue region is to lengthen the duration of using an infusion set on the same sight.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">In some embodiments, tissue or skin treatment methods can be activated on elective or preprogrammed boluses for brief periods to provide a boost of the insulin absorption. In some embodiments, tissue or skin treatments methods can be a part of all or some of the elements of complex pre programmed boluses such as split wave, square root and other bolus patterns. The stimulation can be activated for the initial phase of a standard bolus, specifically for pre-programmed components of a split bolus or at intervals of interest of the square bolus. In other embodiments&#x2014;the stimulation can be activated by a pre-programmed duty cycle independent of the bolus type. In other embodiments, the intermittent activation can be synchronized with individual bolus components of the basal rate.</p>

In some embodiments, tissue or skin treatments or stimulation methods can be used to treat or stimulate a tissue region to which insulin is infused by an implanted insulin delivery device. In some embodiments, implanted insulin delivery device is an implanted insulin pump. In some embodiments, implanted insulin delivery device are implanted beta cells that can produce insulin. In case of implanted beta cells said tissue treatment can support also the implanted cells, for instance by improving local perfusion and improving the cells oxygen, glucose and other required ingredients supply. By improving the local perfusion also the beta cells or other glucose sensing element can react without unwanted delays to fast glucose variations.</p>

<p id="p-0300" num="0299">In some embodiments, glucose level regulation is obtained by automatically controlling the insulin infusion rate using a continuous glucose sensor and a control algorithm. There are many attempts to compose such an &#x201c;artificial pancreas&#x201d; since the development of continuous glucose monitors. In this case, any delay such as the current delays of the insulin absorption and action time, any variability in this delay and any variability in the residual insulin level in the body induces an error for the control algorithm that will result in less tight glucose regulation. Thus, by stimulating or applying a treatment to the vicinity of the infused tissue region combined with input from an implanted or other types of glucose sensor and a control algorithm can provide better accuracy and robustness of a closed loop glucose level control systems.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">In some embodiments, the tissue in the vicinity of the glucose sensor is treated or stimulated by the above described treatments to improve the glucose transport form the blood system to the interstitial fluid and into the glucose sensor, as described in U.S. provisional application 60/948,472.</p>

Therefore, both the delay of the glucose transport to the ISF and to the sensor and the delay of the insulin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are reduced, enabling to achieve a more tight glucose regulation by closing the loop between the two devices.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">In some embodiments, the same treatment or treatments combination is applied to the insulin infused tissue region vicinity and to the vicinity of the tissue region in which the glucose level is measured by the glucose sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">In some embodiments, the tissue region in which the glucose level is measured by the glucose sensor is the in the vicinity of the insulin infused tissue region and the treatment or treatments combination is applied to the vicinity of that tissue region with a single treatment element.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">In some embodiments, described above both the insulin delivery device and the glucose sensor are implanted. In others, both are part of the same transcutaneous catheter or part of a device that has more than one catheter (one for infusion and one as a sensor) that are both inserted by one insertion process and are located in the proximity of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">In some embodiments, for automatic regulation of the glucose level described above, the processing unit or the algorithm includes an automatic meal detection algorithm that identifies a rapid rise in the glucose level on a continuous glucose level signal. The processing unit infuses insulin bolus using the insulin delivery device and applies the above described treatment or treatments in case of detection of a meal and automatic detection. In others, the indication of food consumption can be given manually by the patient through the infusion pump.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">In some embodiments, for semi automatic regulation of the glucose level that involves human approval for insulin bolus, the processing unit or the algorithm includes an automatic meal detection algorithm that identifies a rapid rise in the glucose level on a continuous glucose level signal. The processing unit alerts the patient that infuses an insulin bolus using the insulin delivery device and applies the above described treatment or treatments to shorten the insulin action time and reduce the postprandial glucose excursion.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">In some embodiments, the treatment can be programmed to reduce the temperature in order to reduce absorption of previously administered insulin that is still in the subcutaneous space. This feature can be a cautionary and protective element of a closed loop system.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">In some embodiments, the treatment can be in the vicinity of the drug infused tissue region and still induce the desired effect to the drug infused tissue region. For instance in the case of heating, W. Magerl et. al. [W. Magerl et. al. Journal of Physiology 497.3 pp 837-848 (1996)] showed that heating the skin can induce vasodilatation in human at a distance of even 30 mm due to activation of nociceptive axon reflex. They also showed that in some cases short period heating can also evoke vasodilatation for a period of few minutes. Therefore In some embodiments, the treatment, such as heating to temperature of 39.5&#xb0; C. is applied for short periods of 2-60 seconds every few minutes and evokes vasodilatation that improves the drug pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics in the drug infused tissue region.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">In some embodiments, the treatment can be calibrated for each patient to optimize it for its own nociceptive axon reflex activation threshold. For instance, W. Margerl et. al. show that the vasodilatation evoking temperature after 64 seconds of heating can vary between 37-43&#xb0; C. for different subjects. The calibration can be done also locally for a specific infusion site. An method for calibrating the treatment device is to start applying the tissue treatment gradually in the first initiation of the treatment device and measure the treatment effect on the tissue, such as vasodilatation, using a specific sensor connected to the processor unit that controls the treatment device. Than the processing unit decide what level of tissue treatment to apply, to optimize the treatment effect on one hand without causing any adverse effects on the other hand. For example, in case the tissue treatment is heating and the desired effect is vasodilatation, the treatment device can gradually heat the tissue till the safety upper limit and measure the local tissue vasodilatation. The vasodilatation can be measured by Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF). Another close parameter that can be measured is the tissue blood perfusion which can be measured by LDF or by one of the known in the art measurements for the tissue optical absorption in hemoglobin significant absorption lines, such as 700-1000 nm. Afterwards, the processing unit uses that information to decide what the best peak temperature of the temperature heating profile to which the specific sight at the specific subject should be heated should be.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">In some embodiments, these calibration process is repeated once a while, such as every 6-12 hours, to compensate for changes that might influence on the temperature threshold of the axon reflex response to local heating.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">In some embodiments, these calibration process is repeated every time the treatment device is operated, such as during insulin bolus to compensate for more rapid changes that might influence on the temperature threshold of the axon reflex response to local heating, such as Nitric Oxide, noradrenaline and other substances [Belinda et. al. J. Physiol. 572 3 pp 821-820 (1996)]. In this case when the treatment, such as heating, is started the treatment parameter, such as temperature, is raised gradually while measuring the desired tissue parameter such as vasodilatation, using LDF. When the vasodilatations happens the treatment level, such as temperature, is stabilized to that level or slightly above it.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">In some embodiments, these calibration process is repeated also during the treatment. In this case the treatment, such as heating, after it starts as described in the paragraph above is regulated to keep the desired tissue parameter, such as vasodilatation level stabilized to a target level, during the whole treatment. Stabilizing the desired tissue parameter, such as vasodilatation level, stabilizes also the absorption of drug in the blood and improve the repeatability of the drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Controlling the treatment level according to the desired tissue parameter, such as vasodilatation level may reduce also the power consumption of the treatment device. For instance, in case of heating, since short period heating to a certain temperature above the threshold temperature initiates the axon reflex response and vasodilatation, there is no need to keep the temperature high for a long period and by that the power consumption can be reduced.</p>
