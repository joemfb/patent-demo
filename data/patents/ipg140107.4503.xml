<heading id="h-0001" level="1">SCOPE OF THE APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to device selection, for example but not exclusively to device selection in integrated circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The general principle of connecting or coupling devices together using for example a control bus for selecting some element within the remote device and data bus for providing or retrieving information concerning the element within the remote device are generally known. For example systems containing one master device and one slave device and where the master device communicates with the slave device and the slave device performs data transactions as per a predefined protocol are generally known and implemented widely.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However such single master single slave communication couplings typically fail where additional devices use the same bus or, link, or coupling. In such systems where there is more than one slave device typically a device address bus is implemented to select one of the devices. For example a typical example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where a master device (port) <b>1</b> can be coupled to a first device &#x2018;Device <b>1</b>&#x2019; <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and a second device &#x2018;Device <b>2</b>&#x2019; <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>via a main clock coupling (MAIN CLOCK) <b>3</b>, a control signal coupling (CTRL_SIG_OUT) <b>5</b> and a data signal coupling (DATA_OUT) <b>7</b>. The master device <b>1</b> in order to select one of the devices to communicate with is further coupled to an address logic decoder (Logic) <b>9</b> using a dedicated select address coupling <b>15</b> on which dedicated select signals can be sent. The address logic decoder <b>9</b> can furthermore be coupled to each of the devices via additional dedicated selection couplings (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by the first dedicated select coupling <b>16</b> between the logic <b>9</b> and the first device <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second dedicated select coupling <b>17</b> between the logic <b>9</b> and the second device <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As dedicated lines or couplings are required for each device this can limit expansion in the design. In other words it is not possible to increase the number of slave devices in the system beyond the number of dedicated couplings between the address logic decoder and device. Furthermore such approaches require additional coupling lines between the master device, address decoding device and the slave devices as well as a specific address decoding logic apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE APPLICATION</heading>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the switching logic <b>101</b> and specifically the state machine <b>121</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments the state machine <b>121</b> comprises a counter <b>211</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the counter <b>211</b> is a 2-bit counter but in some other embodiments any suitable length of counter can be employed. The counter <b>211</b> is configured to receive the main clock signal (Main CLK) from the main clock coupling <b>3</b>. In some embodiments the main clock signal can be employed as a Reset input to the counter <b>211</b>. Furthermore the counter <b>211</b> is configured to receive a secondary clock signal carried by at least one of the control or data couplings. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the secondary clock signal is carried from the master device <b>1</b> by the least significant bit control coupling (CTRL_OUT[0]) <b>201</b>. In some embodiments the counter <b>211</b> is configured to receive the secondary clock signal as the clock input (CLK). Furthermore in some embodiments the counter <b>211</b> is configured to output the result of the counter to a decoder <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The state machine <b>121</b> in some embodiments further comprises a decoder <b>213</b> configured to receive the output of the counter <b>211</b> and at a specific counter value to output a enable signal or latch signal to a Flop Array <b>215</b>. In some embodiments the decoder is configured to output an enable signal when the selection input is at a defined value which is passed to the Flop Array <b>215</b>. As can be seen in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the decoder <b>213</b> is configured to output the latch signal when the value of the counter reaches <b>2</b>. In some embodiments the determined output value can be any suitable value of the counter <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments the state machine <b>121</b> further comprises flop array <b>215</b> or data latch configured to receive an input signal carried by the remainder of the input couplings from the master device <b>1</b> and is latched by the latch signal received from the decoder <b>213</b>. Thus in some embodiments, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where the main clock coupling <b>3</b> and one (the least significant bit element) of the control couplings <b>201</b> has been used to carry the main and secondary clock signals the remainder of the control and data couplings <b>203</b> (N&#x2212;2) are configured to be received as the data input (Data_in) to the flop array <b>215</b>. In some embodiments the latch signal from the decoder <b>213</b> is coupled to the clock input (clock) of the flop array <b>215</b> and thus the flop array is configured to output and latch a value of the data input to be output via a flop array data output (Data_out) when the flop array clock input is enabled. The flop array <b>215</b> data output is further in some embodiments to be configured to be coupled to the selection input of the demultiplexer <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> the operation of the selection system is shown in further detail. With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the operation of device selection from the viewpoint of the master device <b>1</b> is shown as a series of flow chart blocks. With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the operation device selection from the viewpoint of the switching block <b>101</b> is shown in further detail as a series of flow chart blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The master device <b>1</b> in some embodiments is configured to stop the main clock signal and to start the secondary clock signal using one of the control/data couplings or lines. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the secondary clock signal is output on the least significant bit control signal coupling <b>201</b>. In some other embodiments the master device <b>1</b> can use any one of the control/data couplings to carry the secondary clock signal. Thus where for example there is only one data coupling or line and only one control coupling or line one or other of the control or data lines can be used to supply the secondary clock signal to the switching logic <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The operation of stopping the main clock signal and starting the secondary clock signal is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by step <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The switching logic <b>101</b> and specifically the state machine <b>121</b> is configured to receive both the couplings carrying the main clock signal and the secondary clock signal and determine a stopped main clock signal. In the example of the state machine <b>121</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the main clock signal is used to reset a counter <b>211</b> and thus when the main clock signal is stopped the reset input is deactivated enabling the counter <b>211</b> to operate and register input clock signal state changes.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The determination of the stopped main clock signal is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by step <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore the state machine <b>121</b> in the switching block <b>211</b> is further configured to determine the start of the secondary clock signal carried on one of the control/data lines or couplings. For example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the counter <b>211</b> receives the secondary clock signal on the least significant bit control coupling (CTRL_OUT [0]) <b>201</b> at the clock input (CLK). In other words the counter <b>211</b> is able to determine an input secondary clock signal state changes by incrementing the counter output (providing as discussed herein the reset signal, the main clock signal, is de-enabled or stopped).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The determination of the secondary clock signal is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by step <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The state machine furthermore is configured to determine a when a &#x2018;minimum&#x2019; period since the main clock signal has been stopped has been reached. In some embodiments such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> this stopped main clock period is determined by the combination of the counter <b>211</b> outputting the number of secondary clock signal cycles since the main clock has been stopped and the decoder <b>213</b> configured to receive the output of the counter <b>211</b> and output an enable or latch signal when the value of the counter <b>211</b> reaches a determined value. Thus for example the decoder <b>213</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is configured to output the latch signal (latch_signal) when the counter reaches the value 2. However it would be understood that the latch signal could be output at any suitable value. Furthermore in some embodiments as described herein more than one latch signal can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In other words the state machine can be understood to carry out a check whether or not the period since the main clock signal has been stopped is greater than or equal to a determined value. This check operation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by step <b>505</b>. When the period of the stopped main clock signal is not greater to or equal to a determined value the operation passes back to the operations of determining the stopped main clock signal and continued secondary clock signal. However when the period of the stopped main clock is equal to or greater than the determined value the operation can pass to the next step such as the outputting of a latch signal as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The master device <b>1</b> furthermore can be configured to output a device selection signal or address being carried on the remaining unused control and data couplings or lines. As described herein the device selection signal or device selection address value can be output over a determined number of clock cycles or be output over a number of clock cycles as described herein. In a following example the number of slave devices from which one is selected is less than or equal to 2<sup>(N-2) </sup>(N being the number of couplings from the master device <b>1</b> to the switching block <b>101</b>) and as such the address or device selection signal can be output from the master device in a determined number of clock cycles. An example of the number of clock cycles the device selection address can be output over is 2.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The output of the device selection signal or device selection address on the remaining control and data lines or couplings is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by step <b>403</b>. It would be understood that in some embodiments the master device <b>1</b> could output the device selection signal (or first part of the device clock selection signal) on the clock cycle after the main clock signal is stopped or any time up to the determined stopped clock period value.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The state machine <b>211</b> and in some embodiments the flop array <b>215</b> as described herein is configured to receive the latch signal from the decoder <b>121</b> as the flop array clock input (Clock) and the device selection signal from the master device <b>1</b> at the flop array data input (Data_in). Thus the flop array <b>215</b> is configured to, when the latch signal is enabled, to latch the device selection signal via the remaining control and data lines or couplings.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The latching of the data and control remaining inputs, in other words the device selection signal, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by step <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The state machine <b>211</b> and in some embodiments the flop array <b>215</b> can furthermore output the latched device selection signal to the logic block <b>123</b> on the selection couplings (N&#x2212;2 lines wide) <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The operation of outputting the device selection address to the logic block <b>123</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by step <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The logic block <b>123</b> which in some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, comprises a de-multiplexer can furthermore be configured to route any signals received on the data input to a device dependent on the value of the selection signal. In such embodiments therefore the main clock, control and data signals received via the main clock, control and data couplings respectively are selectively routed dependent on the value of the selection signal output from the flop array <b>215</b> to a device via an associated device main clock, control and data coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The configuration of the multiplexer to set up the outputting of received signals dependent on the selection device address to a set of lines or couplings associated with a slave or further device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by step <b>511</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the first part of the timing diagram the switching block <b>101</b> and in some embodiments the logic block <b>123</b> which can be a de-multiplexer is configured to receive master device main clock signal, data signal and control signal and output these to a first device <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>as shown by the first highlighted region <b>301</b> and where the main clock signal is shown on the first device main clock coupling (MAIN_CLK_DEV<b>1</b>) <b>103</b>, the data signal is shown in the first device data coupling (DATA_OUT_DEV<b>1</b>[3:0]) <b>107</b> and the control signal is shown in the control couplings (CONTROL_OUT_DEV<b>1</b>[3:0] and CONTROL_OUT<b>4</b>_DEV<b>1</b>) <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the main clock signal is stopped (approximately 180 ns into the simulation), the secondary clock signal is started and carried on one of the control lines CONTROL_OUT<b>4</b> <b>201</b>. Furthermore the master device passes the device selection signal on the remaining data and control couplings. The device selection signal which indicates that the next device to be selected is Device <b>2</b> <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>when the required number of secondary clock cycles have been detected with the main clock signal stopped, which in this example is 2, is latched into the de-multiplexer <b>123</b>.

The device selection signal which indicates that the next device to be selected is Device <b>3</b> <b>10</b><sub>3 </sub>is latched into the de-multiplexer <b>123</b>.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, for example where there are more than 2<sup>(N-2) </sup>devices to be selected from (where as described herein N is the number of couplings or lines between the master device <b>1</b>, the switching block <b>101</b> and the devices <b>10</b>) the device selection signal can be transmitted by the master device <b>1</b> to the switching block <b>101</b> over more than two clock cycles in order that the full range of devices are selectable. For example in some embodiments the device selection signal or address can be divided into sections each of which is equal to N&#x2212;2 bits wide are transmitted by the master device <b>1</b> to the switching block <b>101</b> where the complete device selection signal or address can be reassembled and decoded to select the device.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In such embodiments a maximum number of devices selectable can be 2<sup>P*(N-2) </sup>where P is the number of sections the address signal is divided into. In some embodiments this can be implemented for example in some embodiments by using P flop arrays each configured to latch a section of the address signal on receiving a latch signal associated with the section to be latched. In other words the first flop array configured to receive the first section of the selection address receiving a latch signal when the counter reaches a first value, for example 2. Similarly the second flop array configured to receive the second section of the selection address receiving a latch signal when the counter reaches a second value, for example 3, and so on. When all of the sections of the selection signal have been latched the concatenated results of all of the flop arrays can be passed to the demultiplexer. In some other embodiments the reconstruction of the sectioning of the selection signal can be carried out by using a buffer, for example a FIFO buffer which is coupled to the flop array and is progressively filled as sections of the selection signal are latched before the buffer is parallel output to the multiplexer.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments the determination of whether a full device selection address has been latched is an implicit action determined by the stopped main clock signal and the continued operation of the secondary clock signal.</p>
