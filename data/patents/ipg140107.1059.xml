<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/403,909 filed Sep. 23, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to containers and particularly to reclosable pour systems for containers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many materials, including flowable materials, are shipped in some form of box or Carton. Frequently these containers are &#x201c;sift proof&#x201d; containers. Sift proof containers do not need an inner lining (such as a plastic bag) to keep the flowable material from sifting through the carton and leaking. Current sift proof containers are often made of paperboard or corrugated box material and adhesive, although other materials can be used. Such cartons are also frequently made as a unitary structure that is foldable into the desired container shape.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To allow the consumer to remove materials from sift proof containers, some form of opening is required. In some instances, the container simply possesses a tear strip near the top of the container. Pulling this tear strip results in a slit being formed along three of the container sidewalls. The top of the container is then free to be pulled open; the remaining sidewall acts as a hinge. Though this system is rather simple, it is disadvantageous because the opening is difficult to pour from and because the relatively large opening cannot typically be reclosed in a latchable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternatively, some sift proof containers possess a reclosable spout. One way this is accomplished is through the addition of a metal or plastic pour spout to the container. However, use of such spouts is disadvantageous since these spouts increase the cost of the containers. Because of this, some containers employ cardboard pour spouts or other types of cardboard pouring devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various examples of containers with paperboard or cardboard pouring devices can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,452,850, 7,581,673, and 5,531,376. Each of these patents generally discloses a paperboard or cardboard carton made from a unitary sheet of material that has been cut and folded in such a way so as to provide a pour flap. For instance, the '850 patent describes a container that has holes in the top of the container through which a flowable material can be poured, with a reclosable cardboard flap covering those holes. In this case, the flap is reclosed by pushing it down until it frictionally engages a cardboard cutout of nearly the same size and shape as the flap. Alternatively, the '376 patent discloses a carton that possesses a reclosable spout that opens in a downward, drawbridge-like fashion, the pour spout possessing a pour spout body and pour spout wings, the wings guiding the spout and helping to ensure that it is not pulled out too far as a user pulls the spout outwards to open the package. These containers possess several shortcomings and disadvantages. For instance, the flaps may interfere with the use of a top handle on the carton or the flaps may not close properly after a relatively small number of open-close cycles due to the flap or latching device becoming worn or misshapen. There is, therefore, a need for improved reclosable pour systems for containers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide reclosable pour systems suitable for use in containers</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another object of the invention to provide reclosable pour systems for containers used for repeated dispensing of flowable materials.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a further object of the invention to provide containers that utilize a reclosable pour system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is yet another object of the invention to provide unitary blanks for forming containers comprising a reclosable pour system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the invention to provide methods of making containers comprising a reclosable pour system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is still another object of the invention to provide methods of obtaining products from containers comprising a reclosable pour system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is another object of the invention to provide products comprising containers of the invention and one or more materials in the containers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other objects are achieved using novel reclosable hinged pour systems and containers employing at least one reclosable hinged pour system. Generally, the reclosable pour systems feature a pour opening that comprises a hinged flap and a tab that enables latchable reclosing and reopening of the pour opening, to allow the pouring of flowable materials contained within the containers. Unitary blanks capable of being cut and folded to produce containers comprising the reclosable pour system, as well as methods of manufacture and use of containers comprising the reclosable pour system of the invention, are also provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one aspect, the invention provides reclosable pour systems for containers. The systems comprise (a) a flap pivotably attached to a wall of the container via a flap hinge, the container having a plurality of top, side and bottom walls defining a substantially closed interior (b) a pour opening traversing at least one wall of the container, the pour opening comprising a plurality of edge portions, wherein one edge portion of the pour opening comprises the flap hinge, and wherein the flap can enter and exit the pour opening through pivotable movement of the flap at the flap hinge; and (c) a tab attached to a wall of the container, wherein the tab is located along another edge portion of the pour opening such that it protrudes into the pour opening. The pour systems latchably reclose by depressing or sliding the flap past the tab, to the interior of the container. The pour systems can be reopened by moving the flap upward toward the hinge, until it clears the tab and is thereby released to the open position. Alternatively, the tab can be pulled or bent away from the container, thereby releasing the flap to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As will be understood by the skilled artisan, the type and construction of the flap hinge will depend in part on the materials used to construct the reclosable pour system. For instance, if cardboard, paper board or light plastic is utilized, the flap hinge may be constructed by creasing or folding the flap back and forth at the hinge juncture. The material can be pre-creased or pre-folded in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain embodiments, the wall of the container comprises an inner panel and an outer panel, which are adhered to one another. Each of the inner panel and outer panel comprises an opening which collectively forms the pour opening. The inner panel comprises the tab and the outer panel comprises part or all of the flap.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the pour opening and flap traverse at least a portion of the top wall and an adjacent side wall of the container. Here, the flap hinge is located along an edge of the pour opening on the top wall and the tab is located along an edge of the pour opening along the side wall. In another embodiment, which may be appreciated as the previous embodiment turned on its side, the pour opening and flap traverse at least a portion of two adjacent side walls of the container, the flap hinge is located along an edge of the pour opening on one side wall and the tab is located along an edge of the pour opening along the other side wall. In another embodiment the pour opening and flap traverse at least a portion of a single side wall of the container, the flap hinge is located along an edge portion of the pour opening on the side wall and the tab is located along a different edge portion of the pour opening on the same side wall.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The flap and the pour opening can be substantially the same size and shape. In certain embodiments, the flap hinge and the tab are located along substantially opposite edge portions of the pour opening. In some embodiments as alluded to above, the tab is bendable, so that it may bend inward if the flap is pressed inward to reclose the container, and/or it may be pulled outward to release the flap. Certain embodiments employ a hinge at the tab, which may be formed in the same way as the flap hinge. If a tab hinge is utilized, it should be constructed so as to be sufficiently rigid to hold the flap in place in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another aspect, the invention provides containers. The containers comprise top, bottom, and side walls that define a substantially enclosed interior and at least one reclosable pour system as described above. The containers may be of any size or shape, such as a bottle, cube, box, pyramid, or cylinder, to name a few. The containers can also be made of any suitable material. Suitable materials are well known to persons skilled in the art and include metal, plastic, paperboard, and corrugated cardboard, to name a few.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, the containers contain one or more flowable materials capable of being poured from the container through the reclosable pour system. The flowable material in certain embodiments is a powder or granular material. Examples include, but are not limited to, pet litter, pet food, powdered detergent, or dry foodstuff, such as grains, sugar, baking soda, salt, and spices.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b>, reclosable pour system <b>10</b> possesses a flap <b>11</b>, which is attached to container <b>12</b> through a flap hinge <b>13</b>. Flap <b>11</b> can be located on a single container wall, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where flap <b>11</b> is located entirely on wall <b>17</b> of container <b>12</b>. Alternatively, flap <b>11</b> can cross the fold junction joining two adjacent walls so that it is located on two walls of the container, for example, partially on the top wall of the container and partially on a side wall, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, or partially on two adjacent side walls. In certain embodiments, the majority of flap <b>11</b> is located on a side wall while a minority portion of flap <b>11</b>, including flap hinge <b>13</b>, is located on a top wall of the container. Flap <b>11</b> can be any shape desired. In certain embodiments, the flap is hemispherical, rectangular, oval, or square shaped. Container <b>12</b> also can be any desired shape or size, as mentioned above. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates reclosable pour system <b>10</b> on a container which is a box. Flap hinge <b>13</b> can be located on any side of flap <b>11</b> such that the flap can open in any direction. The flap hinge is preferably located at the top of the flap such that the flap opens in an upward direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>5</b>. Through flap hinge <b>13</b>, the flap is able to be pivoted (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>) to cover and uncover pour opening <b>14</b> in container <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Pour opening <b>14</b> traverses one or more walls of container <b>12</b>, thereby allowing a flowable material within container <b>12</b> to be passed into or out of the container when flap <b>11</b> is in the open position. Pour opening <b>14</b> can be any shape or size that is desired. In certain embodiments, the pour opening is hemispherical, rectangular, oval, or square shaped. Preferably, the pour opening is substantially the same size and shape as flap <b>11</b>, thereby allowing flap <b>11</b> to be inserted into pour opening <b>14</b> without leaving a gap of sufficient size to allow a significant amount of flowable material within container <b>12</b> to escape through the gap.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Reclosable pour system <b>10</b> also possesses tab <b>15</b> attached to or integrated within wall <b>17</b> of container <b>12</b>. Tab <b>15</b> is attached to wall <b>17</b> of container <b>12</b> through optional tab hinge <b>16</b> and extends from the edge of and into pour opening <b>14</b> such that it is in substantially the same plane as wall <b>17</b> of container <b>12</b>. Though this is the initial position of tab <b>15</b>, and the position to which it prefers to return in the absence of any bending force, tab <b>15</b> is bendable between this first position of being in substantially the same plane as wall <b>17</b> of container <b>12</b> and a second position in which tab <b>15</b> is angled inward such that it is within the interior of container <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, tab <b>15</b> is also bendable to a third position in which tab <b>15</b> is angled outward such that it is outside of the inner space of container <b>12</b>. Tab <b>15</b> can be located at any position along the edge of pour opening <b>14</b> with the exception of the edge portion of pour opening <b>14</b> comprising flap hinge <b>13</b>. In certain embodiments, tab <b>15</b> is located substantially opposite flap hinge <b>13</b> on pour opening <b>14</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>5</b>. Tab <b>15</b> can be any shape desired. In certain embodiments, tab <b>15</b> is hemispherical, rectangular, oval, or square shaped. Tab <b>15</b> can also be any size desired, so long as tab <b>15</b> is sufficiently small to allow flap <b>11</b> to be pushed passed tab <b>15</b> and into pour opening <b>14</b> and sufficiently large to effect latchable closure of the flap.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the reclosable pour system is formed by the overlap of inner and outer panels, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein inner panel <b>21</b> and outer panel <b>22</b> make up the reclosable pour system. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment where the reclosable pour system is formed by the overlap of inner front panel <b>53</b> and outer front panel <b>54</b> and the overlap of inner top panel <b>51</b> and outer top panel <b>69</b>. In such cases, the pour opening is defined by the overlap of openings in both the inner and outer panels. In certain embodiments, the two panels will be adhered to one another by any suitable means during manufacturing of the container. Even more preferably, the inner panel (i.e., the panel nearer the inner space of the container) includes the tab while the outer panel (i.e., the panel further from the inner space of the container) includes the flap.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B</figref>, <b>2</b>C, <b>5</b>B, and <b>5</b>C illustrate, one way to close reclosable pour system <b>10</b>. Flap <b>11</b> is moved toward pour opening <b>14</b>. When flap <b>11</b> comes into contact with tab <b>15</b>, continued movement of flap <b>11</b> results in tab <b>15</b> bending at optional tab hinge <b>16</b> such that tab <b>15</b> is angled inward and within container <b>12</b>. This allows flap <b>11</b> to be moved into pour opening <b>14</b> until flap <b>11</b> passes tab <b>15</b>, at which time tab <b>15</b> will, return to its original position of being in the same plane as wall <b>17</b> of container <b>12</b>. When the pressure on flap <b>11</b> is subsequently released, tab <b>15</b> will not allow flap <b>11</b> to exit pour opening <b>14</b>. By virtue of the presence of flap <b>11</b> within pour opening <b>14</b>, when in the closed position, reclosable pour system <b>10</b> stops the passage of flowable material through pour opening <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> illustrates, to open reclosable pour system <b>10</b>, tab <b>15</b> can be bent outward, away from container <b>12</b>. When tab <b>15</b> is angled sufficiently outward, tab <b>15</b> will no longer physically block flap <b>11</b> from exiting pour opening <b>14</b>. As such, flap <b>11</b> will moved past tab <b>15</b>, thereby uncovering pour opening <b>14</b>. When in the open position, reclosable pour system <b>10</b> allows flowable material within container <b>12</b> to be passed into or out of container <b>12</b> via pour opening <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In embodiments in which the reclosable pour system crosses a fold junction such that it is located on two adjacent walls of the container, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the reclosable pour system <b>10</b> can alternatively be reopened as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C-5E</figref>. To open the reclosable pour system in this manner, flap <b>11</b> is pushed upwards, thereby causing the portion of flap <b>11</b> located on outer top panel <b>69</b> to pivot upwards around flap hinge <b>13</b>, while the portion of flap <b>11</b> located on outer front panel <b>54</b> slides upwards in relation to tab <b>15</b>. When flap <b>11</b> has been slid sufficiently far upwards, it will slide past tab <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>), thereby allowing the portion of flap <b>11</b> located on the front panel of the container to pivot outwards to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, thus uncovering pour opening <b>14</b>. The pour system can also be reclosed in the same manner, i.e., by sliding the flap behind the tab. One advantage of this embodiment is that the tab does not need to be bendable, nor is a tab hinge needed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The containers are useful for containing and dispensing various materials, e.g., pourable materials such as some pet foods and litters, e.g., cat litter.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further aspect, the invention provides methods for manufacturing containers. The methods comprise scoring, cutting, and/or folding unitary blanks to define a series of panels and fold lines. In one embodiment, a container, such as the container of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is formed from a unitary blank that is scored, cut, and/or folded to define a series of panels and fold lines. The blank can be constructed of any of foldable sheet material suitable for containing the desired material to be placed within the container. Such materials are well known within the art and include plastic, paperboard, and corrugated cardboard. In certain embodiments, the blank will also possess instructions for manufacturing a container from the blank, such as instructions relating to where and how to cut the blank, where and how to fold the blank, and where and how to apply adhesive to the blank. The blank can be cut, scored, and/or folded in any suitable manner to provide a container with a reclosable pour system when the blank has been properly folded and assembled. In certain embodiments, the blank is produced such that the area of the reclosable pour system comprises two or more overlapping panels comprising an inner panel (i.e., the panel nearer the interior of the container) and an outer panel (i.e., the panel further from the interior of the container). Preferably, the inner panel comprises the tab and the outer panel comprises the flap.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One example of a unitary blank of the present invention can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, blank <b>40</b> possesses three side panels <b>41</b>-<b>43</b>, which are adjacent to one another and separated by from one another by longitudinal fold lines <b>66</b> and <b>67</b>. Blank <b>40</b> also possesses top panels <b>44</b>-<b>46</b>, which are adjacent to side panels <b>41</b>-<b>43</b>, respectively, and separated from side panels <b>41</b>-<b>43</b> by horizontal fold lines <b>56</b>-<b>58</b>. Blank <b>40</b> also possesses bottom panels <b>47</b>-<b>49</b>, which are adjacent to side panels <b>41</b>-<b>43</b>, respectively, and separated from side panels <b>41</b>-<b>43</b> by horizontal fold lines <b>61</b>-<b>63</b>. Blank <b>40</b> further possesses inner front panel <b>53</b>, which is adjacent to side panel <b>41</b> and is separated from side panel <b>41</b> by longitudinal fold line <b>65</b>. Inner front panel <b>53</b> is further adjacent to bottom panel <b>50</b>, from which it is separated by horizontal fold line <b>60</b>, and inner top panel <b>51</b>, from which it is separated by horizontal fold line <b>55</b>. Blank <b>40</b> further possesses outer front panel <b>54</b>, which is adjacent to side panel <b>43</b> and is separated from side panel <b>43</b> by longitudinal fold line <b>68</b>. Outer front panel <b>54</b> is further adjacent to bottom panel <b>52</b>, from which it is separated by horizontal fold line <b>64</b>, and outer top panel <b>69</b>, from which it is separated by horizontal fold line <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Pour opening <b>14</b> is located within inner front panel <b>53</b> and inner top panel <b>51</b>, traversing horizontal fold line <b>55</b>, which separates those two panels. Tab <b>15</b> is located along an edge of pour opening <b>14</b> on inner front panel <b>53</b>, such that tab <b>15</b> protrudes into pour opening <b>14</b>. Tab <b>15</b> is connected to the edge of pour opening <b>14</b> via tab hinge <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Flap <b>11</b> is located within outer front panel <b>54</b> and outer top panel <b>69</b>, traversing horizontal fold line <b>59</b>, which separates those two panels. Hinge flap <b>13</b> is located along an edge of flap <b>11</b> that lies within outer top panel <b>69</b>. Separation line <b>75</b> is located along all remaining edges of flap <b>11</b>. Separation line <b>75</b> allows flap <b>11</b> to be partially separated from outer front panel <b>54</b> and outer top panel <b>69</b> so that flap <b>11</b> can be pivotably opened and closed through flap hinge <b>13</b>. Separation line <b>75</b> can be a perforation, scoring, or full cut. Hinge flap <b>13</b> connects flap <b>11</b> to the container after the flap is separated along separation line <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Top panels <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> also possess cutout areas <b>70</b> and <b>71</b>, respectively, to accommodate the opening of flap <b>11</b> at flap hinge <b>13</b> when the container is properly folded and assembled. Top panel <b>46</b> also possesses handle cutout <b>72</b> to accommodate a handle, which can be attached to attachment area <b>73</b> of top panel <b>44</b>. The handle could be any type suitable for the desired container use. Such handles are well known in the art and include plastic, cardboard, and rope handles. The handle can also be attached by any suitable means, including gluing, taping, stapling, or the use of slots and tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to assemble the container from blank <b>40</b>, blank <b>40</b> is folded at right angles at all horizontal fold lines <b>55</b>-<b>64</b> and longitudinal fold lines <b>65</b>-<b>68</b>, such that side panels <b>41</b> and <b>43</b> are substantially parallel to one another and are each substantially perpendicular to side panel <b>42</b>, inner front panel <b>53</b>, and outer front panel <b>54</b>, with outer front panel <b>54</b> overlaid on inner front panel <b>53</b>. Inner front panel <b>53</b> and outer front panel <b>54</b> are then adhered to one another by any suitable means, including gluing, taping, stapling, or the use of slots and tabs. Bottom panels <b>47</b>-<b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are then adhered to one another in a suitable manner to cause bottom panels <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> to be substantially overlaid on one another and to provide a sift proof bottom for the container. Top panels <b>44</b>-<b>46</b>, inner top panel <b>51</b>, and outer top panel <b>69</b> are then adhered to one another in a suitable manner to cause bottom panels <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> to be substantially overlaid on one another, to cause inner top panel <b>51</b> and outer top panel <b>69</b> to be within the confines of the container and adhered to the inside portion of the top wall of the container, and to provide a sift proof top for the container.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In certain embodiments, the reclosable hinge pour flap must be initially opened by separation of the flap from the container wall before use. To initially open the reclosable pour system, flap <b>11</b> is separated from outer front panel <b>54</b> and outer top panel <b>69</b> along separation line <b>75</b>, thereby freeing flap <b>11</b> from front panel <b>54</b> and outer top panel <b>69</b>, except for along flap hinge <b>13</b>. The container manufacturer, an end user, or any other intermediate entity can perform this separation step. In certain other embodiments, separation line <b>75</b> comprises a complete cut, such that the separation is essentially complete prior to container assembly, making the step of separating the flap from the container unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another aspect, the invention provides methods of manufacturing containers having a reclosable pour system of the invention. The methods comprise providing a unitary blank as described above, and producing a container from the unitary blank by folding the unitary blank and adhering the overlapping panels to form the container. In certain embodiments, the unitary blank further comprises manufacturing instructions printed on the blank, and wherein the folding is performed as directed by the manufacturing instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another aspect, the invention provides containers manufactured using the methods of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another aspect, the invention provides methods of obtaining products from a container comprising a reclosable pour system as described above. The methods comprise releasing the flap from its latchably reclosed position over the pour opening, pouring a flowable material from the container through the pour opening, and reclosing the container.
