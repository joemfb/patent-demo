<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The amount of light incident on a photoelectric conversion element is increased while stray light from a backlight below a light-transmitting substrate is prevented from being incident on the photoelectric conversion element. A light-blocking film is formed with a color filter covering a photoelectric conversion element over a light-transmitting substrate and a color filter covering a photoelectric conversion element in an adjacent pixel which overlap each other at the side with respect to the direction in which light travels. In addition, by providing a microlens over the color filter, light which is conventionally not detected is collected to a photoelectric conversion element, and accordingly the amount of light incident on the photoelectric conversion element is increased.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One embodiment of the present invention relates to a photodetector including a photodiode, and a display device including a photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1 discloses a liquid crystal display device having an input function using a photosensor. Specifically, the liquid crystal display device includes a switching element and a photoelectric conversion element over a light-transmitting substrate. The thickness of the light-transmitting, substrate is 70 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. The light-transmitting substrate having such a thickness prevents stray light from a backlight below the light-transmitting substrate from being incident on the photoelectric conversion element. On the other hand, light from an object to be detected which is located over the photoelectric conversion element is incident on the photoelectric conversion element.</p>

</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The photosensitivity of a photoelectric conversion element (photodiode) increases as the amount of incident light increases. However, in the case where a photodiode is formed in a display portion, it is difficult to increase the area of a light receiving portion of the photodiode in view of an aperture ratio. It is therefore difficult to ensure a sufficient amount of light incident on a photodiode, and it is difficult to increase photosensitivity. In addition, in the case where light from a backlight, or part of light (oblique light) from an object to be detected, is incident on a photoelectric conversion element, light that should not be detected is also detected, which results in a decrease in photodetection accuracy of the photoelectric conversion element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above problems, an embodiment of the present invention discloses a structure capable of preventing light (stray light) from a backlight from being incident on a photodiode and capable of preventing oblique light (stray light) from an object to be detected from being incident on a photodiode, while increasing the amount of light incident on a photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An embodiment of the present invention is a photodetector including a first light-blocking layer and a second light-blocking layer over a light-transmitting substrate; a first photodiode over the first light-blocking layer; a second photodiode over the second light-blocking layer; a first color filter covering the first photodiode; a second color filter covering the second photodiode; a third light-blocking layer formed with the first color filter and the second color filter between the first photodiode and the second photodiode; and lenses over the first photodiode and the second photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A photodetector of the present invention includes a first photodiode and a second photodiode over a light-transmitting substrate; a first color filter covering the first photodiode; a second color filter covering the second photodiode; a first microlens over the first color filter; a second microlens over the second color filter; and a light-blocking layer formed with the first color filter and the second color filter between the first photodiode and the second photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A photodetector of the present invention includes a first photodiode and a second photodiode over a light-transmitting substrate; a first microlens over the first photodiode; a second microlens over the second photodiode; a first color filter covering the first microlens; a second color filter covering the second microlens; and a light-blocking layer formed with the first color filter and the second color filter between the first photodiode and the second photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A photodetector of the present invention includes a first light-blocking layer and a second light-blocking layer over a light-transmitting substrate; a light-transmitting insulating film over and in contact with the light-transmitting substrate, the first light-blocking layer, and the second light-blocking, layer; a first photodiode over the first light-blocking layer with the light-transmitting insulating film interposed therebetween; a second photodiode over the second light-blocking layer with the light-transmitting insulating film interposed therebetween; a first color filter covering the first photodiode; a second color filter covering the second photodiode; a first microlens over the first color filter; a second microlens over the second color filter; and a third light-blocking layer formed with the first color filter and the second color filter arranged side by side between the first photodiode and the second photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A photodetector of the present invention includes a first light-blocking layer and a second light-blocking layer over a light-transmitting substrate; a light-transmitting insulating film over and in contact with the light-transmitting substrate, the first light-blocking layer, and the second light-blocking layer; a first photodiode over the first light-blocking layer with the light-transmitting insulating film interposed therebetween; a second photodiode over the second light-blocking layer with the light-transmitting insulating film interposed therebetween; a first microlens over the first photodiode; a second microlens over the second photodiode; a first color filter covering the first microlens; a second color filter covering the second microlens; and a third light-blocking layer formed with the first color filter and the second color filter arranged side by side between the first photodiode and the second photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A display device of the present invention includes a backlight; a first light-transmitting substrate over the backlight; a liquid crystal layer over the first light-transmitting substrate; a second light-transmitting substrate over the liquid crystal layer; a first light-blocking layer and a second light-blocking layer over the second light-transmitting substrate; a first photodiode over the first light-blocking layer; a second photodiode over the second light-blocking layer; a first color filter covering the first photodiode; a second color filter covering the second photodiode; a first microlens over the first color filter; a second microlens over the second color filter; and a third light-blocking layer formed with the first color filter and the second color filter between the first photodiode and the second photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A display device of the present invention includes a first light-transmitting substrate; a light-emitting layer over the first light-transmitting substrate; a second light-transmitting substrate over the light-emitting layer; a first photodiode over a first light-blocking layer; a second photodiode over a second light-blocking layer; a first color filter covering the first photodiode; a second color filter covering the second photodiode; a first microlens over the first color filter; a second microlens over the second color filter; and a third light-blocking layer formed with the first color filter and the second color filter between the first photodiode and the second photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When a microlens with an appropriate focus is formed in a pixel portion, light transmitted through the microlens is collected to each photodiode, which enables even low-intensity incident light to be detected with high sensitivity. In addition, the increase in the amount of light collected makes it possible to reduce the area of a photosensor and decrease the circuit area.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, light not having a focus at a photodiode (stray light) is blocked by a light-blocking layer including color filters. In other words, oblique light from above the first photodiode is blocked by the third light-blocking layer, and oblique light from above the second photodiode is blocked by the third light-blocking layer. Therefore, the first photodiode and the second photodiode do not detect light over the second photodiode and light over the first photodiode, respectively. The first photodiode and the second photodiode can accurately detect light that should be detected; thus, the photosensitivity of the first photodiode and the second photodiode can be improved.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, an embodiment and examples of the present invention will be described. Note that the present invention can be carried out in many different modes, and it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that modes and details of the present invention can be modified in various ways without departing from the purpose and the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the description in the embodiment and examples.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Embodiment 1)</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A photodetector which is one mode of the present invention will be described (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the photodetector.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The photodetector which is one mode of the present invention includes a first light-blocking layer <b>2</b> and a second light-blocking layer <b>3</b> over a substrate <b>1</b> having a light-transmitting property, a first photodiode <b>4</b> over the first light-blocking layer <b>2</b>, a second photodiode <b>5</b> over the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b>, a first color filter <b>6</b> covering the first photodiode <b>4</b>, and a second color filter <b>7</b> covering the second photodiode <b>5</b>. The photodetector includes a third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> formed with the first color filter <b>6</b> and the second color filter <b>7</b> between the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b>. The photodetector also includes microlenses <b>9</b> over the first color filter <b>6</b> and the second color filter <b>7</b> with a third light-transmitting insulating film <b>13</b> interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to collect light to the photodiodes, plano-convex lenses are formed as the microlenses <b>9</b> with a material having a higher refractive index than the surroundings. Alternatively, a microlens may be formed with two cylindrical lenses oriented perpendicular to each other. Further alternatively, in the case of using a material having a lower refractive index than the surroundings, a concave lens may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If a microlens is formed such that the lens covers the whole area of each pixel, the optical path of backlight light emitted through an aperture area is changed, which results in a distortion of display images. The microlenses <b>9</b> are preferably formed only directly above photodiodes so as not to adversely affect display images.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The microlenses <b>9</b> can be set to have an optimal focal length by appropriately selecting their shape or material. The thicknesses of a second light-transmitting insulating film <b>12</b>, the third light-transmitting insulating film <b>13</b>, and the color filters are adjusted so that the first photodiode <b>4</b> or the second photodiode <b>5</b> is located at the focal point.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note that the microlenses may be formed under the color filters (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). In that case, it is preferable that the thickness of the second light-transmitting insulating film <b>12</b> be appropriately adjusted depending on the focal length.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> is formed with the first color filter <b>6</b> and the second color filter <b>7</b> which are arranged side by side. In other words, one end of the first color filter <b>6</b> and one end of the second color filter <b>7</b> are arranged side by side. This portion serves as the third light-blocking layer <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A fourth light-blocking layer <b>15</b> formed with a third color filter <b>10</b> and the first color filter <b>6</b> may be provided on a side of the first photodiode <b>4</b> which is opposite to the side where the third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> is provided. One end of the third color filter <b>10</b> and the other end of the first color filter <b>6</b> are arranged side by side, and this portion serves as the fourth light-blocking layer <b>15</b>. In addition, a fifth light-blocking layer <b>16</b> formed with the third color filter <b>10</b> and the second color filter <b>7</b> may be provided on a side of the second photodiode <b>5</b> which is opposite to the side where the third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> is provided. One end of the third color filter <b>10</b> and the other end of the second color filter <b>7</b> are arranged side by side, and this portion serves as the fifth light-blocking layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b> may be provided over and in contact with the substrate <b>1</b>, the first light-blocking layer <b>2</b>, and the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b>. The first photodiode <b>4</b> may be formed over the first light-blocking layer <b>2</b> with the first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b> interposed therebetween. The second photodiode <b>5</b> may be formed over the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b> with the first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b> interposed therebetween. The third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> may be formed in contact with the first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second light-transmitting insulating films <b>12</b> may be formed over the first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b>, the first photodiode <b>4</b>, and the second photodiode <b>5</b>. The first color filter <b>6</b> may be formed over the first photodiode <b>4</b> with the second light-transmitting insulating film <b>12</b> interposed therebetween. The second color filter <b>7</b> may be formed over the second photodiode <b>5</b> with the second light-transmitting insulating film <b>12</b> interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A photodetection method using a photodetector which is one mode of the present invention will be described below (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Light <b>21</b> emitted from a backlight <b>20</b> below the substrate <b>1</b> having a light-transmitting property passes through the substrate <b>1</b> and the first color filter <b>6</b> or the second color filter <b>7</b> and is reflected off a portion <b>22</b> to be detected. Light <b>23</b> and light <b>24</b> reflected off the portion <b>22</b> to be detected are collected by the microlens and detected by the first photodiode <b>4</b>. In addition, light <b>25</b> and light <b>26</b> reflected off the portion <b>22</b> to be detected are collected by the microlens and detected by the second photodiode <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Note that the light <b>24</b> and the light <b>26</b> reflected are not detected in the absence of the microlenses because the light <b>24</b> and the light <b>26</b> do not enter the first photodiode <b>4</b> or the second photodiode <b>5</b>. On the other hand, by using the structure of this embodiment, the light <b>24</b> and the light <b>26</b> are collected to the photodiodes by the microlenses <b>9</b> and can be detected by the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Part of the light <b>21</b> from the backlight becomes light <b>27</b> directed to the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b>. However, the light <b>27</b> is absorbed or reflected by the first light-blocking layer <b>2</b> and the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b>. Therefore, the light <b>27</b> is not incident on the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b> and hence is not detected. On the other hand, in the structure in Patent Document 1, it is possible that the light <b>27</b> is detected by the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b> because the first light-blocking layer <b>2</b> and the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b> are not provided.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Part of light reflected from the portion <b>22</b> to be detected becomes light <b>28</b> and light <b>29</b>. Each of the light <b>28</b> and the light <b>29</b> is oblique light. The light <b>28</b> is obliquely directed to the second photodiode <b>5</b>. The light <b>29</b> is obliquely directed to the first photodiode <b>4</b>. However, the light <b>28</b> is blocked by the third light-blocking layer <b>8</b>. Thus, the light <b>28</b> is not incident on the second photodiode <b>5</b> and hence is not detected. The light <b>29</b> is blocked by the third light-blocking layer <b>8</b>. Thus, the light <b>29</b> is not incident on the first photodiode <b>4</b> and hence is not detected. On the other hand, in the structure in Patent Document <b>1</b>, the third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> is not provided, and therefore the light <b>28</b> is detected by the second photodiode <b>5</b> and the light <b>29</b> is detected by the first photodiode <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> between the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b> is formed with the first color filter <b>6</b> and the second color filter <b>7</b> which are arranged side by side. The third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> can be formed with a metal film or a resin film that has a black material dispersed or black fine particles dispersed therein. In that case, however, the number of manufacturing steps is significantly increased. In one mode of the present invention, the third light-blocking layer is formed with the first color filter <b>6</b> and the second color filter <b>7</b> which are arranged side by side, and thus the number of manufacturing steps is not increased. In addition, the light <b>21</b> can be colored by the first color filter <b>6</b>, the second color filter <b>7</b>, and the third color filter <b>10</b>, which enables the photodetector to be used as a color sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b> are formed over and in contact with the first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b> and the third light-blocking layer is formed over and in contact with the first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b>, the oblique lights <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> can be reliably blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Components of the photodetector will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The substrate <b>1</b> transmits visible light and preferably has a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m. For example, a plastic substrate that has flexibility and transmits visible light, or an inorganic material substrate that transmits visible light, can be used. Examples of the material of the plastic substrate include: polyester typified by polyethylene terephthalate (PET); polyether sulfone (PES); polyethylene naphthalate (PEN); polycarbonate (PC); polyether ether ketone (PEEK); polysulfone (PSF); polyetherimide (PEI); polyarylate (PAR); polybutylene terephthalate (PBT); polyimide; acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin; polyvinyl chloride; polypropylene; polyvinyl acetate; and acrylic resin. Examples of the inorganic material substrate include a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first light-blocking layer <b>2</b> prevents the light <b>27</b> from the backlight <b>20</b> from being incident on the first photodiode <b>4</b>. The second light-blocking layer <b>3</b> prevents the light <b>27</b> from the backlight <b>20</b> from being incident on the second photodiode <b>5</b>. The first light-blocking layer <b>2</b> and the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b> can be island-shaped. The first light-blocking layer <b>2</b> and the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b> are formed using a material capable of blocking light, by a sputtering method, a CVD method, or a coating method. As the material capable of blocking light, for example, a material mainly containing chromium, a resin containing a carbon black, or a resin containing a black pigment such as titanium lower oxide whose oxidation number is smaller than that of titanium dioxide can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first photodiode <b>4</b> detects the light <b>23</b> and the light <b>24</b> which are reflected by the portion <b>22</b> to be detected and are collected by the microlens. The second photodiode <b>5</b> detects the light <b>25</b> and the light <b>26</b> which are reflected by the portion <b>22</b> to be detected and are collected by the microlens.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b> are each a PIN diode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> or <b>3</b>C) or a PN diode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> or <b>4</b>B). The first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b> are formed using a semiconductor film. A PIN diode includes a region of p-type conductivity (a p-type layer <b>31</b>), a region of i-type conductivity (an i-type layer <b>32</b>), and a region of n-type conductivity (an n-type layer <b>33</b>). A PN diode includes a p-type layer <b>31</b> and an n-type layer <b>33</b>. The p-type layer <b>31</b>, the n-type layer <b>33</b>, and the i-type layer <b>32</b> are formed using a film of a semiconductor such as silicon or formed using an oxide semiconductor film containing ZnO or the like. The semiconductor film may be amorphous, microcrystalline, crystalline, or single-crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first color filter <b>6</b>, the second color filter <b>7</b>, and the third color filter <b>10</b> are color filters which transmit light of red, blue, or green. Two or more different color filters which overlap each other with respect to the direction in which light travels transmit very little visible light and function as a light-blocking film. In addition, the color filters color the light <b>21</b> from the backlight <b>20</b>. The colored light is reflected by the portion <b>22</b> to be detected and becomes the lights <b>23</b> to <b>26</b>, the light <b>28</b>, and the light <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The lights <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> pass through the first color filter <b>6</b> and are then detected by the first photodiode <b>4</b>. The lights <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> pass through the second color filter <b>7</b> and are then detected by the second photodiode <b>5</b>. The first color filter <b>6</b> and the second color filter <b>7</b> cover the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first color filter <b>6</b>, the second color filter <b>7</b>, and the third color filter <b>10</b> are selectively formed by photolithography after applying an organic resin such as an acrylic-based resin in which a pigment is dispersed. Alternatively, the first color filter <b>6</b>, the second color filter <b>7</b>, and the third color filter <b>10</b> can be selectively formed by etching after applying a polyimide-based resin in which a pigment is dispersed. Alternatively, the first color filter <b>6</b>, the second color filter <b>7</b>, and the third color filter <b>10</b> can be selectively formed by a droplet discharge method such as an inkjet method.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> prevents the oblique light <b>28</b> and the oblique light <b>29</b> of the light reflected from the portion <b>22</b> to be detected from being detected by the second photodiode <b>5</b> and the first photodiode <b>4</b>, respectively.

Each of the second light-transmitting insulating film and the third light-transmitting insulating film is formed by a plasma CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like using a single layer or a stacked layer of any of the following films: a silicon film; a silicon oxide film; a silicon oxynitride film; a silicon nitride oxide film; and a film containing an organic material such as an organic resin with high planarity. Note that the second light-transmitting insulating films <b>12</b> and the third light-transmitting insulating film <b>13</b> preferably have high planarity because the microlenses are formed thereover.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The microlenses collect light, which is reflected from the portion <b>22</b> to be detected, to the photodiodes. Because the amount of light incident on the photodiodes increases, the sensitivity of the photodiodes can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A material for forming the microlenses may be any material that has high transmittance and is easy to process. An inorganic film such as a silicon film, a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film, or a resin can be used. Alternatively, a lens-shaped cavity may be provided between layers, and may be filled with air or may be vacuum. In the case of a convex lens, a material is selected such that the lens has a high relative refractive index (higher than 1.0) with respect to a material stacked thereon. In the case of a concave lens, a material is selected such that the lens has a low relative refractive index (lower than 1.0) with respect to a material stacked thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, in the case of forming a microlens with a resin, a columnar photoresist pattern is manufactured by photolithography, and then the substrate is heated to make the resist flow and a lens shape is formed by surface tension by a reflow method. Alternatively, a small amount of a resin material may be dropped to a predetermined position by using an inkjet printer head, and a lens shape may be manufactured by surface tension.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A microlens can also be formed by drawing with an electron beam such that a material is partially melted and the dielectric constant is changed. In the case of manufacturing a lens on a counter substrate side, the lens can be formed by forming a spherical lens shape (with a specified value of curvature radius) on glass and attaching it to another glass.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A metal film is formed over the light-transmitting insulating film <b>50</b>. The metal film is processed by a photolithography method and an etching method to form the gate electrode <b>60</b> over the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> with the gate insulating film interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Impurity ions which impart p-type or n-type conductivity are selectively added to the semiconductor layer <b>101</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>102</b>, and the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> to form n-type layers and p-type layers, and a source region and a drain region.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Next, the light-transmitting insulating film <b>51</b> is formed. After contact holes are formed in the light-transmitting insulating film <b>51</b>, the electrode <b>43</b>, the electrode <b>44</b>, the electrode <b>48</b>, the electrode <b>49</b>, the source electrode <b>61</b>, and the drain electrode <b>62</b> are formed.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Next, the alignment film <b>53</b> is formed and then subjected to rubbing treatment. The alignment film <b>53</b> is not necessarily formed if there is another way to align the liquid crystal molecules in one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The spacer is formed. As the spacer, a columnar spacer is formed by applying an organic resin and then processing the organic resin by photolithography and etching. Alternatively, spherical spacers are scattered. Alternatively, the spacer may be formed on either the first substrate <b>1</b> or the counter substrate <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The liquid crystal layer <b>54</b> is formed by dropping liquid crystal or the like. Injection of the liquid crystal layer <b>54</b> may be performed by a dispenser method (dripping method) or a dipping method (pumping method). Alternatively, after the substrate <b>1</b> and the counter substrate <b>57</b> are bonded to each other, vacuum injection may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The counter electrode <b>56</b> and the alignment film <b>55</b> are formed on the counter substrate <b>57</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">An electroluminescent display device (hereinafter referred to as an &#x201c;EL display device&#x201d;) which is one mode of the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example of a cross-sectional view of an EL display element with an EL element (for example, an organic EL element, an inorganic EL element, or an EL element including an organic substance and an inorganic substance) used as a light-emitting element.

The photodetection method of the display device of Example 1 and that of the light-emitting device of Example 2 are also different in that the display device of Example 1 uses the backlight, while the light-emitting device of Example 2 does not.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The photodetection method in the EL display device of this example is basically similar to Embodiment 1 and Example 1. Note that light emitted from not a backlight but an EL element is reflected by a portion to be detected. The light reflected by the portion to be detected is collected by microlenses and detected by the first photodiode <b>4</b> and the second photodiode <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The light-emitting device which is one mode of the present invention includes a photodetection portion and a display portion. The photodetection portion has a structure similar to those in Embodiment 1 and Example 1. Note that the first light-transmitting insulating film <b>11</b> and a first electrode <b>70</b> in Example 1 do not necessarily need to have a light-transmitting property in this example. In addition, over the color filters, the alignment film <b>53</b> is not provided and a light-transmitting insulating film <b>75</b> is formed as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The display portion includes, over the substrate <b>1</b>, the semiconductor element <b>65</b>, the first electrode <b>70</b> connected to the semiconductor element <b>65</b>, a partition <b>71</b> formed using an insulating film covering the ends of the first electrode <b>70</b>, a light-emitting layer <b>72</b> over the first electrode <b>70</b>, a second electrode <b>73</b> over the light-emitting layer <b>72</b>, and the second color filter <b>7</b> over the second electrode <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The semiconductor element <b>65</b> is the same as that of Example 1. The semiconductor element <b>65</b> controls the amount of current to be supplied to the light-emitting layer <b>72</b>. The display portion is provided with an additional semiconductor element which is not illustrated. One of the source and drain regions of the additional semiconductor element is connected to the gate electrode <b>60</b> of the semiconductor element <b>65</b>; thus, the additional semiconductor element serves as a switch for controlling the operation of the semiconductor element <b>65</b>. In addition, a storage capacitor for maintaining the potential of the gate electrode <b>60</b> of the semiconductor element <b>65</b> may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The EL element is formed by stacking the first electrode <b>70</b>, the light-emitting layer <b>72</b>, and the second electrode <b>73</b>. Over the light-transmitting insulating film <b>52</b>, the first electrode <b>70</b> is provided, and the partition <b>71</b> is provided so as to cover the ends of the first electrode <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The partition <b>71</b> is used for partitioning the pixel portion. The partition <b>71</b> is provided between adjacent pixels. The partition <b>71</b> is formed using an inorganic or organic insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The light-emitting layer <b>72</b> is interposed between the first electrode <b>70</b> and the second electrode <b>73</b> and emits light when supplied with a current. The light-emitting layer <b>72</b> preferably emits white light. The light-emitting layer <b>72</b> may be formed using a known organic or inorganic material. In addition, the first electrode <b>70</b> does not necessarily need to be transparent and preferably reflects light which is emitted from the light-emitting layer <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The second color filter <b>7</b> is the same as those in Embodiment 1 and Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In this example, a backlight is not used, and thus the first light-blocking layer <b>2</b>, the second light-blocking layer <b>3</b>, and the light-blocking layer <b>58</b> are not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A method for manufacturing the light-emitting device will be described below. The method of manufacturing the light-emitting device is the same as that in Example 1 except for the steps performed after the first electrode <b>70</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">An organic resin film or an inorganic insulating film is formed over the first electrode <b>70</b> and processed by photolithography and etching to form the partition <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The light-emitting layer <b>72</b> is formed over the first electrode <b>70</b> by a vacuum evaporation method, a droplet discharge method, or the like.</p>

The second color filter <b>7</b> is also formed in the groove described above. The third light-blocking layer <b>8</b> is formed so as to fill the groove. Similarly, the third color filter <b>10</b> is formed. The fifth light-blocking layer <b>16</b> formed with the second color filter <b>7</b> and the third color filter <b>10</b> is formed in the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Through the above steps, the light-emitting device can be manufactured. The light-emitting layer <b>72</b> can be degraded by moisture; therefore, a sealing member may be additionally provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">An example of a writing board (blackboard, whiteboard, or the like) using a display portion that includes a photosensor will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">For example, the display portion including a photosensor is provided at the position of a panel <b>9696</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The panel <b>9696</b> includes a photosensor and a display element.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Here, it is possible to freely write down letters or the like on the surface of the panel <b>9696</b>, with a marker pen or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Note that it is easy to erase letters if the letters are written with a marker pen or the like which does not include a fixing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In addition, the surface of the panel <b>9696</b> preferably has adequate smoothness in order that the ink of the marker pen may easily be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">For example, the surface of the panel <b>9696</b> is adequately smooth if made using a glass substrate or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, a transparent synthetic resin sheet or the like may be attached to the surface of the panel <b>9696</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As a synthetic resin, acrylic or the like is preferably used, for example. In this case, the surface of the synthetic resin sheet is preferably made smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In addition, since the panel <b>9696</b> includes a display element, the panel <b>9696</b> can display a particular image and at the same time, it is possible to write down letters or the like on the surface of the panel <b>9696</b> with a marker pen.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Further, since the panel <b>9696</b> includes the photosensor, letters written with a marker pen can be read and printed out if the panel <b>9696</b> is connected to a printer or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Furthermore, since the panel <b>9696</b> includes the photosensor and the display element, by writing down letters or the like or drawing a graphic or the like on the surface of the panel <b>9696</b> while the panel <b>9696</b> displays an image, the panel <b>9696</b> can display a trail of a marker, which has been read by the photosensor, combined with the image.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Note that sensing with resistive touch sensors, capacitive touch sensors, or the like can be performed only at the same time as writing with a marker pen or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Meanwhile, sensing with a photosensor is superior in that it can be performed anytime even long after writing has been done with a marker pen or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">This example can be implemented by being freely combined with Embodiment 1 and other examples.</p>
