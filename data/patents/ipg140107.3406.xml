<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aspects of the present disclosure relate to ultrasonic transducers, and, more particularly, to methods of forming a connection with a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer defining an air-backed cavity, and associated apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some micromachined ultrasonic transducers (MUTs) may be configured, for example, as a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (pMUT) as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,449,821 assigned to Research Triangle Institute, also the assignee of the present disclosure, which is also incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The formation of pMUT device, such as the pMUT device defining an air-backed cavity as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,449,821, may involve the formation of an electrically-conductive connection between the first electrode (i.e., the bottom electrode) of the transducer device, wherein the first electrode is disposed within the air-backed cavity of the pMUT device, and the conformal metal layer(s) applied to the air-backed cavity for providing subsequent connectivity, for example, to an integrated circuit (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;) or a flex cable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some instances, one or more pMUTs, for example, arranged in a transducer array, may be incorporated into the end of an elongate catheter or endoscope. In those instances, for a forward-looking arrangement, the transducer array of pMUT devices must be arranged such that the plane of the piezoelectric element of each pMUT device is disposed perpendicularly to the axis of the catheter/endoscope. Where the transducer array is a one-dimensional (1D) array, external signal connections to the pMUT devices may be accomplished by way of a flex cable spanning the series of pMUT devices in the transducer array so as to be in electrical engagement with (i.e., bonded to) each pMUT device via the conformal metal layer thereof. For instance, in one exemplary 1D transducer array <b>100</b> (e.g., 1&#xd7;64 elements), pMUT devices forming the array elements <b>120</b> may be attached directly to a flex cable <b>140</b>, with the flex cable <b>140</b> including one electrically-conductive signal lead per pMUT device, plus a ground lead. For a forward-looking transducer array, the flex cable <b>140</b> is bent about the opposing ends of the transducer array such that the flex cable <b>140</b> can be routed through the lumen of the catheter/endoscope which, in one instance, may comprise an ultrasound probe. However, for a forward-looking transducer array in a relatively small catheter/endoscope, such an arrangement may be difficult to implement due to the severe bend requirement for the flex cable (i.e., about 90 degrees) in order for the transducer array to be disposed within the lumen of the relatively small catheter/endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, for a forward-looking two-dimensional (2D) transducer array, signal interconnection with the individual pMUT devices may also be difficult. That is, in an exemplary 2D transducer array (e.g. 14&#xd7;14 to 40&#xd7;40 elements), there may be many more required signal interconnections with the pMUT devices, as compared to a 1D transducer array. As such, more wires and/or multilayer flex cable assemblies may be required to interconnect with all of the pMUT devices in the transducer array. However, as the number of wires and/or flex cable assemblies increases, the more difficult it becomes to bend the larger amount of signal interconnections about the ends of the transducer device to achieve the 90 degree bend required to integrate the transducer array into a catheter/endoscope. Accordingly, such limitations may undesirably limit the minimum size (i.e., diameter) of the catheter/endoscope that can readily be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, there exists a need in the ultrasonic transducer art, particularly with respect to a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (&#x201c;pMUT&#x201d;) having an air-backed cavity, for improved methods of forming an electrically-conductive connection between the pMUT device and, for example, an integrated circuit (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;) or a flex cable. More particularly, it would be desirable for such an electrically-conductive connection with the pMUT device to be configured to avoid bending of the flex cable/wiring about the pMUT device upon integration thereof in the tip of a probe/catheter/endoscope used, for example, in cardiovascular devices and intravascular ultrasound devices. Such solutions should desirably be effective for 2D transducer arrays, particularly 2D pMUT transducer arrays, but should also be applicable to 1D transducer arrays, and should desirably allow greater scalability in the size of the probe/catheter/endoscope having such transducer arrays integrated therein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above and other needs are met by aspects of the present disclosure, wherein one such aspect relates to a method of forming a connection with a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer apparatus, with the piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer apparatus comprising a transducer device disposed on a dielectric layer on a device substrate, wherein the transducer device includes a piezoelectric material disposed between a first electrode and a second electrode. The device substrate and the dielectric layer define a first via extending to the first electrode. The first via is substantially filled with a first conductive material. The transducer device further includes a support member engaged with the device substrate and the first conductive material.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present disclosure now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all aspects of the disclosure are shown. Indeed, the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the aspects set forth herein; rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Aspects of the present disclosure are generally applicable to ultrasonic transducers, though particular aspects are particularly directed to a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (&#x201c;pMUT&#x201d;) having an air-backed cavity. More particularly, aspects of the present disclosure are directed to improved methods of forming an electrically-conductive connection between a pMUT device and, for example, an integrated circuit (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;), a flex cable, or a cable assembly, whereby individual signal leads extend parallel to the operational direction of the transducer array to engage the respective pMUT devices in the transducer array (see generally, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In such aspects, a representative pMUT device, implemented in both 1D and 2D transducer arrays, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may comprise a transducer device <b>200</b> disposed on a dielectric layer <b>220</b> on a device substrate <b>240</b>, wherein the transducer device <b>200</b> includes a piezoelectric material <b>260</b> disposed between a first electrode <b>280</b> and a second electrode <b>300</b>. The device substrate <b>240</b> and the dielectric layer <b>220</b> define a first via <b>320</b> extending to the first electrode <b>280</b>, wherein the first via <b>320</b> is substantially filled with a first conductive material <b>340</b>. The transducer device <b>200</b> further includes a support member <b>360</b> (e.g., a silicon-on-insulator substrate) engaged with the device substrate <b>240</b> and the first conductive material <b>340</b>, and defining a second via <b>380</b> extending thereto. The second via <b>380</b> has a second conductive material <b>400</b> disposed thereon, with the second conductive material <b>400</b> forming an electrically-conductive engagement with the first conductive material <b>340</b>. The second conductive material <b>400</b> extends outwardly of the second via <b>380</b> so as to be accessible externally to the support member <b>360</b>. Such a pMUT transducer device <b>200</b> is disclosed, for example, in co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 61/299,514 (&#x201c;Methods for Forming a Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer, and Associated Apparatuses&#x201d;), also assigned to Research Triangle Institute, and which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In this regard, particular materials that can be implemented for the piezoelectric material <b>260</b> include, for example, ceramics including ZnO, AlN, LiNbO<sub>4</sub>, lead antimony stannate, lead magnesium tantalate, lead nickel tantalate, titanates, tungstates, zirconates, or niobates of lead, barium, bismuth, or strontium, including lead zirconate titanate (Pb(Zr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1-x</sub>)O<sub>3 </sub>(PZT)), lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT), lead niobium zirconate titanate (PNZT), BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, lead magnesium niobate, lead nickel niobate, lead manganese niobate, lead zinc niobate, lead titanate. Piezoelectric polymer materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE), or polyvinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene (PVDF-TFE) can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A method of forming an electrically-conductive connection with a pMUT device, in one such aspect of the present disclosure, is thus schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. In this regard, individual signal leads extending parallel to the operational direction of the transducer array are configured to directly engage the respective pMUT devices in the transducer array. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a connection support substrate <b>420</b> such as, for example, a silicon substrate, may first be bonded using, for instance, an epoxy, an adhesive tape, or other appropriate adhesive material <b>440</b>, to one of the support member <b>360</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b> associated with one or more of the pMUT transducer devices <b>200</b> forming the pMUT array. More particularly, the adhesive material <b>440</b> may initially be applied to the connection support substrate <b>420</b>, and then the connection support substrate <b>420</b> applied to the one of the support member <b>360</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b> so as to be secured thereto by the adhesive material <b>440</b>. In doing so, the second via <b>380</b> may remain unfilled, or may be partially or otherwise incompletely filled with an acoustic material (not shown) so as to allow the piezoelectric material to flex and generate acoustic energy when actuated via the first and second electrodes <b>280</b>, <b>300</b>. In some instances, the adhesive material <b>440</b> may particularly comprise a non-conductive bonding material such as, for example, an SU-8 photoimageable epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The connection support substrate <b>420</b> may then be etched, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to define a third via <b>460</b> extending through the adhesive material <b>440</b> to the second conductive material <b>400</b> using, for example, using a deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) process. In this manner, the second conductive material <b>400</b>, in electrically-conductive engagement with the first electrode <b>280</b>, is exposed through the third via <b>460</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a connective element <b>480</b> may then be bonded to the connection support substrate <b>420</b>, such that the connective element <b>480</b> is inserted into the third via <b>460</b> and into electrically-conductive engagement with the second conductive material <b>400</b>. The connective element <b>480</b> may be bonded to the connection support substrate <b>420</b>, for instance, by a bonding material <b>500</b>, such as an electrically-conductive epoxy, disposed within the third via <b>460</b>, between the connective element <b>480</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b>. The bonding material <b>500</b> can be inserted into the third via <b>460</b> prior to the connective element <b>480</b> being inserted therein, or the bonding material <b>500</b> may be applied to the individual connective element <b>480</b>, prior to insertion thereof into the third via <b>460</b>. In some instances, the connective element <b>480</b> may comprise a fine-gauge wire (e.g. 45 AWG, about 50 &#x3bc;m diameter), wherein the wire may, in some instances, comprise an elongate conductor circumscribed by an insulator. In such instances, the insulator may be configured to provide electrical isolation between the conductor and the connection support substrate <b>420</b>. In other instances, if the wire does not include the insulator, an insulator material (not shown) may be first deposited on the connection support substrate <b>420</b> so as to extend into the third via <b>460</b> and into proximity to the second conductive material <b>400</b>, after etching the connection support substrate <b>420</b> and before bonding the connective element <b>480</b>, so as to electrically isolate the conductor from the connection support substrate <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some aspects, the connective element <b>480</b> may also be bonded to the connection support substrate <b>420</b> with a bonding material <b>520</b> engaged therebetween and externally to the third via <b>460</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the connective element <b>480</b> may be inserted into the connection support substrate <b>420</b> and then fixed thereto with a bonding material <b>520</b>, such as a non-conductive epoxy, applied around the connective element <b>480</b> on the surface of the substrate opposite the adhesive material <b>440</b>. Such a fine-gauge wire may be available, for example, in the form of standard magnet wire, a micro-coaxial cable, or a micro-miniature ribbon cable.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A method of forming an electrically-conductive connection with a pMUT device, in another aspect of the present disclosure, is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>. As previously disclosed, individual signal leads are arranged to extend parallel to the operational direction of the transducer array, while directly engaging the respective pMUT devices in the transducer array. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a connection support substrate <b>540</b> is first etched, for example, using a DRIE process, to define a third via <b>560</b> extending therethrough. A connective element <b>580</b> is then bonded to the connection support substrate <b>540</b>, with the connective element <b>580</b> inserted into and extending through the third via <b>560</b>. In some instances, the connective element <b>580</b> may comprise a fine-gauge wire, wherein the wire may, in some instances, comprise an elongate conductor circumscribed by an insulator. In such instances, the insulator may be configured to provide electrical isolation between the conductor and the connection support substrate <b>540</b>. In other instances, if the wire does not include the insulator, an insulator material (not shown) may be first deposited on the connection support substrate <b>540</b> so as to extend through the third via <b>560</b>, after etching the connection support substrate <b>540</b>, so as to electrically isolate the conductor from the connection support substrate <b>540</b>. In some aspects, the connective element <b>580</b> may be bonded to the connection support substrate <b>540</b> with a bonding material <b>600</b> engaged therebetween and externally to the third via <b>560</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the connective element <b>580</b> may be inserted through the third via <b>560</b> defined by the connection support substrate <b>540</b> and then fixed thereto with a bonding material <b>600</b>, such as a non-conductive epoxy, applied around the connective element <b>580</b> on the surface of the connection support substrate <b>540</b> opposite the surface of the connection support substrate <b>540</b> through which the connective element <b>580</b> extends.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, once the connective element <b>580</b> is secured to the connection support substrate <b>540</b>, the surface of the connection support substrate <b>540</b> through which the connective element <b>580</b> extends is planarized, for example, by a mechanical polishing process or a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process to produce a substantially planar surface having the end <b>620</b> of the connective element <b>580</b> exposed. In some instances, any gap between the connective element <b>580</b> and the wall defining the third via <b>560</b> can be filled, for example, with a non-conductive epoxy to provide a void-free, planar surface of the connection support substrate <b>540</b> for subsequent processing. The connective element <b>580</b> and/or the connection support substrate <b>540</b> is subsequently bonded to the support member <b>360</b> and/or the second conductive material <b>400</b>. In one instance, a non-conductive bonding material <b>640</b> such as, for example, a spin-coated or laminate adhesive, such as SU-8 photoimageable epoxy, may be applied to the planarized surface of the connection support substrate <b>540</b>. The non-conductive bonding material <b>640</b> can then be selectively removed (i.e., patterned) so as to form a fourth via <b>660</b> extending through the non-conductive bonding material <b>640</b> and exposing the end <b>620</b> of the connective element <b>580</b>. In other instances, the non-conductive bonding material <b>640</b> may be pre-patterned prior to being applied to the planarized surface of the connection support substrate <b>540</b>, such that the end <b>620</b> of the connective element <b>580</b> is exposed through the fourth via <b>660</b> upon application of the non-conductive bonding material <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a third conductive material <b>680</b> such as, for example, plated copper or an electrically-conductive epoxy, may then be deposited in the fourth via <b>660</b> such that the third conductive material <b>680</b> forms an electrically-conductive engagement with the connective element <b>580</b> and extends at least through the non-conductive bonding material <b>640</b>. The connection support substrate <b>540</b> can then be bonded to at least the support member <b>360</b>, such that the connective element <b>580</b> forms an electrically-conductive engagement with the second conductive material <b>400</b>, for example, by curing an epoxy material comprising the non-conductive bonding material <b>640</b>. In another aspect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the connective element <b>580</b> is brought into electrically-conductive engagement with the second conductive material <b>400</b>, for instance, via a conductive bonding material <b>700</b> disposed therebetween. In one such aspect, the conductive bonding material <b>700</b> may comprise, for example, a solder bump, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In such instances, the bonding may be effectuated by reflowing the solder comprising the solder bump. In another aspect, the conductive bonding material <b>700</b> may comprise metal (i.e., Au, Al, or Cu) stud bumps formed using a wire bonder or by electroplating, wherein such stud bumps can be thermo-compression bonded to provide the electrically-conductive engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other aspects, the connective element <b>580</b> and/or the connection support substrate <b>540</b> may be bonded to one of the support member <b>360</b> and/or the second conductive material <b>400</b> with an anisotropically-conductive epoxy <b>710</b> engaged therebetween. In this regard, an electrically-conductive engagement may be formed between the connective element <b>580</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b>, through the anisotropically-conductive epoxy <b>710</b>, without such an electrically-conductive engagement extending laterally through the anisotropically-conductive epoxy <b>710</b> to other transducer devices. In still further instances, an integrated circuit device and/or a redistribution element <b>720</b> may be interposed between the connective element <b>580</b> and/or the connection support substrate <b>540</b> and the support member <b>360</b> and/or the second conductive material <b>400</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In such instances, the integrated circuit device and/or redistribution element <b>720</b> may be in electrically-conductive engagement between at least the connective element <b>580</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b> by way of the anisotropically-conductive epoxy <b>710</b>, <b>730</b> engaged respectively therebetween. The integrated circuit device and/or redistribution element <b>720</b> may also be in electrically-conductive engagement between at least the connective element <b>580</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b>, for instance, by solder bumps or by metal stud bumps. In such instances, the integrated circuit device and/or redistribution element <b>720</b> may also include one or more conductive elements extending therethrough by way of corresponding device vias <b>725</b> also defined thereby and extending therethrough, and configured to provide, for example, electrical connection between the second conductive material <b>400</b> and the connective element <b>580</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A method of forming an electrically-conductive connection with a pMUT device, in yet another aspect of the present disclosure, is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>. As previously disclosed, individual signal leads are arranged to extend parallel to the operational direction of the transducer array, while directly engaging the respective pMUT devices in the transducer array. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a connective element <b>740</b> may be directly bonded to the support member <b>360</b>, whereby the connective element <b>740</b> is received in the second via <b>380</b> so as to be in electrically-conductive engagement with the second conductive material <b>400</b> and spaced apart from an end wall <b>760</b> of the second via <b>380</b> where the second conductive material <b>400</b> forms the electrically-conductive engagement with the first conductive material <b>340</b>. The connective element <b>740</b> is spaced apart from the end wall <b>760</b> of the second via <b>380</b> so as to allow the piezoelectric material <b>260</b> of the transducer device <b>200</b> to vibrate (i.e., to flex upon actuation via the first and second electrodes <b>280</b>, <b>300</b>, and thus function as intended. The connective element <b>740</b> may be bonded to the support member <b>360</b>, for instance, by a bonding material, such as an electrically-conductive epoxy, disposed within the second via <b>380</b>, between the connective element <b>740</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b>, wherein the bonding material may be applied to the individual connective element <b>740</b>, prior to insertion thereof into the second via <b>380</b>. In this manner, the spacing between the connective element <b>740</b> and the end wall <b>760</b> may be maintained. In other instances, the connective element <b>740</b> may be bonded to the support member <b>360</b> with a bonding material <b>800</b>, such as an electrically-conductive epoxy, engaged therebetween and externally to the second via <b>380</b>. More particularly, the bonding material <b>800</b> may be applied around the connective element <b>740</b> on the surface of the support member <b>380</b>, outside the second via <b>380</b>, such that bonding material <b>800</b> is in electrically-conductive engagement between the connective element <b>740</b> and the second conductive material <b>400</b>. In some aspects, the bonding material <b>800</b> is applied so as to not contaminate any adjacent pMUT devices by entering the second vias thereof, particularly in instances where the second vias are electrically isolated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some instances, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the connective element <b>740</b> may be engaged with a connection support substrate <b>820</b>, with the connective element <b>740</b> inserted into and extending through a third via <b>840</b> defined by the connection support substrate <b>820</b>, prior to the connective element <b>740</b> being bonded to the support member <b>360</b>, wherein the connection support substrate <b>820</b> may be previously etched to define the third via <b>840</b> extending therethrough. In still other instances, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an acoustic member <b>860</b> may also be engaged with the connection support substrate <b>820</b>, whereby the acoustic member <b>860</b> may likewise define an acoustic member via <b>880</b> corresponding to the third via <b>840</b> defined by the connection support substrate <b>820</b>, prior to engaging the connective element <b>740</b> with the connection support substrate <b>820</b>. As such, the connective element <b>740</b> may be inserted into and extend through the third via <b>840</b> defined by the connection support substrate <b>820</b> and the acoustic member via <b>880</b> defined by the acoustic member <b>860</b>, prior to bonding the connective element <b>740</b> to the support member <b>360</b>. In such instances, the acoustic member <b>860</b> may be selected according to appropriate acoustic dampening properties, so as to provide desirable acoustic dampening for the pMUT transducer array (i.e., so as to inhibit or prevent vibrations from the piezoelectric material from reverberating back to the piezoelectric material). In other aspects, the connective element <b>740</b> may be inserted into at least one of the support member <b>360</b> and connection support substrate <b>820</b>. In such instances, the acoustic member <b>860</b> may comprise, for example, a polymer material in a fluid/liquid state that may be backfilled into the gap between the connection support substrate <b>820</b> and the support member <b>360</b>, and between the connective elements <b>740</b>, wherein the fluid/liquid polymer may then be cured to form the acoustic member <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to the engagement of one or more of the connective elements with the connection support substrate (or the pMUT transducer array) in instances involving the same. More particularly, such aspects of the present disclosure are directed to facilitating and/or expediting the connective element/connection support substrate (or pMUT transducer array) engagement process. In some exemplary instances, the pitch of pMUT transducer devices in a transducer array may be on the order of between about 100 &#x3bc;m and about 200 &#x3bc;m, while the diameter of a corresponding connective element (e.g., wire) is on the order of about 50 &#x3bc;m. As such, precise alignment of the connective element with the connection support substrate is a consideration in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> thus schematically illustrates one aspect of the present disclosure directed to the assembling of a 2D array of connective elements (i.e., wires) <b>900</b> with respect to the connection support substrate or the pMUT transducer array (see, generally, element <b>920</b>). In one instance, a guide substrate <b>940</b>, about as wide as one dimension of connection support substrate/transducer array <b>920</b>, may be configured so as to define a plurality of parallel, spaced-apart channels <b>960</b> extending across the width thereof (and extending along the length of the guide substrate <b>940</b>), wherein the spacing of the channels <b>960</b> corresponds to the spacing of the third vias defined by the connection support substrate and/or the spacing of the second vias of the pMUT devices in the transducer array. In some aspects, the guide substrate <b>940</b> may be comprised of silicon, and the channels <b>960</b> may be &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped. The &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape of the channels <b>960</b> formed, for example, by anisotropic crystallographic etching of the silicon, may promote, for instance, alignment of the connective elements <b>900</b> with respect to the desired spacing therebetween. Once the connective elements <b>900</b> are laid in the respective channels <b>960</b>, so as to extend longitudinally outward thereof, a retaining member <b>980</b> may be removably applied over the channels <b>960</b> so as to retain the connective elements <b>900</b> within the channels <b>960</b>. Once prepared, the guide substrate <b>940</b> may be disposed adjacent to the intended connection support substrate/pMUT transducer array <b>920</b> (i.e., using micropositioners), and the connective elements <b>900</b> slid or otherwise longitudinally directed along the channels <b>960</b> to engage the intended connection support substrate/pMUT transducer array <b>920</b>. In some instances, the channels <b>960</b> (and the retaining member <b>980</b>, if necessary) may have an anti-stiction coating (e.g., fluoropolymer) applied thereto to inhibit or prevent electrostatic attraction with the connective elements <b>900</b>. Upon bonding the connective elements <b>900</b>, as necessary, the retaining member <b>980</b> and the guide substrate <b>940</b> may be removed, leaving the connective elements <b>900</b> engaged with the intended connection support substrate/pMUT transducer array <b>920</b>. As shown, the guide substrate <b>940</b>/retaining member <b>980</b> may be configure to address one row (or column) of the 2D transducer array at a time. As such, repeat application of the disclosed process may be required in order to populate the 2D transducer array with an appropriate complement of connective elements <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition to such an assembly process for individual connective elements, as disclosed above, another aspect of the present disclosure may be directed to direct integration of a suitable assembly of connective elements. In this regard, some aspects may be directed to forming the connective elements <b>1000</b> in an appropriate carrier matrix <b>1020</b>. For example, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, nanofibers could be formed in the channels of the guide substrate and, if necessary, plated with a conductive material to produce a conducting &#x201c;cable.&#x201d; In other instances, a monolithic cable may be attained by fabricating, for example, by a co-extrusion process, a flexible composite assembly having the connective elements arranged in a polymeric matrix. For example, one such configuration may include, for example, a co-extrusion of a doped PET polymer (i.e., having a resistivity of about 5 Ohm-cm or less, such as, for instance, about 20 &#x3bc;Ohm-cm) in an insulator matrix comprised of undoped PET or polypropylene. In one desirable instance, the connective elements may each have a resistance of less than about 20 Ohms. Once formed, one end of the monolithic cable aspect may be polished (i.e., perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis) so as to provide a planar surface for bonding with an appropriate bonding material to the pMUT transducer array, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In particular instances, the polymer used for the insulator matrix may be selected according to acoustic dampening properties, so as to provide desirable acoustic dampening for the pMUT transducer array (i.e., so as to inhibit or prevent vibrations from the piezoelectric material from reverberating back to the piezoelectric material).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Many modifications and other aspects of the disclosures set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which these disclosures pertain having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. For example, the exemplary methods and aspects thereof as disclosed herein may also have related apparatuses associated therewith, as otherwise disclosed herein. Further, the pMUT transducer devices disclosed herein may, as necessary or desired, be engaged with an IC (e.g., a control IC such as amplifier or multiplexer), an interposer (e.g., silicon or flex cable), or a redistribution element, for example, using solder bumps, gold stud bumps, metal stud bumps, anisotropic conductive epoxy, or other suitable electrically-conductive connection provisions, to provide an electrically-conductive engagement between the second conductive material of a particular pMUT transducer device and the IC, flex cable, cable assembly, interposer, or redistribution element. In addition, in some of the exemplary methods disclosed herein, a bonding material may sometimes be engaged with the support member so as to extend across the second vias defined thereby. In those instances, a suitably selected material comprising the bonding material may allow the bonding material to desirably function as an acoustic dampener for absorbing and/or dissipating vibrations emitted from the piezoelectric material, thereby inhibiting or preventing reverberation of the piezoelectric material along the second via. As such, the apparatuses and methods disclosed herein may be suitably adapted to address such instances, within the scope of the present disclosure. Therefore, it is to be understood that the disclosures are not to be limited to the specific aspects disclosed and that modifications and other aspects are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.</p>
