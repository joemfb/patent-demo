<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-205757, filed on Sep. 14, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a transmission device, a control device, and a method of detecting the erroneous connection of a signal line.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology has been used in the field of an optical network, where the WDM technology allows a large capacity optical transmission to be achieved by performing wavelength division multiplexing for different wavelengths to transmit large-capacity data. According to the WDM technology, an optical add drop multiplexer (OADM) configured to add an optical signal with an arbitrary wavelength to a group of WDM signals and drop an optical signal with an arbitrary wavelength from the WDM signal group for reception is often used.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When an optical signal with another wavelength is added to the WDM signal group in an optical network including the OADM, the optical signal may not be transmitted successfully. Such situation is caused by, for example, deterioration of optical characteristics due to the transmission distance dependence, the dispersion characteristic of an optical fiber used to transmit the WDM signals, the erroneous setting of a wavelength route in the optical network, or the erroneous connection of an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an OADM conforming to Optical Transport Network (OTN), for example, the erroneous connection of an optical fiber is detected by referring to Source Access Point Identifier (SAPI) or Destination Access Point Identifier (DAPI) of an optical signal, which is included in Trail Trace Identifier (TTI) information provided in a frame.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2001-358657, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2002-44035, etc. are disclosed as the related art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the embodiment, a transmission device includes a transponder including an oscillator configured to oscillate a local optical laser, a wavelength controller configured to control an oscillation wavelength of the local optical laser to receive desired input signal light, and a coherent receiver configured to combine and detect the local optical laser and input signal light. A controller is configured to control the oscillation wavelength using a wavelength of the input signal light detected by the coherent receiver, to determine an erroneous connection of a signal line related to the input signal light, when the wavelength of the input signal light is not an expected wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The erroneous connection of the optical fiber is detected in the following manner, for example. Specifically, when the erroneous connection of the optical fiber occurs, an optical signal with a wavelength different from a wavelength which is originally to be input to a port (in other words, an optical connector) of the OADM is input to the port. Accordingly, a loss-of-light (LOL) signal is not detected. The OADM often uses a wide-band specification optical receiver (e.g., an optical electronic converter (O/E)) to receive a signal with every wavelength, which is to be included in the WDM signal group. Therefore, upon receiving an optical signal with a different wavelength, the OADM can receive the optical signal successfully and convert the optical signal into an electric signal. Therefore, a loss-of-signal (LOS) signal is not detected. Accordingly, the erroneous connection is detected by analyzing a frame indicated by the electric signal obtained by converting the received optical signal. Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings.</p>

Therefore, it is preferable that the optical receiver <b>5231</b> include a 90&#xb0;-hybrid circuit configured to generate a combined optical signal by combining an optical signal input from the transponder-side optical input port <b>521</b> and a local optical laser input from the optical oscillator <b>5232</b>, a balanced receiver configured to separate the combined optical signal into a positive-phase component and a negative-phase component (or a real-part component and an imaginary-part component), and so forth.

Likewise, even though the homodyne detection system included in the intradyne detection system of the present embodiment is adopted, the wavelength of a local optical laser does not become equal to that of the actually received optical signal as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Therefore, the homodyne detection is not appropriately performed even though the optical receiver <b>5231</b> receives an optical signal, which may cause the error rate of the received optical signal to exceed the LOS level. Consequently, the LOS signal may be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, given that the wavelength of a local optical laser is changed to a wavelength (e.g., the wavelength #n+1 corresponding to a channel CH#n+1) which is different from the expected wavelength (e.g., the wavelength #n corresponding to the channel CH#n), the wavelength of a local optical laser becomes substantially equal to that of the actually received optical signal. That is, the error between the wavelength of a local optical laser and the actually received wavelength becomes &#xb1;2.5 GHz or less. Therefore, the intradyne detection is appropriately performed when the optical receiver <b>5231</b> receives an optical signal, so that the error rate of the received optical signal does not exceed the LOS level. Consequently, the LOS signal is not detected. Likewise, even though the homodyne detection system included in the intradyne detection system of the present embodiment is adopted, the wavelength of a local optical laser is changed to be the same wavelength as that of the actually received optical signal as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>. Therefore, the homodyne detection is appropriately performed when the optical receiver <b>5231</b> receives an optical signal, so that the error rate of the received optical signal does not exceed the LOS level. Consequently, the LOS signal is not detected.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The above-described case may occur when the intra-device optical fibers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> where optical signals with the expected wavelengths are transmitted and the intra-device optical fibers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> where optical signals that are actually received by the optical receiver <b>5231</b> are transmitted are erroneously coupled. That is, since the intra-device optical fibers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> where optical signals with the expected wavelengths are transmitted are erroneously coupled, the LOS signal may be detected even though the wavelength of a local optical laser is set to a value which is substantially equal to that of the expected wavelength. Likewise, since the intra-device optical fibers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> where the optical signals that are actually received by the optical receiver <b>5231</b> are transmitted are erroneously coupled, no more LOS signal may be detected when the wavelength of a local optical laser is set to a value which is substantially equal to that of a wavelength different from the expected wavelength. Consequently, with the operations that are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the erroneous connections of the intra-device optical fibers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are appropriately detected, and the erroneously coupled intra-device optical fibers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are appropriately specified.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to the transmission system <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the OADM <b>2</b> (or the OADM transponder <b>5</b> or the OADM transponder <b>52</b>) using an optical coherent receiver adopting the intradyne detection system as the optical receiver <b>5231</b> can appropriately detect the erroneous connections of the intra-device optical fiber <b>42</b> or <b>43</b> (that is, whether or not the erroneous connection occurs can appropriately be determined) as described above. Accordingly, it becomes possible to eliminate undesired effects relatively quickly, the undesired effects being caused by erroneous connections that may occur when a wavelength or line is added, for example. In addition, the maintenance of the transmission system <b>1</b> can be performed with reduced cost.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Further, the transmission system <b>1</b> of the present embodiment uses the unconnectable wavelength information, the expected wavelength information, the local optical laser-wavelength history information, etc., thereby appropriately detecting the erroneous connection of the intra-device optical fiber <b>42</b> or <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The erroneous connection of a different optical fiber provided in the OADM <b>2</b> and used to transmit an optical signal can also be detected in the above-described manner in addition to or in place of the erroneous connections of the intra-device optical fibers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> mutually connecting the OADM core device <b>3</b>, the intra-device optical fiber interface <b>41</b>, and the OADM transponder device <b>5</b>.</p>
