<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is based on and claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-058384, filed on Mar. 16, 2011 in the Japan Patent Office, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a semiconductor device that employs a semiconductor chip in which an internal circuit is formed, a chip tab mounting the semiconductor chip, and encapsulation resin to encapsulate the semiconductor chip and the chip tab.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and digital cameras are ubiquitous. The integrated circuits (IC) used in these portable electronic devices are required to be made more compact and with a higher degree of accuracy. Market demand for rigorous accuracy is particularly intense, with some market sectors seeking tolerance guarantees of from 1% to 0.5% or even less. As used herein, the term &#x201c;tolerance&#x201d; means deviation in performance of an actually manufactured IC from that of an IC that is formed according to design without dimensional error.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although it is difficult to treat such tolerances as a whole because there are many different types, in general they can be divided into two major groups depending on the stage of IC manufacture in which they occur.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first type of tolerance is one that arises during processing of a semiconductor wafer. When the semiconductor wafer is processed and target circuit elements are constructed therein, the dimensions of the circuitry and the degree of impurity may deviate slightly from design values therefor. The first type of tolerance is caused by deviations in processing, which typically follows a normal distribution curve.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first type of tolerance can be reformed by improving the characteristics of production equipment because the first type of tolerance is caused by processing deviation. In addition, a circuit design method in which a circuit area having a larger size such that processing deviation is not a problem is aggressively used for circuits requiring a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The second type of tolerance is generated when a completed semiconductor wafer is cut into chips and each chip is inserted in a container so-called, a package, as an individuated pack. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic plan view and a cross-sectional diagram illustrating a conventional semiconductor device (IC) <b>101</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numerals <b>103</b> represents a chip tab, <b>105</b> represents a semiconductor chip, <b>107</b> represent electrode pads, <b>109</b> represent bonding wires, <b>111</b> represent leads, and <b>113</b> represents encapsulation resin. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second type of tolerance is generated when the semiconductor chip <b>105</b> cut from the semiconductor wafer is encapsulated by the encapsulation resin <b>113</b>, and a mechanical stress (hereinafter just &#x201c;stress&#x201d;) is exerted on the semiconductor chip <b>105</b>. This stress, called package stress, skews and deforms the semiconductor chip <b>105</b>. Owing to the deformation, the electrical characteristics of the circuit elements formed in the semiconductor chip <b>105</b> are changed, thereby changing an output signal of the IC <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph illustrating stress exerted on the semiconductor chip <b>105</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a vertical axis indicates a stress value (orbital unit), and a horizontal axis indicates a measurement positions representing a distance from a center when the center of the semiconductor chip is set to zero. In the conventional semiconductor device <b>101</b>, the package stress exerted on the semiconductor chip <b>105</b> is largest in a center position thereof and is decreased toward a periphery of the semiconductor chip <b>105</b>. Since the package stress is simply changed from the center position to the periphery of the semiconductor chip <b>105</b>, there is no area in which the strength of the package stress is constant.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Several approaches have been proposed for alleviating tolerances arising from package stress. For example, JP H11-145344-A discloses a method that circuit element (e.g., transistor) to be prevented from fluctuation in the electronic characteristics caused by the package stress is arranged in a center position of a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, JP-H10-189875-A discloses a method in which circuit elements (e.g., resistors) to be prevented from fluctuation in electrical characteristics caused by package stress are arranged near a periphery of the chip. In general, the package stress is smallest in the periphery of the semiconductor chip. At the same time, however, localized changes in the package stress are often greatest in the periphery of the semiconductor chip. As a result, fluctuation in the output signal of the IC caused by package stress cannot be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, JP-H06-097368-A discloses an approach in which paired circuit elements to be arranged on lines radiating outward from the center (center of gravity) of the chip toward the periphery to equalize package stress. However, this method does not always achieve the expected result, because the strength and the direction of the package stress is affected by the size of the semiconductor chip, the package shape (shape of the encapsulation resin), and the relative positions of the semiconductor chip and the encapsulation resin.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described above, with the conventional approaches fluctuation in the electrical characteristics of the circuit elements caused by the package stress cannot be eliminated or made uniform, and consequently fluctuation in the output signal caused by the package stress cannot be solved.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect of this disclosure, there is a provided a semiconductor device including a semiconductor chip, a chip tab, and encapsulation resin. An internal circuit is formed in the semiconductor chip, with the internal circuit having an output signal that fluctuates due to variation of fluctuation in electrical characteristics of multiple circuit elements constituting the internal circuit. The semiconductor chip is mounted on the chip tab, with the semiconductor chip completely overlapping the chip tab and the circuit elements in the semiconductor chip arranged on the chip tab. The semiconductor chip and the chip tab are sealed within the encapsulation resin. A horizontal surface area of the chip tab is smaller than that of the semiconductor chip. A distance between a periphery of the chip tab and a periphery of the semiconductor chip is sufficient to cause stress exerted on the semiconductor chip by the encapsulation resin to be uniform across the horizontal surface area of the chip tab.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In describing preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner and achieve a similar result.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic plan view and a cross-sectional diagram illustrating a semiconductor device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment. The cross-sectional diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the semiconductor device <b>1</b> along a line A-A&#x2032; of the plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an encapsulation resin <b>13</b> is represented by a vertical line (two-dot chain line). In the semiconductor device <b>1</b>, a semiconductor chip <b>5</b> is mounted on a chip tab <b>3</b>. Electrode pads <b>7</b> are provided on an upper surface of the semiconductor chip <b>5</b>, on a side of the semiconductor chip <b>5</b> away from the chip tab <b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the formula 1, nine components &#x3c3;<sub>ij </sub>of the stress vectors defines the states of stress at given points. A first index x denotes that the stress acts on a plane normal to a minute plane, and a second index y denotes a direction in which the stress acts on the minute plane. For example, xy means that the normal direction of the minute surface corresponds to X-axis direction, and the force component corresponds to the Y axis direction. The stress at any point in an object, assumed to behave as a continuum, is completely defined by nine component stresses: three orthogonal normal stresses (&#x201c;normal stresses&#x201d;: xx, yy, and zz) and six orthogonal shear stresses (&#x201c;shear stress&#x201d;: xy, xz, yx, yz, zx, and zy) that the normal line of the minute face differs from the stress of action.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The &#x201c;normal&#x201d; stress serves as &#x201c;tensile stress&#x201d; or &#x201c;compressive stress&#x201d;. The &#x201c;tensile stress&#x201d; acts when acting outward from the plane, that is, a direction of acting plane is orthogonal to a direction of the acting force, and the tensile stress is exerted in a direction in which the acting plane is pulled. The &#x201c;compressive stress&#x201d; acts when acting inward to the plane, that is, the compressive stress is exerted in a direction in which the acting plane is pressed into. The &#x201c;stress&#x201d; used in the present disclosure to predict the characteristic fluctuation in the circuit elements, means the &#x201c;normal stress&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, &#x201c;the package stress is uniform&#x201d; means that the fluctuation in the output signal of the internal circuit is uniform in a state in which the variation is vanishingly small, when the electrical characteristics of the circuit elements fluctuate due to the package stress, in the internal circuit whose output signal fluctuates due to the variations of the fluctuation in the electrical characteristics of the multiple circuit elements constituting the internal circuit.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Herein, the circuit elements mean elements build in the semiconductor chip, such as, respective transistors and resistors.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The electrical characteristics of multiple circuit elements arranged on the chip tab <b>3</b> fluctuates because the multiple circuit elements arranged on the chip tab <b>3</b> are subjected to the package stress.

Accordingly, in the present embodiment, in the internal circuit in which the output signal of the internal circuit due to variations of the fluctuation in the electrical characteristics of multiple circuit elements constituting the internal circuit, fluctuation in the output signal caused by the package stress does not occur. As described above, in the internal circuit in which the output signal of the internal circuit fluctuates due to variation of fluctuation in electrical characteristics of multiple circuit elements, fluctuation in the output signal caused by the package stress can be prevented.</p>

Thus, there is no change in the voltage Vref in the state in which the package stress is not exerted and the voltage Vref (stress) in the state in which the package stress is exerted as the output signal of the reference voltage generation circuit <b>50</b>. Therefore, the output signal (reference voltage Vref) of the reference voltage generation circuit <b>50</b> does not fluctuate.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the reference voltage generation circuit <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the depletion-type MOSFET Nch<b>51</b> is connected in serial to a single enhancement-type MOSFET Nch<b>52</b>.

The resistive dividing circuit <b>60</b> includes at least one pair of resistors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> are connected in serial between terminals L and M. A voltage at a terminal N connected between the resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> constitute an output voltage of the resistive dividing circuit <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view illustrating a layout of the resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, multiple resistive elements <b>71</b> are arranged in the resistor R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b>. The each resistive element <b>71</b> is formed by, for example, resistive alloy, resistive carbon, or resistive resin, etc. The single resistive element <b>71</b> serves as a unit resistor. Reference numerals N<b>1</b> through N<b>5</b> represent terminals to take electrical potential (resistances) from the resistive elements <b>71</b>. The resistive dividing circuit <b>60</b> functions as the internal circuit formed in the semiconductor chip <b>5</b> of the semiconductor device <b>1</b>. The resistive elements <b>71</b> function as the circuit elements in the semiconductor chip <b>5</b> arranged on the chip tab <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, when the terminals N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> are selected, resistance R<b>0</b> that is a value corresponding to single resistive element <b>71</b> is obtained. When the terminals N<b>2</b> and N<b>5</b> are selected, the resistance R<b>0</b> that is a value corresponding to single resistive element is obtained. When the terminals N<b>4</b> and N<b>5</b> are selected, resistance <b>2</b>R<b>0</b> that is a value corresponding to two resistive elements <b>71</b> is obtained. When the terminals N<b>3</b> and N<b>4</b> are selected, resistance <b>4</b>R<b>0</b> that is a value corresponding to four resistive elements <b>71</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Using the resistance, one example in which the resistance is taken out by dividing a potential difference between the terminals N and M and outputting from the terminal N is described below. For example, setting the voltage at the terminal L to 3.0 V (volt) and the voltage at the terminal M to 1.5V, 1.5 V is taken from the terminal N. In this case, the terminals N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> are wired and the resistance R<b>0</b> is used as resistance of the resistor R<b>1</b>, and the terminals N<b>2</b> and N<b>5</b> are wired and the resistance R<b>0</b> is used as resistance of the resistor R<b>2</b>, thereby 1.5 V can be obtained. That is, a voltage V(N) at the terminal N is represented by the following formula 4:</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Herein, a case in which the package stress is exerted on the resistive elements <b>71</b> is assumed. Although the resistance of the resistive elements <b>71</b> fluctuates respectively by being subjected to the package stress, the amount of fluctuation between the resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> that are formed by the two resistive elements <b>71</b> respectively are identical because the strength of the package stress is uniform across the chip tab <b>3</b>. Herein, V (N: stress) represents the voltage V at the terminal N after the package stress is exerted, R<b>1</b> (stress) represents the resistance of the resistor R<b>1</b> after the package stress is exerted, and R<b>1</b> (stress) represents the resistance of the resistor R<b>1</b> after the package stress is exerted. Assuming the fluctuation amount to &#x201c;r&#x201d;, the voltage V at the terminal N after the package stress is exerted is calculated as follows:</p>
