<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to novel antireflective coating compositions and their use in image processing by forming a thin layer of the novel antireflective coating composition between a reflective substrate and a photoresist coating. Such compositions are particularly useful in the fabrication of semiconductor devices by photolithographic techniques, especially those requiring exposure with deep ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Photoresist compositions are used in microlithography processes for making miniaturized electronic components such as in the fabrication of computer chips and integrated circuits. Generally, in these processes, a thin coating of a film of a photoresist composition is first applied to a substrate material, such as silicon wafers used for making integrated circuits. The coated substrate is then baked to evaporate any solvent in the photoresist composition and to fix the coating onto the substrate. The baked and coated surface of the substrate is next subjected to an image-wise exposure to radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">This radiation exposure causes a chemical transformation in the exposed areas of the coated surface. Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, electron beam and X-ray radiant energy are radiation types commonly used today in microlithographic processes. After this image-wise exposure, the coated substrate is treated with a developer solution to dissolve and remove either the radiation-exposed or the unexposed areas of the photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">There are two types of photoresist compositions, negative-working and positive-working. When positive-working photoresist compositions are exposed image-wise to radiation, the areas of the photoresist composition exposed to the radiation become soluble in a developer solution while the unexposed areas of the photoresist coating remain relatively insoluble to such a solution. Thus, treatment of an exposed positive-working photoresist with a developer causes removal of the exposed areas of the photoresist coating and the formation of a positive image in the coating, thereby uncovering a desired portion of the underlying substrate surface on which the photoresist composition was deposited. In a negative-working photoresist the developer removes the portions that are not exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The trend towards the miniaturization of semiconductor devices has led both to the use of new photoresists that are sensitive to lower and lower wavelengths of radiation, and also to the use of sophisticated multilevel systems to overcome difficulties associated with such miniaturization.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The use of absorbing antireflective coatings in photolithography is a simpler approach to diminish the problems that result from back reflection of light from highly reflective substrates. The bottom antireflective coating is applied on the substrate and then a layer of photoresist is applied on top of the antireflective coating. The photoresist is exposed imagewise and developed. The antireflective coating in the exposed area is then typically etched and the photoresist pattern is thus transferred to the substrate. Most antireflective coatings known in the prior art are designed to be dry etched. The etch rate of the antireflective film needs to be relatively high in comparison to the photoresist so that the antireflective film is etched without excessive loss of the resist film during the etch process. There are two known types of antireflective coatings, inorganic coatings and organic coatings. These types of coatings have been designed for removal by dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">In addition, photoresist patterns may be damaged or may not be transferred exactly to the substrate if the dry etch rate of the antireflective coating is similar to or less than the etch rate of the photoresist coated on top of the antireflective coating. The etching conditions for removing the organic coatings can also damage the substrate. Thus, there is a need for both organic bottom antireflective coatings that can be dry etched and organic bottom antireflective coatings that can be removed by the photoresist developer without dry etching, and can also provide good lithographic performance, especially for compound semiconductor type substrates, which are sensitive to etch damage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">The novel approach of the present application is to use an absorbing bottom antireflective coating film; especially a bottom antireflective coating that can be dry etched or developed by an aqueous alkaline developer solution. Aqueous removal of the bottom antireflective coating eliminates the dry etch rate requirement of the coating, reduces the cost intensive dry etching processing steps and also prevents damage to the substrate caused by dry etching. The novel bottom antireflective coating compositions of the present invention contain a novel additive, a crosslinking compound and a polymer.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0014">The present invention relates to a bottom antireflective coating composition removed after patterning of the photoresist by dry etching or an aqueous alkaline developer. The composition comprises a polymer, a crosslinker and an additive. The polymer may be a crosslinkable polymer comprising a crosslinkable group which crosslinks with the crosslinker. The polymer may be a polymer which comprises a crosslinkable group which crosslinks with the crosslinker and further becomes soluble in the aqueous alkaline developer by the decrosslinking of an acid labile group in the polymer. The invention further relates to a process for using such a composition, especially for imaging with radiation from about 12 nm is to about 450 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">In one embodiment, the antireflective coating composition of the present invention relates to a novel absorbing, photoimageable and aqueous developable positive image-forming antireflective coating composition comprising a polymer, a vinyl ether terminated crosslinking agent and a novel crosslinking additive containing at least one arylene-hydroxyl moiety, further where the polymer comprises at least one chromophore group and at least one hydroxyl and/or a carboxyl group, and optionally one unit containing a hydroxyl and/or carboxyl group capped with a compound to form an acid labile group, Optionally, the composition may further contain at least one compound selected from a group consisting of a photoacid generator, a photoacid generator comprising a vinyl ether which also acts as a vinyl ether crosslinker, photoacid generator comprising a hydroxyl group capable of crosslinking with a vinyl ether, a base additive consisting of an amine and mixtures thereof. The novel composition is used to form a film which is coated on a substrate and below a positive photoresist, in order to prevent reflections in the photoresist from the substrate. This antireflective coating is photoimageable with the same wavelength of light as the top photoresist, and is also developable with the same aqueous alkaline developing solution as that used to typically develop the photoresist, thus forming a pattern in the novel antireflective coating film. The antireflective coating composition comprises a polymer, a crosslinking agent and the novel additive. The antireflective coating composition is coated on a reflective substrate. The edge bead which may form during the spinning process can then be removed using an edgebead removing solvent, since the polymer is still soluble in solvents used as edgebead removers. The coating is then baked to remove the solvent of the coating solution and also to crosslink the coating, in order to prevent, or minimize the extent of intermixing between the layers and make the coating insoluble in the aqueous alkaline developer. Although not being bound by theory, it is believed that during the baking step a reaction takes place between the crosslinking agent, especially compounds containing vinyl ether terminal groups, and the polymer with the hydroxyl and/or a carboxyl group in the antireflective coating, to form acid labile groups within the coating. After baking and curing the antireflective coating is essentially insoluble in both an alkaline developing solution and the solvent of the photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">A positive photoresist is then coated on top of the cured antireflective coating and baked to remove the photoresist solvent. Prior to exposure to actinic radiation both the photoresist and the antireflective coating are insoluble in the aqueous alkaline developing solution of the photoresist. The bilevel system is then imagewise exposed to radiation in one single step, where an acid is then generated in both the top photoresist and the bottom antireflective coating. If a photoacid generator is present in the antireflective coating it is photolysed. When a photoacid generator is not present in the antireflective coating, the acid may diffuse from the photoresist into the antireflective coating. In a subsequent baking step, in the exposed regions the polymer of the antireflective coating with the crosslinked sites comprising acid labile groups (such as acid labile acetal groups), the acid labile groups are decrosslinked in the presence of the photogenerated acid, thus making the polymer and hence the antireflective coating soluble in the aqueous alkaline developer. A subsequent developing step with an aqueous alkaline developer then dissolves the exposed regions of both the positive photoresist and the antireflective coating, thus producing a positive image, and leaving the substrate clear for further processing. The novel composition functions as a developable bottom antireflective coating composition.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">In another embodiment of the invention, the present invention relates to an antireflective coating composition comprising a polymer comprising a crosslinkable group and a chromophore, a crosslinker and the novel additive. In this embodiment the coating is baked to form a crosslinked coating which is not removed by an aqueous alkaline developer used to image and pattern the photoresist film. This novel coating is removed by dry etching using gas(es) in a dry etching chamber. No acid labile groups are formed between the polymer and the crosslinker. A photoresist coating is formed over the antireflective coating film and imagewise exposed and developed. No pattern is formed in the antireflective coating film during the aqueous alkaline development process.</p>

The acid in the exposed areas of the antireflective coating, present either through diffusion from the photoresist or through photogeneration from the photoacid generator in the antireflective film, reacts with the acid labile crosslinkages to decrosslink the polymer, thus making the exposed areas of the antireflective coating soluble in the aqueous alkaline developer. The photoacid generator of the antireflective coating chosen depends on the photoresist to be used. The photoacid generator (PAG) of the novel composition is selected from those which absorb at the desired exposure wavelength, preferably 248 nm, 193 nm and 157 nm for deep ultraviolet photoresists, 13.5 nm for extreme ultraviolet, and naphthoquinone diazides or sulfonium salts for 365 nm, 436 nm and broadband photoresists.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The absorption parameter (k) of the novel composition ranges from about 0.1 to about 1.0, preferably from about 0.15 to about 0.7 as measured using ellipsometry. The refractive index (n) of the antireflective coating is also optimized. The n and k values can be calculated using an ellipsometer, such as the J. A. Woollam WVASE VU-302 &#x2122; Ellipsometer. The exact values of the optimum ranges for k and n are dependent on the exposure wavelength used and the type of application. Typically for 193 nm the preferred range for k is 0.1 to 0.75, for 248 nm the preferred range for k is 0.15 to 0.8, and for 365 nm the preferred range is from 0.1 to 0.8. The thickness of the antireflective coating is less than the thickness of the top photoresist. For developable antireflective coatings the film thickness of the antireflective coating is less than the value of (wavelength of exposure/refractive index), and more preferably it is less than the value of (wavelength of exposure/2 times refractive index), where the refractive index is that of the antireflective coating and can be measured with an ellipsometer. The optimum film thickness of the antireflective coating is determined by the exposure wavelength, refractive indices of the antireflective coating and of the photoresist, absorption characteristics of the top and bottom coatings, and optical characteristics of the substrate. In this case, since the bottom antireflective coating is removed by exposure and development steps, the optimum film thickness is determined by avoiding the optical nodes where no light absorption is present in the antireflective coating.</p>

In certain cases there can be a buildup of photoresist film at the edges of the substrate, referred to as edge bead. This edge bead can be removed using a solvent or mixture of solvents using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The composition of the present invention is particularly compatible with edge bead removers. Typical solvents used for edge bead removers are ethyl lactate, butyl acetate, propyleneglycol monomethyletheracetate, propyleneglycol monomethylether, or mixtures thereof. The coating is then cured. The preferred range of temperature is from about 120&#xb0; C. to about 240&#xb0; C. for about 30-120 seconds on a hot plate or equivalent heating unit, more preferably from about 150&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C. for 45-90 seconds. The film thickness of the antireflective coating ranges from about 20 nm to about 300 nm. The optimum film thickness is determined, as is well known in the art, to be where good lithographic properties are obtained, especially where no standing waves are observed in the photoresist. If has been unexpectedly found that for this novel composition very thin coatings can be used due to the excellent absorption and refractive index properties of the film. The cured antireflective coating is also insoluble at this stage in the alkaline developing solution. The photoresist can then be coated on top of the antireflective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Positive photoresists, which are developed with aqueous alkaline solutions, are useful for the present invention, provided the photoactive compounds in the photoresist and the antireflective coating absorb at the same exposure wavelength used for the imaging process for the photoresist. Positive-working photoresist compositions are exposed image-wise to radiation, those areas of the photoresist composition exposed to the radiation become more soluble to the developer solution while those areas not exposed remain relatively insoluble to the developer to solution. Thus, treatment of an exposed positive-working photoresist with the developer causes removal of the exposed areas of the coating and the formation of a positive image in the photoresist coating. Photoresist resolution is defined as the smallest feature which the resist composition can transfer from the photomask to the substrate with a high degree of image edge acuity after exposure and development. In many manufacturing applications today, resist resolution on the order of less than one micron are necessary. In addition, it is almost always desirable that the developed photoresist wall profiles be near vertical relative to the substrate. Such demarcations between developed and undeveloped areas of the resist coating translate into accurate pattern transfer of the mask image onto the substrate. This becomes even more critical as the drive toward miniaturization reduces the critical dimensions on the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Photoresists can be any of the types used in the semiconductor industry, provided the photoactive compound in the photoresist and the antireflective coating absorb at the exposure wavelength used for the imaging process.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To date, there are several major deep ultraviolet (uv) exposure technologies that have provided significant advancement in miniaturization, and these radiation of 248 nm, 193 nm, 157 and 13.5 nm. Photoresists for 248 nm have typically been based on substituted polyhydroxystyrene and its copolymers/onium salts, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,491,628 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,350,660. On the other hand, photoresists for exposure below 200 nm require non-aromatic polymers since aromatics are opaque at this wavelength. U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,624 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,866,984 disclose photoresists useful for 193 nm exposure. Generally, polymers containing alicyclic hydrocarbons are used for photoresists for exposure below 200 nm. Alicyclic hydrocarbons are incorporated into the polymer for many reasons, primarily since they have relatively high carbon to hydrogen ratios which improve etch resistance, they also provide transparency at low wavelengths and they have relatively high glass transition temperatures. U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,624 discloses polymers for photoresist that are obtained by free radical polymerization of maleic anhydride and unsaturated cyclic monomers. Any of the known types of 193 nm photoresists may be used, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,980 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,723,488, and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Two basic classes of photoresists sensitive at 157 nm, and based on fluorinated polymers with pendant fluoroalcohol groups, are known to be substantially transparent at that wavelength. One class of 157 nm fluoroalcohol photoresists is derived from polymers containing groups such as fluorinated-norbornenes, and are homopolymerized or copolymerized with other transparent monomers such as tetrafluoroethylene (U.S. Pat. No. 6,790,587, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,377) using either metal catalyzed or radical polymerization. Generally, these materials give higher absorbencies but have good plasma etch resistance due to their high alicyclic content. More recently, a class of 157 nm fluoroalcohol polymers was described in which the polymer backbone is derived from the cyclopolymerization of an asymmetrical diene such as 1,1,2,3,3-pentafluoro-4-trifluoromethyl-4-hydroxy-1,6-heptadiene (Shun-ichi Kodama et al Advances in Resist Technology and Processing XIX, Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 4690 p 76 2002; U.S. Pat. No. 6,818,258) or copolymerization of a fluorodiene with an olefin (U.S. Pat. No. 6,916,590). These materials give acceptable absorbance at 157 nm, but due to their lower alicyclic content as compared to the fluoro-norbornene polymer, have lower plasma etch resistance. These two classes of polymers can often be blended to provide a balance between the high etch resistance of the first polymer type and the high transparency at 157 nm of the second polymer type. Photoresists that absorb extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV) of 13.5 nm are also useful and are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A film of photoresist is then coated on top of the cured antireflective coating and baked to substantially remove the photoresist solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The photoresist is imagewise exposed to actinic radiation and then developed to form an image in the photoresist pattern, without transferring the pattern into the antireflective coating film. In this embodiment dry etching is used to remove the novel antireflective film.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the embodiment of the photoimageable antireflective coating, the photoresist and the antireflective coating bilevel layers are then imagewise exposed to actinic radiation. In a subsequent heating step the acid generated during exposure step reacts to de-crosslink the polymer of the antireflective coating composition and thus rendering the exposed region of the antireflective coating alkali soluble in the developing solution. The temperature for the postexposure bake step can range from 40&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. for 30-200 seconds on a hot plate or equivalent heating system, preferably from 80&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C. for 40-90 seconds. In some instances, it is possible to avoid the postexposure bake, since for certain chemistries, such as some acetal acid labile linkages, deprotection proceeds at room temperature. The polymer in the exposed regions of the antireflective coating is now soluble in an aqueous alkaline solution. The bilevel system is then developed in an aqueous alkaline developer to remove the photoresist and the antireflective coating. The developer is preferably an aqueous alkaline solution comprising, for example, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide. The developer may further comprise additives, such as surfactants, polymers, isopropanol, ethanol, etc. The process of coating and imaging photoresist coatings and antireflective coatings is well known to those skilled in the art and is optimized for the specific type of photoresist and antireflective coating combination used. The imaged bilevel system can then be processed further as required by the manufacturing process of integrated circuits, for example metal deposition and etching.</p>
