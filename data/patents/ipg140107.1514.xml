<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to a gearbox for a ram air turbine assembly. More particularly, this disclosure relates to a bearing preload spring and spacer for supporting rotation of a gear shaft within a gearbox of a ram air turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A ram air turbine (RAT) is a back up power generation device utilized in aircraft. The ram air turbine is deployed into airflow along the exterior of the aircraft and the turbine is driven by the airflow. The turbine may drive a generator, hydraulic pump or other power generation device. A strut or other extension member supports the turbine away from the aircraft. The generator or hydraulic pump may be supported within the RAT assembly and driven by a shaft extending from a gearbox driven by the turbine. During operation, a turbine may encounter cyclical loads that are in turn transmitted through the gearbox and corresponding gear interfaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A disclosed ram air turbine assembly includes a spacer that controls axial movement of a bearing assembly supporting rotation of a driven shaft to limit compression of a bearing biasing member. A turbine drives a generator through a gearbox responsive to airflow. The gearbox includes mating gears that transfer power through a driveshaft to the generator.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a ram air turbine <b>10</b> is generally indicated and is movable between a stowed position within an aircraft <b>12</b> and a deployed position shown. The ram air turbine <b>10</b> includes a turbine <b>14</b> with blades <b>16</b> that rotate responsive to air flow. The turbine <b>14</b> is suspended on a strut <b>18</b>. The strut <b>18</b> supports a gearbox <b>24</b> that transmits power from the turbine <b>14</b> to a generator <b>23</b> mounted within a generator housing <b>22</b>. The strut <b>18</b> is attached to the generator housing <b>22</b> that is pivotally attached to support member <b>20</b> of the aircraft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosed example includes a generator <b>23</b>; however the turbine <b>14</b> could also be utilized to drive a hydraulic pump or other power generation or conversion device. The ram air turbine <b>10</b> is moved to the deployed position shown such that airflow through the turbine blades <b>16</b> drive the turbine <b>14</b> which in turn drives a turbine shaft <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) extending into gearbox <b>24</b>. The gearbox <b>24</b> in turn transmits power with a driveshaft up through strut <b>18</b> to drive the example generator <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the turbine shaft <b>26</b> is supported for rotation about an axis <b>17</b> by bearing assemblies <b>30</b>. The turbine shaft <b>26</b> supports a turbine gear <b>28</b>. In this example the turbine gear <b>28</b> is connected to the turbine shaft <b>26</b> using a keyway and drives a pinion gear <b>34</b> that is supported on a corresponding pinion shaft <b>32</b>. The example turbine gear <b>28</b> and pinion gear <b>34</b> are bevel gears that engage at an angle relative to the axis of rotation <b>17</b> of the turbine shaft <b>26</b> and axis <b>15</b> about which the pinion shaft <b>32</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The pinion shaft <b>32</b> extends upward from the gearbox <b>24</b> through the strut <b>18</b> to drive the generator within the generator housing <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The pinion shaft <b>32</b> is supported for rotation relative to the turbine shaft <b>26</b> within the gearbox <b>24</b> by a lower pinion bearing assembly <b>36</b> and an upper pinion bearing assembly <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The upper and lower pinion bearing assemblies <b>38</b>, <b>36</b> not only support rotation of the pinion shaft <b>32</b> but also control axial thrust generated during operation. The lower bearing assembly <b>36</b> and upper bearing assembly <b>38</b> control axial movement of the pinion shaft <b>32</b> and thereby the pinion gear <b>34</b> that may occur responsive to driving engagement between the turbine gear <b>28</b> and the pinion gear <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the example upper bearing assembly <b>38</b> includes an inner race <b>40</b> that is pressed or fixed to the pinion shaft <b>32</b>. A set of balls <b>44</b> are supported between the inner race <b>40</b> and an outer race <b>42</b>. The upper bearing assembly <b>38</b> is supported within a retainer <b>46</b>. In this example, the retainer <b>46</b> is constructed of an aluminum material. Within the retainer <b>46</b> is disposed a liner <b>48</b>. The example liner <b>48</b> is fabricated from a stainless steel material to provide desired durability and wear characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Rotation of the pinion shaft <b>32</b> as driven by the turbine shaft <b>26</b> results in an axial thrust load along the axis <b>15</b> in the direction indicated by arrows <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. Normal axial thrust is in the direction of arrow <b>62</b> towards a center point of engagement between turbine gear <b>28</b> and the pinion gear <b>34</b>. However, the torque loads between the turbine shaft <b>26</b> and the driving engagement of the pinion shaft <b>32</b> with the generator <b>23</b> can cause a reversal of the axial load on the pinion shaft <b>32</b> as is indicated by arrow <b>64</b>. A reversal in the axial loads on the pinion shaft <b>32</b> can cause misalignment between the pinion gear <b>34</b> and the turbine gear <b>28</b>. Misalignment in turn may cause increased wear of the meshing gear teeth of the turbine gear <b>28</b> and pinion gear <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A biasing member is utilized that generates a biasing &#x2018;preload&#x2019; force in the direction indicated by arrow <b>60</b>. The arrow <b>60</b> points in a direction generally toward a center point of the engagement interface between the turbine gear <b>28</b> and the pinion gear <b>34</b>. In this example, the biasing member comprises a wavy spring <b>52</b> that is disposed within an annular space <b>54</b> between a spacer <b>50</b> and the sleeve <b>48</b> disposed in the retainer <b>46</b>. The wavy spring <b>52</b> is disposed within the annular space <b>54</b> defined by the spacer <b>50</b>. As appreciated, although a wavy spring <b>52</b> is shown in this disclosed example, other biasing members such as coil springs, resilient material or other known biasing members.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The annular space <b>54</b> defined by the spacer <b>50</b> is defined by a lip <b>68</b> that extends axially from a shoulder <b>70</b>. The shoulder <b>70</b> defines a seat on which the wavy spring <b>52</b> exerts its biasing force downward onto the outer race <b>42</b> of the bearing assembly <b>38</b>. The lip <b>68</b> includes an inner surface <b>65</b> that defines a first inner diameter <b>74</b>. The spacer <b>50</b> includes a bottom surface <b>72</b> that is in direct abutting contact with a first surface <b>75</b> of the outer race <b>42</b> of the bearing assembly <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The spacer <b>50</b> is disposed about the pinion shaft <b>32</b> with the lip <b>68</b> disposed on a radially innermost portion of the shoulder <b>70</b>. The lip <b>68</b> extends the axial distance <b>56</b> from the shoulder <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) that is less than the overall axial width <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) of the annular space defined within the retainer <b>46</b> such that a gap <b>58</b> allows some axial movement of the upper bearing assembly <b>38</b> and pinion shaft <b>32</b>. Reversal of axial thrust forces in the direction indicated by arrow <b>64</b> could flatten out the wavy spring <b>52</b>. However, the annular space <b>54</b> defined by the lip <b>68</b> of the spacer <b>50</b> prevents complete compression of the wavy spring <b>52</b>. Instead, the example lip <b>68</b> that extends the axial distance <b>56</b> from the shoulder <b>70</b> defines a maximum compression height allowable for the wavy spring <b>52</b>. The lip <b>68</b> will contact the sleeve <b>48</b> prior to the wavy spring <b>52</b> reaching a fully compressed or flattened state. The wavy spring <b>52</b> remains safely within the annular space <b>54</b> defined by the lip <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The retainer <b>46</b> also includes an upper annular cavity <b>65</b> that houses a lip seal <b>66</b>. The lip seal <b>66</b> is biased against the outer surface of the rotating pinion shaft <b>32</b>. The lip seal <b>66</b> provides a desired seal to prevent lubricants from leaving the gearbox or other external contaminants from entering the gearbox and interfering with operation of the bearing assembly <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the example disclosed spacer <b>50</b> is generally ring shaped and includes a first inner diameter <b>74</b> that extends to a second inner diameter <b>76</b> that is larger than the first inner diameter <b>74</b>. An angled surface <b>82</b> extends at an angle <b>86</b> between the first and second diameters <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. The angle <b>86</b> in a non-limiting dimensional embodiment is provided in range between 60&#xb0; and 70&#xb0;. The bottom surface <b>72</b> is disposed radially outward from the second inner diameter <b>76</b> to an outer diameter <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a non-limiting dimensional embodiment the outer diameter <b>84</b> is provided within a range of 2.439 inches (61.95 mm) and 2.429 inches (61.70 mm) and the inner diameter <b>74</b> is provided in a range between 1.850 inches (46.99 mm) and 1.830 inches (46.48 mm). A ratio of the outer diameter <b>84</b> to the inner diameter <b>74</b> being between 1.31 and 1.33.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a non-limiting dimensional embodiment, the inner diameter <b>76</b> is provided within a range of 2.205 inches (56.01 mm) and 2.25 inches (57.15 mm). A ratio between the outer diameter <b>84</b> and the inner diameter <b>76</b> is between 1.091 and 1.106. As appreciated, the example may be scaled in size to tailor the spacer configuration to application specific requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The ratios between the outer diameter <b>84</b> and the two inner diameters <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> define the surface <b>72</b> that abuts the outer race of the <b>42</b>. Accordingly, the dimensions of the surface <b>72</b> provide the desired durability and wear properties of the spacer <b>50</b>. Moreover, the lip <b>68</b> is defined between the inner diameter <b>74</b> and an outer diameter <b>90</b>. In a non-limiting embodiment, the outer diameter <b>90</b> is defined within a range of 1.990 inches (50.55 mm) and 1.970 inches (50.04 mm) and is in concert with the inner diameter <b>74</b> defines the surface area of the lip <b>68</b> that contacts the retainer <b>46</b> in the event of a thrust reversal. In this disclosed example, a ratio of the outer diameter <b>90</b> to the inner diameter <b>74</b> is between 1.06 and 1.09.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The spacer <b>50</b> includes the shoulder <b>70</b> and the lip <b>68</b> that extends from the shoulder <b>70</b>. The lip <b>68</b> defines the axial distance <b>56</b> (Also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The axial distance <b>56</b> is determined relative to the biasing member, in this disclosed example the wavy spring <b>52</b>. The axial distance <b>56</b> is determined to provide a minimum compressed height of the wavy spring <b>52</b>. In other words, the maximum compression of the wavy spring <b>52</b> is attained only when the lip <b>68</b> comes into contact with the corresponding surface of the liner <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The lip <b>68</b> is defined as the axial distance <b>56</b> from the shoulder <b>70</b> and is related to the overall width <b>88</b> of the spacer <b>50</b> to provide a desired space for the biasing member <b>52</b>. In one non-limiting embodiment the distance <b>56</b> is provided in a range between 0.072 inches (1.83 mm) and 0.082 inches (2.08 mm) and the overall width <b>88</b> is provided in a range between 0.180 inches (4.57 mm) and 0.170 inches (4.32 mm). A ratio of the total width <b>88</b> relative to the distance <b>56</b> being between 2.95 and 3.64.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The lip <b>68</b> limits and controls movement of the bearing assembly <b>38</b> in response to axial thrust reversal indicated by the arrow <b>64</b>. The biasing wavy spring <b>52</b> the bearing assembly <b>38</b> towards the center of the interface between the pinion gear <b>34</b> and the turbine gear <b>28</b>. However, when the axial thrust force indicated by <b>64</b> exceeds the biasing force of the wavy spring <b>52</b>, the spacer <b>50</b> and lip <b>68</b> prevent over compression of the wavy spring <b>52</b> in the interim until the axial thrust forces return to the direction indicated by arrow <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the example bearing assembly <b>38</b> is a component part of a replaceable unit supported within the retainer <b>46</b>. The retainer <b>46</b> includes the liner <b>48</b> and the bearing assembly <b>38</b> including the inner outer races and the ball <b>44</b> disposed therebetween. The liner <b>48</b> is provided between the bearing assembly <b>38</b> and the inner surface of the retainer <b>46</b>. The liner <b>48</b> is provided in this example to provide a wear bearing surface that is more durable than the retainer assembly <b>46</b>. In this example, the retainer <b>46</b> is fabricated from an aluminum material for weight saving purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The retainer <b>46</b> also defines an external groove <b>78</b> that supports a seal <b>80</b>. During maintenance operations the entire containment case <b>46</b> can be removed and replaced. Alternatively, the retainer <b>46</b> may be removed so that the wavy spring <b>52</b> and bearing assembly <b>38</b> may be replaced followed by reinstallation of the retainer <b>46</b> about the pinion shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As appreciated, although the example retainer <b>46</b> is fabricated from aluminum material, the example retainer <b>46</b> may also be fabricated from other material to relieve the need for the use of another part as is disclosed as the liner <b>48</b>. In such an instance, the retainer <b>46</b> would include dimensions that support and hold the bearing assembly <b>38</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, the wavy spring <b>52</b> provides the desired bias on the bearing assembly <b>38</b> to counter thrust reversals and maintain a desired relative orientation between the pinion gear <b>34</b> and turbine gear <b>28</b>. Moreover, the example spacer <b>50</b> prevents over compression of the wavy spring <b>52</b> in a manner that provides an increase in durability. Additionally, the spacer <b>50</b> limits maximum movement of the bearing assembly <b>38</b> in response to possible thrust reversals during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although an example embodiment has been disclosed, a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this disclosure. For that reason, the following claims should be studied to determine the scope and content of this invention.</p>
