<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Several new and useful concepts for a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair are provided. In one concept, the vehicle is configured to be selectively placed in an automatic lock condition in which (i) the wheel chair can move in a conventional manner while an occupant is seated in the wheel chair, and (ii) the wheel chair is automatically locked against movement when an occupant begins to rise from a seated position on the wheel chair. In another concept, a particularly secure structure is provided for locking the wheel of the wheel chair against movement. In yet another concept, important components of the wheel chair are formed in a manner that facilitates assembly of those components into the wheel chair, by an internal fastening system and in a modular fashion.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to new and useful structures, components and methods for constructing and operating a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair, including (a) structures, components and methods for automatically locking the wheels of the vehicle when the occupant starts to get out of the vehicle, (b) locking components for locking the wheel of the vehicle against movement, and (c) components of the vehicle that are designed to facilitate assembly of those components into the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wheel chairs used to transport persons that are mobility-impaired have been available for over a century. The first wheel chairs were bulky, heavy and difficult to maneuver. In 1932 the first tubular formed frame wheel chair that was lighter and easier to maneuver was introduced by Harry Jennings. Of necessity, it used folding mechanisms consisting of moveable joints and linkages, etc. to connect the side frames of the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the applicants' experience, there are currently two commonly used wheel chair designs&#x2014;the cross brace folding wheel chair and the welded rigid frame wheel chair. Today's disabled population demands lighter, more durable, maneuverable, transportable and utilitarian wheel chairs. Towards that end, in the 1970s a conceptually new wheel chair with a rigid frame was introduced. The wheel chair's side frames are secured to each other by rigid elements (tubes, bars, etc.) by means of welding, which provide a rigid wheel chair without a folding mechanism; such welded rigid frame design may be more expensive due to higher manufacturing costs. However, the absence of a folding mechanism provides the following advantages:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">increased strength and durability (fewer moving parts)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">increased energy efficiency (folding mechanism absorbed energy needed to propel the chair)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">decreased weight (fewer parts)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">increased maneuverability</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0009">increased stability</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0010">increased comfort.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0011">Examples of wheel chairs that utilize welded joints are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,840390 and 4,981,305 issued to Lockard et al. A sports wheel chair is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,102 issued to Haury et al that includes a one piece, welded tubular frame assembly. Another U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,321 issued to Haury discloses a similar sports wheel chair construction. Another welded wheel chair frame is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,964 issued to Horn for a wheel chair propelled by rowing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0012">There are also wheel chairs that are modular in design and can change widths of the wheel chair with little difficulty. For example, there is a design that converts from a user-propelled wheel chair to an assistant-propelled wheel chair (see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,294,141). There is also a wheel chair that converts the riding position from the standard seating position to a recumbent position (see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,175). In addition, there is a weld-free folding wheel chair that folds in a non-conventional manner but is not modular (U.S. Pat. No. 4,682,783). Another wheel chair design appears to be a weld-free design that allows the wheel chair to adjust to different needs by use of special shaped bars and plates but in the applicants' view is limited to width and depth adjustment (U.S. Pat. No. 5,743,545).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0013">Also, there are several U.S. patents that claim to be modular, allowing for different components to be used to build the chair to the user's needs. Among these is a rigid frame wheel chair (U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,598), but applicants believe this wheel chair does not convert or adapt to the extent of the current invention. A folding frame wheel chair that is moveable between and upper normal sitting position and a lower reclining position that does not utilize welds is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,175 issued to Nicholson, et al. However, such a chair is a folding frame wheel chair. While it includes no welds, it is secured together by means of pivoted members or linkages that render the chair construction less stable and less secure. In applicants' view, the chair has all of the disadvantages of the folding frame wheel chairs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">Also known are numerous clamping element designs for securing two or more tubular members to each other. By way of example only, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,515,497 issued to Guillemot et. al. for a clamping element for releasable fastening of spatially arranged, or parallel bars, tubes, and similar objects; U.S. Pat. No. 4,039,263 issued to Bassler for a connector arrangement for a minimum of three struts along the spatial axes; U.S. Pat. No. 4,294,561 to Chapman et al for a jointing member for frame systems; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,597,140 and 4,597,690 issued to Girard for tube clamps; U.S. Pat. No. 3,423,113 issued to Gonsalves et. al. for a connection for tubular members; U.S. Pat. No. 4,784,511 issued to Greene for a connector for tubular frame members; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,216,752 issued to Rifken for coupling means for building frameworks, racks, scaffolds, and the like. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,638 issued to Zalesak, inexpensive, molded plastic shells for corners and elbows is disclosed. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,253,888 Friedrich discloses a tubular rigid wheel chair system secured by mating semi-cylindrical shells that can be readily disassembled for transport or repair, but not readily foldable for daily use. In this invention, a series of specially designed clamps had to be utilized that were not universal, and bolts were clearly visible, detracting from the appearance of the wheel chair. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,105 Friedrich discloses a wheel chair system that is constructed with distortion-free connectors and that can be configured or adapted to a multitude of end user configurations, still using the tubular construction typical for wheel chairs of this era. Schlangen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,769,705 discloses a rigid non-foldable wheel chair with a system of longitudinal beams to which tubes are attached so that the seat, frame and footrests are releasably connected with supports without welding members, held together instead with expansion devices. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,187 Vassilli discloses a modular wheel chair construction of low cost tubes assembled with exposed rivets and screws constructed without welding.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0015">Notwithstanding the fact that numerous clamps have been proposed for securing tubular members to each other, in applicants' experience the wheel chair industry has continued to rely on welded frame construction for rigid wheel chairs. However, the welding/brazing operations have proven to be inconsistent, hazardous, time consuming and expensive. It results in metal fatigue due to crystallization/oxidation, creates a heat-effected zone next to the weld which could lead to a potential safety hazard (i.e., collapse of the chair). It also requires additional operations such as polishing/grinding, electrochemical plating, etc., all of which are hazardous to both workers and to the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0016">All of the above processes would have to be repeated in the case of an accidental failure of the chair (i.e., weld breakage), which would entail a high repair cost. Breakage of welded or brazed joints is the major cause of structural failures in welded wheel chairs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0017">Almost all manually propelled wheeled vehicles such as wheel chairs have manual wheel locks that prevent the vehicle from rolling when an occupant either attempts to sit in or rise from said vehicle. Because the physically or mentally frail state of many occupants often prevents them from engaging such locks, thereby increasing their risk for injurious falls, many such vehicles also utilize an anti-rollback apparatus. Anti-rollback apparati prevent unintended rearward chair motion when the occupant is attempting to exit or enter said vehicle. Prior constructs to create a self-locking anti-rollback system for self-propelled vehicles such as wheel chairs have suffered from a variety of disadvantages. Some such as U.S. Pat. No. 2,426,451 disclosed by Hammack, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,227 by Knoche, rely on pressure on the armrest to lock the chair, which does not take into account when an occupant might get off of the seat by pulling on something like their bed rather than pushing on the armrest. Some disclosures such as U.S. Pat. No. 6,315,085 by Dahlem and U.S. Pat. No. 6,431,572 by Harden require pushing a seat lever out of the occupant's way that engages the brake before they can exit the chair, creating an obstacle for the confused patient. Some disclosures such as Marshall's U.S. Pat. No. 3,529,700, and Kuilk's U.S. Pat. No. 4,852,697 only allow the assistant from behind to lock or unlock the device. Many examples exist of prior attempts to engage the large diameter driving wheel hub as the locking region, requiring intricate and expensive construction or adaptations of existing vehicles such as U.S. Pat. No. 3,897,857 disclosed by Rodaway, U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,825 by Lemarie, U.S. Pat. No. 5,203,433 by Dugas, U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,756 by Roberts, U.S. Pat. No. 6,012,555 by Duran, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,007 by Norton. Others require volitional (non-automatic) locking of the hub brake as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,379,866 by Pearce, U.S. Pat. No. 5,984,334 by Dugas, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,341,671 as disclosed by Ebersole. Some automatic locking devices require levers under the seat that are potentially uncomfortable or prone to cause pressure sores as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,894,912 by Dugas, U.S. Pat No. 6,092,824 by Ritchie, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,066,482 by Ford. Other patent disclosures will not allow the wheel chair to collapse and fold when added onto the wheel chair as in U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,824 by Ritchie. Still others focus their attention to the large diameter driving wheel rim or tire itself, but are too complex as is U.S. Pat. No. 4,623,043 by Babilas, or are just for caregiver operation as add-ons to the vehicle as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,852,697 by Kulik. Others such as U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,138 by Duran, or U.S. Pat. No. 6,739,610 by Connors work by leveraging arms into the ground surface when the patient gets up. What is needed is an efficient, simple, reliable, unobtrusive, inexpensive self-locking anti-rollback system for self-propelled vehicles such as wheel chairs that will prevent an incapacitated occupant from experiencing rollaway of their vehicle when exiting or entering same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">The present invention provides new and useful structure, components and method concepts for a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair, designed in light of the foregoing background. Specifically, the present invention relates to new and useful structures, components and methods for constructing and operating a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair, including (a) structures, components and methods for automatically locking the wheels of the vehicle when the occupant starts to get out of the vehicle, (b) locking components for locking the wheel of the vehicle against movement, and (c) components of the vehicle that are designed to facilitate assembly of those components into the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0019">In one of its aspects, the present invention provides a new and useful paradigm for automatically locking a vehicle such as a wheel chair against movement whenever an occupant starts to get out of the wheel chair. More particularly, the present invention provides an automatic braking assembly and anti-rollback feature for a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair, that is designed to protect an occupant who has not manually braked the wheel chair before attempting to get out of the wheel chair. The automatic braking assembly is designed automatically to brake the wheels of the wheel chair when an occupant starts to rise from a seated position on the wheel chair. Once the wheels are braked, the automatic braking assembly will not allow the wheels to roll until the automatic braking assembly is intentionally disengaged. Thus, the automatic braking assembly will prevent the wheel chair from sliding away from the occupant as the occupant dismounts from or remounts the wheel chair, and will not allow motion or rollback of the wheel chair until the braking system is volitionally released. Therefore, the automatic braking assembly should help minimize risk of injuries to occupants of wheel chairs. The automatic braking assembly may be readily disengaged for use by those occupants or attendants who may have no need for it, in which case the wheel chair will functions exactly like any other wheel chair with a conventional, manually actuated braking system, i.e., it rolls until it is volitionally locked.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">Thus, according to this aspect of the present invention, a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair is configured to be selectively placed in an automatic lock condition in which (i) the vehicle can move in a conventional manner while an occupant is seated in the vehicle, and (ii) the vehicle is automatically locked against movement when an occupant begins to rise from a seated position on the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">The vehicle preferably has an automatic braking assembly that has a cocked position in which an auto lock brake device is disengaged from the wheel of the vehicle, and is automatically moved to a locked condition in which it locks the vehicle against movement when an occupant begins to rise from a seated position on the vehicle. The vehicle includes a seat rail disposed over a chair rail, the seat rail resting on the chair rail when an occupant is seated in the vehicle and the automatic braking assembly is in the cocked position. The seat and chair rails are assembled with each other and with the frame of the vehicle so that they will automatically separate in a predetermined manner when an occupant begins to rise from a seated position. When the seat and chair rails separate in that predetermined manner, the automatic braking device is actuated automatically, and the auto lock brake device is automatically moved to the locked condition, in which it locks a wheel of the vehicle against movement. The automatic braking assembly preferably includes a lock tensioning structure in which a tension spring that is being held in tension is released and causes the auto lock brake device to lock the wheel of the vehicle against movement when an occupant begins to rise from the vehicle, and the automatic braking assembly is configured to tension the spring and hold the tension spring in tension while the seat rail is resting on the chair rail and the automatic braking assembly is in a cocked position; in such a manner that tension in the tension spring is released when the occupant begins to rise from the vehicle and the seat rail is automatically pivoted relative to the chair rail.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">In another aspect of the present invention, the chair rail and the seat rail are each formed of relatively rigid members that can be (a) connected to each other with mechanical fasteners, in a way that enables them to move relative to each other in a predetermined manner, and (b) assembled with the wheel chair frame in a manner that enables them to move relative to each other in the predetermined manner, while being supported and guided by the wheel chair frame. The relatively rigid members that form the chair rail and the seat rail preferably comprise extruded T-slotted aluminum members. This aspect of the present invention addresses the types of issues discussed above with respect to welded wheel chair frames, and also provides structural concepts that can be used to retrofit existing wheel chairs with the type of automatic braking assembly described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a new form of auto lock brake device for a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair. The auto lock brake device has multi edge brake surfaces (e.g. 2 brake surfaces in the preferred embodiment) that are integral parts of the auto lock brake device, and are brought into contact with a wheel of the vehicle to lock the wheel against movement. The multi edge brake surfaces are configured to substantially simultaneously contact portions of the vehicle wheel that are spaced apart about the periphery of the wheel, so that all of the multi edge brake surfaces provide locking force against the wheel. Thus, unlike conventional wheel chairs, that use a single brake blade as a braking mechanism, the present invention is designed to provide a more secure braking structure that is less likely to lose its braking power from repeated use than a locking mechanism that is a single brake blade.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">In addition, the present invention provides a new and useful internal fastening system, by which frame components of a vehicle such as a wheel chair can be connected with each other, by means of one or more mechanical fasteners that are located substantially inside the frame components.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved automatic braking assembly for manually propelled vehicles such as wheel chairs that enables a vehicle to remain stationary until it is unlocked for travel, and is automatically locked when an occupant starts to rise from a seated position on the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">Moreover, it is another object of the present invention to provide a new and useful concept for locking the wheel of a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a vehicle such as a wheel chair with important structural features (e.g. a modular frame formed of frame components that are secured together by a new internal fastening system; a chair and seal rail assembly, which forms part of the automatic braking assembly that can be conveniently assembled with the vehicle frame in a manner that enables the chair and seat rails to move relative to each other in a predetermined manner while being supported and guided by the vehicle frame.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0050">As discussed above, the present invention provides new and useful structure and method concepts for a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair. The principles of the present invention are described below in connection with a wheel chair, and from that description, the manner in which the principles of the present invention can be applied to various similar types of manually propelled vehicles will be apparent to those in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates one version of a wheel chair <b>100</b> configured according to the principles of the present invention. The wheel chair <b>100</b> comprises a wheel chair with a seat <b>118</b>, and a wheel chair rear vertical frame <b>106</b> that provides a back structure for the wheel chair. A pair of large rear wheels <b>108</b> are supported on the wheel chair rear vertical frame <b>106</b>, in an orientation such that they can be conveniently manually manipulated by a wheel chair occupant. A pair of front wheels <b>110</b>, of conventional design, are supported at the bottom of a pair of front vertical frames <b>107</b> and base horizontal rail and foot rests <b>115</b>, at the front of the wheel chair. The front vertical frames <b>107</b> and the base horizontal rail and foot rests <b>115</b> are preferably T-slotted aluminum members. The wheel chair <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is different from a traditional wheel chair for a medical patient, in that the wheel chair does not include armrests. However, the wheel chair <b>100</b> can function as an aisle chair of the type used to transport a person with physical impediment(s) along the aisle of an aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the wheel chair <b>100</b> has a new and useful automatic braking assembly <b>112</b> on each side of the wheel chair, that is associated with a respective one of the rear wheels <b>108</b>. In addition, the wheel chair has a chair rail <b>114</b> and a seat rail <b>116</b> on each side of the seat <b>118</b>. The seat rails <b>116</b> support the seat <b>118</b> for the vehicle occupant, by means of T-slotted locking nuts <b>119</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>) that attach the seat <b>118</b> to the seat rails <b>116</b>. The seat rails <b>116</b> are disposed over the chair rails <b>114</b>. The automatic braking assembly <b>112</b> on each side of the wheel chair is integrated with (i.e. assembled with) the chair rail <b>114</b>, and the seat rail <b>116</b> on that side of the wheel chair, in the manner described in more detail below. When an occupant is seated in the wheel chair, and the wheel chair is being propelled along a surface, weight of the occupant causes the seat rails <b>116</b> to normally rest directly on the chair rails <b>114</b>. In that condition, the automatic braking assemblies <b>112</b> can each be in a cocked or disengaged condition, and the wheel chair can be manually manipulated like a conventional wheel chair. However, when an occupant starts to rise from the seat <b>118</b>, the seat and chair rails <b>116</b>, <b>114</b> automatically separate, in a manner described further herein, and an auto lock device <b>126</b>, forming part of each automatic braking assembly <b>112</b> automatically engages and locks a respective one of the rear wheels <b>108</b> against movement, so that the occupant can get out of the wheel chair without injury. As schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when an occupant starts to rise from the seat <b>118</b>, the seat and chair rails are biased automatically to separate, preferably by pivoting of the seat rail <b>116</b> relative to the chair rail <b>114</b>, to automatically initiate operation of each automatic braking assembly <b>112</b> to lock the wheels <b>108</b> against movement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates the front of one seat rail <b>116</b> pivoted to about &#x215b; inch above the chair rail <b>114</b> (about a fulcrum at the rear of the seat and chair rails), and as the seat rail pivots, the automatic braking assembly <b>112</b> forces a respective auto lock brake device <b>126</b> against a respective rear wheel <b>108</b>, to automatically locks the rear wheel <b>108</b> against movement, thereby enabling the occupant to exit the wheel chair without risk of rollback or any other movement of the wheel(s) <b>108</b> that could affect the occupant's exit from the wheel chair.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-22</figref> further illustrate details of one of the automatic braking assemblies <b>112</b>, according to the principles of the present invention. A manually operated hand brake lever <b>120</b> connected with a brake platform <b>129</b> operates a manual brake overthrow mechanism <b>122</b> that manipulates a brake blade <b>124</b> for locking the wheel <b>108</b> of the wheel chair. The overthrow mechanism <b>122</b> and the brake blade <b>124</b> are both of conventional design for a wheel chair. In addition, the manually operated hand lever <b>120</b> can be manually manipulated relative to the brake platform <b>129</b> to cock an auto lock brake device <b>126</b> to an automatic locking armed condition, and also to move the brake blade <b>124</b> to an unlocked condition. The auto lock brake device <b>126</b> comprises a relatively rigid structure (e.g. metal) with multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> at an end of the auto lock brake device <b>126</b>. In the illustrated example, there are two multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> at the end of the auto lock brake device. When the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> is triggered, e.g. by an occupant starting to rise from the seat <b>118</b>, the multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> are rapidly forced into contact with the wheel <b>108</b> (virtually simultaneously), to lock the wheel against movement. The automatic braking assembly also includes a brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b> connected to the brake platform <b>129</b>, an auto lock floating pin <b>146</b>, described further below, and a tension spring assembly, also described further below. Also, the chair rails <b>114</b> and the seat rail <b>116</b> are preferably formed of extruded material such as extruded aluminum, and have cross sectional configurations as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with a T-slot <b>134</b> along the bottom of the chair rail <b>114</b>. The brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b> fits into the T-slot <b>134</b> and can slide along the bottom of the chair rail <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, when the hand lever <b>120</b> is manipulated to cock and release the auto lock brake device <b>126</b>, the automatic braking assembly <b>112</b> is in a condition where the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> (with its multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b>) is spaced from the wheel <b>108</b>, and the auto lock brake device is cocked and in condition to be forced into locking engagement with the wheel if an occupant starts to rise from the seat <b>118</b> of the wheel chair. The hand lever <b>120</b> can also be manipulated to unlock the brake blade <b>124</b> (preferably as the automatic braking assembly is being cocked); so that the wheel chair is in a more traditional wheel chair state where it can be propelled in a traditional fashion. As shown from the locking sequence of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, the automatic locking function is initiated by a wheel chair occupant starting to rise from the wheel chair. As the occupant starts to rise, the chair and seat rails automatically separate (e.g. by pivoting about a fulcrum), and the multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> on the auto lock brake devices <b>126</b> are driven automatically into engagement with respective wheels <b>108</b>, to securely lock the wheels against movement.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">As further illustrated in the Figures, the manual brake lever <b>120</b> is connected to the brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b>, and a tension spring assembly, which forms part of the automatic braking assembly, includes (a) a tension spring <b>140</b> that extends between one of a pair of slider bolts <b>142</b> that are fixed to the auto lock brake slider bearing <b>130</b> and (b) an adjustment plate <b>144</b> that is fixed to the chair rail <b>114</b> in a selected position. When the manual brake lever <b>120</b> is being manipulated to cock (or arm) the automatic braking assembly, the slider bearing <b>130</b> is pulled to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-22</figref>. The seat rail <b>116</b> carries a floating pin <b>146</b> that can move vertically within the seat rail <b>116</b> unless engaged with the brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b> in the manner described below. The floating pin <b>146</b> is disengaged from the slider bearing <b>130</b> until the slider bearing moves far enough away from the tension spring adjustment plate that the floating pin can fall into a hole <b>132</b> in the brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b>. As the brake platform slider bearing moves away from the tension spring adjustment plate <b>144</b>, the tension spring <b>140</b> is tensioned, and when the floating pin <b>146</b> falls into the opening in the slider bearing, the tension in the tension spring <b>140</b> is held or maintained, so that the auto lock is now armed or cocked. In that state, whenever an occupant seeks to rise from the chair, a compression lift spring <b>150</b> on each side of the wheel chair that has been compressed between the seat rail <b>116</b> and the chair rail <b>114</b> applies a biasing force to the seat and chair rails that causes the front end of the seat rail to separate (i.e. pivot away) from the chair rail. Thus, releases the floating pin <b>146</b> from the brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b>, resulting in tension spring <b>140</b> pulling hard on the brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b>, and thereby pulling or driving the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> with the multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> into the wheel <b>108</b>, to lock the wheel against movement.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">The following further features of the wheel chair should also be noted:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0057">a. It should be clear from the foregoing description that the automatic braking assembly <b>112</b> on each side of the wheel chair effectively encompasses the various parts and components that are connected with the brake platform <b>129</b> (or with an element such as the slider bearing <b>130</b> that is fixed to the brake platform).</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0058">b. The chair rail <b>114</b>, brake platform <b>129</b>, and seat rail <b>116</b> are each preferably formed as an extruded aluminum component formed with a configuration known as a 3 T-slotted configuration, which is a well known configuration for an extruded aluminum component.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0059">c. Each of the front and rear vertical frame members <b>107</b>, <b>106</b>, each of the base horizontal rail and foot rests <b>115</b>, and each of a pair of handles <b>101</b> at the upper ends of the rear vertical frame members <b>106</b>, are preferably lightweight members, preferably formed of T-slotted aluminum members, that are connected together by mechanical fasteners, preferably with an internal fastening system described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, so that the wheel chair frame is essentially a modular structure, with an aesthetically pleasing external appearance that is relatively free of exposed parts and edges, as also described below. Also, the seat and chair rails <b>116</b>, <b>114</b>, that support and form part of the automatic braking assemblies <b>112</b>, are also preferably T-slotted aluminum members that are (a) connected to each other in a manner that enables them to move relative to each other in a predetermined manner, and (b) assembled with the vehicle frame in a manner that enables them to move relative to each other in the predetermined manner while being supported and guided by the vehicle frame.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0060">d. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>, the end of the tension spring <b>140</b> that connects to the adjustment plate <b>144</b> is secured to a specially formed T-slot locking nut <b>145</b> that has a locking pin <b>145</b>A that is configured and oriented to be engaged by one end of the tension spring <b>140</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the end of the tension spring extends through an opening (or orifice) <b>145</b>B in the T-slot locking nut <b>145</b>, to enable the end of the spring to hook about the locking pin <b>145</b>A.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0061">e. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the bottom of the chair rail <b>114</b> has one or more tightening tool access holes <b>147</b>, that enable a tightening tool to tighten various components together (e.g. to tighten a rail to one of the rear vertical rails <b>106</b> by the internal fastening system described herein).</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0062">f. The brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b> has an extension that fits inside a channel in the chair rail, and is formed of a material that can slide along the bottom of the chair rail with minimal wear of the material.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0063">g. The extruded aluminum components that form the chair rail <b>114</b> and the seat rail <b>116</b> can be pivotally connected to each other, in a manner that is simulated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> to illustrate the parts that are hinged together, but which in practice would be located to allow those rails to pivot relative to each other, as part of the auto lock function, in a manner that integrates the hinge into the wheel chair structure. Also, as shown in those figures, the seat rail <b>116</b> pivots between a position in which it rests directly on top of the chair rail <b>114</b> (and compresses the compression lift spring <b>150</b>), to a position in which its front end is raised above the chair rail (by the compression lift spring) when the occupant begins to rise from the wheel chair, to enable the multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> on the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> to automatically engage the wheels and lock the wheel chair against movement.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0064">h. Structural components such as the vertical rear frame <b>106</b> and some of the rails, can be assembled together by conventional fasteners, e.g. screws, nuts and bolts, thereby eliminating the need to weld the components, and by the internal fastening system described herein, in a way that makes the chair structure convenient and efficient to assemble, without requiring a skilled welder. Also, with the foregoing structure, structural components such as seat rails and chair rails may be able to be retrofitted to at least some existing wheel chairs, so that the benefits of the auto locking device of the present invention can be retrofit to those wheel chairs.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0009" num="0065">i. The multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> that form part of the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> are designed to be particularly strong and secure in locking the wheel chair against movement when the occupant starts to rise from the wheel chair. Specifically, when the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> is pulled or triggered, the multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> are forced substantially simultaneously into engagement with spaced apart portions of the vehicle wheel(s) <b>108</b>, and this provides a particularly secure lock on the wheel(s) of the wheel chair.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0010" num="0066">j. In operation, once the automatic braking assembly has been triggered to lock the wheels <b>108</b>, it remains locked until it is released by the handle mechanism. Thus, when an occupant is being seated in the wheel chair, the wheels remain locked. Once an occupant is seated, and wants to propel the chair, the handle <b>120</b> is rotated in a manner that pulls the brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b> in a direction that tensions the tension spring <b>140</b>, and the slider bearing <b>130</b> can continue to move and tension the tension spring until the floating pin <b>146</b> falls into the slot <b>132</b> in the brake platform slider bearing <b>130</b>. In that condition, the automatic locking assembly is cocked or armed. However, the wheel chair is still manually locked, until the handle <b>120</b> is pulled backward to pull the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> with the multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> away from engagement with the wheel (that action also pulls the traditional manual locking blade <b>124</b> away from the wheel), so that the wheel chair can be propelled in a normal way. When the occupant starts to rise from the chair, the seat rail <b>116</b> is pivoted by the compression lift spring <b>150</b>, releasing the locking pin <b>146</b> from the slider bearing <b>130</b>, and allowing the tension spring <b>140</b> to propel the auto lock brake device <b>126</b> with the multi edge brake surfaces <b>128</b> into secure engagement with the wheel.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0011" num="0067">k. The foregoing components are configured to enable the amount by which the seat rail rises above the chair rail to trigger the auto lock to be selectively set. Currently, it is preferred that they are set such that when the front end of the seat rail rises approximately &#x215b; inch from the chair rail, the auto lock will be triggered.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A</figref>, <b>22</b>B, <b>23</b>-<b>26</b> show the application of the principles of the present invention to a folding wheel chair <b>200</b>. The folding wheel chair <b>200</b> includes a seat <b>218</b> connected to a seat rail (e.g. via T-slot locking machined nuts <b>219</b> similar to those disclosed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The wheel chair <b>200</b> has a rear vertical frame <b>206</b> that is similar to the rear vertical frame <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pair of handles <b>201</b> at the top of the rear vertical frame <b>206</b>, a pair of front vertical frames <b>207</b>, front and rear sets of wheels <b>210</b>, <b>208</b>, respectively (The rear, or main, wheels <b>208</b> have axle bearing supports <b>270</b> that support the wheels from the chair frame). Also, the wheel chair <b>200</b> has base horizontal rail and foot rests <b>215</b>, handles <b>201</b>, and a conventional brake blade <b>224</b> that are similar to the chair of the previous embodiment. In addition, the chair <b>200</b> also has arm rests comprising horizontal rails <b>266</b> and padding <b>268</b> similar to the arm rests of a conventional wheel chair.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0069">In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the wheel chair <b>200</b> includes a seat rail <b>216</b> and a chair rail <b>214</b> that are biased to separate by pivoting relative to each other about pivot formed by a hinge pin and fulcrum <b>260</b> located at the front end of the seat and chair rails and extending between those rails. The seat and chair rails are biased to separate by a torsion lift spring <b>250</b> that is secured to the inside of one of the T-slots of the T-slotted (preferably aluminum) member forming the chair rail <b>214</b> (e.g. by a lock bolt plate <b>219</b> and lock bolt <b>301</b>) and acts against the inside of one of the T-slots of T-slotted (preferably aluminum) member forming the seat rail <b>216</b> (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0070">A latch <b>256</b> is pivotally connected to each chair rail <b>214</b>, and can be manually pivoted from an unlatched condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>24</b>) to a latched condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) in which it engages (hooks about) a latching pin <b>252</b> on the associated seat rail <b>216</b>. In the latched condition, the seat and chair rails are prevented from separating under the bias of the torsion lift spring <b>250</b>. When the latch is pivoted to the unlatched condition, the seat and chair rails can pivot automatically under the bias of lift spring <b>250</b> to a condition in which the automatic braking assembly will automatically lock the wheels <b>208</b> against movement.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0071">An automatic braking assembly <b>212</b> that is generally configured and operates in a manner similar to the automated braking assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The automatic braking assembly <b>212</b> is supported by the seat and chair rails, associated with each of the rear wheels <b>208</b>, and is automatically actuated to lock a respective rear wheel when the seat and chair rails separate under the bias of the torsion lift spring <b>250</b>. The automatic braking assembly <b>212</b> is secured to a stabilizer plate <b>264</b> that is attached to the chair rail <b>214</b> by a series of attach-thru bolts. The automatic braking assembly <b>212</b> includes a tension spring <b>240</b> that is connected with an adjustment plate <b>244</b> of the automatic braking assembly <b>212</b> in the manner described and shown in connection with the chair of the previous embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When the automatic braking assembly <b>212</b> is cocked, to disengage a multi edge brake (similar to the multi-edge brake <b>126</b>) from the wheel <b>208</b>, the tension spring <b>240</b> is held in an extended state (by the same structure, and in the same manner, as in the previous embodiment). When the seat and chair rails separate, e.g. under the bias of lift spring <b>250</b> when an occupant starts to get out of the chair, the tension spring <b>240</b> is released, and forces the multi edge brake into locking engagement with a respective one of the wheels <b>208</b> to securely lock the wheel against movements.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0072">The chair rail <b>214</b> also supports a folding scissor attachment bracket <b>262</b> that enables a pair of folding scissors to be attached to the wheel chair. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, the folding scissors have a configuration similar to the folding scissors of a conventional folding wheel chair, and include a pair of scissor cross laterals <b>274</b> (that also attach to supports along the bottom rail <b>215</b> that are similar to bracket <b>262</b>), and a scissors pivot bolt <b>286</b>, that enables the cross laterals to pivot about that bolt as the chair is being folded. Also, there is a folding spanner bar <b>282</b> at the rear of the chair, that comprises a pair of bar sections that can pivot about folding hinges <b>292</b> (one of which is midway along the bar <b>282</b> and the others are attached to the rear verticals <b>206</b>) to enable the chair to be folded. When the chair is opened the spanner bar will open, and stabilize the chair in the open condition, until and unless an upward force is applied to the bottom of the middle one of the hinges <b>292</b> to initiate pivoting of the bar sections <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0073">The chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> is thus generally similar to the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the manner in which it is automatically locked against movement when an occupant starts to rise from a seated position on the chair. However, it should be noted that one important difference is that in the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, the seat and chair rails have a pivot point or fulcrum at the front of the chair, and applicants currently prefer that location for the fulcrum.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0074">Also, the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> is also different from the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in that the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> has a seat rail latch mechanism <b>256</b> at the rear of the seat and chair rails. Also, the rear of the seat and chair rails have steel slider pins bushed with durable nylon <b>254</b> that fit into T-slots in the rear vertical <b>206</b> of the chair, nylon slider bearings <b>258</b> at the front ends of the seat and chair rails that fit into T-slots in the front vertical frame members <b>207</b>. Also, the rear verticals <b>206</b> of the chair have vertical chair stop rails <b>278</b>. In addition, the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> has arm rests formed by arm rest horizontal rails <b>266</b> that are connected to the rear and front vertical frame members <b>206</b>, <b>207</b>, and arm rest padding <b>268</b> on the rails <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0075">In the operation of the wheel chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, the seat and chair rails are continuously biased by lift spring <b>250</b> to separate by pivoting about their fulcrum formed by hinge pin <b>260</b>. The nylon bushed steel slider pins <b>254</b> enable the seat and chair rails to separate at the rear of the chair (by pivoting or fulcruming about the pivot or fulcrum <b>260</b> at their front ends). The nylon bushed steel slider pins <b>254</b> and the nylon slider bearings <b>258</b> remain assembled with, and therefore supported and guided by the front and rear vertical frames. Specifically, the hinge pin <b>260</b> couples the seat and chair rails at their front ends, and enables them to pivot relative to each other (either under or against the bias of the lift spring <b>250</b>). As the seat and chair rails pivot and/or slide upward or downward along the vertical frame members <b>206</b>, <b>207</b>, the nylon slider bearing <b>258</b> slides in T-slot in the front vertical frame member <b>207</b>, and the nylon bushed slider pins <b>254</b> can slide and tilt in the T-slot in the rear vertical frame member <b>206</b>. Thus, the seat and chair rails are always supported and guided by the front and rear vertical frame members <b>207</b>, <b>206</b>. When a vehicle occupant is out of the chair, and it is desired to maneuver the chair in a traditional fashion (e.g. roll the chair, fold up the chair, etc.) the seat and chair rails are initially manipulated (manually) to press them together against the bias of spring <b>250</b>. When the seat and chair rails are pressed together, the latch <b>256</b> can be pivoted to a latched condition to maintain the seat and chair rails together. The automatic braking assembly can then be cocked to a condition where the auto lock brake device is released from locking engagement with a wheel <b>208</b> of the wheelchair. The wheel chair is then in a state in which it can be maneuvered as a traditional wheel chair, i.e. it can be wheeled along without the vehicle occupant, folded up, etc. When the wheel chair is being folded up, applying upward pressure at the middle hinge <b>292</b> of the folding spanning bar <b>282</b> will begin to fold that bar about the middle hinge <b>292</b>, which in turn will enable the folding scissors to pivot in a manner what enables the chair to be folded up. To open the wheel chair, the chair is manipulated to cause the folding scissors to open the wheel chair and as it is fully opened, the folding spanner bar <b>282</b> will effectively snap open to a condition in which it stabilizes the wheel chair in an open condition (if the latched seat and chair rails had been pulled up as the chair was being folded, they can be pressed downward toward the vertical chair rail stop <b>278</b> as the chair is being opened). Once the chair is opened, and the spanning bar is in a stabilizing condition, the latch <b>256</b> can be pivoted to the unlatched condition, which will cause the automatic braking assembly to automatically engage the wheels <b>208</b> and hold the wheel chair in a locked condition (requiring the automatic braking assembly to be cocked when an occupant is seated in the wheel chair, to place the wheel chair in a normal wheel chair operating mode).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0076">As will also be appreciated from the wheel chair constructions described and illustrated above, the wheelchair is constructed as a modular structure, with an internal fastening system, as can be particularly appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. More specifically, as schematically shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 26A</figref>, fastening between frame components is internal to those members (i.e. it is not visible to a person viewing the chair from the outside). For example, the fastening between the handles and the rear vertical <b>206</b> is by one or more screws <b>299</b> that are internal to the frame <b>206</b> and the handle (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, a screw <b>299</b> is shown prior to being inserted into a tool access hole <b>302</b> in a rear vertical <b>206</b>, and is also shown (in dashed lines) located internal to those members when it is tightened to fasten the members together. A tightening tool can access the screws through one or more tightening tool access holes <b>302</b> (similar to the holes <b>147</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>). Similar internal fasteners can be used at other fastening points, e.g. between the bottom of the rear verticals <b>206</b> and the base horizontal rails and foot rests <b>215</b>, between the horizontal arm rest rails <b>266</b> and the rear and front verticals <b>206</b>, <b>207</b>, and between the base horizontal rails and foot rests <b>215</b> and the front wheels <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0077">The foregoing internal fastening system, along with the fact that many of the components of the automatic braking assembly (e.g. tension springs, lock floating pins, slider bolts, adjustment plates, etc) are primarily located within the various rails, are substantially unobtrusive, enables the wheel chair frame to have an aesthetically pleasing appearance, minimizes the likelihood of occupant exposure to external portions of such components, while enabling those components to be accessible (e.g. via tool tightening holes similar to <b>147</b>), and also provides the wheel chair with structural integrity comparable to a wheel chair of welded components Also, the foregoing features allows an entire wheel chair to be assembled at a remote side.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0078">It should also be noted that the automatic braking assembly, including the chair rail and seat rail that form part of the automatic braking assembly, can be retrofitted onto an existing wheelchair, e.g. to add an automatic braking assembly to an existing wheelchair. Moreover, the modular wheelchair construction described above enables frame components that become damaged or worn, to be replaced, rather than having to effectively replace an entire wheelchair.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0079">While the foregoing description relates to currently preferred embodiments of a wheelchair configured according to the principles of the present invention, applicants believe there may be ways to configure the wheelchair such that it conforms even more closely to the way wheelchairs are currently constructed and operated, while still conforming to the principles described in this application. Specifically, applicants envision a spring loaded brake platform with lateral motion provided by a blade from the seat rail that penetrates the chair rail in angular manner, pushing brake platform away from the wheelchair wheel. When the seat is elevated with compression springs on exodus by the occupant, the brake platform is released, allowing impact of the multi edge brake surface with the wheel. This would remain locked until the manual locking lever is advanced while the patient is seated, again arming another compression spring that would be released again when the occupant arises. Similar to the preferred embodiment, the wheelchair is locked in its default mode, and only unlocked when intentionally done.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0080">Accordingly, the foregoing description provides a manually propelled vehicle such as a wheel chair with a locking mechanism that is automatically triggered whenever an occupant starts to rise from a seated position on the wheel chair, and also provides several new and useful structural, operation and design concepts for a vehicle such as a wheel chair. With the foregoing disclosure in mind, it is believed that various adaptations of a manually propelled vehicle, according to the principles of the present invention, will be apparent to those in the art.</p>
