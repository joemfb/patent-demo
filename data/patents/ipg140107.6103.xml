<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A computing device includes an immersive environment module for facilitating simultaneous display of a plurality of applications on a display device without relying on system chrome. At least a first of the applications is displayed in a primary region of the display. The computing device also includes a UI management component for enabling a user selection of an application for simultaneous display on the display device with at least one other application. Processing logic is configured to determine a size in at least one direction of content of a user-selected application as it is displayed on a non-primary region of the display device simultaneous with display of content of the first application on the primary region of the display device. The determination is based at least in part on one or more pre-defined size requirements specified by the selected application.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/972,611, filed on Dec. 20, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Managing applications and corresponding running items (e.g., open windows) on a computer has become increasingly difficult and burdensome, as computers are more heavily relied upon now than in the past. The availability of computers having increased computer speed and memory, in addition to improved overall computer performance over the last several years has provided users with the capability to efficiently run multiple applications at the same time, which was not practical in the past. Users can run a large variety of applications, and frequently run more than one application at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional operating systems permit users to view and interact with multiple computing applications through windows. Each of these windows generally includes a frame having controls for interacting with the computing application as well as controls for moving, sizing, or otherwise managing the layout of the window. These window frames, however, occupy portions of a display that might otherwise be dedicated to an application's content. Furthermore, managing the layouts of these windows through these controls can be time-consuming, annoying and distracting to users.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This document describes techniques and apparatuses for creating an immersive environment. The immersive environment described herein can present multiple applications without dedicating significant amounts of a display to window frames for the applications. These techniques and/or apparatuses enable a user to view and interact with the content of a single application that is presented full screen (i.e., without system chrome) on a display while maintaining much of the power and flexibility that is available when multiple window frames are available. System chrome refers to the user-interactive graphical elements provided by the system for identifying and managing the regions or windows In some implementations the amount of space allocated to the applications when they are presented in a non-primary region of the display may be determined at least in part on minimum and/or maximum sizes that are specified by the applications themselves. This capability allows application developers to effectively participate in the process used by the computing device when determining how the content of their applications will be presented on the display. For example, different content from different applications may require different amounts of screen space in order to be useful. Accordingly, different applications may specify different minimum sizes below which they should not be presented on the display. Likewise, there may be a maximum size above which content may no longer be useful in practice because of content limitations or other reasons.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some operating systems permit users to view and interact with a single computing application with little or no window frame, generally by presenting content of an application on all or nearly all of a computer's display. While this technique permits more of an application's content to be viewed, it lacks much of the flexibility permitted by the window-based techniques</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This document describes techniques and apparatuses for creating an immersive environment in which a user can view and interact with the content of a single application that is presented full screen (e.g., without system chrome) on a display while maintaining much of the power and flexibility that is available when multiple window frames are available. In particular, the immersive environment can present multiple applications without dedicating significant portions of the display to window frames for the applications.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Example Environment</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> in which techniques for managing an immersive environment can be embodied. System <b>100</b> includes a computing device <b>102</b>, which is illustrated with six examples: a laptop computer <b>104</b>, a tablet computer <b>106</b>, a smart phone <b>108</b>, a set-top box <b>110</b>, a desktop computer <b>112</b>, and a gaming device <b>114</b>, though other computing devices and systems, such as servers and netbooks, may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Computing device <b>102</b> includes computer processor(s) <b>116</b> and computer-readable storage media <b>118</b> (media <b>118</b>). Media <b>118</b> includes an operating system <b>120</b>, immersive environment module <b>122</b>, manager module <b>124</b>, and applications <b>126</b>, each of which may provide content <b>128</b>. Computing device <b>102</b> also includes or has access to one or more displays <b>130</b>, four examples of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Immersive environment module <b>122</b> provides an environment by which a user may view and interact with one or more of applications <b>126</b> and corresponding content <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, this environment presents content of, and enables interaction with, applications with little or no window frame and/or without a need for a user to manually size or position content. This environment can be, but is not required to be, hosted and/or surfaced without use of a windows-based desktop environment. Thus, in some cases immersive environment module <b>122</b> presents an immersive environment that is not a window (even one without a substantial frame) and precludes usage of desktop-like displays (e.g., a taskbar). Further still, in some embodiments this immersive environment is similar to an operating system in that it is not closeable or capable of being un-installed. Examples of immersive environments are provided below as part of describing the techniques, though they are not exhaustive or intended to limit the techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Manager module <b>124</b> enables a user to manage an immersive environment and applications <b>126</b> presented in the environment. Manager <b>124</b> and/or module <b>122</b> can be separate from each other and/or operating system <b>120</b>, or may be combined or integrated in some form. Thus, in some cases operating system <b>120</b> includes immersive environment module <b>122</b> and manager <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows application work area <b>300</b> filled with immersive environment <b>302</b>. The immersive environment <b>302</b> is divided by the manager module <b>124</b> into two work areas or regions: a primary region <b>304</b> and a non-primary region <b>306</b>. The two regions <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are dividing by a splitting boundary <b>318</b>. Both the primary region <b>304</b> and the non-primary region <b>306</b> present various content <b>128</b> of applications <b>126</b>. Note that non-primary region <b>306</b> includes two non-primary sections <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>, each of which may be used to present content simultaneously (e.g., in parallel) with each other and that of primary region <b>304</b>. The non-primary sections <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> are divided by splitting boundary <b>320</b>. In this example, content from three applications is presented in parallel: content <b>312</b> from a social networking website which is presented by a web browser application, content <b>314</b> from a news website which is presented by a web browser application, and content <b>316</b> from a local document-viewing application.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The applications that present content in the primary region <b>304</b> and the non-primary region <b>306</b> are not limited to the aforementioned web browser and document-viewing applications. Other illustrative examples of applications that may be presented in the immersive environment <b>302</b> include, without limitation, spreadsheet applications, word processing applications, email applications, photo editing applications and the like. Moreover, it should be emphasized that while the content of two applications is shown in the non-primary region <b>306</b>, the non-primary region <b>306</b> more generally may present the content of any number of applications, including the content of only a single application.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a preferred implementation, the immersive environment <b>302</b> in the application work area <b>300</b> does not include any system chrome. System chrome refers to the user-interactive graphical elements provided by the system for identifying and managing the regions or windows (e.g., primary and non-primary regions <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>). For example, in the case of Microsoft Windows&#xae;, system chrome includes the start button, maximize and minimize buttons, taskbars, title bar labels, and so on. System chrome does not include, however, non-user interactive graphical elements such as visible lines and blank areas that may be provided to visually separate the content of different applications but which do not allow the user to manage the applications.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations the primary region <b>304</b> occupies a substantially larger portion of the work area <b>300</b> than the non-primary region <b>306</b>. This allows the user to interact with applications that present content in the primary region <b>304</b> which is currently the principal focus of the user's attention. Content presented by other applications which is of lesser immediate importance or less demanding of the user's attention may then be presented in the smaller non-primary region <b>306</b> of the work area <b>300</b>. In this way the user can focus on his or her most important tasks, while still having immediately access to the content provided by other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The non-primary region <b>306</b> may be presented anywhere within the work area <b>300</b>. Its location may be fixed or variable. For instance, in the case of a variable location, the location of the non-primary region may be user-selectable and/or selected by immersive environment module <b>124</b> based, for example, on the capabilities of the display device. On the other hand, if the location of the non-primary region <b>306</b> is fixed, it may be docked to one side of the work area <b>300</b>. Such an arrangement, which is shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, allows the content in the primary region <b>304</b> to be more centrally presented within the work area <b>304</b>, where it can be most conveniently be viewed by the user.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Example Methods</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a method for presenting the content of various applications in an immersive environment. In portions of the following discussion reference may be made to illustrative system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and illustrative immersive environment <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference to which is made for example only.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Block <b>202</b> presents an immersive environment on a display. The immersive environment does not include system chrome. At block <b>204</b> a first region and a second region are defined within the immersive environment. The first and second regions do not overlap with one another and therefore are visible to a user at the same time. The first region may be a primary region that is larger in size than the second region. The second region may then serve as a non-primary region that is docked to one side of the display.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At block <b>206</b> the content of a first executing user-interactive application is presented in the first region. Likewise, at block <b>208</b> the content of one or more other executing user-interactive applications are presented in the second region. The content respectively presented in the first and second regions is presented simultaneously with one another. When two or more applications are presented in the non-primary region, they may be arranged so that that they do not overlap one another.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some cases the non-primary region may be fixed in size. Accordingly, to ensure that content presented by different applications do not overlap with one another, as additional content from additional applications is presented in the non-primary region, the amount of space allocated to each application decreases. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an application work area <b>400</b> similar to the application work area shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the content <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> and <b>318</b> of three applications is presented in the non-primary region <b>306</b> while the content <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> from only two applications is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The content displayed in the primary region may be replaced with the content of another application. For instance, if the user opens a new application that is to be presented in the primary region, the content that is currently being presented may be removed from the immersive environment or, alternatively, it may be moved into the non-primary region. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an application work area in which the content <b>316</b> shown in the primary region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has been replaced with the content of a photo editing application. In this example the original content has been replaced by the content <b>320</b> of the photo editing application.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some cases the content of one or more applications can be maintained (&#x201c;pinned&#x201d;) on the display by the user. When an application is pinned, the application remains in either the primary region or the non-primary region, and is movable from one region to the other. For instance, if the user pins the content <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> and <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to the display, then when as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the content <b>316</b> of another application is displayed, the content <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> and <b>320</b> remains on the screen. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the original content <b>316</b> of the document-viewing application has been added to the non-primary region <b>306</b> without replacing the content <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> of the social networking website and the news website which are presented by web browser applications. The user may also pin the content <b>316</b> to the display. In this case, since the content of all three applications is pinned, if the user then moves content <b>320</b> from the primary region to the non-primary region, the content <b>316</b> will be automatically moved from the non-primary region to the primary region.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In general, the content of a given applications may be able to be presented in both the primary region <b>304</b> and the non-primary region <b>306</b>. In some cases, however, an application may be configured so that it can only be presented in one of the regions.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations the user may be able to remove the non-primary region <b>306</b> so that the content in the primary region <b>304</b> can occupy the entire work area. At a later time the user can also restore the non-primary region <b>306</b>. In addition, under certain circumstances the manager <b>124</b> may automatically remove the non-primary region. For instance, if the display is rotated into portrait mode the non-primary region may be removed. Likewise, when it is rotated back to landscape mode the manager <b>124</b> may restore the non-primary region.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Any of a wide variety of techniques and apparatuses may be provided for allowing users to manage the immersive environment. Such user interface techniques enable a user to select when, where, and/or under what conditions to present applications in this immersive environment. For instance, the manager module <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may enable a user to manage the immersive environment and the applications presented in the environment. In particular, the manager module <b>124</b> may enable selection of the user interface with a non-visual selector, such as a hot key or selector movement (e.g., a mouse selector moved to a right edge of primary region <b>304</b>) or, in the case of a touch screen, a gesture. In some other cases, however, the manager module <b>124</b> enables selection through a displayed, selectable user interface control. Illustrative examples of user interface techniques and apparatuses that may be used in connection with an immersive environment may be found in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 12/969,474.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Regardless of the particular user interface that is employed, the techniques for creating an immersive environment discussed herein allow users to simultaneously manage multiple applications. Assume, for example, that a user wishes to select a music application that he used yesterday while maintaining an immersive presentation of work-related memos that are currently in a primary area of an immersive environment. These techniques can provide a user interface that presents recently-used applications, such as the music application, and enables the user to quickly and easily present the music application in the primary area while automatically moving the work-related memos into the non-primary area of the immersive environment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also by way of example, assume that a user wishes to begin his immersive session each day with the same three applications&#x2014;a sports website, a business-news website, and work-related memos. These techniques permit the user to select these three applications to be automatically presented and maintained in the immersive environment. The user may simply open the immersive environment or logon to his computing device to have these three applications presented in the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations the amount of space allocated to the applications when they are presented in the non-primary region of the display may be determined at least in part on minimum maximum sizes that are specified by the applications themselves. This capability allows application developers to effectively participate in the process used by the immersive environment module <b>122</b> and/or the manager module <b>124</b> when determining how the content of their applications will be presented on the display. For example, different content from different applications may require different amount of screen space in order to be useful. Accordingly, different applications may specify different minimum sizes below which they should no longer be presented in the non-primary region of the display. Likewise, there may be a maximum size above which content may no longer be useful in practice, either because of resolution limitations or for other reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To address these issues applications may specify the size or sizes at which they may be presented on a display device. The allowable size or sizes of an application may be specified in any suitable manner. For instance, an application may specify size requirements such as maximum and/or minimum size limits, a series (i.e., two or more) of different sizes at which the application's content may be presented, a single fixed size, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The applications may be configured in a well-known manner to expose one or more APIs (application programming interfaces) to enable the immersive environment module <b>122</b> and/or the manager module <b>124</b> to present the content of the applications in the non-primary region of a display in accordance with the applications' size requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The manager module <b>124</b> will attempt to simultaneously present the content from all currently-executing applications while accommodating or satisfying the size requirements specified by each of those applications. To accomplish this, the manager module <b>124</b> can be provisioned with display space allocation rules, which may include tie-breaking rules in the event that the size specifications of two or more applications cannot be satisfied. If it is not possible to satisfy the size requirements of any given application, the user will simply not be able to DOCK it in the non-primary region. To the extent that the immersive environment module <b>122</b> and/or the manager module <b>124</b> can present the content of an application in multiple sizes supported by the application while accommodating any other currently-executing applications, the user may be given the opportunity to choose the size that is actually used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As previously mentioned, in some implementations the non-primary region <b>306</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is fixed in size. For instance, it may occupy the full height of the display while having a fixed width of, in one example, 320 pixels. Accordingly, when the size of the non-primary region is fixed in this manner the content of any applications docked in the non-primary region will be fixed in width and will vary in height depending on its size (e.g., height) specifications as well as the size specifications of any other applications that are currently docked.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The height specifications exposed by an application to the manager module <b>124</b> may include one or mandatory specifications that are required by the manager module <b>124</b>. In addition, the manager module <b>124</b> may also recognize optional specifications. In some cases a minimum height may be a mandatory specification required by the manager module <b>124</b>. The manager module <b>124</b> may require the minimum height to be no less than some specified value (e.g., between 48 and 240 pixels). If the application specifies an invalid value for the minimum height (e.g., a value outside of the minimum range required by the manager module <b>124</b>), the application's content will be presented in the non-primary region with a height corresponding to some default value.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that reference to height, height requirements, and the like is by way of illustration only. More generally, size requirements may refer to a size in any direction and not simply height. That is, a size requirement may specify the length in one direction of the area occupied by the content of an application in the non-primary region of the display. The direction may be along a vertical axis, a horizontal axis, or any axis there-between.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The specification of a maximum height may be mandatory or optional. If it is specified it should be greater than the minimum specified height. In some cases it may have a default value, which, for example, may be set to infinity, in which case the content of the application will fill whatever portion of the non-primary region is unoccupied.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations the manager module <b>124</b> may also require applications to specify their fill capabilities, which may be specified by selecting among three options: fill, no fill, and fill to maximum size. If the fill option is selected, the application will fill whatever space (e.g., height) is available in the non-primary region down to its minimum size (e.g., height). If the no fill option is selected, the application will only be presented at its minimum size regardless of how much space is available in the non-primary region. Finally, if the fill to maximum size option is selected, the application will fill whatever space (e.g., height) is available in the non-primary region up to its maximum size.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example immersive environment in which the content <b>314</b> of an application is presented in the non-primary region <b>310</b>. In this example the application has specified its fill capability as fill. Accordingly, as shown, the content <b>314</b> occupies all the available space (height), which in this case is the entire non-primary region <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another example immersive environment in which the content of two applications is presented in the non-primary region. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the immersive environment presents the content <b>312</b> from one web browser application and content <b>314</b> from a second web browser application in non-primary region <b>306</b>. In this example both applications have specified their respective fill capabilities as fill. Accordingly, as shown, the content <b>312</b> and content <b>314</b> equally share the entire non-primary region <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows yet another example immersive environment in which the content of three applications is presented in the non-primary region. In this example case the content <b>316</b> of one application has been specified as no fill by the user and the content <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> of the other two applications have specified their respective fill capabilities as fill. Accordingly, as shown, the content <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> of the two applications share the remaining space (e.g., height) that is not occupied by the content <b>316</b> of the application, which is presented at its minimum size.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The preceding discussion describes methods in which the techniques may operate to provide an immersive environment in the work area of a display. These methods are shown as sets of blocks that specify operations performed but are not necessarily limited to the order shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Aspects of these methods may be implemented in hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), firmware, software, manual processing, or any combination thereof. A software implementation represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed by a computer processor, such as software, applications, routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, procedures, modules, functions, and the like. The program code can be stored in one or more computer-readable memory devices, both local and/or remote to a computer processor.
