<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When planning or initiating a conference call, a conference call organizer may decide to record the conference call. Recording the conference call, and storing the recording, allows the conference call to be played back at a later time. For example, an individual who was unable to participate in the conference call, but needs to become acquainted with topics discussed during the conference call, may obtain the recording of the conference call and play back the recording.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, meetings may be recorded by activating a device to record the meetings. By way of example, meetings may be recorded by turning on recording devices including, but not limited to including, tape recorders, digital recorders, and/or computer-based applications that record.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To record a meeting or a conference call, pre-planning is generally required. That is, a decision must be made to turn on a recording device, or to enable recording functionality, in order to cause a meeting to be recorded. In some instances, a decision to record a meeting may be made during the meeting based upon a determination, made during the course of the meeting, that important subject matter is being discussed in the meeting. When a decision to record a meeting is not made until after the meeting has commenced, any portions of the meeting which occurred prior to the decision to record the meeting are not captured in a recording. Thus, important discussions during a meeting which prompted a decision to record the meeting may not be captured in a recording.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">General Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one aspect, a method includes monitoring activity in an environment, and storing a snippet of the monitored activity. Monitoring the activity in the environment includes operating a device arranged to capture the activity between approximately a first time and approximately a second time. The snippet has a particular duration that is arranged to end at approximately the second time. The method also includes storing the snippet in a storage module and determining when a request to provide the snippet is obtained from a party. If it is determined that the request to play the snippet is obtained, the method includes accessing the storage module to obtain the snippet and providing the snippet to the party if it is determined that the request to provide the snippet is obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Description</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">During the course of a conversation such as an ad hoc or otherwise unplanned conversation, it is not unusual for participants to wish to &#x201c;replay&#x201d; a portion of the conversation. For example, a participant may be unable to recall exactly what he said during the course of a conversation, and wish that there was a way for him to either listen to what he said or read a transcript of what he said. Although it is possible to record a conversation and to listen to a recording of the recorded conversation, recording a conversation typically requires pre-planning, e.g., a recorder must be activated prior to the beginning of the conversation. As many conversations are unplanned, many conversations are often not recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, a microphone may be activated such that the microphone captures a conversation, and a recent portion of the captured conversation may be stored such that the recent portion may be played back or otherwise provided to a party by request. By way of example, if a microphone monitors or captures a conversation and a most recent snippet of the conversation is stored, then a participant who is unable to recall exactly what he recently said in a conversation may access the most recent snippet and &#x201c;play back&#x201d; the snippet. Substantially only a recent portion of a conversation captured by a microphone is stored. The ability to access a recent portion of a conversation contained in a snippet, and to request a playback of the snippet, allows a user to effectively replay the recent portion of the conversation substantially without having to plan ahead to record the conversation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Many environments such as office environments contain devices that include microphones. For instance, many telephone devices include microphones. A microphone in an office environment may be activated such that the microphone may monitor or capture conversations in the office environment. A snippet of the captured conversation may be created, stored, and updated such that the snippet substantially always contains the most recent portions of the captured conversation. By way of example, a snippet may be updated to substantially always contain the last N seconds of an ongoing conversation. Thus, any portions of the ongoing conversation that occur earlier than the last N seconds are effectively not stored.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A snippet that is stored in memory and is accessible for playback is generally the most recent snippet of activity. For example, if a snippet has a predetermined duration that is approximately 30 seconds, then the snippet that is stored will generally include the most recent 30 seconds of activity. Hence, the snippet stored in memory varies dynamically such that as new activity is captured, older stored activity is effectively purged such that a snippet substantially always maintains a predetermined duration and includes the most recent activity. Any data pertaining to older stored activity, e.g., any data that is older than a current capture interval, may be discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, a user may be provided with the ability to play back or save a recent portion of activity, e.g., audio and/or visual activity, substantially without having to previously plan to record the activity using substantially any device with recording capabilities. A phone that is placed at a location, for example, may be used to provide the ability to play back or save activity. When audio is to be captured, substantially any device that includes a microphone may be utilized. A microphone may, for example, be arranged to constantly be on to record audio or sounds in a surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a block diagram representation of a device that is capable of recording and playing back a recent portion of activity occurring in an environment will be described in accordance with an embodiment. A device <b>104</b> generally includes a module <b>108</b> that is arranged to record or otherwise capture activities associated with an environment, e.g., an environment in which device <b>104</b> is placed. Module <b>108</b> may include logic, e.g., hardware logic and/or software logic. Device <b>104</b> may be, but is not limited to being, a telephone device that is connected to a communications network, a computing system that is connected to a communications network, or a standalone computing system that is not connected to a communications network.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Module <b>108</b> is generally arranged to provide recording/playback functionality. That is, module <b>108</b> is configured to allow for the capture of activities within an environment, the storage of a most recent snippet of the captured activities, the processing of a request to access the most recent snippet, and the playback of the most recent snippet. In one embodiment, module <b>108</b> is arranged to provide recording and playback functionality associated with activities that include an audio component, e.g., conversational activities. Hence, module <b>108</b> includes a microphone device <b>112</b> that is arranged to capture audio. It should be appreciated that microphone device <b>112</b> may be arranged to be remotely activated, as for example by an owner who is not at the location at which device <b>104</b> is located and desires to capture activities at the location.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Device <b>104</b> further includes an activation interface <b>116</b>, a processing module <b>120</b>, and a storage module <b>124</b>. Activation interface <b>116</b> typically includes a user interface that cooperates with module <b>108</b> to activate playback functionality. By way of example, activation interface <b>124</b> may include a physical mechanism such as a button or a switch that may be activated to cause a recent snippet to be accessed. It should be appreciated that the recent snippet has a duration that is approximately the length of a capture interval, and that the recent snippet ends at approximately the time that activation interface <b>124</b> is activated. Causing a recent snippet to be accessed may include causing the recent snippet to be played such that a party may listen to the recent snippet and/or causing a file containing the recent snippet to be provided to the party such that the party may play the recent snippet. Processing module <b>120</b> is generally arranged to execute logic such as software logic associated with module <b>108</b> and activation interface <b>116</b>. Storage module <b>124</b>, which may be a memory arrangement, is configured to store data such as data associated with a recent snippet.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As mentioned above, device <b>104</b> may be a telephone device. In one embodiment, device <b>104</b> may be an Internet protocol (IP) phone, as for example an IP phone located in an office environment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a block diagram representation of a telephone device such as an IP phone that is capable of recording and playing back a recent portion of activity occurring in an environment in accordance with an embodiment. A telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032; includes a module <b>108</b>&#x2032; that is arranged to record or otherwise capture activities associated with an environment, e.g., a location in which telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032; is placed. Module <b>108</b>&#x2032; may include hardware logic and/or software logic.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Module <b>108</b>&#x2032; is generally arranged to provide recording, playback, and call functionality. Module <b>108</b>&#x2032; is configured to allow for the capture of activities within an environment, the storage of a most recent snippet of the captured activities, the processing of a request to access the most recent snippet, and/or the playback of the most recent snippet. In addition, module <b>108</b>&#x2032; is configured to allow telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032; to generally function as a telephone, and typically includes a communications interface such as an input/output port. For example, module <b>108</b>&#x2032; generally includes logic arranged to allow a call to be placed, to allow a call to be answered, and to enable participation in a call. In one embodiment, module <b>108</b>&#x2032; may include functionality associated with participation in conference calls.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Module <b>108</b>&#x2032; includes a microphone device <b>112</b>&#x2032; that is arranged to capture audio, as well as a speaker <b>114</b> that is arranged to facilitate the playback of a recent snippet. The audio captured by microphone device <b>112</b>&#x2032; may be audio associated with a call, or audio associated with activities that occur in the environment in which telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032; is located.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A &#x201c;brilliant observation button&#x201d; (BOB) button <b>116</b>&#x2032;, a processing module <b>120</b>&#x2032;, and a storage module <b>124</b>&#x2032; are also included in module <b>108</b>&#x2032;. BOB button <b>116</b>&#x2032; is arranged to be activated to initiate a playback of a recent snippet. In one embodiment, upon activating BOB button <b>116</b>&#x2032;, as for example by pressing BOB button <b>116</b>&#x2032;, the playback of a recent snippet that is stored in storage module <b>124</b>&#x2032; substantially automatically commences. Alternatively, activating BOB button <b>116</b>&#x2032; may cause a menu to be activated that enables a user to select whether to commence playback of a recent snippet or to send the recent snippet to the user, or another party, in a voicemail or an email. In general, activating BOB button <b>116</b>&#x2032; effectively triggers a request for access to the recent snippet stored in storage module <b>124</b>&#x2032; Processing module <b>120</b>&#x2032; is generally arranged to execute logic such as software logic associated with module <b>108</b> and software associated with BOB button <b>116</b>&#x2032;. Storage module <b>124</b>, which may be a memory arrangement, is configured to store data such as data associated with a recent snippet. Although storage module <b>124</b> is shown as being included on telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032; and, hence, is local to telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032;, it should be appreciated that a storage module may instead be accessible to telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032;, but remote with respect to telephone device <b>104</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a method of utilizing a system, as for example a telephone device such as an IP phone, that captures and records audio for playback will be described in accordance with an embodiment. A method <b>201</b> of utilizing a system that captures and records audio begins at step <b>205</b> in which the capture of audio, e.g., audio within a particular environment, is initiated. Initiating the capture of audio may include a party using a user interface to request that audio be captured, and/or may include activating a microphone. It should be appreciated, however, that initiating the capture of audio may instead be substantially automatic. In one embodiment, upon initiating the capture of audio, an indication may be provided such that parties present in the environment may be aware that audio is being captured, e.g., that conversations are effectively being monitored. An indication may be, but is not limited to being, a visual indication, such as a light associated with the system that is illuminated when audio is being captured, or an audio indication, such as a tone that may be played. An indication may also include a sign in a building, e.g., at an entrance of the building, which indicates that recording may be in progress or that all conversations within the building may be subject to being recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once the capture of audio is initiated, audio is captured, and the captured audio is stored in memory associated with the system in step <b>209</b>. The captured audio that is stored, i.e., the &#x201c;capture,&#x201d; has a duration that is the length of a capture interval. In other words, the snippet of audio that is stored has a time length that is generally no longer than a capture interval. The capture interval effectively defines the length of a snippet of the capture that is to be stored in memory. In general, the capture interval may have any suitable length, as for example a length of between approximately 30 seconds and approximately 120 seconds. The capture interval may be variable, and may be altered at substantially any time. Storing captured audio in memory may include identifying a portion of the memory allocated to store the capture.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A determination is made in step <b>213</b> as to whether a playback of the capture has been requested. Such a determination may involve determining whether an input has been received from a party, e.g., a user or owner of the system. An input may include, but is not limited to including, an actuation of a BOB button.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the determination in step <b>213</b> is that a playback of the capture is not requested, then process flow moves to step <b>217</b> in which it is determined if more audio is to be captured. That is, it is determined in step <b>217</b> if the capture and storage of audio is terminated. The capture and storage of audio may be terminated substantially automatically, e.g., when a predetermined amount of time has elapsed, or may be terminated upon obtaining a cue from a user or owner of the system. If the determination is that the capture of audio is not terminated, process flow returns to step <b>209</b> in which audio continues to be captured and stored. Alternatively, if the determination in step <b>217</b> is that the capture of audio has been terminated, the method of utilizing a system that captures and records audio is completed. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the capture that is stored in the memory may be erased when the capturing and recording of audio is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Returning to step <b>213</b>, if it is determined that playback of the capture is requested, then in step <b>221</b>, then a playback of the capture is initiated. In one embodiment, a initiating a playback of the capture may involve providing a notification or other indication that a playback has been initiated. For example, a message may be sent to a user or owner of the system, or an audio or visual indication may be provided, to inform a user or owner that playback has been initiated. After a playback of the capture is initiated, the capture is played back in step <b>225</b>. In one embodiment, while a capture is being played back, no further capture of audio occurs. That is, recording audio is effectively on hold during playback. Playing back the capture may include outputting audio associated with the capture on a speaker or similar arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an optional step <b>229</b>, the capture is provided to a party, e.g., the party that requested playback and/or a user of the system. Providing the capture to a party may include, but is not limited to including, transmitting an email that includes the capture or a representation of the capture to the party, transmitting a voicemail that includes the capture or a representation of the capture to the party, and providing the capture or a representation of the capture in a file that is accessible to the party. It should be appreciated that a representation of the capture may be, in one embodiment, a text representation of the capture. Once the capture is played back in step <b>225</b>, or after the capture is optionally provided to the party in step <b>229</b>, process flow returns to step <b>209</b> in which audio continues to be captured and stored in a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As previously mentioned, a system that is arranged to capture activities in an environment may be a phone such as an IP phone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a part of a phone that includes a mechanism, e.g., a button, that allows playback of a recorded snippet of a conversation in accordance with an embodiment. A phone <b>304</b>, e.g., an IP phone, is generally part of a communications network (not shown). Thus, phone <b>304</b> may be used to initiate calls, to answer calls, and to participate in calls.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Phone <b>304</b> includes a display <b>332</b>. Display <b>332</b> may generally display information including, but not limited to including, a date, a time, a phone number associated with the phone, a phone number from which a call is received, a phone number to which a call is placed, an indication of whether a call was missed, and/or an indication of a number of voicemail messages associated with the phone. In the described embodiment, display <b>332</b> may display a message which indicates that a capture of audio is in progress (as shown) and/or an indication that a playback of a capture or a snippet is in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Phone <b>304</b> includes a BOB button <b>316</b> that may be activated or actuated, e.g., pressed, to initiate a playback of a shored snippet. It should be appreciated that when BOB button <b>316</b> is activated, display <b>332</b> may indicate that BOB button <b>316</b> is activated. For example, the activation of BOB button <b>316</b> may lead to the display of a message indicating that playback of a snippet is in progress. In lieu of activating BOB button <b>316</b>, BOB functionality may instead by activated by a star code, e.g., *42 or *262.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An indicator <b>328</b>, which may be a visual indicator such as a light emitting diode (LED), may be arranged to indicate that a microphone (not shown) associated with phone <b>304</b> is active. When a microphone (not shown) is active and, hence, monitoring or capturing activities in an environment associated with phone <b>304</b>, In one embodiment, indicator <b>328</b> may be substantially integrated into a button or other mechanism (not shown) that may be used to turn on a microphone (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-D</figref>, one process of capturing audio and playing back a stored snippet of the audio will be described in accordance with an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a timeline at a time t<b>0</b> at which the capture of audio begins in accordance with an embodiment. As shown on a timeline <b>450</b>, at a time t<b>0</b> <b>454</b><i>a</i>, the capture of sound begins. In the described embodiment, the capture of sound may begin when a microphone or other recording device, e.g., a microphone associated with a phone, is activated to capture sound in an environment in which the microphone or other recording device is placed. A microphone may be activated in response to a command from a user, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once the capture of sound begins at time t<b>0</b> <b>454</b><i>a</i>, a snippet of the captured sounds is stored. In general, the snippet that is stored has a duration that is effectively defined by a capture interval, as mentioned above. The capture interval is associated with a length of a snippet that is to be stored. For example, if a capture interval is approximately 30 seconds, then a snippet of a length of approximately 30 seconds is stored in memory and is accessible for playback. The capture interval is associated with a sliding window. Hence, a snippet that has a duration substantially defined by a capture interval is associated with a most recent portion of captured sound. By way of example, regardless of how much time has elapsed since time t<b>0</b> <b>454</b><i>a</i>, a snippet has a duration that is at most approximately equal to the capture interval and includes the most recently captured sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows timeline <b>450</b> at a time t<b>1</b> at which a snippet of captured sound has been stored in accordance with an embodiment. At a time t<b>1</b> <b>454</b><i>b</i>, the capture of sound is ongoing and sound has been captured for a duration <b>458</b> that extends from time t<b>0</b> <b>454</b><i>a </i>to time t<b>1</b> <b>454</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment as shown, a capture interval has a duration that is less than duration <b>458</b>. Thus, a stored snippet <b>462</b> has a duration that is substantially equal to the duration defined by the capture interval, and contains sound captured during a recent period of time that ends at time t<b>1</b> <b>454</b><i>b</i>. In other words, stored snippet <b>462</b> includes sounds captured beginning at a time that substantially begins at t<b>1</b> <b>454</b><i>b </i>&#x201c;minus&#x201d; the capture interval.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At a time t<b>2</b> <b>454</b><i>c</i>, as shown in timeline <b>450</b>&#x2033; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, playback of snippet <b>462</b> is requested. At time t<b>2</b> <b>454</b><i>c</i>, sound has been captured for duration <b>458</b> which began and time t<b>0</b> <b>454</b><i>a</i>, and snippet <b>462</b> corresponds to sounds captured in a capture interval that ends at approximately time t<b>2</b> <b>454</b><i>c</i>. Thus, at time t<b>2</b> <b>454</b><i>c</i>, snippet <b>462</b> contains different contents than snippet <b>462</b> contained at time t<b>1</b> <b>454</b><i>b</i>. It should be understood that while the length of the capture interval generally remains substantially the same, e.g., the length of the capture interval is the same at time t<b>1</b> <b>454</b><i>b </i>and at time t<b>2</b> <b>454</b><i>c</i>, the capture interval may be changed if, for example, it is decided during the course of capturing sound that a capture interval of a different length is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In general, once a playback is requested, snippet <b>462</b> is substantially immediately accessed and playback begins. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, at a time t<b>3</b> <b>454</b><i>d</i>, playback begins. Although the elapsed time between time t<b>2</b> <b>454</b><i>c </i>and time t<b>3</b> <b>454</b><i>d </i>is generally negligible, the gap between time t<b>2</b> <b>454</b><i>c </i>and time t<b>3</b> <b>454</b><i>d </i>has been emphasized for purposes of illustration. The playback of snippet <b>462</b> begins at time t<b>3</b> <b>454</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While activating a playback button such as a BOB button has been described as causing a stored snippet to be played back, activating a playback button may instead cause other events to occur without departing from the spirit or the scope of the disclosure. For instance, when a party activates a playback button, a text transcript of the stored snippet may be made and sent to the party, e.g., as inline text in an email message or as a file attached to the email message. Alternatively, activating the BOB button may cause the stored snippet to be provided to the party as a voicemail message or as an audio file. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a process flow diagram which illustrates a method of utilizing a system, as for example a telephone device such as an IP phone, that captures and records audio for transmission will be described in accordance with an embodiment. A method <b>501</b> of utilizing a system that captures and records audio begins at step <b>505</b> in which the capture of audio, e.g., audio within a particular environment, is initiated. Initiating the capture of audio may include a party using a user interface to request that audio be captured, and/or may include activating a microphone. In one embodiment, after initiating the capture of audio, an indication may be provided such that observers in the environment may be aware that audio is being captured, e.g., that conversations are effectively being monitored. It is important to note that for security reasons, it may be preferable for the initiation of a capture of audio to occur from a physical location and not from a remote location.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once the capture of audio is initiated, audio is captured, and the capture is stored in memory associated with the system in step <b>509</b>. The capture interval may be variable, and may be altered at substantially any time. Storing captured audio in memory may include identifying a portion of the memory allocated to store the capture.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is determined in step <b>513</b> as to whether a playback of the capture has been requested. Such a determination may involve determining whether an input has been received from a party, e.g., a user or owner of the system. An input may include, but is not limited to including, an actuation of a BOB button. If the determination in step <b>513</b> is that a playback of the capture is not requested, then process flow moves to step <b>517</b> in which it is determined if more audio is to be captured. In other words, it is determined in step <b>517</b> if the capture and storage of audio is terminated. The capture and storage of audio may be terminated substantially automatically, or may be terminated upon obtaining a cue from a user or owner of the system. If the determination is that the capture of audio is not terminated, process flow returns to step <b>509</b> in which audio continues to be captured and stored. Alternatively, if the determination in step <b>517</b> is that the capture of audio has been terminated, the method of utilizing a system that captures and records audio is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning to step <b>513</b>, if it is determined that playback of the capture is requested, then in step <b>521</b>, then the indication is that a user or owner or the system desires the ability to play back the capture. Accordingly, process flow moves from step <b>513</b> to step <b>521</b> in which the capture is processed for transmission. Processing the capture may include, but is not limited to including, creating a text transcript of the capture, generating an email message that includes the text transcript and/or a file containing the capture, generating a text message that includes the text transcript, and/or creating a voicemail message that includes the capture. After the capture is processed, the capture is transmitted to a user or owner of the system in step <b>525</b>. In general, the capture is provided to the party that requested playback of the capture. It should be appreciated that for security purposes, the capture may generally be provided substantially to the owner or user of a device that is used to obtain the capture. Providing the capture to a party may include, but is not limited to including, transmitting an email that includes the capture or text transcript of the capture to the party and/or transmitting a voicemail that includes the capture. Once the capture transmitted in step <b>525</b>, process flow returns to step <b>509</b> in which audio continues to be captured and stored in a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although only a few embodiments have been described in this disclosure, it should be understood that the disclosure may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or the scope of the present disclosure. By way of example, while capturing and storing sound has been described, other activities may also be captured and stored for playback. Other activities that may be captured and stored include, but are not limited to including, video and/or photographs. Video and/or photographs may be captured and stored for later playback. Such video and/or photographs may be captured using a video recording device such as a camera, or a computer-based application that cooperates with a camera of a computer to record video. It should be appreciated that when activities are captured and stored for security purposes, the use of video or photographs taken within an environment may provide extra security over recording sound in the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Audio that is captured may be provided over a communications link to voice mailbox associated with a phone, in lieu of or in addition to, being stored. For example, in lieu of storing and refreshing a snippet of audio, the snippet of audio may be processed substantially as being a voice mail message, and provided to the voice mailbox of a party. In one embodiment, substantially all captured audio may be processed as voice mail and provided to a voice mailbox.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As mentioned above, in addition to in lieu of providing a snippet that includes audio to a party, a text transcript of the audio included in the snippet may be provided to the party. For instance, for an embodiment in which a request for playing back a snippet initiates sending the snippet to a party, the snippet may be processed by a text transcription application in order to generate a text transcript, and the text transcript may be provided to the party.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The use of a playback button or similar playback interface generally allows for a party, e.g., the owner or occupant of an office, to play back a snippet of conversation occurring in the office during the most recent capture interval. In order to reduce the likelihood that an unauthorized party may access the playback button, the owner or occupant of the office may be notified when the playback button is activated. Notifying the owner or occupant of the office may include, but is not limited to including, sending a notification email, calling a phone of the owner or occupant, and/or causing the activation of the playback button to provide an audio notification or a video notification. If the playback button is implemented on a phone, and the phone has an associated camera, the activation of the playback button may cause the camera to take at least one picture of the environment to aid in identifying a party who activated the playback button.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While activating a playback button such as a BOB button has been described as causing a stored snippet to be played back, activating a playback button may instead cause other events to occur without departing from the spirit or the scope of the disclosure. For instance, when a party activates a playback button, a text transcript of the stored snippet may be made and sent to the party, e.g., as inline text in an email message or as a file attached to the email message. Alternatively, activating the BOB button may cause the stored snippet to be provided to the party as a voicemail message or as an audio file.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Access to a stored snippet may generally be provided substantially automatically upon a determination that playback is requested. It should be appreciated, however, that in some embodiment, an authentication process may occur prior to access being provided to a stored snippet. For example, if access to a snippet is provided by sending an email that includes a file that contains the snippet, the file may be password protected such that substantially only a party who has knowledge of the password may open the file.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, a playback button such as a BOB button may be utilized to effectively activate a continuous recording and storing function. That is, the use of a playback button may allow for the storage of more than a capture interval. By way of example, if a playback button has been activated more than a predetermined number of times within a particular time interval, a continuous recording and storing function that stores more than a capture interval may effectively commence. Storing more than a capture interval may include, but is not limited to including, storing substantially all interactions within an environment that occur after the continuous recording and storing function has been activated. It should be appreciated that activating a continuous recording and storing function may include allocating additional storage capacity, e.g., memory.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the playback of a snippet may occur at full speed, i.e., at an actual speed such that one second of the snippet is substantially equal to one second of time, the playback of a snippet is not limited to occurring at full speed. For example, the playback of a snippet may be sped up and/or slowed down, as desired by a party listening to the snippet.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The embodiments may be implemented as hardware and/or software logic embodied in a tangible medium that, when executed, is operable to perform the various methods and processes described above. That is, the logic may be embodied as physical arrangements, modules, or components. A tangible medium may be substantially any suitable physical, computer-readable medium that is capable of storing logic which may be executed, e.g., by a computing system, to perform methods and functions associated with the embodiments. Such computer-readable media may include, but are not limited to including, physical storage and/or memory devices. Executable logic may include software logic, code devices, computer program code, and/or executable computer commands or instructions.</p>
