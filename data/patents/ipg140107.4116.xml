<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-158644 filed on Jul. 3, 2009; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a light controlling apparatus and an optical system which are used in a small-size image pickup equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various types of light controlling apparatuses have hitherto been used. As one of the types thereof, a plug-in type light controlling apparatus in which, a single or a plurality of incident-light controlling means is displaced mutually inside and outside an optical path by an electromagnetic driving source, and optical characteristics of incident light which passes through the optical path is changed, is available. In recent years, with an achievement of high-quality image of a portable equipment having an image pickup function and a small-size image pickup equipment such as a micro video scope, with regard to optical elements such as a lens, an aperture, and an optical filter, there has been increasing demand for an application of a focusing lens, a variable aperture, and a variable special characteristic filter instead of a conventional fixed focusing lens, a fixed aperture stop, and a fixed special characteristic filter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the abovementioned plug-in type light controlling apparatus has a simple structure, it has been gathering attention as a light controlling apparatus which is suitable for small sizing, which in turn, is suitable for such small-size image pickup equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example of such plug-in type light controlling apparatus suitable for small-sizing has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. Hei 10-20360, in which, a diaphragm plate is fixed to a rotor which is polarized to bipolarity, via a shaft, and the rotor is inserted through a rotating hole into a coil which has been formed to be ring-shaped, and is fixed to be freely rotatable by a shaft attachment which is formed in an upper cover and a lower cover.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in a structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. Hei 10-20360, an area in which the coil can be formed is limited to be more than a diameter of an opening formed in the upper cover and the lower cover, and within an outer peripheral diameter of the upper cover and the lower cover.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For reducing further a diameter of the light controlling apparatus, it is necessary to shorten a coil-length or to reduce the number of turns of the coil together with the contraction of the area in which the coil can be formed. This leads to a degradation of magnetic field generated in the coil, thereby leading to a degradation of a rotating torque of the diaphragm plate, which hinders a stable drive.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, in reducing further the diameter of the light controlling apparatus, not only that the area in which the coil can be formed is reduced but also there may arise a problem that there is no space to provide the coil in first place.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is made in view of the abovementioned circumstances, and an object of the present invention to provide a light controlling apparatus of a small size which is used in a small-size image pickup equipment, of which, the diameter is reduced further, and which is capable of providing a stable drive.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Exemplary embodiments of a light controlling apparatus and an optical system according to the present invention will be described below in detail by referring to the accompanying diagrams. However, the present invention is not restricted to the embodiments described below.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a first embodiment, the description of a light controlling apparatus will be made by citing an example of a structure in which, a variable aperture which regulates a light beam passing through an aperture is driven by using an electromagnetic actuator, by displacing a diaphragm plate in which the aperture is formed, to a position in the optical path, and a position away from the optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A structure of the light controlling apparatus according to the first embodiment will be described below by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the light controlling apparatus according to the first embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the light controlling apparatus of the first embodiment includes a lower substrate <b>100</b> in which, a first aperture <b>101</b>, a first shaft-receiving hole <b>102</b>, a positioning portion <b>103</b>, and a regulating portion <b>104</b> are formed, an upper substrate <b>200</b> in which, a second aperture <b>201</b> and a second shaft-receiving hole <b>202</b> are formed, a diaphragm plate <b>300</b> in which, a third aperture <b>302</b> is formed, and to which, a shaft member <b>301</b> made of a circular-cylindrical shaped magnet is joined, and a coil <b>400</b> in which, coil wire <b>401</b> is wound around a core <b>403</b>, and a bending portion <b>402</b> is formed at two ends of the core <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each of the structural members will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first aperture <b>101</b> formed in the lower substrate <b>100</b> and the second aperture <b>201</b> formed in the upper substrate <b>200</b> become an optical path through which the incident light passes, with a center of the aperture as an optical axis. The first aperture <b>101</b> and the second aperture <b>201</b> are formed to have the same diameter or the different diameters, and the diameter of the apertures (when the aperture diameters differ, the smaller diameter is an aperture diameter) is an open aperture diameter in the light controlling apparatus. Moreover, the regulating portion <b>104</b> formed in the lower substrate <b>100</b> is a member which regulates a gap between lower substrate <b>100</b> and the upper substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The third aperture <b>302</b> which is smaller than the first aperture <b>101</b> and the second aperture <b>201</b> formed in the lower substrate <b>100</b> and the upper substrate <b>200</b> respectively, is formed in the diaphragm plate <b>300</b>. Moreover, the shaft member <b>301</b> made of the circular cylindrical shaped magnet is joined by a method such as press fitting. The shaft member <b>301</b> is engaged in the first shaft-receiving hole <b>102</b> and the second shaft-receiving hole <b>202</b> formed in the lower substrate <b>100</b> and the upper substrate <b>200</b> respectively, and the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> is rotatably installed with the shaft member <b>301</b> as the axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An operable area of the diaphragm plate <b>300</b>, in an optical axial direction, is regulated by the lower substrate <b>100</b> and the upper substrate <b>200</b>, and in a direction of rotation, is regulated by the regulating portion <b>104</b> and the positioning portion <b>103</b> formed in the lower substrate <b>100</b>. Moreover, the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> is formed such that, at a position making a contact with the position member <b>103</b>, the center of the third aperture coincides with the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The coil <b>400</b> has the coil wire <b>401</b> wound around the core <b>403</b> made of a magnetic material, extending in a direction parallel to the optical axis. The bending portion <b>402</b> is formed at both ends of the core <b>403</b>. The bending portions <b>402</b> are face-to-face to dispose the shaft member <b>301</b> joined to the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> in between the bending portions <b>402</b>. The bending portions <b>402</b> may be provided as separate bodies provided that the bending portions are coupled magnetically with the core <b>403</b>, or may be formed by folding a front end of the core <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, the total length J of the coil <b>400</b> is an important factor which regulates an electric field generated in the bending portions <b>402</b>, like the other factors such as the number of turns of the coil wire <b>401</b>, an amount of electric power supplied to the coil wire <b>401</b>, and properties of a material of the core <b>403</b>. The length J is to be set to a length which enables to achieve a magnetic field sufficient for imparting a rotational force for displacing the diaphragm plate <b>300</b>, to the shaft member <b>301</b> made of the circular cylindrical shaped magnet, along with the abovementioned factors. Moreover, the total length J of the coil <b>400</b> is set to be longer than an outer peripheral length K of the lower substrate <b>100</b> and the upper substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, an operation of the light controlling apparatus of the first embodiment will be described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, show top views seen transparently through the upper substrate <b>200</b>, in the light controlling apparatus of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The shaft member <b>301</b> which is joined to the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> is made of the circular cylindrical shaped magnet, and is magnetized to have S polarity and N polarity in a direction from the center of the third aperture <b>302</b> formed in the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> toward the shaft member <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Whereas, the coil <b>400</b> has the coil wire <b>401</b> wound around the core <b>403</b> made of a magnetic material, and by a current flowing through the coil wire <b>401</b>, the bending portions <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>formed at the two ends respectively of the core <b>403</b> are magnetized mutually to the S polarity and the N polarity. Furthermore, due to magnetic attraction and repulsion of the magnetic field generated by the coil <b>400</b> and the magnetic field of the shaft member <b>301</b>, rotational force is generated in the shaft member <b>301</b>, and the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> rotates with the shaft member <b>301</b> as a center of rotation. The direction of rotation can be controlled by a direction of the current which flows through the coil wire <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Here, the shaft member <b>301</b> is magnetized as described above, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, when the bending portion <b>402</b><i>a </i>is magnetized to S polarity and the bending portion <b>402</b><i>b </i>is magnetized to N polarity, rotational force in the counterclockwise direction in the diagram acts on the diaphragm plate <b>300</b>. The diaphragm plate <b>300</b> stops at a position where the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> has made a contact with the positioning portion <b>103</b>. In this state, the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> closes the first aperture <b>101</b> and the second aperture <b>201</b>, and by the center of the third aperture <b>302</b> formed in the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> coinciding with the optical axis, the diameter of the optical path through which the incident light passes becomes the third aperture <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when the bending portion <b>402</b><i>a </i>is magnetized to N polarity and the bending portion <b>402</b><i>b </i>is magnetized to S polarity, rotational force in the clockwise direction in the diagram acts on the diaphragm plate <b>300</b>. The diaphragm plate <b>300</b> stops at a position where the diaphragm plate <b>300</b> has made a contact with the regulating portion <b>104</b>. The diaphragm plate <b>300</b> is retracted from the first aperture <b>101</b> and the second aperture <b>201</b>, and the aperture diameter becomes the first aperture <b>101</b> and the second aperture <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this manner, by controlling the direction of the electric power supplied to the coil <b>400</b>, it is possible to rotate the diaphragm plate <b>500</b>, and to control in two stages the diameter of the optical path through which the incident light passes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next an effect of the light controlling apparatus of the first embodiment will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As a method of forming a coil in the light controlling apparatus, when the coil is formed by extending along a surface of a substrate, an area in which the coil can be formed is restricted to be not less than a diameter of an aperture in the substrate, and is not more than an outer diameter of the substrate. Accordingly, along with further reduction in a diameter of the light controlling apparatus, it is necessary to shorten the length of the coil or to reduce the number of turns of the coil along with the contraction of the area in which the coil can be formed. This leads to a degradation of magnetic field generated in coil, thereby leading to a degradation of a rotating torque of the diaphragm plate, which hinders a stable drive. Moreover, there may be a problem that a case in which the desired coil is provided cannot be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Whereas, the light controlling apparatus of the first embodiment has a structure in which, the coil is formed by extending in a direction parallel to the optical axis. Consequently, since the area in which the coil is formed does not depend on an outside dimension (outer diameter of the substrate) of the light controlling apparatus, it is possible to set freely the coil length even when the diameter of the light controlling apparatus is made smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As it has been mentioned above, in the light controlling apparatus of the first embodiment, even when the diameter of the light controlling apparatus is reduced further, it is possible to secure the coil length, and it is possible to avoid the degradation of the magnetic field generated in the coil, and to avoid the degradation of the power generated by an electromagnetic actuator, thereby making it possible to drive the light controlling apparatus stably.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Moreover, by replacing the diaphragm plate in the first embodiment by an optical lens, it is also possible to use as an optical lens attaching and detaching apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, by replacing the diaphragm plate in the first embodiment by an optical filter, it is also possible to use as an optical filter attaching and detaching apparatus which changes an amount of light transmitted or a pass wavelength band.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a second embodiment, an optical system will be described by citing an example of an optical system in which alight controlling apparatus is used. In the light controlling apparatus of the second embodiment, a variable aperture which regulates a light beam passing through an aperture by displacing a diaphragm plate in which the aperture is formed, to a position of an optical path and away from the optical path is driven by using an electromagnetic actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A structure of the optical system according to the second embodiment will be described below by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exploded perspective view of the optical system according to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A lens group <b>500</b> (corresponds to a first optical element) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is joined to a second lens frame <b>602</b>, and respective distances and an optical axis position are regulated. A second lens frame <b>602</b> is joined to the upper substrate <b>200</b> of the light controlling apparatus such that an optical axis of the light controlling apparatus and an optical axis of the lens group coincide.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Moreover, the coil <b>400</b> is joined directly to the upper substrate <b>200</b>. The structure may be such that the coil <b>400</b> is joined indirectly to the upper substrate <b>200</b> by being joined to the second lens frame <b>602</b>. Furthermore, the structure may be such that a lens group (not shown in the diagram: corresponds to a second optical element) other than the lens group <b>500</b> is joined to the first lens frame <b>601</b>, and the first lens frame <b>601</b> and the light controlling apparatus are joined such that an optical axis of the light controlling apparatus and the lens group <b>500</b> and an optical axis of the lens group other than the lens group <b>500</b> coincide.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an aspect ratio thereof is to be taken into consideration. A length L along a circumferential direction of a virtual circle having the optical axis as a center is set to be longer than a length M along a radial direction of the virtual circle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, when the coil <b>400</b> is disposed along a circumference of the virtual circle having the optical axis as a center as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, it possible to have even wider area for disposing the lens group <b>500</b> in the second lens frame <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next an effect of the optical system according to the second embodiment will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a case of using the light controlling apparatus generally for an optical application, other lenses and image pickup elements etc. of the light controlling apparatus are arranged in order along the optical axial direction. Here, when the light controlling apparatus, lenses, and optical elements are closed as a separate functional unit, both the reduction of a diameter in the radial direction of the light controlling apparatus and the thinning in the optical axial direction are indispensable for small sizing of the optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">On the other hand, in optical system in the second embodiment, limitations on the thinning in the optical axial direction of the light controlling apparatus are relaxed by considering the overall optical system as one functional unit. In other words, by forming the coil to be extended in the direction parallel to the optical axis and also disposing a lens parallel to the coil, the light controlling apparatus and the lenses are assembled three-dimensionally.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this manner, in the light controlling apparatus of the second embodiment, even when the size of the light controlling apparatus is made further smaller, it is possible to secure the coil length, and it is possible to avoid the degradation of the magnetic field developed by the coil, thereby making it possible to avoid decline in the power generated by the electromagnetic actuator, which enables to drive the light controlling apparatus stably.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, it is possible to reduce effectively the thickness to the minimum in the optical axial direction, which contributes to the optical characteristics of the light controlling apparatus, and to improve the degree of freedom of optical designing. Furthermore, by joining the lens group which is disposed parallel to the coil, to the lens frame other than the lens frame to which the light controlling apparatus is joined, and by joining to the light controlling apparatus, it is possible to avoid the interference of the lens group and the coil.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, it is needless to mention that it is possible to replace the diaphragm plate in the second embodiment by an optical lens or by an optical filter similarly as in the first embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a third embodiment, similarly as in the second embodiment, an optical system will be described by citing an example of an optical system in which, a light controlling apparatus is used. In the light controlling apparatus of the third embodiment, a variable aperture which regulates a light beam passing through an aperture by displacing a diaphragm plate in which the aperture is formed, to a position of an optical path and away from the optical path is driven by using an electromagnetic actuator.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the optical system according to the third embodiment differs from the optical system according to the second embodiment at a point that a portion of the lens of the lens group <b>500</b> is notched and that the lens group <b>500</b> is joined to first lens frame <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the third embodiment, a portion of the lens of the lens group <b>500</b> is notched and a space is provided from the coil <b>400</b>, and the lens group <b>500</b> and the coil <b>400</b> are installed to be parallel inside the lens frame <b>601</b>. By the lens group <b>500</b> being joined to a lens frame <b>601</b> same as the lens frame <b>601</b> which joins the light controlling apparatus, it is possible to improve an accuracy of optical axis adjustment of the lens unit, as well as to simplify the assembly.</p>

The fourth embodiment differs from the second embodiment and the third embodiment at a point that the coil is provided at an outer portion of the first lens frame <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The coil <b>400</b> being at the outside of the first lens frame <b>601</b>, the reduction in diameter by that much amount than in the third embodiment cannot be realized.
