<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is related to the field of microelectronic devices, designed to transport and manipulate magnetic beads, typically on chip. Some application domains are biochips and biosensors, used for molecular, in-vitro and point-of-care diagnostics in general; for the diagnosis of cancer, infectious diseases, auto-immune disorders, cardiovascular risk and neurodegenerative diseases, the detection of hormones, cytokines and acute phase reactants in particular; and for analysis in areas such as food quality and safety, animal diseases, environmental screening, etc. diagnostics, genetics and molecular studies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Following the publication of the first draft of the human genome sequence, the next major task is to determine the function that each of the genes (i.e. &#x3e;35,000) have in each of the tissues in the body over a range of environmental conditions. Using arrays of thousands of probes which are specific to individual genes, DNA microarrays enable the extent to which individual genes are switched on or off to be determined. Genetic variation among individuals also contributes to variation in the way genes behave in response to changes in the environment. Simultaneous detection of variation at thousands of locations (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) in the genome can also be achieved using DNA microarray technology. Applications of DNA microarrays therefore include gene expression profiling, gene sequencing, gene discovery, and genotyping, for users in healthcare, academia and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Currently the major factors limiting the uptake of DNA microarray technology include low sensitivity, the high cost of the technology, requirement for specialist operators and throughput. The same drawbacks are encountered in the development and use of technologies for the detection of proteins, cells and other biological species.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic biochips have the potential to overcome these limitations. Here, exploitation of state-of-the-art micro- and nano-technology design, fabrication and characterization tools and processes enable development of devices and systems that can interface directly with biological reactions. A possibility involves combining magnetic bead-based bioassays with magnetic sensor technology. From a biotechnology perspective, superparamagnetic beads (e.g. 0.05-10.0 &#x3bc;m diameter) are available commercially from a number of sources with a range of surface functional chemistries, for well established applications including isolation and transportation of nucleic acids, proteins and whole cells. In microelectronics, GMR-based magnetic sensors have provided an enabling technology for memory applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Paramagnetic materials are materials that develop a magnetic moment parallel to any applied field. It contains microscopic permanent moments, like a ferromagnet, but the difference is they are only weakly interacting so that no long-ranged order can develop.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, integration of superparamagnetic bead-based nucleic acid, protein and/or cellular assays on a functional biochip surface incorporating magnetic sensors, provides the basis for a range of biochip platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Research groups now start to explore the unique ability of manipulating these particles by applying controlled magnetic forces. By immobilising biomolecules onto the particle's surface, a number of additional functionalities emerge, such as transfer of biomolecules to a specific location on the chip and testing or speeding up biomolecular recognition events. This turns the label, which used to be solely a means of detection, into a &#x2018;smart&#x2019; label.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Today, all particle detection principles are based on a static detection. In a static detection, highly sensitive magnetic field sensors measure the magnetic field emanating from magnetic particles immobilised onto the surface and in the vicinity of the sensor. Given that the field generated by the particles diminishes very fast (1/r<sup>3</sup>) and that these particles are immobilised at different distances from the sensor, each particle will contribute with a different magnitude to the total signal. This effect can lead to large deviations on the total signal but will disappear when many particles are detected (different contributions will average out, lowering the average signal per particle), but for low analyte concentration, this may be a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Next to the detection of the magnetic beads, the problem of transport and manipulation of beads is a limiting factor, which has to be taken into account in biochip designs and methods.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In Whitesides et al., &#x201c;Manipulation of magnetic microbeads in suspension using micromagnetic systems fabricated with soft lithography&#x201d;, Applied Physics Letters [Vol 78, Nr 12 Mar. 19th 2001, pages 1775-1777] and US2002/0166800, systems are described comprising current carrying wires that can generate strong local magnetic field gradients, which in their turn can control the position of magnetic microbeads in aqueous suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In patent application EP1462173 another method for controlled transport of magnetic beads is disclosed. It concerns a method and corresponding devices for controlled transport of magnetic beads between a position X and different position Y, wherein said magnetic beads are manipulated or transported by applying successively a series of N local magnetic fields which have magnetic field gradients different from 0 in the neighbourhood of said magnetic beads is disclosed. Each of these N local magnetic fields is generated by a single current carrying structure, in which the current density is not constant. The state of the art demonstrated movement of magnetic particles that are suspended in essentially pure water (pH 7, ionic strength 1E-7 M).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Biomolecular bonds such as protein-protein protein-cell, nucleic acid&#x2014;nucleic acid, etc. interactions are usually reversible and can be influenced in different ways, such as temperature, pH, solvent and other molecules or ions present. Regeneration of biomolecular recognition events using low/high pH, etc (see above) is known in biotechnology.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory explains absorption of particles onto substrates in aqueous solutions with a known pH value and ionic strength using electrostatic and van der waals interactions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, these parameters have an effect on the substrate charge and bead surface charge and therefor influence the DLVO interactions and the particle mobility associated to it. At present, changing such parameters has been avoided in order to avoid interference with the magnetic transport.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention relates to a method for measuring the presence and/or concentration of magnetic particles by means of a sensor device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method of the invention comprises the steps of:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0016">providing the surface of a sensor device with a solution containing said magnetic particles,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0017">subjecting said magnetic particles to an external magnetic field,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0018">applying a current through a sensor (which can also be referred to as detector unit or magnetic sensing element) and/or through an underlying structure, whereby the combination of said external magnetic field with the magnetic field generated by said current allows said magnetic particles to move towards a predetermined location with respect to said sensor,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0019">measuring the magnetic field generated by said magnetic particles and relating this magnetic field to the presence and/or concentration of said magnetic particles.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">Preferably, said external magnetic field is in-plane with respect to said surface, whereby the combination of said external in-plane magnetic field with the magnetic field generated by said current allows said magnetic particles to move towards the top and centre of each sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">More preferably, said external magnetic field is perpendicular with respect to said surface, whereby the combination of said external perpendicular magnetic field with the magnetic field generated by said current allows said magnetic particles to move towards one of the edges of each sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">Said solution containing said magnetic particles can comprise one or more additives suitable for inducing a repulsive force between said magnetic particles and said surface of the device. The movement of said magnetic particles in said solution, on said surface, is then facilitated. Said repulsive interaction can consist mostly (i.e. more than 50%) of an electrostatic interaction, which can be induced by the presence of charges of equal sign on said surface and on said magnetic particles.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">Said repulsive interaction can be generated by the adsorption onto said magnetic particles and/or onto said surface of anionic or cationic surfactant(s) (which is/are specific example(s) of said additive(s)) added to said solution.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0071">In a first aspect of the present invention a method is disclosed for (re-)enabling transport by means of a magnetic field gradient transport mechanism of magnetic beads comprising a ligand in a solution on top of a surface comprising a receptor bound with the ligand, comprising the step of changing the properties of the solution such that dissociation occurs between the ligand and the receptor, and such that a sufficient repulsive interaction is created between the surface and the bead to allow transport of the bead.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">In certain embodiments a repulsive interaction that maintains mobility is dominated by an electrostatic interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0073">In other embodiments according to the present invention wherein the repulsive interaction comprises also a steric or structural interaction.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0076">In certain embodiments the repulsive interaction is at least partially created by the adsorption of anionic or cationic surfactant onto at least one of the bead surface or device surface, the surfactant added to the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the step of changing the properties of the solution comprises, for a given surface and bead type, changing the pH and/or ionic strength appropriately in order to generate the repulsive interaction.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0098">In advantageous embodiments the absolute value of the induced electrostatic potentials between the bulk solution and the surface and the bead surface respectively are both larger than 5 mV.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0099">In preferred embodiments the magnetic transport is performed with magnetic field strengths and magnetic field gradients that generate forces. Typical such forces are from about 0.05 pN to about 5 pN for in-plane transport and from 0.5 to 30 pN towards the surface, depending on the magnetic field gradient generating structure, the position of the particle and the current in the current carrying structure which is used to generate the magnetic field(s).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0100">In another aspect of the present invention a method for measuring magnetic beads is disclosed wherein magnetic beads are transported towards a measurement location in the neighbourhood of said detection unit.

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0107">Advantageously the measurement location is substantially centred above the edges of the detector unit.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0108">The present invention builds on the idea of a dynamic sensor, to release and reposition immobilised particles by regenerating the biomolecular bond. For this, one needs to be able to transport magnetic particles and break biomolecular bonds in one step.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0109">However, in some applications (such as breaking biomolecular bonds), it is usually necessary to resuspend these particles using a solution with specific pH and ionic strength. Although magnetic particles can be resuspended by breaking recognition events, e.g. biomolecular bonds, it can be experimentally shown that these particles not always move. It can be shown that e.g. streptavidin-coated particles no longer move in a pH 2, 10 mM solution for typical magnetic forces on the beads and a SiO<sub>2 </sub>surface. Typical forces are from about 0.05 pN to about 5 pN for in-plane transport and from 0.5 to 30 pN towards the surface, depending on the magnetic field gradient generating structure, the position of the particle and the current in the current carrying structure which is used to generate the magnetic field(s).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0110">It is believed that this is due to electrostatic interactions events which is believed to be predictable by DLVO theory.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0111">The invention therefore relates to methods for movement of magnetic particles in solutions other than pure water, e.g. solutions with pH values in the order of 2-12 and different from 7 in case the ionic strength is not 1E-7 M, and ionic strengths e.g. 1 mM-10 mM. (e.g. 10 mM NaOH gives pH 12, ionic strength of 10E-2). In these solutions, magnetic forces are not always the dominant forces acting on the particle and depending on the conditions particles can be immobilised or trapped onto the surface. It is believed that electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are at least partly responsible for these effects. The electrostatic force depends on the total charge of both the particle and device surface, which is a function of the pH, and the ionic content and strength, which screens these charges.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0112">It is believed that also other forces are acting on the magnetic beads or particles as for instance steric or structural forces (e.g. hydrophobicity, conformation and allostery).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0113">One needs thus to understand the forces acting on the magnetic beads to stabilise the system and make manipulation of magnetic particles in solution other than water still possible.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0114">The present invention will be described with respect to particular embodiments and with reference to certain drawings but the invention is not limited thereto but only by the claims. The drawings described are only schematic and are non-limiting. In the drawings, the size of some of the elements may be exaggerated and not drawn on scale for illustrative purposes.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0117">The active substrate of the magnetic sensor can consist for instance of a metal (e.g. gold) surface or an oxide surface. These surfaces can be modified with, amongst others, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols or silanes as coupling layers. These SAMs can be homogeneous or a mixture of different molecules, presenting different end-groups especially designed towards reduction of non-specific binding of the analyte and towards good characteristics for coupling the receptor molecules. Different protein receptors, e.g. conventional antibodies, chemically modified conventionally antibodies, recombinant scFv's (Single Chain F Variable), recombinant VHH camel antibodies, aptamers (or any other biomolecule known by the skilled person to be usable as a receptor for protein detection), can be attached, preferably covalently, to the coupling layer by the usage of various coupling chemistries, followed by one or more blocking step(s) of the complete sensor surface. The sensor platform is now ready to perform different types of assays, i.e. inhibition assays, competition assays, displacement assays and ELISA-like sandwich assays, all using magnetic particles as label in the final binding step, or in different steps of this binding cascade. All these assays are mostly based on biomolecular interactions and most assays make use of secondary antibodies. Modification of the secondary antibodies and conjugation of the magnetic particles with the corresponding biospecies is in most cases necessary. Commonly used receptors/ligands are, but are not limited to biotin modified antibodies/streptavidin modified magnetic particles, digoxigen modified antibodies/Anti-digoxigen modified magnetic particles, not modified antibodies/proteinA or proteinG modified magnetic particles, 6His labelled antibodies/Ni-NTA modified magnetic particles, etc. The device surface is washed between some binding steps and preferably each binding step of the assay. To allow quantitative detection of the analyte, the biomolecular interactions need to be efficiently regenerated by the use of typical regeneration buffers, which are known by the skilled person in the field. These buffers will break one or more biomolecular bonds in the assay and have to be compatible with the release and repositioning of the magnetic particles sensor principle, which is based on the movement of magnetic particles.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0127">Given the dipole field generated by magnetic particles with an external field perpendicular to the surface, one can calculate that the signal will be maximised when only 50% of the particle covers one track MR sensor, which can be a single rectangular stripe, or serpentine shaped structure as shown in BARC III (&#x201c;Design and Performance of GMR sensors for the detection of magnetic microbeads in biosensors&#x201d;, J. C. Rife, M. M. Miller, P. E. Sheehan, C. R. Tamanaha, M. Tondra and L. J. Whitman, &#x201c;Sensors and Actuators A&#x201d;, 107, 2003, p 209-218). This can be achieved by releasing the particles, applying an external magnetic field with a perpendicular-to-plane orientation and by putting a (small) current trough the sensor (experimentally verified) or through a structure underlying the sensor, which can independently carry a current and which can be for instance of the same size of the sensor and aligned to the sensor or a similar structure having the same effect. When the particle is in the vicinity of the sensor, it will be attracted towards the edge of the sensor, maximising the signal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Particles on opposing edges of a detector unit may induce complementary signals in the unit such that the total signal may be reduced. Therefore it is advantageous to apply an external magnetic field perpendicular to the surface which will not be sensed by the sensor, but which will remove particles at one of the opposing edges (and possibly moves those beads to the other opposing edge). This way the signal strength will again be increased.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0136">The present invention thus provides a magnetic particle detector capable of breaking bonds and subsequently repositioning the particles to a better place so that a higher detection signal is obtained. An enhancing effect obtained by moving particles towards the sensor is only advantageous for low analyte/particle concentrations. If the concentration of particles is too high, particles will start to form clusters. This will make it more difficult to get a quantitative result from the sensor. The skilled person can easily determine a suitable particle concentration to obtain optimal results.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simulated output signal from the sensor when a magnetic particle with (a) an out-of-plane (perpendicular) or (b) in-plane magnetisation is moved along the sensitive axis of the sensor. Sensor width is 2 micron, signal is maximised when the centre of the particle (2 micron diameter) is located above the edge of the sensor. Thus, 50% of the particle is covering the sensor. In case of an out-of-plane component, the signal is maximised when the particle is completely covering the sensor (centre of particle and centre of sensor are at the same position.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> draws the repositioning of magnetic particles towards the edge of the sensor. Only about 50% of the particle will cover the sensor, maximising in this way the signal measured by the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0139">As described before, magnetic particle detectors sense random magnetic fields coming from magnetic particles positioned at different locations from the sensor. This lowers the average signal contribution for one magnetic particle. In order to solve this problem, one needs to be able to break biomolecular bond and transport the magnetic particles in this solution. In this way, the random contribution of each particle is removed: all particles contribute to the signal in the same amount since their distance to the sensor is constant. Further, the signal from 1 particle is maximised by both placing the particle at the optimal position and by adjusting the sensor geometry for optimal performance (extra degree of freedom).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0140">Breaking biomolecular bonds and ensuring the continued interaction (electrostatic, etc.) of the bead with the substrate, requires transport of particles in specific buffers for proteins, DNA as well as whole cells.</p>
