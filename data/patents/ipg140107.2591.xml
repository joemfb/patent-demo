<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Advanced system-in-package (SiP) designs require substantial innovation in packaging and interconnect technology in order to achieve their ultimate promise for delivering affordable, high functionality, compact devices. Future systems will require combinations of radio frequency (RF), optoelectronics, high-speed logic, memory, and MEMS-enabled functionality, all combined into a single, compact, lightweight and low-power SiP. A fundamental consideration in implementing a SiP design of this sort is how to accomplish heterogeneous integration of the various system components, without incurring unacceptable penalties in terms of either performance or cost. The ability to integrate circuits and components fabricated using disparate and incompatible fabrication processes (e.g. CMOS and bipolar) and materials (Si, III-V semiconductors) is critical for providing the means to realize, in a single package, higher levels of functionality than are presently possible.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In one embodiment the quilt packaging system of the present invention uses the vertical facets on edges of a microchip to make direct electrical contact between integrated circuits. Metal or otherwise conductive nodules are revealed on the vertical surfaces of each microchip, and multiple microchips are welded together in a pattern reminiscent of a quilt to form high-performance electrical connections between the microchips. In this way, the delays and other constraints due to chip-to-package and package-to-chip data transfers are avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In one embodiment of the present invention, the quilt packaging system of the present invention allows for chips to be directly interconnected without the need to go through first-level packaging to printed circuit boards (PCBs) or multichip modules (MCMs). The quilt packaging system of the present invention forms contacts along the vertical edge facets of integrated circuits, enabling ICs or other types of microchips to be interconnected by placing them side-by-side. This technology may have a dramatic impact on the way portable and high-performance electronic systems are designed, particularly for complex or cost-sensitive applications. Possible applications include optical spectroscopy for on-chip chemical analysis, high-speed optical networking, RF communication systems, and advanced mixed-signal electronics. Although various processes may be used to form the quilt packaging system of the present invention, one process that may be used involves using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and metal plating, which together may be used to form solid metallic contacts along the vertical edge facets of one or more microchips. The planar geometry of the edge interconnects promises ultra-high signal bandwidths and excellent signal integrity characteristics, while simultaneously achieving high pitch density.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The quilt packaging system of the present invention provides an ultrafast, high density, inexpensive SiP packaging that embraces heterogeneous device technologies. Its potential impact can hardly be overstated. The limitations of silicon technology, as described by the ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors), would be nearly sidestepped in the proposed SiP approach. Using the quilt packaging system the emphasis on ICs following Moore's law may shift from increasing transistor density and complexity to the systems level (i.e. increasing system-level complexity, with only modestly increasing die complexity).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The quilt packaging system of the present invention provides a new concept in high-speed, high-density, heterogeneous integration. Also, RF systems using quilt packaging provide benefits in cost and performance as compared to current ways of mounting microchips. In addition, as described below and shown in the drawings, the present invention provides a process scheme for achieving chip features suitable for quilt packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The present invention also provides the ability to integrate circuits and components fabricated using disparate and incompatible fabrication processes and materials and offers the opportunity to realize, in a single package, higher levels of functionality than are presently possible. This approach provides solutions to realizing compact systems for advanced remote sensing, bio-chemical agent detection, electronic communications, and high-performance networking applications where heterogeneous integration of sensors, optoelectronic devices, and high-performance electronics are required.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The present invention provides a technique for interconnecting directly between adjacent chips without the need to go through first-level packaging to PCBs or MCMs. This approach facilitates integration of, within a single package, silicon and III-V, II-VI or IV-IV semiconductor ICs while simultaneously improving the bandwidth and signal integrity of the interconnections between these devices and circuits. Thus, the packaging approach of the present invention is a natural means to achieve true SiP and system-on-chip (SoC) implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The quilt packaging system of the present invention has applications in a number of advanced RF and communications applications requiring either high electrical interconnect performance or the integration of optoelectronic, electronic, and sensory components in a single package. Applications include ultracompact RF communications equipment, high-speed optical networking, advanced mixed-signal electronics, as well as bio-chemical agent detection and remote sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In addition to the benefits already described, the quilt packaging system of the present invention may provide: enhanced heat dissipation through support chips, system cost reduction by allowing increased functionality within a single package, heterogeneous integration of ICs and components fabricated using different processes (e.g. bipolar and CMOS) and material systems (e.g. Si and III-V semiconductors), functional partitioning of ICs allowing complex designs to be broken into functional sub-block ICs and integrated into a full system in a single package, increased usable wafer area and silicon efficiency by elimination of saw streets and bond pads, decreased weight and volume of chip and board structures, circuit simplification and area reduction through elimination of ESD protection circuits and high-power pin drivers.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Because the microchips and other electrical components in the quilt packaging system are conductively connected over much reduced distances compared with conventional interconnect technologies, for example PCBs, the capacitance of the interconnects that run between the electrical systems is significantly reduced, and the pad drivers and their associated power dissipation can be eliminated. Significant reductions in overall circuit power dissipation result.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The quilt packaging system may be used by itself or in combination with existing bonding techniques for microchips and electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In one embodiment, the quilt packaging system of the present invention employs DRIE and plating to form metal-filled deep trenches at the edges of a die-on-wafer to provide an additional means of interconnection besides bonding pads/wires. The various die-on-wafer in the system are interconnected either wholly or partly by butting them edgewise against each other, as depicted in the embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Conventional wirebonds may still be used to provide interconnections to next-level packaging and conventional pin arrays and lead frames.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified representation of two IC chips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> of the present invention including edge interconnections.

Notches <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> at respective front edges of chips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are cutaways to show the details of respective interconnect regions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. Chips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> also include several layers of circuitry <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> that include terminal ends <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> at interconnect regions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Although for simplicity, there are only 4 interconnect regions shown for each chip in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in actual chips there may be many more than 4 interconnect regions. Also, although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> it appears that only one layer of circuitry has terminal ends in the interconnect regions, the chips of the present invention may have terminal ends in more than one circuitry layer of the chip. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and in all of the drawings described below, unless otherwise specified, there are several layers of circuitry in each of the IC chips that is represented by one or two layers of &#x201c;simplified circuitry&#x201d; for convenience of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The protruding edge interconnection nodules may be formed by DRIE of trenches and grooves, followed by plating to fill the grooves and form the nodules. The trenches will be designed for easy die separation leaving metallized nodules on the edges of the wafer. Assuming a die edge of 10 mm and a nodule pitch of 20 &#x3bc;m, two thousand such nodules could be fabricated along the periphery. Larger chips and finer pitch may allow yet more nodules to be disposed along the periphery. Nodules may be plated up to extend beyond the edge of the die-on-wafer so that physical contact between adjacent die on any conventional package support substrate may be achieved.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> a semiconductor wafer <b>202</b> is shown including microchips <b>204</b> each of which is separated from a neighboring microchip <b>204</b> by spacer regions <b>206</b>. Trenches <b>210</b> are etched in spacer regions <b>206</b> alongside edges <b>212</b> of each microchip <b>204</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows trenches <b>210</b> in one spacer region <b>206</b> in greater detail. Next, the exposed surfaces of trenches <b>210</b> are passivated by forming an oxide layer <b>216</b> on the exposed surfaces of trenches <b>210</b> by using a known semiconductor oxidation technique. The passivation of trenches <b>210</b> electrically isolates the metal interconnect nodules (described below) that are deposited in the holes from the rest of semiconductor wafer <b>202</b>. Then a resist coating is applied to wafer <b>202</b>. After the resist coating is applied, the resist coating is removed from trenches <b>210</b> to form openings. Then, metal is deposited into trenches <b>210</b> through the openings in the resist. Next the resist is removed. An electroless plating process is then applied to the deposited seed metal to form metal interconnect nodules <b>224</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. Then metal interconnect nodules <b>224</b> are subject to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). The appearance of metal interconnect nodules <b>224</b> after polishing is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>. Intermetal dielectric material is then deposited prior to forming electrical connections <b>232</b> with on-chip wiring (not shown) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>. After electrical connections <b>232</b> are formed, microchips <b>204</b> that include interconnect nodules <b>224</b> and spacer regions <b>244</b> are separated from each other using DRIE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> shows wafer <b>202</b> as wafer <b>202</b> appears after DRIE with portions <b>246</b> still connecting microchips <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> also shows how spacer regions <b>244</b> may be further etched between interconnect nodules <b>224</b> so that interconnect nodules <b>224</b> protrude laterally from chips <b>204</b>. Final separation of microchips <b>204</b> from each other may be completed by backside wafer thinning. Separated microchips <b>204</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>. The semiconductor wafer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, <b>2</b>D, <b>2</b>E, <b>2</b>F, <b>2</b>G, and <b>2</b>H may be made of any type of semiconductor material such as Si, GaAs, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In one embodiment of the present invention, instead of the oxide layer <b>216</b>, the surfaces of the trenches <b>210</b> are passivated using PECVD nitride. Other methods of passivating the surfaces of the trenches include PECVD oxide, sputtered oxide, low-k dielectrics, or other dielectric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A seed may then be applied to trenches prior to depositing metal in the trenches to ensure that the deposited metal will end up in the trenches and not elsewhere on the silicon wafer. Suitable seed materials for the purposes of the present invention are well known to those in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In one embodiment the holes in the semiconductor wafer used to mold the interconnect nodules are formed by photolithography and DRIE. Other methods of forming the trenches of the present invention include such lithographic techniques as electron beam, x-ray, extreme ultraviolet and any other method that may be used to form patterns on a semiconductor substrate. Also, the trenches may be formed by RIE, isotropic wet etching and other suitable etching techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques that may be used in polishing metal interconnect nodules of the present invention include suitable planarization methods used with semiconductor wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, for simplicity, only one layer of electrical connections between the metal interconnect nodules and on-chip wiring is shown, in actual chips there may be multiple layers of electrical connections. Electrical connections may be made from any layer of the on-chip wiring to the interconnect nodules of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The interconnect nodule metallization plating may be copper, gold, or other malleable low-resistance material with an overlay of a flowable solder material, although pure metals such as copper or gold alone may be used with an ultrasonic weld step.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Exposure of the interconnect nodules to form protruding interconnect nodules may be accomplished by performing first an anisotropic etch for depth below the nodules, with substrate material remaining directly beneath the nodules, followed by an isotropic etch that causes the vertical surfaces of the die to recede, allowing the nodules to protrude beyond the edges of the die. Large interconnect nodules and large pitches may be exposed by using isotropic etching or crystallographic etching, whereas small nodules and fine pitch may require both anisotropic and isotropic etch techniques combined. Large pitch exposure could be accomplished using isotropic etching or crystallographic etching, either by plasmas such as those containing SF<sub>6</sub>, liquids such as KOH solutions, or vapors such as XeF<sub>2</sub>. Other chemistries could also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In quilt packaging systems of the present invention, the interconnect nodules of two microchips of the present invention may be placed in electrical communication with each other by thermomechanical or ultrasonic bonding, heat welding, laser welding, etc. Other particular techniques for electrically connecting the interconnect nodules of the present invention are described below.</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The pitch of the interconnect nodules in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> is shown as being 10 &#x3bc;m, but other pitches may be used as well depending on the size of the chips and interconnect nodules used.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As SiP architectures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> illustrate, ICs or other electronic devices that are fabricated with dramatically different processes may be integrated together in a single package, raising the possibility of integration with III-V and other devices (e.g. III-V power amplifiers, SiGe low-noise amplifiers, etc.) for RF communications, as well as the functional integration of silicon-based circuits utilizing incompatible fabrication processes. This is of course only one example of this technology's potential application; any system requiring compact integration of devices, sensors, and integrated circuits can be interconnected using this technique, and reap the benefits of compact implementation and high-performance electrical interconnections. It is important to note that the quilt packaging approach does not preclude the simultaneous use of other dense packaging approaches, including conventional wire bonding, flip chip, and ball grid array techniques. Edge interconnection using interconnect nodules is complementary and can be used to augment these preexisting approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The present invention provides a novel solution to the problem of continued proliferation of interconnect pads following Rent's rule (P. Christie and D. Stroobandt, &#x201c;The Interpretation and Application of Rent's Rule,&#x201d; <i>IEEE Trans. on VLSI Systems, Special Issue on System</i>-<i>Level Interconnect Prediction</i>, vol. 8, no. 6, pp. 639-648, 2000) and the increase in number of logic gates per die-on-wafer as predicted by the ITRS.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Irvine Sensors Corporation, Costa Mesa, Calif. has made attempts to solve the problem of the proliferation of interconnect pads using stacked memory die techniques. This technique makes use of a 3D packaging concept, but requires chips to be thinned, stacked, and interconnected both through the wafers and along the edges of the stacks.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The quilt packaging system of the present invention provides at least three advantages compared to the Irvine Sensors techniques. First, the quilt packaging system of the present invention provides better thermal control, since each die is heat-sinked directly to a package substrate. Secondly, the quilt packaging system of the present invention provides higher speed, since each microchip may be contiguous with one or more other die, and possibly more if several smaller die are adjacent to a large one, for example as shown in the baseband processor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Another advantage of the quilt packing technique of the present invention is that the system may be used to achieve wide-bandwidths while remaining resonance-free, by avoiding the electromagnetic discontinuity arising from the radical changes in transmission line properties for horizontal to vertical interconnects. Such issues will become critical as signal frequencies extend well into the multi-GHz regime. By virtue of its planar geometry, the quilt packaging system of the present invention may provide ultrawide interconnect bandwidths and excellent signal integrity. Many benefits and opportunities resulting from the quilt packaging system are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The quilt packaging system of the present invention provides high-speed, high-signal-integrity chip-to-chip interconnects. The quilt packaging system of the present invention may also provide high-speed, low-loss, and low-noise characteristics for critical applications within SiPs. A high-speed interface with good signal integrity performance may be provided by the quilt packaging system of the present invention due to the edge interconnect geometry. The quilt interconnect geometry essentially results in an extension, from one chip to the next, of the same planar interconnect geometry as is used within a chip. As a consequence of this preservation of the conventional on-chip interconnect geometry, the electromagnetic discontinuities that are inherent in wirebond-based interconnects (and to a lesser degree in flip-chip implementations) may be eliminated almost entirely. This permits resonance-free high-speed interconnects to be designed and fabricated that exhibit a minimum of signal and ground bounce, overshoot, or ringing. In addition, the ability to connect die that are fabricated with completely different fabrication processes and materials make SiPs based on a variety of heterogeneous technologies possible, including CMOS, Si and SiGe bipolar, III-V semiconductors, and MEMS. A feature of one embodiment of the present invention is that each piece of the SiP may be fabricated most efficiently using the best technology for its specific function without compromising either cost or performance due to manufacturing multiple technologies on a single substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the major components of a mobile telephony handset, digital system, optical communications system, or other advanced system using heterogeneous IC technologies may be integrated in a single package through quilt packaging. This integration results in a unique combination of exceptional power and energy efficiency, cost efficiency, flexibility in fabrication and individual function optimization (e.g. SiGe RF processor/LNA, III-V power amplifier, CMOS baseband processor), and high interconnect performance. Such heterogeneous integration across disparate material systems and fabrication processes permits straightforward and cost-effective SiP implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The quilt packaging system of the present invention also provides a low cost packaging system for microchips, even with increased system performance. The quilt packaging system of the present invention may allow the combining of multiple die into a single package with increased speed and lower noise, as well as with greatly increased design flexibility since each microchip may be fabricated using different technologies and/or material systems. The need for fewer packages, which add significantly to the final microchip cost, may lower the system cost considerably. Conventional wafer-level packaging (WLP) and chip-scale packaging (CSP) technologies are often regarded as best suited for economical but lower-performance packaging needs. However, the quilt packaging system of the present invention may be used to extend WLP's reach into higher performance applications as well. Additionally, significantly less PCB area may be required for a quilt packaging system of the present invention due the use of a smaller number of enhanced-functionality packages. The limitation of PCB technology in terms of wiring pitch, etc. is less problematic for a quilt packaging system of the present invention since many of the interconnects are routed directly between chips, and system reliability may be improved due to the easing of PCB layer constraints and the use of fewer packages to fail. In fact, for applications in remote sensing and bio-chemical agent detection, the entire system (sensor, processing electronics, and wireless communication ICs) may be integrated within a single quilt package system with no need for a PCB at all. This offers an opportunity for dramatic decreases in cost and increases in deployability over prior packaging systems.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The quilt packaging system of the present invention offers high chip real estate efficiency. By using the quilt packaging system of the present invention, support circuitry such as pad drivers and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection may be obviated for many signal lines since ICs will interface directly to each other within a single package rather than to long wires (wire bonds and PCB traces) with connections to the outside world and thus subject to ESD. This will result in even greater savings in chip real estate, enhanced reliability from the standpoints of both improved system ESD immunity and that of manufacturing (omission of ESD circuitry), and enhanced energy efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The quilt packing system of the present invention provides lower kerf losses than current packaging systems. Manufacturing costs for quilt packaging systems are lower than for current packaging systems due to the &#x201c;free&#x201d; streets for die-on-wafer separation without the need for wafer sawing. The ITRS indicates that die sizes will saturate and may even shrink toward the year 2016. In this case, it is unlikely that wafer dicing saw technology will keep pace, so a continually larger fraction of the wafer area will be dedicated to kerf and sawing issues. Using the DRIE separation technique as part of one method for making the quilt packaging system of the present invention, the improved areal efficiency may result in additional die per wafer.

Contact bars <b>2618</b> may be used to mount additional microchips (not shown) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In one embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to create interconnect nodules in the production of conventional microchips connected to a PCB with wirebonds. In this case, the interconnect nodules may serve as outlets for testing or for additional functions, such as entering security codes that should not be entered through conventional contacts such as wirebonds.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">To better ensure convenient contact between microchips and PCBs, in one embodiment of the present invention it is possible to utilize conventional microchips with wirebonds to which microchips of the present invention may be connected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A</figref>, <b>27</b>B, <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> show a quilt packaging system <b>2702</b> of the present invention including four square microchips <b>2704</b> and a rectangular microchip <b>2706</b> that are connected together by interconnect nodules (not shown). Quilt packaging system <b>2702</b> is electrically connected to contact bars <b>2712</b> of a PCB <b>2714</b> by wirebonds <b>2716</b> extending from rectangular microchip <b>2706</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref> show a quilt packaging system <b>2802</b> of the present invention including four peripheral hexagonal microchips <b>2804</b> and a central hexagonal microchip <b>2806</b> that are connected together by interconnect nodules (not shown). Quilt packaging system <b>2802</b> is electrically connected to contact bars <b>2812</b> of a PCB <b>2814</b> by wirebonds <b>2816</b> extending from central hexagonal microchip <b>2806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Although only a few shapes of microchips are shown being interconnected in the quilt packaging systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A</figref>, <b>27</b>B, <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B, various combinations of microchip shapes may be used in a quilt packaging system that is wirebonded to a PCB. For example, an octagonal microchip that is wire bonded to a PCB may be connected by interconnect nodules to square chips and/or rectangular microchips and/or hexagonal microchips.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">To enhance the electrical connection between interconnect nodules of the present invention it is possible to create spheroid-shaped end interconnect nodules that are deformed by the connection process. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref> show two microchips <b>2902</b> and <b>2904</b> having spheroid-shaped end interconnect nodules <b>2912</b> and spheroid-shaped end interconnect nodules <b>2914</b>, respectively, connected to circuitry <b>2916</b> and <b>2918</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29C and 29D</figref> show microchips <b>2902</b> and <b>2904</b> pushed against each other to deform interconnect nodules <b>2912</b> and interconnect nodules <b>2914</b> as interconnect nodules <b>2912</b> and interconnect nodules <b>2914</b> are driven into each other, indicated by arrows <b>2932</b> and <b>2934</b> and as ultrasonic welding is applied, indicated by sinusoids <b>2936</b> and <b>2938</b>, to bond together interconnect nodules <b>2912</b> and <b>2914</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Although the welding technique shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29C and 29D</figref> is ultrasonic welding, other types of welding such as heat welding, laser welding, or any other type of welding used to join two pieces of metals may be used to bond together the interconnect nodules of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">It is also possible to create interconnect nodules on the microchips of the present invention from materials having different hardness and deformation characteristics. For example, the contacts may be made from different metals or from different alloys of the same metal having different hardnesses. Such interconnect nodules may be used in an intrusion bonding process such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A</figref>, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, and <b>30</b>D. In an intrusion bonding process, the interconnect nodules made of the harder material each have a sharp end while the softer interconnect nodules each has a blunt end. During the bonding process, the sharp end presses into the softer one to create a good contact. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A and 30B</figref> show two microchips <b>3002</b> and <b>3004</b> having blunt end interconnect nodules <b>3012</b> and sharp end interconnect nodules <b>3014</b>, respectively, connected to circuitry <b>3016</b> and <b>3018</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30C and 30D</figref> show microchips <b>3002</b> and <b>3004</b> pushed against each other, indicated by arrows <b>3032</b> and <b>3034</b>, to deform blunt interconnect nodules <b>3012</b> as interconnect nodules <b>3014</b> pushes into interconnect nodule <b>3012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">After the sharp end interconnect nodules are pushed into the blunt interconnect nodules, each set of blunt end and sharp end interconnect nodules may be welded together using a welding technique such as ultrasonic welding, heat welding, laser welding, etc. to bond the blunt end and sharp end interconnect nodules together. Also, it may be possible to employ a procedure similar to that described above using blunt end and sharp end interconnect nodules having the same hardness.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Although the microchips in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A-30D</figref> are shown with interconnect nodules all having the same shape, not all of the interconnect nodules on a given microchip or a given edge of a microchip need have the same shape. For example, the interconnect nodules may alternate between blunt and sharp interconnect nodules on a given edge or half the edges of a microchip may having sharp interconnect nodules and the other half of the edges may have blunt interconnect nodules.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In addition, it may be possible to pre-shape interconnect nodules having a approximately the same hardness so that one set of interconnect nodules will mate with the other set of interconnect nodules when the interconnect nodules are brought together. For example, one set of interconnect nodules may be made to have a male shape while other interconnect nodules may have a female shape, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A</figref>, <b>37</b>B, <b>37</b>C, <b>37</b>D, described below. Also, not all of the interconnect nodules on a given microchip or a given edge of a microchip need have the same shape. For example, the interconnect nodules may alternate between male and female shaped interconnect nodules on a given edge or half the edges of a microchip may having male interconnect nodules and the other half of the edges may have female interconnect nodules. Also, the interconnect nodules may have other male and female pre-formed shapes than the shapes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37C and 37D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">An example of bonding interconnect nodules of the present invention using a laser beam is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>. Microchips <b>3102</b> and <b>3104</b> include interconnect nodules <b>3106</b> and <b>3108</b>, respectively. As microchips <b>3102</b> and <b>3104</b> are moved towards each other, as indicated by arrows <b>3112</b> and <b>3114</b>, a laser beam <b>3122</b> bonds interconnect nodules <b>3106</b> and <b>3108</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Ground connections may be included in the microchips of the present invention to serve as electromagnetic shields. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows two microchips <b>3202</b> and <b>3204</b> having respective interconnect nodules <b>3206</b> and <b>3208</b> connected to circuits <b>3212</b> and <b>3214</b>, respectively. Each set of interconnect nodules <b>3206</b> and <b>3208</b> are bonded to each other. Microchips <b>3202</b> and <b>3204</b> also include ground connections <b>3222</b> and <b>3224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The high electrical performance afforded by direct-conductive edge interconnects allows the use of high speed serial data transfers between chips. Serializing the data allows data to be transferred using a smaller number of interconnects. In one embodiment of the present invention the USB-2 protocol may be used for the interconnect nodules that electrically connect the microchips of a quilt packaging system of the present invention with each other or with another electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">If for some reason it is impossible or impractical to connect the microchips directly along their edges, special connectors may be utilized such rigid connectors to fix the microchip and/or flexible connectors that allow for adjustments in distance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref> show the use of a rigid connector <b>3302</b> that electrically connects microchips <b>3304</b> and <b>3306</b> to each other.

Interconnect nodules <b>3324</b> are connected to circuitry <b>3334</b> and interconnect nodules <b>3326</b> are connected to circuitry <b>3336</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</figref> show the use of two-section flexible connector <b>3402</b> that electrically connects microchips <b>3404</b> and <b>3406</b> to each other.

Sections <b>3412</b> and <b>3416</b> are connected to each other by a connecting cord <b>3422</b>. Inside connecting cord <b>3422</b> are wires <b>3424</b> that connect sets of contacts <b>3414</b> and <b>3418</b> to each other. Contacts <b>3414</b> make direct electrical contact with interconnect nodules <b>3434</b> of microchip <b>3404</b> and contacts <b>3418</b> make direct electrical contact with interconnect nodules <b>3436</b> of microchip <b>3406</b>. Interconnect nodules <b>3434</b> are connected to circuitry <b>3444</b> and interconnect nodules <b>3436</b> are connected to circuitry <b>3446</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The microchips of the present invention also allow for increasing dynamism of contacts. In addition to the static type of electrical contact between chips described in the embodiments above, the microchips of the present invention may be dynamically connected to provide on-off contacts.

A semiconductor wafer was formed in a conventional fashion to include die-on-wafer. Trenches were etched alongside edges of each microchip. Trenches for the edges of some microchips were shaped to produce male interconnect nodules and the trenches for the edges of other microchips were shaped to produce female interconnect nodules. Next, the exposed surfaces of the trenches were passivated by forming an oxide layer on the exposed surfaces of trenches by using a known semiconductor oxidation technique. Then a metal seed layer was evaporated on the whole wafer. Then a resist coating was applied. After the resist coating was applied, the resist coating was removed from everywhere but the trenches to protect the trenches. Then the metal seed layer was removed everywhere except where protected. Next the resist was removed. An electroless plating solution was then applied over the deposited seed metal to form metal interconnect nodules. Then metal interconnect nodules were subject to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Then interconnect nodules and non-conducting spacing regions were separated from each other using DRIE. Final separation of the microchips from each other could be completed by backside wafer thinning, as suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>.</p>
