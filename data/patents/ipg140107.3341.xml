<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor device manufacturing technique which allows reduction of semiconductor chip size. First, a pad and other wires are formed over an insulating film. A surface protective film is formed over the insulating film including the pad and wires, and an opening is made in the surface protective film. The opening lies over the pad and exposes a surface of the pad. A bump electrode is formed over the surface protective film including the opening. Here, the pad is smaller than the bump electrode. Consequently, the wires are arranged just beneath the bump electrode in the same layer as the pad <b>10</b>. In other words, the wires are arranged in space which becomes available because the pad is small enough.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same and more particularly to a technique which is useful for semiconductor devices used in LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) drivers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 10 (1995)-233507 discloses a technique which reduces the chip area and achieves production efficiency improvement and cost reduction regarding semiconductor integrated circuits such as driver ICs with many output pads and electronic circuit devices such as electronic clocks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Concretely, an output pads is placed over a drive transistor to be connected with the output pad or over a logic circuit so that they overlap each other as seen in a plan view. Furthermore, not only aluminum wires but also bump electrodes or barrier metals are used for semiconductor device wiring interconnection. Also, in a case that a semiconductor integrated circuit is electrically bonded over a printed circuit board face down, electrical connections are made by directly connecting solder bumps of the semiconductor integrated circuit with wires of the printed circuit board. In this case, bump electrodes as external connection terminals for the semiconductor integrated circuit are stacked over transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, FIG. 18 of the above patent document shows that a bump output pad lies over a drive transistor. Hence, since the drive transistor and the output pad overlap as seen in a plan view, the chip area can be reduced. Furthermore, FIG. 26 of the document shows that one diffusion area and another diffusion area are electrically connected by bump interconnection. This structure makes it possible to have one more wiring layer as compared with the conventional structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, LCDs which use liquid crystal for display devices have been spreading rapidly. These LCDs are controlled by drivers which drive them. An LCD driver comprises a semiconductor chip, which is typically mounted on a glass substrate. The semiconductor chip which constitutes the LCD driver has a structure that plural transistors and multi layer interconnections are formed over a semiconductor substrate with bump electrodes on its surface. The chip is mounted over the glass substrate through the bump electrodes formed on the surface. Here, the semiconductor chip and the glass substrate are connected through the bump electrodes. For the purpose of increasing the adhesive force, the bump electrode area is enlarged to increase the area of contact between the semiconductor chip and the glass substrate. In other words, bump electrodes of a semiconductor chip which constitutes an LCD driver are much larger than bump electrodes of semiconductor chips for general purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an LCD driver, an insulating film which functions as a passivation film is formed under bump electrodes and connected with pads formed in the top layer of the multilayer interconnection through openings in the insulating film. Usually the area of an opening and the area of a pad are determined according to the area of a bump electrode so that they are almost equal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As mentioned above, pads which match large bump electrodes are formed in the top layer of the semiconductor chip multilayer interconnection. More specifically, pads which have almost the same area as the bump electrodes are formed in the top layer. This means that in order to leave space for forming interconnection wires different from pads in the top layer of the multilayer interconnection, the semiconductor chip size must be larger.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another problem is that in a normal structure in, which bump electrodes are formed just above bonding pads, the positions of bump electrodes are fixed and there are limitations about the layout arrangement of wiring elements such as pads. Consequently it is difficult to adopt a layout arrangement which permits efficient reduction of semiconductor chip size.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a technique which permits reduction of semiconductor chip size.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide a technique which permits greater latitude in the layout arrangement of interconnection wires formed in the semiconductor chip.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail referring to the accompanying drawings. In all the drawings that illustrate the preferred embodiments, elements with like functions are basically designated by like reference numerals and repeated descriptions thereof are omitted.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing the structure of a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> (semiconductor device) according to the first embodiment. The semiconductor chip <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment is a driver for an LCD. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> has a semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> which takes the form of, for example, an elongated rectangle, and for example, an LCD driver which drives a liquid crystal display is formed on its main surface. This driver has the function of controlling the orientations of liquid crystal molecules by supplying voltage to each pixel in a cell array constituting the LCD and includes gate drive circuits <b>3</b>, a source drive circuit <b>4</b>, a liquid crystal circuit <b>5</b>, graphic RAMs (Random Access Memories) <b>6</b>, and peripheral circuits <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the vicinity of the periphery of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, a plurality of bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged at regular intervals along the periphery of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>. These bump electrodes <b>8</b> lie over active regions where elements and interconnection wires of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> are located. The plural bump electrodes <b>8</b> include bump electrodes for integrated circuits which are necessary for an integrated circuit configuration and dummy electrodes which are not necessary for the integrated circuit configuration. Bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern in the vicinities of one long edge and the two short edges of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>. The plural bump electrodes <b>8</b> arranged in a zigzag pattern are mainly used as bump electrodes for gate output signals or source output signals. The bump electrodes <b>8</b> arranged in a zigzag pattern around the center of the long edge of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> are bump electrodes for source output signals and those arranged in a zigzag pattern along the long edge of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> in the vicinities of its corners and those arranged in a zigzag pattern along the short edges of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> are bump electrodes for gate output signals. This zigzag pattern allows arrangement of many bump electrodes necessary for gate output signals and source output signals while eliminating the need for increase in the size of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>. In other words, it is possible to reduce the chip size and increase the number of bump electrodes at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the vicinity of the other long edge of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged not in a zigzag pattern but linearly. The linearly arranged bump electrodes <b>8</b> are bump electrodes for digital input signals or analog input signals. Also dummy bump electrodes are arranged around the four corners of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, bump electrodes <b>8</b> for gate output signals or source output signals are arranged in a zigzag pattern and bump electrodes <b>8</b> for digital input signals or analog input signals are arranged linearly. However it is also possible that bump electrodes <b>8</b> for gate output signals or source output signals are arranged linearly and bump electrodes <b>8</b> for digital input signals or analog input signals are arranged in a zigzag pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the layers under the top layer are omitted. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a semiconductor element such as a MTSFET (Metal Insulator Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) is formed over the semiconductor substrate and a multilayer interconnection is made over the semiconductor element. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the multilayer interconnection above the top layer of the multilayer interconnection structure.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, top layer interconnection wiring is made over the insulating film <b>9</b> of, for example, oxide silicon. The top layer interconnection wiring includes, for example, a pad <b>10</b> and wires different from the pad <b>10</b>, <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are, for example, signal wires for signals or power wires for power supply or dummy wires. The pad <b>10</b> and wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>consist of, for example, an aluminum film.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A surface protective film (passivation film) <b>12</b> is formed over the pad <b>10</b> and wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>so as to cover the pad <b>10</b> and wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. For example, the surface protective film <b>12</b> consists of an insulating film of silicon nitride. An opening <b>13</b> is made in the surface protective film <b>12</b> to expose a surface of the pad <b>10</b> and a bump electrode <b>8</b> is formed over the surface protective film <b>12</b> including the inside of the opening <b>13</b> through a UBM film <b>14</b> as an undercoat metal film.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Under the bump electrode <b>8</b> are the wiring layer including the pad <b>10</b> and wires <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, and plural other wiring layers (not shown) lying under the wiring layer including the pad <b>10</b> and wires <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, a semiconductor element such as the abovementioned MISFET (not shown) is formed under the bump electrode <b>8</b>. Thus, this makes it possible to reduce the chip area of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> by efficient use of space under the bump electrode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">One characteristic point of the present invention is that the opening <b>13</b> and the pad <b>10</b> are smaller than the bump electrode <b>8</b>. Conventionally an opening <b>13</b> whose size is almost equal to the bump electrode <b>8</b> has been formed under the bump electrode <b>8</b> and a pad <b>10</b> larger than the bump electrode <b>8</b> has been formed under the opening <b>13</b>. In other words, the pad <b>10</b> has been formed under the bump electrode <b>8</b> and the size of the pad <b>10</b> has been almost the same as the size of the bump electrode <b>8</b>. However, in the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> which constitutes an LCD driver, the bump electrode <b>8</b> should be enlarged in order to ensure its adhesion to the glass substrate. Hence, the pad <b>10</b> which is formed in a layer under the bump electrode <b>8</b> should be larger. If the pad <b>10</b> is too large, it would be difficult to leave space for wires different from the pad <b>10</b> in the top layer of the multilayer interconnection and as a consequence the size of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> would have to be increased. On the other hand, in this first, the opening <b>13</b> and the pad <b>10</b> are smaller than the bump electrode <b>8</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Put another way, the bump electrode <b>8</b> is larger than the pad <b>10</b>. When the pad <b>10</b> is smaller than the bump electrode <b>8</b> in this way, space is left for wires different from the pad <b>10</b>, <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, in a layer under the bump electrode <b>8</b>. This may be put as follows. In the conventional structure, because the pad <b>10</b> lies in the top layer just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b>, it has been impossible to make other wires in the same top layer. On the other hand, in the first embodiment, since the pad <b>10</b> is smaller than the bump electrode <b>8</b>, space available for formation of other wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>is left just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> in the same top layer in which the pad <b>10</b> lies. Therefore, it is possible to form wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> in addition to the pad <b>10</b>, so that space just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> can be used effectively and the size of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first embodiment is characterized in that the size of the bump electrode <b>8</b> remains unchanged and the pad <b>10</b> is smaller than the bump electrode <b>8</b>, leaving space for formation of wires different from the pad <b>10</b> for the bump electrode <b>8</b>. In sum, while the area of the bump electrode <b>8</b> to adhere to the glass substrate is large enough, space for wires different from the pad <b>10</b> is left so that the size of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> can be reduced. This technical idea is not described nor suggested even in the patent document cited earlier under the heading &#x201c;BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION&#x201d; and unique to this first embodiment. For example, it is possible to make the bump electrode larger than the pad by increasing the size of the bump electrode without changing the pad size; however, in this case, the size of the pad itself is not reduced and space left by reducing the pad size cannot be obtained. Consequently the size of the semiconductor chip cannot be reduced. Besides, a larger bump electrode leads to a larger semiconductor chip, which means that it is impossible to reduce the size of the semiconductor chip. As discussed above, there are two approaches to realizing a pad electrode smaller than a bump electrode: one is to increase the size of the bump electrode and the other is to reduce the size of the pad. These two approaches are the same in that the pad electrode is smaller than the bump electrode but the approach in which the pad size is reduced is considerably different from the other approach in that space for wires different from the pad is left under the bump electrode in the same layer in which the pad lies. In addition, since the size of the pad itself is reduced, the pad width may be smaller than a relatively wide wire different from the pad, such as a power wire.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line B-B&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the cross section taken along the line B-B&#x2032;, a pad <b>10</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>9</b> and a surface protective film <b>12</b> is formed so as to cover the pad <b>10</b>. An opening <b>13</b> is made in the surface protective film <b>12</b> and a surface of the pad <b>10</b> is exposed at the bottom of the opening <b>13</b>. A bump electrode <b>8</b> is formed over the surface protective film <b>12</b> including the inside of the opening <b>13</b> through a UBM film <b>14</b>. In the direction of the cross section taken along the line B-B&#x2032;, the width of the pad <b>10</b> is almost equal to, or larger than, the width of the bump electrode <b>8</b>. In other words, in the direction of the cross section taken along the line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the width of the pad <b>10</b> is smaller than the width of the bump electrode <b>8</b>, and the pad <b>10</b> and other signal wires and power wires are formed just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b>. On the other hand, in the direction of the cross section taken along the line B-B&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the width of the pad <b>10</b> formed just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> is almost equal to that of the bump electrode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged plan view of region C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing that wires are formed just beneath linearly arranged bump electrodes <b>8</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, rectangular bump electrodes <b>8</b> lie side by side along the short edge direction (perpendicular to the long edge direction). A surface protective film <b>12</b> is formed under the bump electrodes <b>8</b> and openings <b>13</b> are made in the surface protective film <b>12</b>. A pad <b>10</b> is formed in a layer under the opening <b>13</b> made in the surface protective film <b>12</b>. The pad <b>10</b> is electrically connected with a bump electrode <b>8</b> partially buried in the opening. The pad <b>10</b> is square and one edge thereof is slightly longer than the short edge of the bump electrode <b>8</b>. Consequently as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the length of the pad <b>10</b> is slightly larger than the length of the bump electrode <b>8</b> in the short edge direction of the bump electrode <b>8</b>. On the other hand, the length of the pad <b>10</b> is far smaller than the length of the bump electrode <b>8</b> in the long edge direction of the bump electrode <b>8</b>. Specifically, the pad <b>10</b> is smaller than the bump electrode <b>8</b> and the pad <b>10</b> lies only under one end of the bump electrode <b>8</b>. Therefore, in the long edge direction of the bump electrode <b>8</b>, space is left in the same wiring layer in which the pad <b>10</b> lies. Wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>which are different from the pad <b>10</b> are formed in this space. According to the first embodiment, as mentioned above, wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>can be formed just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> in the same layer in which the pad <b>10</b> lies. Since space just beneath the rectangular large bump electrode <b>8</b> can be used effectively, the size of the semiconductor chip can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>are signal wires, power wires or dummy wires and may have different widths. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> indicates that the wire <b>11</b><i>c </i>is wider than the wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. Conventionally the pad size has been similar to the size of the bump electrode <b>8</b> and the pad width is relatively large as compared with other wires. On the other hand, in this first, the pad <b>10</b> is smaller than the bump electrode <b>8</b> and space available for formation of wires is left just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b>. Therefore, the width of the pad <b>10</b> may be smaller than, for example, the width of a power wire formed in the abovementioned space. Thus, according to the first, the width of the pad <b>10</b> may be smaller than the width of another wire.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>extend along the direction perpendicular to the long edge direction of the bump electrode <b>8</b>. Although it is desirable from the viewpoint of effective use of space that the wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>should be perpendicular to the long edge direction of the bump electrodes <b>8</b>, they need not necessarily be perpendicular to the long edge direction of the bump electrodes <b>8</b>. For example, the wires may obliquely intersect with the long edges of the bump electrodes <b>8</b> depending on the interconnection pattern. Even if that is the case, space just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> is available and the semiconductor chip can be smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged plan view of region D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing that wires lie just beneath bump electrodes <b>8</b> arranged in a zigzag pattern. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the long edge direction of the bump electrode <b>8</b>, the width of the bump electrode <b>8</b> is far larger than the width of the pad <b>10</b>, and space is left in the long edge direction of the bump electrode <b>8</b> in the same layer in which the pad <b>10</b> lies. Wires <b>11</b><i>d </i>to <b>11</b><i>k </i>are formed in this space. When bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern, they form two rows as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Therefore, space left just beneath bump electrodes <b>8</b> is larger than when bump electrodes <b>8</b> form one row. This means that if a pad whose size is similar to the size of a bump electrode <b>8</b> is formed, it would be impossible to form other wires in addition to the pad just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b>. In this case, when bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern, which means they are arranged in two rows, space available for formation of wires would be smaller than when bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in one row. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the first embodiment, wires <b>11</b><i>d </i>to <b>11</b><i>g </i>are formed just beneath the bump electrodes <b>8</b> in the first row and wires <b>11</b><i>h </i>to <b>11</b><i>k </i>are formed just beneath the bump electrodes <b>8</b> in the second row. Therefore, even when the bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern, space just beneath the bump electrodes <b>8</b> can be used almost as effectively as when they are arranged in one row. Regarding bump electrodes <b>8</b> of the semiconductor chip, wires can be formed not only beneath bump electrodes <b>8</b> arranged in one row but also beneath the ones in a zigzag pattern and the semiconductor chip size can be thus reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The number of bump electrodes <b>8</b> in region D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is larger than in region C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). This is because more bump electrodes <b>8</b> are needed in region D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in order to drive elements of an LCD screen area <b>20</b> (described later) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The bump electrodes <b>8</b> in region D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are mainly used for gates and sources of elements of the LCD screen area <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the first will be described referring to the accompanying drawings. A semiconductor element such as a MISFET is formed over, for example, a semiconductor substrate of silicon single crystal, and a multilayer interconnection is made over the semiconductor element, though not shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows wires formed in the top layer where the layers under the wires in the top layer are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, an insulating film <b>9</b> of oxide silicon is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The insulating film <b>9</b> may be formed using a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) process. A titanium or titanium nitride film, an aluminum film and a titanium or titanium nitride film are stacked over the insulating film <b>9</b>. Then, patterning is done on the stacked films by photolithography or etching and a pad <b>10</b> and wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are formed by this patterning process. The pad <b>10</b> thus formed is smaller than a bump electrode formed by a process which will be described later. The wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are formed just beneath a bump electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a surface protective film <b>12</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>9</b> in which the pad <b>10</b> and wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are formed. The surface protective film <b>12</b> consists of, for example, a silicon nitride film and is made by a CVD process. Next, an opening <b>13</b> is made in the surface protective film <b>12</b> by photolithography or etching. This opening <b>13</b> lies over the pad <b>10</b> and exposes a surface of the pad <b>10</b>. The opening <b>13</b> should be smaller than the pad <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a UBM (Under Bump Metal) film <b>14</b> is formed over the surface protective film <b>12</b> including the inside of the opening <b>13</b>. The UBM film <b>14</b> is made by sputtering and consists of a single film of titanium, nickel, palladium, titanium-tungsten alloy, titanium nitride or gold or a laminate of films of these materials. The UBM film <b>14</b> has not only the function of improving the adhesion of the bump electrode <b>8</b> to the pad <b>10</b> and surface protective film <b>12</b> but also the barrier function which suppresses or prevents movement of the metal element of a conductive film <b>16</b> made by a subsequent process toward the wire <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>or the like, or movement of the metal element of the wire <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>or the like toward the conductive film <b>16</b>. The plan view size of the UBM film <b>14</b> is larger than that of the opening <b>13</b> and almost equal to that of the conductive film <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, after a resist film <b>15</b> is coated over the UBM film <b>14</b>, patterning is done by exposure and development of the resist film <b>15</b>. Patterning is done in a way not to leave the resist film <b>15</b> in the bump electrode formation region. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, a gold film is formed as a conductive film <b>16</b> by plating. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a bump electrode <b>8</b>, consisting of a conductive film <b>16</b> and a UBM film <b>14</b>, is formed by removing the pattern resist film <b>15</b> and the UBM film <b>14</b> portion covered by the resist film <b>15</b>. Next, separate semiconductor chips are produced by dicing the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the first, since the pad <b>10</b> formed just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> is small, wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>can be formed beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b>. The pad <b>10</b> and the wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>can be formed in the same layer just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b>, so that the space left just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b> can be effectively used and the semiconductor chip size can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the first is the same as conventional semiconductor device manufacturing methods except that patterning is done in a way to form, just beneath the bump electrode <b>8</b>, the pad <b>10</b> and the wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>which should lie in the same layer as the pad <b>10</b>. Therefore, a semiconductor device according to the first is manufactured without complicating the manufacturing process. This means that an advantageous effect is achieved without any drastic change in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, a semiconductor chip produced as mentioned above is bonded to a packaging substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a case that the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> is mounted over a glass substrate <b>17</b><i>a </i>(COG: Chip On Glass).

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The second embodiment concerns a semiconductor device with wide layout latitude which optimizes pad positions regardless of bump electrode positions.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a fragmentary plan view of a semiconductor chip according to the second embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a pad <b>10</b> is connected with a pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>as a part of a bump electrode <b>8</b> through an opening <b>13</b> made in a surface protective film <b>12</b>. The bump electrode <b>8</b> consists of: a pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>to be connected with the pad <b>10</b>; a terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>to be connected with a terminal of a packaging substrate; and a wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>which connects the pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c</i>. A conventional bump electrode consists of only a terminal connection portion which is connected with a pad. In other words, in a conventional bump electrode, the terminal connection portion also functions as a pad connection portion, which means that the pad connection portion and the terminal connection portion overlap each other as seen in a plan view. On the other hand, in the bump electrode <b>8</b> according to the second embodiment, the pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>are formed in different places as seen in a plan view and the pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>in different places as seen in a plan view are connected by the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>are larger than the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>in terms of wire width, as seen in a plan view. This is because the pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>have to be connected with the pad <b>10</b> and the lead wire on the glass substrate (or film substrate) respectively and therefore their flat surfaces must be large enough to secure the connections. Since the wire width of the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>is relatively small, contact with other wiring portions <b>8</b><i>b </i>is less likely, permitting greater latitude in interconnection wiring arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Since each bump electrode <b>8</b> is thus structured, pads <b>10</b> can be arranged not in a zigzag pattern but in one row in the X direction while terminal connection portions <b>8</b><i>c </i>of bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern. This means that the positions of pads can be determined regardless of the positions of bump electrodes. Conventionally, bump electrodes and pads overlap as seen in a plan view; and when bump electrodes are arranged in a zigzag pattern in the y direction, pads should also be arranged in a zigzag pattern in the y direction. In this case, pads are arranged in two rows and wires different from the pads cannot be laid in areas where the pads lie. Consequently, in this case, even when a pad is made smaller than a bump electrode in order to form wires different from a pad as mentioned above according to the first, it would be impossible to increase space for formation of wires different from pads because pads are formed in two rows in the y direction. On the other hand, according to the second, even when bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern, pads <b>10</b> need not be arranged in a zigzag pattern and can be arranged in one row in the x direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Therefore, space occupied by pads <b>10</b> is smaller than when pads <b>10</b> are arranged in two rows. Since the space occupied by pads <b>10</b> is smaller, it is possible to leave enough space to form wires different from pads <b>10</b>, <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>k</i>, under bump electrodes <b>8</b> in the same layer in which the pads <b>10</b> lie. Therefore, the semiconductor chip size can be further reduced. The wires <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>k </i>which are formed just beneath bump electrodes <b>8</b> need not be linear; they may be folded or curved.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As mentioned above, one characteristic point of the present invention is that a bump electrode <b>8</b> consists of a pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a</i>, a wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and a terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c</i>, and the pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>do not overlap as seen in a plan view. The pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a</i>, wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>and terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>are in the same layer. This make it possible that bump electrodes <b>8</b>, extending in the y direction, are arranged in a zigzag pattern while pads <b>10</b> are arranged in one row in the x direction. Since the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>as a part of the bump electrode <b>8</b> is bonded to a packaging substrate such as a glass substrate, its width is made larger than the width of the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>and that of the pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>in order to ensure the required adhesive force. The characteristic point of this that a bump electrode <b>8</b> consists of a pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a</i>, a wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and a terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>may be interpreted as follows: a bump electrode <b>8</b> includes a narrower wiring portion (first portion) <b>8</b><i>b </i>and a terminal connection portion (second portion) <b>8</b> which is wider than the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>. This makes it possible that the area of contact with the packaging substrate is sufficient and bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern at small intervals. Stated another way, the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>of a bump electrode <b>8</b> is relatively wide because the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>is to be bonded to a packaging substrate while the width of the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>is relatively small because the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>is only intended to connect the pad connection portion and the terminal connection portion, so that bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern at small intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to the second embodiment, the positions of pads can be determined so as to reduce the semiconductor chip size efficiently regardless of bump electrode positions. In other words, since greater latitude in pad arrangement is permitted, the semiconductor chip size can be reduced efficiently. In addition, since the area of the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>of a bump electrode <b>8</b> may be increased regardless of the pad <b>10</b>, the area of contact with the packaging substrate can be changed flexibly.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the second is almost the same as in the first embodiment. The difference is that a bump electrode <b>8</b> consists of a pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a</i>, a wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and a terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c</i>, and the pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>do not overlap as seen in a plan view. Furthermore, the width of the terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c </i>should be larger than that of the wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>. A semiconductor device according to the second is manufactured with these points into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, a variation of the second will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a plan view of a variation of the second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a case that pads <b>10</b> are arranged in one row in the x direction and the terminal connection portions <b>8</b><i>c </i>of bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in one row in the y direction. Even this variation can be realized by the use of a bump electrode <b>8</b> which consists of a pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a</i>, a wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and a terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c</i>. For example, even when the terminal connection portions <b>8</b><i>c </i>of bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in one row in the y direction in order to meet the customer's request, pads <b>10</b> can be arranged in one row in the x direction. The positions of pads <b>10</b> can be determined irrespective of where the terminal connection portions <b>8</b><i>c </i>are formed. Again, though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, wires different from pads <b>10</b> are formed just beneath the bump electrodes <b>8</b> in the same layer in which the pads <b>10</b> lie. Therefore, space just beneath the bump electrodes <b>8</b> can be used effectively so that the semiconductor chip size is reduced. Furthermore, since this permits greater latitude in the layout arrangement of pads <b>10</b>, the semiconductor chip size can be further reduced by optimizing the positions of pads <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> indicates that the wiring portions <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the bump electrodes <b>8</b> are bent at right angles; however, instead it is also possible that they are curved.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a plan view showing another variation of the second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a case that pads <b>10</b> are arranged in one row in the x direction and the terminal connection portions <b>8</b><i>c </i>of bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern in the y direction. Even this variation can be realized by the use of a bump electrode <b>8</b> which consists of a pad connection portion <b>8</b><i>a</i>, a wiring portion <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and a terminal connection portion <b>8</b><i>c</i>. For example, even when the terminal connection portions <b>8</b><i>c </i>of bump electrodes <b>8</b> are arranged in a zigzag pattern in the y direction in order to meet the customer's request, pads <b>10</b> can be arranged in one row in the x direction. The positions of pads <b>10</b> can be determined irrespective of where the terminal connection portions <b>8</b><i>c </i>are formed. Again, though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, wires different from pads <b>10</b> are formed just beneath the bump electrodes <b>8</b> in the same layer in which the pads <b>10</b> lie. Therefore, space just beneath the bump electrodes <b>8</b> can be used effectively so that the semiconductor chip size is reduced. Furthermore, since this permits greater latitude in the layout arrangement of pads <b>10</b>, the semiconductor chip size can be further reduced by optimizing the positions of pads <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The invention made by the present inventors has been so far explained in detail in reference to preferred embodiments thereof. However, the invention is not limited thereto and it is obvious that these details may be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Although bump electrodes <b>8</b> and pads <b>10</b> are located along the four edges of a semiconductor chip in the abovementioned embodiments, obviously the invention is not limited thereto. For example, it is also possible that pads <b>10</b> are located in the vicinities of the four edges of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and bump electrodes <b>8</b> extend to the center of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>. Alternatively it is also possible that pads <b>10</b> are located in the center of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and bump electrodes <b>8</b> extend to the four edges of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the description of the above embodiments, it is assumed that a semiconductor device is used as an LCD driver but the invention is not limited thereto and may be applied to a wide range of semiconductor devices which have bump electrodes.</p>
