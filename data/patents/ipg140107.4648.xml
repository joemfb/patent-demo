<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an X-ray computed tomography (CT) technique for generating an image of an object by performing image reconstruction by detecting an X-ray transmitted through the object, and particularly, to an X-ray CT apparatus having a data acquisition system (DAS) and acquires information on an X-ray transmitted through the object required for image reconstruction as digital data.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recent X-ray CT apparatuses have an X-ray detector which is configured using an X-ray detection element array which is configured such that X-ray detection elements are two-dimensionally arranged. The X-ray detection element array has a tendency that the number of X-ray detection elements is increasing not only in a channel direction which is a rotational direction of the X-ray detector but also in a slice direction (line direction) which is crossed with the channel direction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The X-ray CT apparatus is configured such that each X-ray detection element generates an X-ray detection signal (electrical signal), on which a DAS (see Japanese Patent Application Publication (Laid-open: KOKAI) No. 2006-15065 A) performs various kinds of signal processing such as a QV (Quantum of electric charge) conversion, an amplification, and an AD (Analog to Digital) conversion to generate projection data, which undergoes image reconstruction processing to produce a medical X-ray image, which appears on a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of a conventional X-ray CT apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an X-ray detection element (PD) <b>9</b>X and a DAS <b>6</b>X of the conventional X-ray CT apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a configuration example in which 24 X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X on the X-ray detection element array share one QV chip (heavy lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>); and four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X share one QV amplifier and one AD converter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The DAS <b>6</b>X has a QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>X, an AD converter unit <b>13</b>X, a first signal path <b>14</b>X, and a second signal path <b>15</b>X.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>X has QV chips as a plurality of IC chips and each QV chip has a plurality of QV amplifiers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates only a first QV chip having six QV amplifiers (QV <b>1</b> to QV <b>6</b>) and a second QV chip having six QV amplifiers (QV <b>7</b> to QV <b>12</b>). The X-ray detection element <b>9</b>X detects a transmitted X-ray transmitted through the object and outputs an electrical signal reflecting an intensity of the transmitted X-ray. Each QV amplifier converts the electrical signal to a voltage signal and amplifies the voltage signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The AD converter unit <b>13</b>X has a plurality of AD converters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates only twelve AD converters (ADC <b>1</b> to ADC <b>12</b>). Each AD converter converts the voltage signal generated by a corresponding QV amplifier, to a digital signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first signal path <b>14</b>X forms a signal path starting at each X-ray detection element <b>9</b>X and reaching the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>. The second signal path <b>15</b>X forms a signal path connecting the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>X to the AD converter unit <b>13</b>X. That is, the DAS <b>6</b>X forms a signal path (starting at the first signal path <b>14</b>X, passing through the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>X and the second signal path <b>15</b>X, and reaching the AD converter unit <b>13</b>X) for each X-ray detection element <b>9</b>X, and acquires information on the transmitted X-ray as digital data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, for the purpose of simplified structure, the DAS <b>6</b>X is configured such that 24 (M=24) X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X continuing in a channel direction in the same line share one QV chip of the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>X. An X-ray detection element <b>9</b>X in the m-th (m=1, 2, . . . , M) channel and the n-th (n=1, 2, . . . , N) line is expressed as an element [m, n]. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>24</b>, <b>1</b>] share one QV chip.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, for the purpose of simplified structure, the DAS <b>6</b>X is configured such that four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X continuing in the channel direction and in the same line share one QV amplifier of the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>X. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>4</b>, <b>1</b>] share a QV <b>1</b> of the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>X.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, for the purpose of simplified structure, the DAS <b>6</b>X is configured such that four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X continuing in the channel direction and in the same line share one AD converter of the AD converter unit <b>13</b>X. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>4</b>, <b>1</b>] share one ADC <b>1</b> of the AD converter unit <b>13</b>X.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, the DAS <b>6</b>X is configured such that signal processing characteristics differ for each circuit of the QV amplifier and the AD converter. Therefore, if a shared structure is used in which a QV amplifier is shared by the four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X continuing in the channel direction and in the same line, the same QV amplifier has the same signal processing characteristics. Note that the DAS <b>6</b>X is configured such that signal processing characteristics differ widely for each IC chip of a QV chip and the like. Therefore, if a shared structure is used in which a QV chip is shared by the 24 channels of X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X in the same line, signal processing characteristics differ widely between the two QV amplifiers (e.g., QV <b>1</b> and QV <b>7</b>) each belonging to a different QV chip; while signal processing characteristics differ slightly (are similar) between the two QV amplifiers (e.g., QV <b>1</b> and QV <b>2</b>) both belonging to the same QV chip.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are diagrams each illustrating a configuration example of a conventional X-ray CT apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> each illustrate an X-ray detection element <b>9</b>Y and a DAS <b>6</b>Y of the conventional X-ray CT apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> each illustrate a structure example in which 16 X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>Y on an X-ray detection element array share one QV chip (heavy lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>); four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>Y share one AD chip (heavy lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>); and one X-ray detection element <b>9</b>Y corresponds to one QV amplifier and one AD converter.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The DAS <b>6</b>Y has a QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>Y, an AD converter unit <b>13</b>Y, a first signal path <b>14</b>Y, and a second signal path <b>15</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Here, the DAS <b>6</b>Y is configured such that 16 (N=16) X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>Y continuing in a line direction in the same channel share one QV chip of the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>Y. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>1</b>, <b>16</b>] share one QV chip.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the DAS <b>6</b>Y is configured such that four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>Y continuing in the line direction in the same channel share one AD chip of the AD converter unit <b>13</b>Y. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>1</b>, <b>4</b>] share one AD chip.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, the DAS <b>6</b>Y is configured such that one X-ray detection element <b>9</b>Y corresponds to only one QV amplifier. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, only element [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] shares a QV <b>1</b> of the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, the DAS <b>6</b>Y is configured such that one X-ray detection element <b>9</b>X corresponds to only one AD converter. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, only element [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] corresponds to ADC <b>1</b> of the AD converter unit <b>13</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In general, the DAS <b>6</b>X and <b>6</b>Y illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref> is configured such that signal processing characteristics differ widely for each IC chip of a QV chip and the like. Therefore, if a shared structure is used in which a QV chip is shared by the plurality of X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X, signal processing characteristics differ widely between the two QV amplifiers (e.g., QV <b>1</b> and QV <b>7</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) each belonging to a different QV chip; while signal processing characteristics are similar between the two QV amplifiers (e.g., QV <b>1</b> and QV <b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) both belonging to the same QV chip.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">More specifically, the DAS <b>6</b>X illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is configured such that processing is performed on a group of four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X continuing in the channel direction and in the same line on the X-ray detection element array under the same signal processing characteristics. In addition, the DAS <b>6</b>X is configured such that a group adjacent to the above-mentioned group is signal-processed by the same QV chip, and thus processing is performed under similar signal processing characteristics. Moreover, the DAS <b>6</b>X illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is configured such that a group of four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b>X continuing in the channel direction and in the same line on the X-ray detection element array is signal-processed by the same QV chip and the same AD chip, and thus processing is performed under similar signal processing characteristics. Therefore, the DAS <b>6</b>X and <b>6</b>Y illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref> cause an uneven distribution of signal processing characteristics on the X-ray detection element array, and thus artifacts are likely to appear noticeably.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Third-generation X-ray CT apparatuses are configured such that a channel of an X-ray detection element array is used in a fold back manner by sandwiching a channel at a center of field of view (FOV). At this time, in a channel region (particularly, 10-channel to 20-channel) near the center, the channel used in a fold back manner is restricted, and thus, artifacts due to an uneven distribution of signal processing characteristics of the DAS are likely to appear noticeably.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In recent years, image reconstruction performed by one scan using a widely used multi-line X-ray detection element array tends to produce such noticeable artifacts, and thus anti-artifact measures are required. As a method of removing such artifacts, a method can be considered of equalizing all signal processing characteristics of the QV chips, AD chips, QV amplifiers, AD converters, and the like constituting the DAS. However, the method is very difficult under the present technology and inevitably increases the cost of the X-ray CT apparatus and thus is unrealistic.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments of an X-ray CT apparatus according to the present invention will be described by referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a configuration of an X-ray CT apparatus of a first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partially detailed diagram illustrating the X-ray CT apparatus of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An X-ray CT apparatus U of the present embodiment includes a gantry (rotary frame) <b>1</b> and a console <b>2</b>. The gantry <b>1</b> has an X-ray tube <b>3</b>, a high voltage generating unit <b>4</b>, an X-ray detector <b>5</b>, and a data acquisition system (DAS) <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The X-ray tube <b>3</b> and the X-ray detector <b>5</b> are arranged facing each other and sandwiching an object P placed on a bed device (not illustrated) therebetween. Further, the X-ray tube <b>3</b> and the X-ray detector <b>5</b> are rotatably arranged in a channel direction D<b>2</b> substantially orthogonal to a body axial direction (slice direction D<b>1</b>: see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the object P.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The X-ray tube <b>3</b> receives a required tube voltage from the remote-controlled high voltage generating unit <b>4</b> and emits an X-ray having energy according to the received tube voltage from an arbitrary rotational position in a 360&#xb0; rotational direction toward the object P.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The X-ray detector <b>5</b> is configured such that a plurality of X-ray detection element arrays <b>7</b> is tightly arranged in an arc shape and in a channel direction. Each X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> is configured such that a plurality of X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> is two-dimensionally arranged on a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate <b>8</b>. Note that each X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> includes X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> having M (M=1, 2, . . . ) channels in the channel direction D<b>2</b> and N (N=1, 2, . . . ) lines in the slice direction D<b>1</b>. Hereinafter, an X-ray detection element <b>9</b> included in one X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> in the m-th (m=1, 2, . . . , M) channel and the n-th (n=1, 2, . . . , N) lines is expressed as an element [m, n]. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the description focuses on one X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> in which X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> are arranged for 24 (M=24) channels in the channel direction D<b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref>, the description focuses on one X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> in which X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> are arranged for 24 (M=24) channels in the channel direction D<b>2</b>, and for 16 (N=16) lines in the slice direction D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each X-ray detection element <b>9</b> of the X-ray detector <b>5</b> is made of a pair of a scintillator <b>10</b> and a photodiode <b>11</b>. Each X-ray detection element <b>9</b> detects an X-ray emitted from the X-ray tube <b>3</b> and transmitted through the object P, and generates an electrical signal reflecting an intensity of the transmitted X-ray. Each X-ray detection element <b>9</b> is independently connected to the DAS <b>6</b>. Note that the scintillator <b>10</b> has a function to convert an X-ray incident on the X-ray detection element <b>9</b> to light and supply the light to the photodiode <b>11</b>. The photodiode <b>11</b> has a function to convert the light received from the scintillator <b>10</b> to an X-ray detection signal (electrical signal).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of the DAS <b>6</b> according to the X-ray CT apparatus U of the first embodiment. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a part of the DAS <b>6</b>, namely, a part connected to one X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> (a total of 24 channels) if the number of channels is 24.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the X-ray detection element (PD) <b>9</b> and the DAS <b>6</b> of the X-ray CT apparatus U. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a configuration example in which 24 X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> on the X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> share one QV chip (heavy lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>); and four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> share one QV amplifier and one AD converter. The DAS <b>6</b> has a QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>, an AD converter unit <b>13</b>, a first signal path <b>14</b>, and a second signal path <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The DAS <b>6</b> allocates 24 X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> in the same line to one QV chip. In addition, the DAS <b>6</b> allocates four unadjacent X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> to one QV amplifier. In addition, the DAS <b>6</b> allocates four unadjacent X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> to one AD converter. Consequently, the DAS <b>6</b> allocates QV chips for each line in the same manner as the conventional DAS <b>6</b>X (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), but adjacent X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> are processed by a different circuit in the same QV chip. As a result, the DAS <b>6</b> can distribute signal processing characteristics on the X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> in such a manner that adjacent X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> have non-identical signal processing characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The QV amplifier unit <b>12</b> has QV chips as a plurality of IC chips and each QV chip has a plurality of QV amplifiers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates only a first QV chip having six QV amplifiers (QV <b>1</b> to QV <b>6</b>) and a second QV chip having six QV amplifiers (QV <b>7</b> to QV <b>12</b>). Each photodiode <b>11</b> of the X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> outputs an X-ray detection signal as an electrical signal. Each QV amplifier converts the electrical signal to a voltage signal and amplifies the voltage signal.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The AD converter unit <b>13</b> has a plurality of AD converters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates only twelve AD converters (ADC <b>1</b> to ADC <b>12</b>). Each AD converter converts the voltage signal generated by a corresponding QV amplifier, to a digital signal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first signal path <b>14</b> forms a signal path starting at each X-ray detection element <b>9</b> and reaching the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b>. The second signal path <b>15</b> forms a signal path connecting the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b> to the AD converter unit <b>13</b>. The signal paths (not illustrated) following the AD converter unit <b>13</b> reach console <b>2</b>. That is, the DAS <b>6</b> forms a signal path reaching the console <b>2</b> for each X-ray detection element <b>9</b>, and acquires projection information of the X-ray detection signal generated by the transmitted X-ray as digital data (projection data).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the DAS <b>6</b> allocates four X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> in the same line and not continuing in the channel direction, to one QV amplifier as well as to one AD converter. Therefore, if 10 lines of X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> are arranged in the X-ray detection element array <b>7</b>, the X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> has 60 QV amplifiers and 60 AD converters.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the DAS <b>6</b> is configured such that the elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>24</b>, <b>1</b>] in the first line share one QV chip. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the DAS <b>6</b> is configured such that the elements [<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>] to [<b>24</b>, <b>2</b>] in the second line share one QV chip.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the DAS <b>6</b> is configured such that elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>7</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>13</b>, <b>1</b>], and [<b>19</b>, <b>1</b>] share QV <b>1</b> and ADC <b>1</b>. The DAS <b>6</b> is configured such that elements [<b>2</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>8</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>14</b>, <b>1</b>], and [<b>20</b>, <b>1</b>] share QV <b>2</b> and ADC <b>2</b>. The DAS <b>6</b> is configured such that elements [<b>3</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>9</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>15</b>, <b>1</b>], and [<b>21</b>, <b>1</b>] share QV <b>3</b> and ADC <b>3</b>.

The DAS <b>6</b> is configured such that elements [<b>6</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>12</b>, <b>1</b>], [<b>18</b>, <b>1</b>], and [<b>24</b>, <b>1</b>] share QV <b>6</b> and ADC <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Note that the number of X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> sharing each QV amplifier and each AD converter is not limited to 4.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The console <b>2</b> includes an image processing unit <b>16</b>, a storage device <b>17</b>, a display device <b>18</b>, and an input device <b>19</b>. Based on various programs stored in the storage device <b>17</b>, the image processing unit <b>16</b> executes image processing for generating a desired slice thickness of image data from the projection data received from the DAS <b>6</b> and displays an X-ray image on the display device <b>18</b>. An operator can supply a necessary instruction to a system control unit (not illustrated) for performing various controls required for scanning via the input device <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Hereinafter, an operation of the X-ray CT apparatus U will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the conventional DAS <b>6</b>X (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), each X-ray detection signal generated by the 24 channels of elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>24</b>, <b>1</b>] in the same line is signal-processed by the same QV chip. In other words, each X-ray detection signal generated by the elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>24</b>, <b>1</b>] is signal-processed under similar signal processing characteristics. In addition, according to the DAS <b>6</b>X, each X-ray detection signal generated by the four elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>4</b>, <b>1</b>] continuing in the channel direction and in the same line is signal-processed by the same QV <b>1</b> and the same ADC <b>1</b>. In other words, each X-ray detection signal generated by the four elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>4</b>, <b>1</b>] is signal-processed under the same signal processing characteristics. Consequently, the DAS <b>6</b>X causes an uneven distribution of signal processing characteristics, and thus artifacts are likely to appear noticeably.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In contrast to this, according to the DAS <b>6</b> of the X-ray CT apparatus U, of the four elements [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] to [<b>4</b>, <b>1</b>] continuing in the channel direction and in the same line, the X-ray detection signal generated by the element [<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>] is signal-processed by the QV <b>1</b> and the ADC <b>1</b>; the X-ray detection signal generated by the element [<b>2</b>, <b>1</b>] is signal-processed by the QV <b>2</b> and the ADC <b>2</b>; the X-ray detection signal generated by the element [<b>3</b>, <b>1</b>] is signal-processed by the QV <b>3</b> and the ADC <b>3</b>; and the X-ray detection signal generated by the element [<b>4</b>, <b>1</b>] is signal-processed by the QV <b>4</b> and the ADC <b>4</b>. That is, according to the DAS <b>6</b>, each X-ray detection signal generated by adjacent X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> is signal-processed by a different QV amplifier in the same QV chip and a different AD converter. Therefore, the signal processing characteristics of the X-ray detection signals generated by the adjacent X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> may be similar, but is not the same.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Hereinafter, advantages of the X-ray CT apparatus U will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The DAS <b>6</b> of the X-ray CT apparatus U has a characteristic distribution connection structure in which adjacent X-ray detection elements <b>9</b> have non-identical signal processing characteristics.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Hereinbefore, the X-ray CT apparatuses U to UF of the present embodiments have been described based on the nine DASs <b>6</b> to <b>6</b>F, but a specific configuration of the X-ray CT apparatus of the present invention is not limited to the embodiments. Design modifications and additions are allowed to be made to the X-ray CT apparatus of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention claimed within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">For example, the DASs <b>6</b> to <b>6</b>F may be configured such that a combination of channels undergoing an AD conversion by each AD converter may be made different for each line or the DASs <b>6</b> to <b>6</b>F may be configured such that a combination of the first signal path <b>14</b> shared by the second signal path <b>15</b> may be made different for each line.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Moreover, the characteristic distribution connection structure of the DASs <b>6</b> to <b>6</b>F may be provided at an appropriate position such as the first signal path <b>14</b> starting at the X-ray detection element <b>9</b> and reaching the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b> and the second signal path <b>15</b> starting at the QV amplifier unit <b>12</b> and reaching the AD converter unit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, the DASs <b>6</b> to <b>6</b>F and X-ray CT apparatuses U to UF may be manufactured by recombining the connection between a signal path and an X-ray detection element <b>9</b> so that the signal path having the same or similar signal processing characteristics on the X-ray detection element array <b>7</b> has a higher dispersion than the signal path at or after completion of the DASs <b>6</b> to <b>6</b>F.</p>
