<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0008">The present invention relates to mobile digital camera devices and online photograph collection systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0009">Certain locations exist that are popular amongst travelers and amateur photographers for taking photographs. Such locations are known as &#x201c;Picture Hotspots&#x201d;. Typical picture hotspots include scenic views along nature trails or key spots in amusement parks. However, travelers may not always be aware when they are near such a hotspot. Often these hotspots may be marked with a physical sign to notify travelers of their location. Alternately, some picture hotspots are identified on maps or in travel guides. However, such information is not always readily available to all travelers or may become outdated. Furthermore, such signs and notifications do not typically provide information about how to best capture a photograph at the hotspot, such as a best angle, best position, or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0010">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide notification to a user when they approach a picture hotspot. It is a further object of the present invention to provide proximity and directional information to users for describing nearby picture hotspots. It is a further object of the present invention to provide the user with exemplary photographs previously captured at the hotspot in order to assist the user deciding how to position their camera to capture their own picture. It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a system that supplies hotspot information to a user that is dynamically updated over time so as to be of increased relevance to the user. It is a further objective of the present invention to supply hotspot information to a user that is specifically customized to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0011">This object is achieved by a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprising a computer, such as a network server, performing the steps of connecting to the internet and receiving data sent over the network by a wireless communication device. The data, such as GPS data as used in a lot of popular GPS devices, identifies a location of the wireless communication device and a user of the wireless communication device. The computer is programmed to determine if the wireless communication device is in a vicinity of a preselected location, stored on the computer, based on the data for identifying the location of the wireless communication device. The computer transmits data to the communication device for notifying the user of the communication device that the user is in the vicinity of the preselected location. Directional information can then be sent to the communication device for the user to access in order to assist the user in finding the preselected location. The directional information can include audio for playback on a speaker of the communication device, descriptive text, numerical coordinates, or a map. A database associated with the user in the computer is accessed based on the data for identifying the user and an image database is accessed based on the data for identifying the location of the wireless communication device. Digital images of the preselected location are identified in the image database and can be transmitted over the communication network to the communication device. Directional data can also be sent that includes geographic compass directions to the preselected location and a distance to the preselected location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0012">Another preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a wireless hand held device performing the steps of transmitting data over a communication network for identifying a location of the hand held device and for identifying a user of the device. In return, the device receives data over the network for notifying the user that the device is in a vicinity of a preselected location. Directional information received at the device is accessed by the user for enabling the user to find the preselected location. This can include data as described above and at least one digital image of the preselected location. The device can generate a visual notification on a display of the device or an audible notification through a speaker of the device in response to being transported to within a preselected distance from the preselected location. The hand held device can receive and store a plurality of preselected locations and then later determine by internal programming that the user has carried the communication device to a vicinity of another one of the stored preselected locations. It can also generate a notification to the user when this occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0013">Another preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a computer implemented method of selecting a picture taking hotspot. The computer, such as a server, is coupled to a communication network and begins receiving and storing a plurality of digital images from a plurality of users, who might be permitted to use the computer based on membership or otherwise, wherein the images have associated descriptive metadata including location data and user identification data corresponding to each of the digital images. This information is stored on the computer. Under program control the computer can determine that a preprogrammed threshold number of the digital images were captured within a preprogrammed threshold distance from a geographic location, which geographic location is stored on the computer. The users, whether they are admitted as members or otherwise, can access and store on the computer, over the network, designation information identifying any other users as an associated user. The designation information is accessible by the computer for identifying which other users are selected by another user as being associated with him or her. The designation information is tracked in a database coupled to the computer. The computer then receives data over the communication network sent by a wireless hand held device, the received data including GPS data for identifying a location of the wireless device and also data identifying a user of the wireless device. If the wireless device is in a vicinity of the geographic location, based on the received GPS data, and the user of the wireless device has provided designation information identifying an associated user, then the computer will transmit data over the communication network to the device for notifying the user that he or she is in the vicinity of the preselected location. This transmission will occur if one of said preprogrammed threshold number of the digital images was captured by a user designated in the device user's designation information as an associated user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">These, and other, aspects and objects of the present invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

As such, the computer access devices are a type of communication device which can be remotely located from the digital camera <b>100</b> as well as the online photo-management service <b>300</b>, but in communication by way of the network <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">Database <b>310</b> preferably includes a plurality of tables for managing users and digital images files. Tables of Database <b>310</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. These tables are each populated with several records of exemplary data for purpose of illustration of the present invention, however, it will be understood that example includes additional data not shown and that actual data can differ from the data show here. The names of the fields of each table are marked with an underline and primary key field(s) are marked with an asterisk &#x201c;*&#x201d; symbol. Table <b>311</b>, titled &#x201c;Users&#x201d; is used for recording user information including a &#x201c;user ID&#x201d; for uniquely identify a user. User ID may optionally be a screen name for the user accord. User ID may alternately be a purely numerical auto-incremented counter. Additional information such as a user name is included, such as the &#x201c;Name&#x201d; field shown. Additional fields (not shown) such as first name, last name, password, and the like can alternately be included as desired. Additional data about user configuration preferences can be stored included as additional fields (not shown) of Table <b>311</b> or in another related tabled. Table <b>312</b> titled &#x201c;Connections&#x201d; is used for recording connections between users. Such connections can be used to identify friends, family, associates, and the like. Table <b>313</b> titled &#x201c;ImageFiles&#x201d; is used for identify digital image files which have been associated with a user. Each file is assigned a &#x201c;FileID&#x201d; for tracking. The &#x201c;FileName&#x201d; may be used for tracking the storage of the file on the storage memory <b>330</b>. The &#x201c;UserID&#x201d; field identifies the associated user. For example, &#x201c;DSC000123.jpg&#x201d; may have been uploaded to the online photo-management service by &#x201c;User<b>01</b>&#x201d;. The associated user is considered the &#x201c;owner user&#x201d; of the associated file. While still image files of the JPEG (&#x201c;.JPG&#x201d;) type are shown, other types of image files, including video image files, such as &#x201c;.AVI&#x201d;, &#x201c;.MOV&#x201d;, and the like, can also be applied to the present invention. Table <b>314</b> titled &#x201c;Groups&#x201d; is used for recording groups to which users may elect to associate. The groups are provided with an assigned &#x201c;GroupID&#x201d; or a &#x201c;GroupName&#x201d; or both to identify the groups. Additional fields such as a description may optionally be included here. Table <b>315</b> entitled &#x201c;GroupMembers&#x201d; defines the association of users to each group.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">Table <b>316</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> tiled ImageMetadata stores metadata associated with the digital image files. The image FileID, as used in Table <b>313</b>, is used to associate the image file. A field titled &#x201c;MetaDataName&#x201d; identifies the type of metadata. Many types of metadata can be stored in the table, including geographic location metadata representative of a capture location such as &#x201c;GPS Latitude&#x201d; and &#x201c;GPS Longitude&#x201d; data. A field titled &#x201c;Value&#x201d; stores the data value for each metadata item. Other types of location metadata can also be employed and stored in the database table. For example, street address data can also be used. Nearby street addresses can be obtained by converting the GPS location data using a database of locations of street addresses. According to the present invention, picture hotspots are determined using the data stored in database <b>310</b>. A process for determining picture hotspots will now be described with reference to process <b>1000</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and with continued reference to the parts and figures previously described. Process <b>1000</b> can be executed by processor <b>320</b> of the photo-management service <b>300</b> and can be constructed using an object oriented programming language by one skilled in the art. Picture hotspots are determined by analyzing image clusters using the stored geographic location metadata. Process <b>1000</b> can be executed periodically, for example once per day, once per hour, once per week, or at another desired frequency. Alternately, process <b>1000</b> can be performed whenever a new image is uploaded to the online photo-management service. Alternately, process <b>1000</b> can be performed upon request by a requesting user over network <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">Process <b>1000</b> begins with step <b>1010</b> where a collection of image files is defined by querying the database and the resulting collection of references to image file are stored temporarily in memory. In one embodiment of the present invention, global picture hotspots are determined by defining the collection as all image files stored in table <b>313</b>. The resulting image files are further refined by selecting only image files having geographic metadata as stored in table <b>316</b>. The resulting records are used as the collection in step <b>1010</b>. In an alternate embodiment, older pictures can be disregarded by establishing a prior date range and filtering on either capture date metadata or upload date metadata (not shown) greater than a certain date when defining the collection of image files in step <b>1010</b>. This provides an advantage in avoiding generating hotspot locations which were temporary or no longer present.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">In yet another, more preferred, alternate embodiment of the present invention, the user specific customized picture hotspots are generated by querying table <b>313</b> during step <b>1010</b> for all users connected to specific user as defined by table <b>312</b> and returning image files associated with that user. For example, if user specific picture hotspots are to be determined for &#x201c;user<b>01</b>&#x201d;, it is first determined that &#x201c;user<b>02</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;user<b>03</b>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;user<b>04</b>&#x201d; are connected to &#x201c;user<b>01</b>&#x201d; by querying table <b>312</b>. Then table <b>313</b> is queried for all image files associated with &#x201c;user<b>02</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;user<b>03</b>&#x201d;, or &#x201c;user<b>04</b>&#x201d; in the field &#x201c;UserID&#x201d;. The resulting image files are further refined by selecting only image files having geographic metadata as stored in table <b>316</b>. The resulting records are used as the collection in step <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">In yet another alternate embodiment, user interest group specific picture hotspots are determined by querying table <b>313</b> for all users associated with the same groups as a specific user as defined in table <b>315</b>. For example, if a user interest group specific picture hotspot is to be determined for &#x201c;user<b>01</b>&#x201d;, it is first determined that &#x201c;user<b>01</b>&#x201d; is associated with groups &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; and that &#x201c;user<b>03</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;user<b>02</b>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;user<b>05</b>&#x201d; also belong to these groups by querying table <b>315</b>. Then table <b>313</b> is queried for all image files associated with &#x201c;user<b>03</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;user<b>02</b>&#x201d;, or &#x201c;user<b>05</b>&#x201d; in the field &#x201c;UserID&#x201d;. The resulting image files are further refined by selecting only image files having geographic metadata as stored in table <b>316</b>. The resulting records are used as the collection in step <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">Combinations of these alternate embodiments can also be obtained by combing these queries of dates and associates into a further refined collection. For example, querying both table <b>312</b> and <b>315</b> for all users either connected to a specific user or in a common group with the specific user and then querying table <b>313</b> for of the resulting users. For example to determine a picture hotspot for &#x201c;user<b>01</b>&#x201d;, table <b>313</b> would be queried for all image files associated with &#x201c;user<b>02</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;user<b>03</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;user<b>04</b>&#x201d;, or &#x201c;user<b>05</b>&#x201d; in the field &#x201c;UserID&#x201d;. This will yield a broader range of hotspots of potential interest to the user. Which of these alternate embodiments, or combinations thereof, is used can be fixed by the system, or selected as a preference for each user. Alternately, each user may specifically select by preference which user connections in table <b>312</b> and/or which groups in table <b>315</b> the user wishes to use for the purpose of defining hotspots. Such user preferences can further be stored in the tables of database <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">With a collection of image files defined in step <b>1010</b>, process <b>1000</b> then proceeds to step <b>1020</b> where the first of the image files is selected. Step <b>1020</b> begins a process loop by which each image file will be examined in turn to determine if the image file is part of a picture hotspot.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">Next, step <b>1030</b> is executed where a count (P<b>1</b>) of image files is calculated within a &#x201c;hotspot radius&#x201d; (H) distance centered on the selected image file. Hotspot radius defines a relatively small region locally around the selected image file. Count P<b>1</b> is calculated by executing another process loop (not shown) where the distance of each image file in the collection to the selected image file calculated, adding to P<b>2</b> if within distance H. Hotspot radius H can be preset by the system of the photo-management service <b>300</b> or be set by preference of a specific user. For example, H can be set to a distance of 20 m, 40 m, or to another desired distance.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">For purposes of determining distance between two geographical locations, the Haversine formula (see Equation 1 below) for calculating a great circle distance can be used. This simplified formula ignores altitude or depth, which are also not recorded as metadata in preferred embodiments thereby reducing the amount of data which needs to be stored. Therefore, a constant altitude, such as an approximate sea level is assumed. In this case the average radius of the Earth of approximately 6367.5 km can be used. This can result in small inaccuracies when calculating distance, however, such inaccuracies are small enough to be neglected by the users for purposes of the present invention. The simplified equation also assumes that the Earth is perfectly spherical, ignoring the fact that the Earth's radius is slightly larger at the equator than at the poles. This assumption simplifies the processing thereby improving speed of the processing and reduced storage space for the processing instructions. Other known formulas for calculating distance can be employed by one skilled in the art, including the spherical law of cosines. Alternately, more complex embodiments of the present invention can be implemented by one skilled in the art by recording altitude and accounting for altitude in the distance equation and/or by using non-spherical Earth models.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0042">In equation 2, if local count P<b>1</b> is greater than a percentage of regional count P<b>2</b> defined as 10&#xd7; the ratio of the square of hotspot radius H to regional radius R and also greater than or equal to a minimum count of 3, then the image file as being part of a picture hotspot. Effectively, a hotspot is identified here if density of image files in the local area is 10 times greater than the density of image files in the larger regional area and also at least a minimum of 3 image files. Optionally, the values of 10 and 3 can be chosen to be different values if so desired. Image files which are found to be part of a picture hotspot are recorded in step <b>1055</b> in a temporary memory as being associating with a second collection of hotspot image files which is a subset of the first collection established in step <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">The next image file is incremented in step <b>1060</b> and the process loops back to step <b>1030</b> until last image file has been examined per decision block <b>1070</b>. Process <b>1000</b> then proceeds with process <b>1100</b> where the images previously identified as belonging to a hotspot are merged into clusters. The steps of process <b>1100</b> are described in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">Process <b>1100</b> begins with step <b>1105</b> by incrementing through the image files in the second collection of hotspot image files beginning with the first image file in order of the FileID. In step <b>1110</b>, a ClusterID for the hotspot cluster is established and set equal to the image file's FileID and thereby the hotspot is associated with that image file. The image files are incremented to the next image file at step <b>1115</b> in order of FileID and the process loops to step <b>1110</b> until the last image file has been processed at decision block <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">Process <b>1100</b> then executes another series of process loops by selecting the image file with the highest fileID in the hotspot image file collection in step <b>1125</b>. The selected image file in this loop is referenced as the &#x201c;Current file&#x201d;. In step <b>1130</b> a further embedded process loop is executed by again selecting the image file with the highest fileID in the hotspot image file collection which becomes referenced as the &#x201c;compare file&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">The distance between the current file and the compare file is checked in decision block <b>1135</b>. If this distance is with the hotspot radius (H), then decision block <b>1140</b> is executed. In decision block <b>1140</b> the clusterID associated with the compare file is compared to the clusterID associated with the current file. If the clusterID of the compare file is found to be lower than the clusterID of the current file, process <b>1100</b> proceeds to step <b>1145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">In process <b>1145</b>, the clusterID associated with the currentfile is then set to the lower clusterID of the comparefile, overwriting the previous association. In this way, image files associated with a hotspot are clustered into groups having the same clusterID. By incrementing the image files of the process from highest to lowest and by associating each image file with the lowest clusterID, a reduced set of clusters are formed at the lowest clusterID values for each hotspot. Having adjusted a clusterID of one of the image files in the hotspot image file collection, the process then iterates by looping back to step <b>1125</b>, thereby restarting the comparison with the image file at the highest fileID.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">If, on the other hand, either decision block <b>1135</b> or decision block <b>1140</b> return a false result, process <b>1100</b> proceeds to step <b>1150</b> where the compare file is incremented to the next compare file having the next lower fileID. Decision block <b>1155</b> causes the process to loop back to decision block <b>1135</b> until the last compare file is compared. The current file is then incremented at step <b>1160</b> to the next image file in the hotspot image file collection having the next lowest fileID value. Decision block <b>1165</b> loops back to step <b>1130</b> until all current files have been compared.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">Process <b>1100</b> completes having established and stored in memory a set of one or more clustersIDs for clusters of image files belonging to picture hotspots. Each clusterID is hereafter considered as representing a unique picture hotspot with digital image files associated with each picture hotspot by the clusterID value. Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, process <b>1000</b> then proceeds to step <b>1200</b>. In step <b>1200</b>, a center point is calculated for each hotspot cluster previously established. Giving the relatively small area of a hotspot cluster, this calculation can be done by a simple averaging of the geographic coordinates of all image files in the hotspot cluster. However adjustments to the coordinates must be made in the rare instance when the hotspot cluster lies over the <b>180</b> degree meridian or a pole by temporarily adjusting the coordinates to a shifted <b>360</b> degree reference system. During step <b>1200</b>, the defined center point is stored either a temporary volatile memory or alternately in nonvolatile memory as part of the database for later use. The center point location data is preferably in the form of a longitude and latitude coordinate, but can also take the form of a street address or other type of location data. The image files associated with each cluster are thereby located proximate to the center point of the cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">Process <b>1000</b> continues with step <b>1210</b>, where the number of different or unique owner users associated with the digital image files making up each hotspot cluster are counted. This counting can be achieved using a SELECT type query with a GROUP BY &#x201c;UserID&#x201d; function. This count for each hotspot cluster is stored in memory. This count data is useful when a user requests picture hotspot locations, as the hotspot clusters can then be filtered for clusters having images from two or more users, three or more users, or another number of users as defined by either a user or system preference. Alternately, all clusters may be returned which would include clusters which have images only from a single user, for example three images taken nearby from the same user. In a preferred configuration, hotspot clusters are limited to clusters consisting of three or more digital image files associated with three or more different users. Hotspot clusters having fewer associated different owner users than then the specified criteria are discarded at step <b>1220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">Hotspots which have been determined by process <b>1000</b> are then available upon request from a user with a mobile digital camera as will be described in further detail below. By executing process <b>1000</b>, hot spot information is dynamically updated over time by using the location metadata of image files continually received by the online photo-management service and stored the database. As more pictures are received, new hot spot locations will be determined. This is done without the need for a manual operator inputting the hotspot locations. Additionally, the hotspot locations can be made particularly relevant (or customized) to the user by filtering on the users associations as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">Process <b>1000</b> has been described as executing a particular clustering technique, however, variations and alternate clustering techniques may also be applied by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with continued reference to the previously described figures, process <b>500</b> for notifying users of a digital camera device of picture hotspot locations according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described. Process <b>500</b> with step <b>510</b> where the location of the camera is retrieved by the digital camera device <b>100</b>. The location is preferably received from the GPS receiver module <b>170</b>. Alternate types of signals other than GPS can also be employed to retrieve the camera location. In step <b>520</b>, a network connection to network <b>200</b> is established using network communication module <b>180</b>. The connection can be through, for example, a wireless LAN or WAN or a cellular communications network. The network connection provides a communication route between the camera <b>100</b> and the online photo-management service <b>300</b>. Login information designating the user (also referred to as designation information) to online photo-management service <b>300</b>, such as a user name and a password identifying the user, can either be requested during step <b>520</b> or be previously stored in the digital camera <b>100</b> internal storage memory <b>125</b> to facilitate access. The login information is transmitted over the network to the online photo-management service for authentication. Step <b>520</b> can alternately be performed prior to step <b>510</b>. In step <b>530</b>, location data corresponding the location received from the GPS receiver module in step <b>510</b> is transmitted over the network <b>200</b> to on-line photo-management service <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">Next decision block <b>540</b> is performed. In decision block <b>540</b>, the received location data is compared to the location, or centers) of known picture hotspots, which are determined as previously described above. The comparison is executed at on-line photo management service <b>300</b> using processor <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">Comparison of the received camera location to the hotspot location is performed with respect to a distance limit (L). The distance limit may stored either in the online photo-management service <b>300</b> or the digital camera <b>100</b>. The distance limit can alternately be user-selectable so that the user can choose a preferred distance. Alternately, it can be varied based on location, for example where some regions such as known urban regions have a lower limit while other regions such as known wilderness regions have a higher limit. If the received camera location is not within the distance limit of any calculated picture hotspots, then process <b>500</b> ends. If, on the other hand, the received camera location is within the distance limit of at least one picture hotspot, process <b>500</b> proceeds to decision block <b>545</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">In decision block <b>545</b>, it is determined if the camera user already has digital image files associated with all of the nearby hotspot locations or if the user has previously elected to ignore the picture hotspots. Decision block <b>545</b> prevents alerting the user of picture hotspots of which the user is already familiar. Prior images associated the user and with the picture hotspot are determined by querying database <b>310</b> of the on-line photo management service <b>300</b>. Elections to ignore picture hotspots by the user, as will be described in further detail below, can be either stored at the on-line photo management service <b>300</b> or in the internal storage memory <b>125</b> of digital camera <b>100</b> for querying during decision block <b>545</b>. If at least one of the nearby hotspot locations does not have an image file associated with the camera user and has not been indicated as one which the user wishes to ignore, process <b>500</b> proceeds to step <b>550</b>. Otherwise, process <b>500</b> ends. In an alternate simplified embodiment of the present invention, decision block <b>545</b> can be omitted. In this alternate embodiment, the user will always be alerted of nearby hotspots. Alternately, on-line photo-management service <b>300</b> can provide a preference for each user, enabling the user to decide whether or not to be notified of previously acknowledged picture hotspots and whether or not to execute decision block <b>545</b>. In yet further alternate embodiments of the present invention, decision block <b>545</b> can be reduced to query for only one of either previously captured digital image files associated with the user and the picture hotspot or picture hotspots which the user has elected to ignore.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">In step <b>550</b>, the locations of nearby picture hotspots within distance limit L are transmitted over the network from the on-line photo management service <b>300</b> to the digital camera <b>100</b> and stored in internal memory <b>130</b>. The location is preferably transmitted as latitude and longitude coordinate data, however alternately, other types of location data such as a street address can be transmitted in addition to or instead of the coordinate data. Next, step <b>560</b> is executed where one or more of the prior digital image files associated with each of the nearby picture hotspots are also transmitted over the network from the on-line photo management service <b>300</b> to the digital camera <b>100</b> and stored in internal memory <b>130</b>. Lower resolution or thumbnail versions of the digital image files can be utilized in order to reduce required storage space and transmission time.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">Next, step <b>570</b> is executed whereby the user is alerted to presence of nearby picture hotspots. The alert can be a visual alert, for example a message or a map displayed on display <b>140</b>. The alert can also be an audio alert, such as a synthesized voice message, a series of beeps, or the like. The alert can be a combination of audio and visual responses. The alert preferably communicates the location, direction, or distance of the picture hotspots. For example, the alert can be a message such as &#x201c;A picture hotspot is located 20 meters to the northwest of your current location&#x201d;. Alternately, the alert can show a scaled map with icons indicating the current camera location and the hotspot location. The location of multiple nearby hotspots can be communicated with multiple simultaneous or sequential alerts.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">In step <b>580</b>, the transferred image files from step <b>560</b> are displayed on the display <b>140</b>. The displaying of step <b>580</b> can be executed automatically, following or concurrent to the alert of step <b>570</b>. Alternately, step <b>580</b> can be executed at the request of the user. For example, the user can be provided with an icon or button which when activated causes the display of the digital image files. The digital image files provide the benefit to the user of being able to see what types of images where previously captured at this location to assist the user in deciding how to capture his or her own digital image. For example, the user may determine which position or angle is best suited for capturing a digital image. Following step <b>580</b>, process <b>500</b> ends.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">During step <b>570</b> or <b>580</b>, the user can cancel the notification (step not shown), ending process <b>500</b>. Optionally, the user can be provided with the option (not shown) to &#x201c;ignore&#x201d; a picture hotspot, for example by providing an &#x201c;ignore&#x201d; button on the graphical user interface of display <b>140</b>. The location of ignored picture hotspots can stored locally in internal storage memory <b>125</b> of digital camera <b>100</b>. Alternately, ignored picture hotspot locations for each user can be transmitted via network <b>200</b> to online photo-management service <b>300</b> for storage in database <b>310</b> in an additional table (not shown) having fields for userID and location (longitude and latitude). Since, according to the present invention, picture location hotspots can change or move over time as more digital image files are uploaded to the online photo-management service by users, the identification, such as clusterID, of the ignored picture hotspot is not used. Instead, at the time process <b>500</b> is next executed, the ignored picture hotspot locations are considered to be the same as a found nearby picture hotspot in decision block <b>545</b> if it is within a radius, such as hotspot radius (H), of the picture hot.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">Process <b>500</b> can be repeated periodically, for example every 10 minutes, or at the manual request of the camera user or automatically when the digital camera is activated or powered on.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, process <b>600</b> according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention will now be described whereby the digital camera <b>100</b> checks for changes in its location while searching for picture hotspot locations. Process <b>600</b> begins with step <b>610</b> where the current location of the camera is retrieved by the digital camera device <b>100</b>. The location is preferably received from the GPS receiver module <b>170</b>. Alternate types of signals other GPS can also be employed to retrieve the camera location.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">Next, decision block <b>615</b> is executed. In decision block <b>615</b> the current camera location data is compared to a stored camera location from the last time the camera communicated with on-line photo-management service. More description about this stored location is provided below with respect to step <b>630</b>. If the difference in these two locations is less than distance limit (L), process <b>600</b> end. As previously described, the distance limit (L) is preferably pre-set to a fixed distance and can be pre-stored, user selectable or varied by location. Useful values for a distance limit could include, for example, 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 kin, or a similar distance. However, if the current location of the camera compared to the stored location has changed by more than L, the process continues to step <b>620</b>. Also, if no stored location is available, such as the first time process <b>600</b> executes, decision block <b>615</b> will also proceed to step <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">In step <b>620</b>, a network connection to network <b>200</b> is established using network communication module <b>180</b>. The connection can be through, for example, a wireless LAN or WAN or a cellular communications network. The network connection provides a communication route between the camera <b>100</b> and the online photo-management service <b>300</b>. Login information to online photo-management service <b>300</b>, such as a user name and password, can either be requested during step <b>620</b> or be previously stored in the digital camera <b>100</b> internal storage memory <b>125</b> to facilitate access. The login information is transmitted over the network to the online photo-management service for authentication. Next, in step <b>630</b>, location data corresponding to the current location received from the GPS receiver module in step <b>610</b> is transmitted over the network <b>200</b> to on-line photo-management service <b>300</b>. During step <b>630</b>, the transmitted current location is also stored in internal memory <b>130</b> for use in subsequent executions of process <b>600</b> at step <b>615</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">Next step <b>650</b> is executed where camera <b>100</b> requests the location information for all picture hotspots within a radius of two times the distance limit (or 2 L). The requested hotspot locations can be limited by certain user preferences as previously described. For example, the request can be for hotspots containing three or more digital image files from three or more different users. This location information is transmitted from the on-line photo-management service <b>300</b> across network <b>200</b> to camera <b>100</b> and stored in internal memory <b>130</b>. Alternate distances such as three or four times the distance limit can also be used if sufficient storage memory space exists in camera <b>100</b>. Next, in step <b>660</b> one or more of the prior digital image files associated with each of the transmitted picture hotspots are also transmitted over the network from the on-line photo management service <b>300</b> to the digital camera <b>100</b> and stored in internal memory <b>130</b>. Lower resolution or thumbnail versions of the digital image files can be utilized in order to reduce required storage space and transmission time. Furthermore, if any image files associated with these picture hotspot locations are already stored in memory, for example from a previous execution of process <b>600</b>, these image files do not need to be re-transmitted. Next step <b>665</b> is executed whereby any picture hotspots outside of the 2 L range and associated image files currently stored in internal memory <b>130</b> are deleted in order to free memory space for other uses.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">Next, decision block <b>670</b> is executed using processor <b>110</b> of digital camera <b>100</b> to compare the distance current location to the location of the received hotspots. If no hotspot is within the distance limit (L), process <b>600</b> ends. Otherwise process <b>600</b> proceeds to execute step <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">In step <b>680</b>, the user is alerted to the presence of any picture hotspot locations within the detection limit (L), including for example, location, direction, or distance. The alert can be visual, audio, or a combination thereof such as previously described above. In step <b>690</b>, the transferred image files are displayed on display <b>140</b> for reference by the user. Alternately, step <b>690</b> can be executed by request of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">Execution of process <b>600</b> can be repeated periodically, for example every 10 minutes, or at the manual request of the camera user. Process <b>600</b> can also be set to be executed when the digital camera <b>100</b> is first powered on or otherwise initially activated.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> a graphical user interface (GUI) for display on display <b>140</b> of camera <b>100</b> in conjunction with the present invention will be described. Starting with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, GUI screen <b>700</b> is shown. GUI screen <b>700</b> includes a map region <b>705</b> with scrolling navigation buttons <b>710</b><i>a</i>, <b>710</b><i>b</i>, <b>710</b><i>c, </i>and <b>710</b><i>d </i>and zoom navigation buttons <b>715</b>. The map region <b>705</b> can be used to display various types of maps such as satellite views, street maps, topographical maps, or combinations thereof. The navigation buttons allow the user to view difference portions and perspectives of the maps on the limited display area. Location icon <b>720</b> shows the current location of the user as received from GPS receiver module <b>170</b>. As previously described above, nearby hotspot locations have been determined and are presented here for the user. These hotspots are indicated as by hotspot icons <b>725</b><i>a</i>, <b>725</b><i>b </i>and <b>725</b><i>c </i>which are shown here, for example, as star shaped icons.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">In this embodiment, the size of the various hotspot icons are varied by an importance metric. For example, hotspot icon <b>725</b><i>a </i>is larger than hotspot icon <b>725</b><i>c </i>which is larger than hotspot icon <b>725</b><i>b</i>. Alternately, importance can be indicated by varying the shape, type, or color of the icons. Importance can be determined using a number of metrics. One exemplary method ranks importance by the number of digital images taken at the hotspot weighted by the number of these digital images which are associated with users directly connected to the user of the camera. For example, the importance rank score is calculated as the number of digital images at the hotspot plus 4 times the number of digital images associated with users connected to the user of the digital camera as defined in table <b>312</b> of database <b>310</b>. Counts of digital images at the hotspot and their associated users are received by submitting and SQL query to database <b>310</b> of the online photo-management service <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">The hotspot icons are user selectable, for example by touching a touch screen interface. Selecting one of the hotspot icons retrieves additional information about the hotspot as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, GUI screen <b>750</b> is displayed. GUI Screen <b>750</b> includes a digital image region <b>760</b> for displaying exemplary digital image files transmitted from online photo-management service <b>300</b>. Additional information is shown in information region <b>765</b> including the associated user and the date of capture of the digital image. Navigation buttons are provided to allow the user to scroll through a plurality of the exemplary digital images. Information region <b>770</b> displays information including location coordinates of the hotspot and distance and direction from the user's current location. Alternately, other types of location information can be displayed, such as street address which has been converted from the latitude and longitude coordinate data. Information region <b>775</b> displays information about the number of digital images captured at this hotspot as used in the importance ranking about the number of digital images taken at the hotspot location. Information Region <b>780</b> shows additional nearby hotspot locations where these users have also captured digital images. Information about other hotspots having digital images by these users is received by submitting an SQL query to database <b>310</b> of the online photo-management service <b>300</b>. Navigation buttons <b>785</b> labeled &#x201c;Go&#x201d; allow the user to display information about these nearby hotspots on the screen using GUI screen <b>750</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">Button <b>790</b> labeled &#x201c;Ignore this hotspot&#x201d; enables the user to mark this hotspot as &#x2018;to-be-ignored&#x2019; as previously described above. The user's preference to ignore this hotspot location is stored either in local storage memory on the camera or is transmitted to online photo-management service <b>300</b> for storage in database <b>310</b>. Ignored hotspot locations are not presented to the user on GUI screen <b>700</b> or in region <b>780</b> of GUI screen <b>750</b>. Button <b>795</b> labeled &#x201c;Exit&#x201d; navigates back to GUI screen <b>700</b>.</p>
