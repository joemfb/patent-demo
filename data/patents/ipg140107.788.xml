<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A reciprocating saw including a housing and a reciprocating shaft supported within the housing. The reciprocating shaft has a longitudinal axis and a first end and a second end opposite the first end. A cutting blade is provided at the first end of the reciprocating shaft. A drive mechanism provided at a second end of the reciprocating shaft is configured to drive the reciprocating shaft in a substantially reciprocating motion relative to the housing while at the same time allowing the reciprocating shaft to substantially rotate about the longitudinal axis of the reciprocating shaft independent of the housing.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/343,385, titled &#x201c;ROTATING SPINDLE FOR A RECIPROCATING SAW&#x201d;, filed on Dec. 23, 2008, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The application generally relates to a hand-held power tool and in particular to a reciprocating saw. More specifically, the application relates to a rotating spindle provided in a reciprocating saw.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A reciprocating saw is a power tool often used in the construction and home remodeling industries and may be used in a variety of cutting applications, including the cutting of wood, metal, plastics or any variety or combination of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical reciprocating saw has a fixed blade attached to a shaft, specifically a reciprocating shaft that provides the saw with a reciprocating cutting motion. In order for a user of the reciprocating saw to change the cutting angle, the entire saw position must be changed. A system and/or method that allows a user to maximize the cutting reach of the saw and to more easily access confined and tight spaces is needed. A lightweight and ergonomically friendly reciprocating saw that is easy to change the position of the blade and/or to find a comfortable cutting position using the reciprocating saw is also needed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Before turning to the figures which illustrate the exemplary embodiments in detail, it should be understood that the application is not limited to the details or methodology set forth in the following description or illustrated in the figures. It should also be understood that the terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description only and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, a reciprocating saw <b>10</b> is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The reciprocating saw <b>10</b> has a working end <b>12</b> and a non-working end <b>14</b> having a handle <b>16</b>. A front housing <b>18</b> is located adjacent the working end <b>12</b> in between the working end <b>12</b> and the handle <b>16</b>. A rear housing <b>20</b> is located adjacent the handle <b>16</b> in between the working end <b>12</b> and the handle <b>16</b>. A middle housing, or bearing plate <b>22</b>, is located in between the front housing <b>18</b> and the rear housing <b>20</b>. A guide member or foot (not shown) may be provided at the working end <b>12</b> of the saw <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the handle <b>16</b> may have a generally D-shaped configuration. According to other exemplary embodiments, the handle <b>16</b> may have different configurations. An on/off switch is preferably located on or near the handle <b>16</b> of the reciprocating saw <b>10</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, a trigger switch <b>24</b> may be located on an interior surface of the handle <b>16</b>. According to other exemplary embodiments, the on/off switch maybe located elsewhere on the handle <b>16</b> or elsewhere on the reciprocating saw <b>10</b>. The saw <b>10</b> may be powered by a battery (that, for example, attaches to the handle) or the saw <b>10</b> may be plugged into a standard wall outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and <b>4</b>, the reciprocating saw <b>10</b> is shown to include a drive assembly <b>30</b> and a spindle assembly <b>60</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown in the Figures, both the drive assembly <b>30</b> and the spindle assembly <b>60</b> are located in the front housing <b>18</b> between the working end <b>12</b> of the reciprocating saw <b>10</b> and the bearing plate <b>22</b> of the reciprocating saw <b>10</b>. The drive assembly <b>30</b> in cooperation with the spindle assembly <b>60</b> converts rotary motion from a motor (not shown) to reciprocating motion for a saw blade <b>26</b>. The spindle assembly <b>60</b> allows the blade <b>26</b> to rotate about the axis of the spindle independent of the front housing <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The drive assembly <b>30</b> includes a shaft shown as a drive shaft <b>32</b> having a first bearing <b>34</b> located at a first end of the drive shaft <b>32</b> and a second bearing (not shown) located at a second end of the drive shaft <b>32</b>. The drive shaft <b>32</b> further includes a drive gear <b>36</b> located adjacent the second end of the drive shaft <b>32</b> which is matingly engaged with a pinion gear (not shown) that is coupled to the motor (not shown). Rotary motion of the motor is transmitted via the pinion gear to the drive gear <b>36</b>, from the drive gear <b>36</b> to the drive shaft <b>32</b>, and from the drive shaft <b>32</b> to a motion conversion device shown as a wobble <b>38</b>. The rotary motion is converted to reciprocating motion via the internal configuration of the wobble <b>38</b> that is attached to an eccentric portion of the drive shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Attached to an upper portion of the wobble <b>38</b> is a drive means or mechanism <b>40</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The drive means or mechanism <b>40</b> is configured to transfer input reciprocating motion to a shaft in order to drive the shaft in a reciprocating motion. The drive means or mechanism <b>40</b> is also configured to allow the reciprocating shaft to rotate about the axis of the shaft while the shaft is reciprocating.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The drive means or mechanism <b>40</b> includes a drive fork <b>42</b> that is generally Y-shaped and includes a first end or portion <b>44</b> that is coupled to the upper portion of the wobble <b>38</b> and a first arm <b>46</b> extending from the first end <b>44</b> and a second arm <b>46</b> extending from the first end <b>44</b> spaced apart from the first arm <b>46</b>. Each arm <b>46</b> contains an aperture <b>48</b> configured to receive a pin <b>50</b>. Provided intermediate the two arms <b>46</b> is a drive bushing <b>52</b> which is generally a cylindrical shaped member having an internal diameter <b>54</b> configured to receive a shaft of the spindle assembly <b>60</b> and an external diameter <b>56</b> configured to be received in the arms <b>46</b> of the drive fork <b>42</b>. The drive bushing <b>52</b> has multiple apertures <b>58</b> in the sides of the bushing <b>52</b> that are in alignment with the apertures in the arms <b>46</b> of the drive fork <b>42</b>. The apertures <b>58</b> of the drive bushing <b>52</b> are configured to receive the pins <b>50</b> that are inserted through the apertures <b>58</b> of the drive fork <b>42</b>. The pins <b>50</b> extend no further than the internal diameter <b>54</b> of the drive bushing <b>52</b> and do not contact or lock the shaft <b>32</b> to the drive bushing <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the spindle assembly <b>60</b> is shown to include a spindle shaft <b>62</b> having a longitudinal axis <b>29</b> and also having a first end or working end <b>64</b> and a second end or driven end <b>66</b>. One end of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> is shown received inside the drive bushing <b>52</b>. A raised diameter portion <b>68</b> is provided at the second end <b>66</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. When the spindle shaft <b>62</b> is inserted in the drive bushing <b>52</b>, a shoulder or edge <b>70</b> of the raised diameter portion <b>68</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> contacts one side of the drive bushing <b>52</b> and couples lateral movement of the drive mechanism <b>40</b> to the spindle shaft <b>62</b> in a first direction or rearward direction. A member shown as a retaining clip <b>72</b> is provided (e.g., in a groove <b>74</b>) on the opposite side of the drive bushing <b>52</b> to couple lateral movement of the drive mechanism <b>40</b> to the spindle shaft <b>62</b> in a second direction or forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an alternative embodiment, the drive bushing <b>52</b> may be laterally coupled to the spindle shaft <b>62</b> by two members or retaining clips <b>72</b> (e.g., one retaining clip <b>72</b> on each side of the drive bushing <b>52</b>). In yet another alternative embodiment, the raised diameter portion <b>68</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> may be reversed with the member or retaining clip <b>72</b> (e.g., the raised portion <b>68</b> restrains the front side of the drive bushing <b>52</b> and the retaining clip <b>72</b> restrains the rear side of the drive bushing <b>52</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation, as the wobble <b>38</b> converts rotary motion of the drive shaft <b>32</b> to reciprocating motion, the drive fork <b>42</b> transmits the reciprocating motion to the drive bushing <b>52</b>. The drive bushing <b>52</b> cooperates with the spindle shaft <b>62</b> to reciprocate with respect to the front housing <b>18</b>. However, as mentioned above, the pins <b>50</b> that couple the drive bushing <b>52</b> to the drive fork <b>42</b> do not extend sufficiently beyond to the inside diameter <b>54</b> of the drive bushing <b>52</b> to make contact with the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. Therefore, the spindle shaft <b>62</b> is rotationally free within the drive bushing <b>52</b> and the spindle shaft <b>62</b> is able to rotate inside the drive bushing <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and <b>4</b>, the spindle assembly <b>60</b> is shown to include a locking means or assembly <b>80</b>. The locking assembly <b>80</b> is configured to selectively lock and unlock the spindle assembly <b>60</b> in a rotational manner, thereby allowing the spindle assembly <b>60</b> to rotate substantially about the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> independent of the front housing <b>18</b>. For example, when the locking assembly <b>80</b> is locked, the spindle assembly <b>60</b> is able to reciprocate substantially along the longitudinal axis <b>29</b>, but remains substantially fixed rotationally with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. When the locking assembly <b>80</b> is unlocked, the spindle assembly <b>60</b> is able to reciprocate substantially along and rotate substantially about the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The spindle assembly <b>60</b> also includes a dust retention device shown as a steel washer <b>90</b> and a felt washer <b>92</b> located on the spindle shaft <b>62</b> in between the working end <b>64</b> and the driven end <b>66</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. These washers aid in preventing dust and debris from entering the interior of the front housing <b>18</b>. In alternative embodiments, the dust retention device may be other suitable devices and/or may be located elsewhere on the reciprocating saw.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The spindle assembly <b>60</b> further includes a second bushing shown as a back spindle bushing <b>94</b> to aid in the support of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> during the substantially reciprocating motion and the substantially rotary motion of the shaft <b>62</b>. The back spindle bushing <b>94</b> is received by the front housing <b>18</b> (e.g., pressed into the front housing) and remains in a fixed position with respect to the spindle shaft <b>62</b> reciprocating back and forth through the interior diameter of the back spindle bushing <b>94</b>. The back spindle bushing <b>94</b> also remains in a fixed position with respect to the spindle shaft <b>62</b> rotating in the interior diameter of the back spindle bushing <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and <b>4</b>, the locking assembly <b>80</b> is shown to include a locking bushing <b>82</b> that is provided adjacent the first end <b>64</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. The locking bushing <b>82</b> has a first external diameter <b>84</b> configured to be received inside the front housing <b>18</b> and a second external diameter <b>86</b> configured to cooperate with a bearing <b>88</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the bearing <b>88</b> is a thin wall bearing. The bearing <b>88</b> is pressed onto the second external diameter <b>86</b> of the locking bushing <b>82</b>. The bearing <b>88</b> is then pressed into the front housing <b>18</b>. The first external diameter <b>84</b> of the locking bushing <b>82</b> is configured to be slightly smaller than the external diameter of the bearing <b>88</b> so that when the bearing <b>88</b> is pressed into the front housing <b>18</b>, there is a predetermined amount of clearance between the first external diameter <b>84</b> of the locking bushing <b>82</b> and the front housing <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the locking bushing <b>82</b> is shown to have an internal diameter <b>102</b> configured to be slidably coupled with the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. The internal diameter <b>102</b> is configured so that the spindle shaft <b>62</b> may reciprocate through the locking bushing <b>82</b> independent of the locking bushing <b>82</b>. In addition, the internal diameter <b>102</b> includes a flat portion that corresponds to a flat portion of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> so that the locking bushing <b>82</b> and the spindle shaft <b>62</b> are rotationally coupled to one another relative to the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. Thus, when the locking bushing <b>82</b> rotates, so does the spindle shaft <b>62</b> and vice versa. In an alternative embodiment, the locking bushing <b>82</b> and the spindle shaft <b>62</b> may be rotationally coupled by a keyway, a spline, a tongue and groove configuration, or other appropriate configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> and <b>6</b>-<b>7</b>, the locking assembly <b>80</b> also includes a locking mechanism (device, member, slider, switch, etc.) shown as a locking button <b>110</b>. The locking button <b>110</b> is received and retained by the front housing cover <b>96</b> but may be located elsewhere. The locking button <b>110</b> is selectively engaged with the locking bushing <b>82</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the locking button <b>110</b> is shown in a first position which substantially fixes the rotational position of the spindle assembly <b>60</b> with respect to the front housing <b>18</b> but still allows the spindle shaft <b>62</b> to reciprocate with respect to the front housing <b>18</b>. In the first position, the locking button <b>110</b> is engaged with the locking bushing <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, by depressing the locking button <b>110</b> (i.e., pressing the locking button radially inward relative to the spindle shaft <b>62</b>), the locking button <b>110</b> is moved to a second position and disengaged from the locking bushing <b>82</b>. Once the locking button <b>110</b> is disengaged from the locking bushing <b>82</b>, the spindle shaft <b>62</b> is free to rotate about the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> for a full 360&#xb0; independent of the front housing <b>18</b>. The locking button <b>110</b> may be disengaged or moved to the second position both while the reciprocating saw <b>10</b> is running (i.e., while the spindle shaft <b>62</b> is reciprocating) or when the reciprocating saw <b>10</b> is off.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The locking assembly <b>80</b> preferably includes a biasing device shown as a spring <b>98</b> to bias the locking button <b>110</b> in a locked or engaged position. In addition, the locking button <b>110</b> may be configured to be biased or retained in the second or unlocked position. Biasing or retaining the locking button <b>110</b> in an unlocked position allows for free rotation of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> of a full 360&#xb0;. The free rotation setting of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> allows for scroll cutting (scrolling) while using the reciprocating saw <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the cutting edge of the blade <b>26</b> is shown off center from the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the spindle shaft <b>62</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. The blade <b>26</b> is coupled to the spindle shaft <b>62</b> by a blade clamp or blade holder <b>28</b>. The blade holder <b>28</b> may be a manual blade holder or a keyless blade holder as is known in the art. Locating the cutting edge of the blade <b>26</b> off center from the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> creates a moment arm between the blade and the spindle shaft <b>62</b>. When the saw <b>10</b> is in the free rotation setting, the moment arm keeps the blade <b>26</b> going in the direction of a force applied by a user, allowing hands free scrolling.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the locking bushing <b>82</b> has multiple locking positions <b>100</b> (e.g., slots, detents, splines, etc.) formed therein in which the locking button <b>110</b> may engage. These locking positions <b>100</b> may be equally spaced about the radial axis of the locking bushing <b>82</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the depicted embodiment of the locking bushing <b>82</b> has eight (8) locking positions <b>100</b> that are located at every 45&#xb0; (e.g., 0&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 135&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, etc.) about the radial axis of the locking bushing <b>82</b>. In another exemplary embodiment, the locking bushing <b>82</b> may have four (4) locking positions <b>100</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>d</i>, where the reciprocating saw <b>10</b> is shown with the rotating spindle shown in various positions of rotation (e.g., 0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 270&#xb0;). In other exemplary embodiments, the locking bushing <b>82</b> may have more or less locking positions <b>100</b> that may or may not be equally spaced about the radial axis.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the locking button <b>110</b> includes a first projection <b>112</b> extending from a first end of the button <b>110</b> and a second projection <b>114</b> extending from a second end of the button <b>110</b>. The first projection <b>112</b> is configured to be received by the front housing cover <b>96</b> and the second projection <b>114</b> is configured to be selectively engaged with the various locking positions <b>100</b> of the locking bushing <b>82</b>. As shown in the Figures, the locking button <b>110</b> is pressed radially inward relative to the shaft <b>62</b> to disengage the locking button <b>110</b> from the locking bushing <b>82</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the locking button <b>110</b> may be configured to slide relative to the locking bushing <b>82</b> (and the front housing cover <b>96</b>) to engage/disengage with the locking bushing <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The advantages of the reciprocating saw <b>10</b> shown and described in the present application include allowing a user of the saw <b>10</b> to more easily access confined and tight spaces with the reciprocating saw <b>10</b>. The rotating spindle <b>60</b> of the reciprocating saw <b>10</b> allows a user to find the best rotational position for the blade <b>26</b> relative to the workpiece being cut without having to flip or turn the blade <b>26</b> over or make multiple cuts with the saw <b>10</b>. The rotating spindle <b>60</b> also allows the user to change hand positions in the middle of a cut and to maximize the cutting reach in tight areas. The design also allows for an ergonomically friendly design that is both low weight and has a low power/low torque requirement. The free scrolling cutting feature also allows hands free scrolling using the reciprocating saw <b>10</b>.</p>
