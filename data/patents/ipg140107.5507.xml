<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to searching media items based upon a number of beats per minute. In one embodiment, search results that are presented to a user include media items matching the search query along with one or more beats per minute taxonomy concepts, where each of the beats per minute taxonomy concepts comprise a number of beats per minute or a range of beats per minute. The user may then select one of the beats per minute taxonomy concepts in order to identify a portion of the media items associated with the selected beats per minute taxonomy concept. The embodiments disclosed herein also relate to generating recommendations for media items based upon a beats per minute value and information associated with a user account as described herein. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components are provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shown is a networked environment <b>100</b> according to various embodiments. The networked environment <b>100</b> includes a computing device <b>103</b>, clients <b>106</b>, and a network <b>109</b>. The network <b>109</b> includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The computing device <b>103</b> may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices <b>103</b> may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices <b>103</b> together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices <b>103</b> may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device <b>103</b> is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices <b>103</b> may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various applications and/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device <b>103</b> according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store <b>112</b> that is accessible to the computing device <b>103</b>. The data store <b>112</b> may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store <b>112</b>, for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and/or functional entities described below.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The components executed on the computing device <b>103</b>, for example, include an electronic commerce system <b>115</b>, a media consumption interface <b>129</b>, and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The electronic commerce system <b>115</b> may include various components, such as, a beats per minute application <b>118</b>, a media search application <b>121</b>, a media recommendation application <b>124</b>, a network page encoder <b>127</b>, and other applications and/or processes.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electronic commerce system <b>115</b> is executed in order to facilitate the online purchase of media items <b>136</b> over the network <b>109</b>. The electronic commerce system <b>115</b> also performs various back-end functions associated with the online presence of a merchant in order to facilitate the online purchase of media items <b>136</b>. For example, the electronic commerce system <b>115</b> may generate various network pages, using the network page encoder <b>127</b>, such as web pages, or other types of network content that are provided to clients <b>106</b> for the purposes of selecting media items <b>136</b> for purchase, rental, download, lease, or any other forms of consumption as can be appreciated. Alternatively, a mobile application may be executed in a client <b>106</b> to generate and render user interfaces using data served up by the computing device <b>103</b> and/or other servers. To this end, when rendered, network pages generate a user interface as can be appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The media consumption interface <b>129</b> is executed to serve up media items <b>136</b> stored in the data store <b>112</b> to clients <b>106</b>. The media consumption interface <b>129</b> may include a commercially available HTTP server such as, for example, Apache&#xae; HTTP Server, Apache&#xae; Tomcat&#xae;, Microsoft&#xae; Internet Information Services (IIS), etc. The media consumption interface <b>129</b> may generate one or more network pages, such as web pages, to facilitate selection and consumption of media items <b>136</b>. In various embodiments, the media consumption interface <b>129</b> may serve up code that functions as an embedded audio player, video player, image viewer, etc. in order for the user to consume the media items. Multiple media consumption interfaces <b>129</b> may be provided for different platforms of clients <b>106</b>. For example, one media consumption interface <b>129</b> may provide an interface for tablet computers, while another media consumption interface <b>129</b> may provide an interface for network-enabled televisions. In one embodiment, the media consumption interface <b>129</b> may facilitate consumption of media items <b>136</b> through various other media channels and/or subscriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The beats per minute application <b>118</b> is executed to identify media items <b>136</b> that do not have a beats per minute associated therewith. The beats per minute application <b>118</b> may then determine a beats per minute value corresponding to each of the identified media items <b>136</b>, where the beats per minute value is stored in association with each of the media items <b>136</b> as will be described. The media search application <b>121</b> may be executed to encode, for rendering by the client <b>106</b>, one or more search result network pages including a pool of media items <b>136</b> in response to a search query and one or more beats per minute taxonomy concepts associated with the pool of media items <b>136</b>. Lastly, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> is executed to generate one or more media recommendations to present to the user based at least upon a determined beats per minute value and information associated with a user account as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The data stored in the data store <b>112</b> includes, for example, a media library <b>130</b> of media items <b>136</b>, user accounts <b>150</b>, and potentially other data. Associated with each of the media items <b>136</b> is media content <b>139</b>, media data <b>141</b>, media metadata <b>143</b>, and potentially other data. The media content <b>139</b> comprises, for example, audio content, video content and/or audio/video content associated with each of the media items <b>136</b> in the media library <b>130</b>. The media data <b>141</b> comprises information about each of the media items <b>136</b>, such as, for example, customer reviews, customer ratings, statistics generated from server log data that indicate the number of downloads or previews (e.g., only the first minute of the media item was played out) associated with each of the media items <b>136</b>, and potentially other data. The media metadata <b>143</b> includes beats per minute data <b>147</b> comprising a number of beats per minute associated with each of the media items <b>136</b>, where one or more beats per minute may be associated with each of the media items <b>136</b> (e.g. corresponding to slow and fast sections of a song). The media metadata <b>143</b> may further comprise other data useful in searching media items <b>136</b>, such as, for example, media titles, artist titles, media images, genre titles, album titles, media descriptions, media prices, media categories, and potentially other data.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Associated with each user account <b>150</b> is, for example, user account data <b>153</b>, a purchase history <b>157</b>, a browse history <b>160</b>, a storage bucket <b>163</b>, and potentially other data. The user account data <b>153</b> may include information about the user and their user account <b>150</b>, such as, for example, name, address, payment instruments, billing information, account settings, passwords, security credentials, file management permissions, storage quotas and limitations, profile or demographic data associated with users, and/or other data. The purchase history <b>157</b> may include data related to a history of purchases of media items <b>136</b> through the electronic commerce system <b>115</b> by the user. The browse history <b>160</b> may comprise data that relates to a history of browsing for media items <b>136</b> by a user through the electronic commerce system <b>115</b>, such as, for example, data relating to the previewing of media items <b>136</b>. Each user account <b>150</b> also comprises a storage bucket <b>163</b> for the user to store one or more media items <b>136</b> either possessed by the user or purchased from the electronic commerce system <b>115</b> as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The client <b>106</b> is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network <b>109</b>. The client <b>106</b> may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, a smartphone, a set-top box, a music player, a web pad, a tablet computer system, a game console, an electronic book reader, or other devices with like capability.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The client <b>106</b> may be configured to execute various applications such as a browser <b>170</b>, a media player <b>173</b>, and/or other applications. The browser <b>170</b> may be executed in a client <b>106</b>, for example, to access and render network pages, such as web pages, or other network content served up by the computing device <b>103</b> and/or other servers. Alternatively, a mobile application may be executed in a client <b>106</b> to generate and render user interfaces <b>179</b> using data served up by the computing device <b>103</b> and/or other servers. To this end, when rendered, network pages generate a user interface <b>179</b> as can be appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The media player <b>173</b> is executed to play out media items <b>136</b> obtained through the media consumption interface <b>129</b> of the computing device <b>103</b>. The media player <b>173</b> may be a stand-alone application, a plug-in for the browser <b>170</b>, or other code included within a network page served up by the media consumption interface <b>129</b>. The client <b>106</b> may be configured to execute applications beyond the browser <b>170</b> and the media player <b>173</b>, such as, for example, email applications, instant message applications, and/or other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When executed in a client <b>106</b>, the browser <b>170</b> renders network pages on a respective display <b>176</b> and may perform other functions. The browser <b>170</b> accesses network pages, such as web pages or other types of content from the computing device <b>103</b> in order to access the functionality of the search application <b>121</b>, the recommendation application <b>124</b>, and other components implemented in the computing device <b>103</b> as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment <b>100</b> is provided. To begin, the beats per minute application <b>118</b> may be executed periodically, or in response to some other trigger, to identify one or more media items <b>136</b> in the media library <b>130</b> for which there are no beats per minute data <b>147</b>. Upon identifying a media item <b>136</b> with no beats per minute data <b>147</b>, the beats per minute application <b>118</b> may determine a beats per minute value for the media item <b>136</b>, where the beats per minute value is stored in the beats per minute data <b>147</b>. In one embodiment, the beats per minute data <b>147</b> may comprise multiple beats per minute values for the media item <b>136</b> (e.g. corresponding to a slow portion and a fast portion of the media item <b>136</b>). It is understood that the data generation and analysis functions of the beats per minute application <b>118</b> may be implemented within the media search application <b>121</b> or some other application.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">From time to time, a user possessing one or more media items <b>136</b> may wish to transfer such media items <b>136</b> into their storage bucket <b>163</b> in association with their user account <b>150</b>. Such a transfer may involve the user uploading the media items <b>136</b> to the storage bucket <b>163</b> by way of the browser <b>170</b>, the media player <b>173</b>, or other applications in the client <b>106</b>. In addition, the user may also purchase media items <b>136</b> through the electronic commerce system <b>115</b>, which may be automatically uploaded and included in the storage bucket <b>163</b> in association with their user account <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the beats per minute application <b>118</b> may be executed to identify one or more media items <b>136</b> in the storage bucket <b>163</b> of one or more user accounts <b>150</b> that are not associated with a number of beats per minute. The beats per minute application <b>118</b> may then analyze each of the media items <b>136</b> to determine a number of beats per minute. To this end, a user may purchase media items <b>136</b> or upload media items <b>136</b> and organize them based on the number of beats per minute.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, a user may wish to search for media items <b>136</b> to purchase based upon a number of beats per minute. To do so, the user may navigate to an appropriate search link in one or more search network pages to generate a search query. The search network pages may comprise a search field to facilitate the input of one or more search terms describing the media items <b>136</b>, such as, a field to enter a beats per minute value, an artist name, a genre name, an album name, and potentially other data.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As a non-limiting example, a user may input &#x201c;150&#x201d; into a beats per minute search field of a search network page. The user may send the search request to the computing device <b>103</b> through the network <b>109</b> by clicking on an appropriate button or link. Upon receiving the request, the media search application <b>121</b> may execute a search of the beats per minute data <b>147</b> associated with the media items <b>136</b> to identify a set of media items <b>136</b> having 150 beats per minute. Upon identifying the set of media items <b>136</b>, the media search application <b>121</b> generates one or more search result network pages that include the set of media items <b>136</b>. The media search application <b>121</b> then sends the search result network pages over the network <b>109</b> to the client <b>106</b>. A browser <b>170</b> or other application executing on the client <b>106</b> then renders the search result network pages for display to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other embodiment, a user may wish to search for media items <b>136</b> by entering one or more search terms describing the media items <b>136</b>. For example, if a user is interested in media items <b>136</b> recently released by Madonna, then the user may input the search term &#x201c;Madonna&#x201d; into a search field entitled &#x201c;Artist&#x201d; and the search term &#x201c;pop&#x201d; under the search field entitled &#x201c;Genre&#x201d;. The user may send the search request to the computing device <b>103</b> through the network <b>109</b> by clicking on an appropriate button or link.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Upon receiving the request, the media search application <b>121</b> may execute a search of the media items <b>136</b> to identify a pool of media items <b>136</b> based upon the search terms inputted by the user. To this end, the media search application <b>121</b> may use one or more approaches to identify the pool of media items <b>136</b> from the search terms in the search request. For instance, the media search application <b>121</b> may generate the pool of media items <b>136</b> by identifying associations between the search terms and the media metadata <b>143</b> associated with each of the media items <b>136</b>. To this end, in the example above, the media search application <b>121</b> would search media items <b>136</b> associated with the &#x201c;Pop&#x201d; genre and the artist entitled &#x201c;Madonna&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Having determined the pool of media items <b>136</b>, the media search application <b>121</b> may then use the beats per minute data <b>147</b> associated with the pool of media items <b>136</b> to identify one or more beats per minute taxonomy concepts, where each of the beats per minute taxonomy concepts correspond to a number of beats per minute described by a beats per minute designation. In one embodiment, the beats per minute designation may be a number of beats per minute, such as, for example, &#x201c;150&#x201d;. In another embodiment, the beats per minute designation may be a range of beats per minute, such as, for instance, &#x201c;140 to 160&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In yet another embodiment, the beats per minute designation may comprise one or more descriptive terms associated with a range of beats per minute, such as, for instance, &#x201c;Blues-Like BMP&#x201d;. In this example, a user may select the &#x201c;Blues-Like BMP&#x201d; in order to identify one or more media items <b>136</b> that have a range of beats per minute commonly associated with media items <b>136</b> within the Blues music genre.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Upon identifying the beats per minute taxonomy concepts associated with the pool of media items <b>136</b>, the media search application <b>121</b> generates one or more search result network pages that include the pool of media items <b>136</b> and the corresponding beats per minute taxonomy concepts associated with the pool of media items <b>136</b>. The media search application <b>121</b> then sends the search result network pages over the network <b>109</b> to the client <b>106</b>. A browser <b>170</b> or other application executing on the client <b>106</b> then renders the search result network pages for display to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the beats per minute taxonomy concepts displayed in the search result network pages may be rendered as a set of links to one or more network pages, where each of the linked network pages correspond to subsequent views of the search results comprising a portion of the media items from the pool of media items <b>136</b> that are associated with the respective beats per minute taxonomy concept.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a non-limiting example, assume that the beats per minute designations comprise of ranges of beats per minute, such as, &#x201c;100 to 120&#x201d;, &#x201c;120 to 140&#x201d;, &#x201c;140 to 160&#x201d;, &#x201c;160 to 180&#x201d;, and so forth. Further assume that the media search application <b>121</b> has identified one hundred media items <b>136</b> in response to a search request from a user, where twenty of the media items <b>136</b> have a number of beats per minute in the range of &#x201c;120 to 140&#x201d;, forty of the media items <b>136</b> have a number of beats per minute in the range of &#x201c;140 to 160&#x201d;, and forty of the media items <b>136</b> have a number of beats per minute of &#x201c;160 to 180&#x201d;. In this case, the search result network page would comprise a listing of the one hundred media items <b>136</b> and links for each of the beats per minute taxonomy concepts entitled &#x201c;100 to 140&#x201d;, &#x201c;140 to &#x201c;160&#x201d; and &#x201c;160 to 180&#x201d;. Thus, if the user selects the &#x201c;160 to 180&#x201d; beats per minute taxonomy concept, then the user would be directed to a network page comprising the forty media items <b>136</b> that are associated with the &#x201c;160 to 180&#x201d; beats per minute designation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the media search application <b>121</b> may use other data associated with the pool of media items <b>136</b> to identify one or more other taxonomy concepts. For example, the media search application <b>121</b> may generate one or more search result network pages comprising the pool of media items <b>136</b> and one or more genre taxonomy concepts associated a portion of the pool of media items <b>136</b>. In this example, the search result network page would comprise a listing of the pool of media items <b>136</b> and a list of genre taxonomy concepts, such as, for example, &#x201c;Jazz&#x201d;, &#x201c;Classic Rock&#x201d;, &#x201c;Country&#x201d;, and potentially other genres.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another embodiment, the media search application <b>121</b> may generate the search result network pages comprising the pool of media items <b>136</b> and one or more activity taxonomy concepts associated with the pool of media items <b>136</b>, where each of the activity taxonomy concepts comprises a description of an exercise and a suggested range of beats per minute. For example, suppose that the suggested beats per minute for a person walking are between 120 and 140, 150 and 170 for running, and 120 and 140 for cycling. To this end, the search result network page may comprise a listing of the pool of media items <b>136</b> and one or more activity taxonomy concepts, such as, for example, &#x201c;Walking&#x201d;, &#x201c;Running&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Cycling&#x201d;. In this example, if the user selects the activity concept entitled &#x201c;Running&#x201d;, then the user would be directed to a network page comprising a portion of the media items <b>136</b> that have a number of beats per minute that is between 150 to 170.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, in some cases a user may not wish to input one or search terms describing one or more media items <b>136</b>. As mentioned above, the search network page may comprise a taxonomy comprising one or more categories for the user to select in order to narrow a search of media items <b>136</b>. To do so, a user may select a category from the taxonomy. The user may send a search request to the computing device <b>103</b> through the network <b>109</b> by clicking on an appropriate button or link. Upon receiving the request, the media search application <b>121</b> may generate one or more category network pages listing the media items <b>136</b> associated with the category over the network <b>109</b> to the client <b>106</b>. The media search application <b>121</b> then sends the category network pages over the network <b>109</b> to the client <b>106</b>. A browser <b>170</b> or other application executing on the client <b>106</b> then renders the category network pages, or other user interface, for display to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the category network pages may comprise a group of the media items <b>136</b> associated with the selected category, as well as one or more beats per minute taxonomy concepts associated with the group of media items <b>136</b> of the respective category. As noted above, each of the beats per minute taxonomy concepts may be rendered as a set of links to one or more additional network pages showing at least a portion of the group of media items <b>136</b> associated with the beats per minute taxonomy concept.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition to searching media items <b>136</b>, in various embodiments, one or more media items <b>136</b> may be recommended by the media recommendation application <b>124</b> when the user is searching, playing or otherwise rendering media items <b>136</b> by the media recommendation application <b>124</b>. In one embodiment, the browser <b>170</b>, media player <b>173</b>, or other applications may be configured to send requests to the media recommendation application <b>124</b> to generate media items <b>136</b> to recommend to the user. Upon receiving the request, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> uses one or more approaches to determine a beats per minute value from which to generate one or more recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may determine a beats per minute value from the search terms inputted by the user. For instance, if a user has generated a search query by inputting the search term &#x201c;150&#x201d; in the search field entitled &#x201c;Beats Per Minute&#x201d;, then the media recommendation application <b>124</b> would determine that the beats per minute value is 150.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may determine the beats per minute value from a reading of an input device, such as, for example, a pedometer, a heart rate monitor, or other similar devices. To this end, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may use the biomechanics and pacing of the user to determine the beats per minute value closest to the pace of the user for purposes of exercise, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In yet another embodiment, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may determine the beats per minute value from a number of beats per minute of a media item the user is listening. For instance, if the user is listening to a media item with 120 beats per minute, then the media recommendation application <b>124</b> would determine that the beats per minute value is 120.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another embodiment, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may determine the beats per minute value by averaging the number of beats per minute of the media items <b>136</b> consumed by the user. For instance, suppose the media items <b>136</b> in the storage bucket <b>163</b> associated with a user account <b>150</b> comprises media items <b>136</b> with a range of beats per minute between 160 and 180. In this case, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> would determine that the beats per minute value as a range between 160 to 180.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In yet another embodiment, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may determine the beats per minute value from the number of beats per minute associated the media items <b>136</b> purchased or sampled by the user, or from the number of beats per minute associated with the media items <b>136</b> in one or more playlists generated by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Having determined the beats per minute value, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may execute a search of the media items <b>136</b> to identify one or more media candidates based upon the beats per minute value. In one embodiment, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may identify media candidates by searching media items <b>136</b> with the same beats per minute value. In other embodiments, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may identify media candidates by searching media items <b>136</b> with a number of beats per minute within a predefined delta of the beats per minute value. For instance, if the beats per minute value is &#x201c;120&#x201d; and the predefined delta is &#x201c;10&#x201d;, then the media recommendation application <b>124</b> would identify the one or more media candidates having a number of beats per minute between &#x201c;110&#x201d; and 130&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After identifying the media candidates, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> filters out the media items <b>136</b> already possessed by the user by, for example, identifying the media items <b>136</b> in the storage bucket <b>163</b> associated with the user account <b>150</b>, or examining the purchase history <b>157</b> of the user. Upon filtering out the media items <b>136</b> possessed by the user from the media candidates, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may then identify a subset of the media candidates that a user is more likely to purchase or consume based upon information associated with the user account, such as, for example, the user account data <b>153</b>, the purchase history <b>157</b>, the browse history <b>160</b>, playlists, and potentially other data. The media recommendation application <b>124</b> then sends the subset of the media item candidates to a requesting process, where the browser <b>170</b> or other application executing on the client <b>106</b> then renders the subset of media candidates as recommendations for display to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As a non-limiting example, suppose the purchase history <b>157</b> of the user indicates that the user has primarily purchased rap media items <b>136</b> with a range of beats per minute between 160 to 180. In this example, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may identify a subset of the media item <b>136</b> that are associated with a range of beats per minute between 160 and 180 and fall within the genre category of rap. To this end, the media recommendation application <b>124</b> may use information from the user account <b>150</b> to tailor the subset of media candidates to the likes of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the beats per minute application <b>118</b> in generating beats per minute data <b>147</b> for media items <b>136</b> according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the beats per minute application <b>118</b> as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device <b>103</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) according to one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Beginning with box <b>200</b>, the beats per minute application <b>118</b> may periodically, or upon a purchase or download, determine if a media item <b>136</b> has beats per minute data <b>147</b> associated therewith. If the media item <b>136</b> has beats per minute data <b>147</b> associated herewith, then the beats per minute application <b>118</b> ends as shown. If the media item <b>136</b> does not have beats per minute data <b>147</b>, then the beats per minute application <b>118</b> determines if the media item <b>136</b> has already been analyzed in box <b>203</b>. For example, such may be the case if an earlier instance of the media item <b>136</b> had been analyzed on a prior occasion. If the media item <b>136</b> has previously been analyzed, then in box <b>209</b>, the beats per minute application <b>118</b> associates the previously determined beats per minute data <b>147</b> to the media item <b>136</b>. If, however, the media item <b>136</b> has not been analyzed, then in box <b>206</b>, the beats per minute application <b>118</b> determines a number of beats per minute for the media items <b>136</b>. Subsequently, in box <b>209</b>, the beats per minute application <b>118</b> associates the number of beats per minute to the analyzed media item <b>136</b>. The beats per minute application <b>118</b> may periodically re-execute steps <b>200</b> through <b>209</b> as one or more media items <b>136</b> are added to the media library <b>130</b>, or media items <b>136</b> are presented in some other way.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, shown is a non-limiting example of a user interface <b>179</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), denoted herein as user interface <b>179</b><i>a </i>generated by a media search application <b>121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and rendered by a browser <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) executed on a client <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As a non-limiting example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a user has entered the search terms &#x201c;Classic Rock&#x201d; within a search query entry field <b>303</b> and has executed a search by clicking on a search button <b>306</b>. It is understood, however, that a search query may be entered in a variety of ways such as, for example, by clicking on a link, by depressing a key on a keyboard, and/or by other methods. As described above, the media search application <b>121</b> obtains a search query and generates a pool of media items <b>136</b> based at least in part on the search query.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, user interface <b>179</b><i>a </i>comprises the beats per minute taxonomy concepts <b>309</b> entitled, &#x201c;60 to 70&#x201d;, &#x201c;70 to 80&#x201d;, &#x201c;80 to 90&#x201d;, &#x201c;90 to 100&#x201d;, &#x201c;100 to 110&#x201d;, and so forth. To this end, a user may identify one or more media items <b>136</b> associated with a range of beats per minute value by selecting one of the beats per minute taxonomy concepts <b>309</b>. For instance, the user may select the beats per minute taxonomy concept <b>309</b> entitled &#x201c;100 to 110&#x201d; to search media items <b>136</b> having a range of beats per minute between 100 and 110.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, user interface <b>179</b><i>a </i>comprises additional beats per minute taxonomy concepts <b>312</b> entitled, &#x201c;Blues-Like BPM&#x201d;, &#x201c;Rock-Like BPM&#x201d;, &#x201c;Rap-Like BPM&#x201d;, and so forth, where each of the additional beats per minute taxonomy concepts <b>312</b> is associated with a range of beats per minute or other grouping of beats per minute.
