<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a Schottky barrier diode.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A Schottky barrier diode includes a semiconductor layer and a Schottky metal in contact with the semiconductor layer. A Schottky barrier is formed at an interface of the semiconductor layer and the Schottky metal. A plurality of structural examples of Schottky barrier diodes are disclosed a Japanese Patent No. 3691736. The structural examples to be compared with the invention of the present application are as follows. A first structural example (FIG. 11A of the Japanese Patent No. 3691736) is called a planar type and a Schottky metal is formed on a flat top surface of a semiconductor layer. A second structural example (FIG. 11C of the Japanese Patent No. 3691736) is called a trench diffusion type and columnar impurity diffusion layers are formed at intervals inside a semiconductor layer and a Schottky metal is formed on a top surface of the semiconductor layer. A Schottky junction is formed between the semiconductor layer top surface and the Schottky metal outside regions of the impurity diffusion layers (outside trenches). A third structural example (FIG. 2 of the Japanese Patent No. 3691736) is called a trench MOS type and an oxide film is formed on inner walls of trenches formed at intervals in a top layer portion of the semiconductor layer and polysilicon is embedded inside the trenches so as to contact the oxide film. A Schottky metal is formed to contact the polysilicon and the semiconductor layer outside the trenches. A Schottky junction is an interface of the semiconductor layer top surface and the Schottky metal outside the trenches.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With all of the arrangements disclosed in the Japanese Patent No. 3691736, the Schottky junction surface is small in area and it is thus difficult to increase a rated current or to decrease a forward voltage (VF).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">More specifically, with the planar type Schottky barrier diode, the area of the Schottky junction surface must be made large to make a large current flow. However, chip size must be enlarged for this purpose and thus a Schottky barrier diode that is compact and high in rated current cannot be realized. The same problem is faced when the forward voltage is to be decreased in the planar type Schottky barrier diode because the area of the Schottky junction surface must be increased in this case as well.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of the trench diffusion type and trench MOS type Schottky barrier diodes, the Schottky junction surface is formed on the semiconductor layer top surface outside the trenches. An even larger chip size than that required with the planar type Schottky barrier diode is thus required in order to increase the area of the Schottky junction surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention thus provides a Schottky barrier diode with which the area of the Schottky junction surface can be increased even with a small chip size.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above and yet other objects, features, and effects of the present invention shall be made clearer by the following description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A Schottky barrier diode according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a semiconductor layer having a plurality of trenches formed by digging in from a surface and having mesa portions formed between adjacent trenches, and a Schottky metal formed to contact the surface of the semiconductor layer including inner surfaces of the trenches.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With the present arrangement, the plurality of trenches are formed in a top layer portion of the semiconductor layer and the Schottky metal contacts the surface of the semiconductor layer including the inner surfaces of the trenches. An area of a Schottky junction surface can thereby be made greater than an apparent area of the top surface of the semiconductor layer in plan view as viewed downward along a direction of a normal to the top surface of the semiconductor layer. That is, the Schottky junction surface can be formed on the inner surfaces of the trenches and the top surface of the semiconductor layer outside the trenches (top surfaces of the mesa portions). A total of these areas is greater than the apparent area of the semiconductor layer in plan view. A Schottky barrier diode having a Schottky junction surface with a large area can thereby be realized even with a small chip size. Consequently, a Schottky barrier diode of high rated current or a Schottky barrier diode of low forward voltage can be realized with a small chip size.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Also, a depletion layer that spreads from the Schottky junction surface is thick at the mesa portions formed between adjacent trenches and is thin near bottom portions of the trenches. The thick depletion layer near the mesa portions contributes to reduction in leak current during reverse bias application.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the Schottky metal contacts the surface of the semiconductor layer at the inner surfaces of the trenches and outside the trenches. Also, preferably, the Schottky metal covers entireties of the inner surfaces of the trenches and extends continuously outside the trenches.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, each of the mesa portions has a width of 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m. The width of a mesa portion corresponds to an interval between trenches. When the interval between trenches is wide, the depletion layer at the mesa portion stays within a region inside the mesa portion. In this case, the depletion layer near the trench bottom portions is thin and the leak current during reverse biasing may be high near the trench bottom portions. Further, the increase in the area of the Schottky junction surface is low and the amount of reduction in the forward voltage is low. On the other hand, if the interval between trenches is narrow, the depletion layer at the mesa portion spreads to regions outside the mesa portion and the depletion layer near the trench bottom portions thickens. Although the leak current during reverse biasing can thereby be suppressed, effects of current increase and forward voltage reduction are decreased because a serial resistance of each trench bottom portion increases. Thus, by setting the width of each mesa portion (the interval between trenches) in a range of 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, the depletion layer can be made to have a thickness of appropriate value near the trench bottom portions. Specifically, in comparison to a planar type Schottky barrier diode of the same chip size, a larger current can be made to flow, the forward voltage can be decreased, and the reverse leak current can be suppressed to a similar level.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, each of the trenches has a depth of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m. If the trenches are deep, the depletion layer at the mesa portions does not readily fill the mesa portions and the depletion layer is thin at the trench bottom portions. If the trenches are shallow, the depletion layer of the mesa portions readily fills the mesa portions and spreads to regions outside the mesa portions and thus the depletion layer is thick at the trench bottom portions. Thus, by setting the trench depth in a range of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, the depletion layer can be made to have a thickness of appropriate value near the trench bottom portions. Specifically, in comparison to the planar type Schottky barrier diode of the same chip size, a larger current can be made to flow, the forward voltage can be decreased, and the reverse leak current can be suppressed to a similar level.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, a ratio of the mesa portion width with respect to the trench depth (mesa portion width/trench depth) is 0.2 to 10. The depletion layer can thereby be made to have a thickness of appropriate value near the trench bottom portions. Specifically, in comparison to the planar type Schottky barrier diode of the same chip size, a larger current can be made to flow, the forward voltage can be decreased, and the reverse leak current can be suppressed to a similar level.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the plurality of trenches are formed in a stripe form. Besides this, a lattice shape, hole shapes positioned discretely in two dimensions, etc., are examples of shapes of the trenches. By forming the trenches in stripe form, the trench interval and width can be controlled accurately in a manufacturing process. Device characteristics can thereby be obtained readily as designed.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> includes a silicon substrate <b>2</b> of an n<sup>+</sup> type (for example, with an n type impurity concentration of 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>21</sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) A cathode electrode <b>3</b> is formed on a rear surface of the silicon substrate <b>2</b> so as to cover the entire rear surface. The cathode electrode <b>3</b> is made of a metal (for example, Au, nickel (Ni) silicide, cobalt (Co) silicide, etc.) that can be in ohmic contact with the n type silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An epitaxial layer <b>4</b> (semiconductor layer) of an n<sup>&#x2212;</sup> type (for example, with an n type impurity concentration of 1&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) of lower concentration than the silicon substrate <b>2</b> is laminated on a top surface of the silicon substrate <b>2</b>. A thickness of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> is, for example, 2 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A field insulating film <b>5</b> made of silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is laminated on a surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>. A thickness of the field insulating film <b>5</b> is, for example, no less than 1000 &#x212b; and is preferably 7000 &#x212b; to 40000 &#x212b;. The field insulating film <b>5</b> may instead be made of another insulating substance, such as silicon nitride (SiN), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An opening <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that exposes a central portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> is formed in the field insulating film <b>5</b>. In a top layer portion of the central portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>, a plurality of trenches <b>7</b> are formed by digging in from the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>. Each trench <b>7</b> is a longitudinal groove that extends along a predetermined direction. A bottom surface of each trench <b>7</b> is a flat surface parallel to the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>. Each trench <b>7</b> thus has a cross section of substantially rectangular shape. In the present preferred embodiment, seven trenches <b>7</b> extend in parallel at predetermined intervals. The trenches <b>7</b> are thus formed to a stripe form in plan view (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, a pair of side wall surfaces of each trench <b>7</b> may be substantially parallel to a direction of a normal to the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> (thickness direction of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>). In this case, a surface area of the central portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> is increased by an amount corresponding to the side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b> in comparison to a case where the trenches <b>7</b> are not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At the top layer portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>, a mesa portion <b>8</b> is formed at each portion sandwiched by adjacent trenches <b>7</b>. In the case where each trench <b>7</b> has a substantially rectangular cross section, each mesa portion <b>8</b> has a substantially rectangular cross section accordingly. Each mesa portion <b>8</b> has a pair of side wall surfaces (side wall surfaces of the trench <b>7</b>), which, for example, rise substantially perpendicularly from respective edges at one side of the bottom surfaces of the pair of adjacent trenches <b>7</b> and an upper surface (top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>) joining together the pair of side wall surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An anode electrode <b>9</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>. The anode electrode <b>9</b> fills an interior of the opening <b>6</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b> and projects outside the opening <b>6</b> so as to cover a peripheral portion <b>10</b> of the opening <b>6</b> in the field insulating film <b>5</b>. That is, over its entire periphery, the peripheral portion <b>10</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b> is sandwiched from above and below by the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> and the anode electrode <b>9</b>. A projection amount X by which the anode electrode <b>9</b>, covering the peripheral portion <b>10</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b>, projects from an edge of the opening <b>6</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b> is, for example, no less than 10 &#x3bc;m and is preferably 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The anode electrode <b>9</b> has a multilayer structure (a two-layer structure in the present preferred embodiment) that includes a Schottky metal <b>11</b> joined to the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> inside the opening <b>6</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b> and a contact metal <b>12</b> laminated on the Schottky metal <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The Schottky metal <b>11</b> is made of a metal (for example, titanium (Ti) or molybdenum (Mo) or palladium (Pd), etc.) that forms a Schottky junction by junction with the n type silicon. In the present preferred embodiment, Ti is used. The Schottky metal <b>11</b> is formed so as to contact the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> including the inner surfaces (bottom surfaces and pairs of side wall surfaces) of the trenches <b>7</b>. The Schottky metal <b>11</b> thus contacts the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> at the inner surfaces of all of the trenches <b>7</b> and outside the trenches <b>7</b>. Also, the Schottky metal <b>11</b> covers the entireties of the inner surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b> and extends continuously outside the trenches <b>7</b>. The Schottky metal <b>11</b> is thus joined to the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> exposed from the opening <b>6</b> so as to cover the entirety of the surface. In the present preferred embodiment, the Schottky metal <b>11</b> includes bottom surface portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>in contact with the bottom surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b>, side surfaces portions <b>11</b><i>b </i>in contact with the side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b> (side wall surfaces of the mesa portions <b>8</b>), and upper surface portions <b>11</b><i>c </i>in contact with upper surfaces of the mesa portions <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, a junction surface (Schottky junction surface) S of the Schottky metal <b>11</b> and the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> is formed to have an uneven cross section in the region inside the opening <b>6</b> as indicated by thick lines as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An area of the Schottky junction surface S is thus greater than an apparent area of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> in plan view when the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> (portion extending in a horizontal direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is viewed downward along the direction of the normal thereto. More specifically, the Schottky junction surface S includes bottom surface portions S<b>1</b> in contact with the bottom surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b>, side surfaces portions S<b>2</b> in contact with the side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b> (side wall surfaces of the mesa portions <b>8</b>), and upper surface portions S<b>3</b> in contact with the upper surfaces of the mesa portions <b>8</b>. In the case where the trenches have substantially rectangular cross sections, the Schottky junction surface S can be made larger by an amount corresponding to the side surface portions S<b>2</b> in comparison to the case where the trenches <b>7</b> are not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The Schottky metal <b>11</b> joined to the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> forms a Schottky barrier (potential barrier) of, for example, 0.52 eV to 0.9 eV with respect to the silicon semiconductor making up the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>. Also, a thickness of the Schottky metal <b>11</b> in the present preferred embodiment is, for example, 0.02 &#x3bc;m to 0.2 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The contact metal <b>12</b> is a portion of the anode electrode <b>9</b> that is exposed at a topmost surface of the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> and is the portion to which bonding wires, etc., are joined. The contact metal <b>12</b> is made, for example, of aluminum (Al). In the present preferred embodiment, a thickness of the contact metal <b>12</b> is greater than that of the Schottky metal <b>11</b> and is, for example, 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 5 &#x3bc;m. The contact metal <b>12</b> is embedded in the respective trenches <b>7</b> so as to contact the Schottky metal <b>11</b> covering the inner surfaces of the respective trenches <b>7</b>. That is, the contact metal <b>12</b> contacts the respective bottom surface portions <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the pairs of side surface portions <b>11</b><i>b</i>, and the upper surface portions <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the Schottky metal <b>11</b>. The contact metal <b>12</b> is thus formed to have an uneven cross section at the side at which it contacts the Schottky metal <b>11</b> in the respective trenches <b>7</b>. Atop surface of the contact metal <b>12</b> at the opposite side of the side in contact with the Schottky metal <b>11</b> is flat and parallel to the top surface (excluding the inner surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b>) of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a case where the Schottky metal <b>11</b> is made of Ti, a titanium nitride (TiN) layer <b>30</b> may be interposed between the Schottky metal <b>11</b> and the contact metal <b>12</b> made of Al as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The TiN layer <b>30</b> adheres together the Ti of the Schottky metal <b>11</b> and the Al of the contact metal <b>12</b>, secures conductivity between Ti and Al, and further functions as a barrier layer that suppresses mutual diffusion of Ti and Al. Such a barrier layer protects the Schottky junction surface S by suppressing or preventing the diffusion of the material of the contact metal <b>12</b> to the Schottky metal <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A top surface protection film (not shown) may be formed on a topmost surface of the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b>. In this case, an opening that exposes the contact metal <b>12</b> is formed in a central portion of the top surface protection film. External connection members, such as bonding wires, are joined to the contact metal <b>12</b> through this opening.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A guard ring <b>13</b> made of a p type diffusion layer is formed in a top layer portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> so as to contact the Schottky metal <b>11</b>. The guard ring <b>13</b> is formed along an outline of the opening <b>6</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b> so as to span across the interior and the exterior of the opening <b>6</b> in plan view. The guard ring <b>13</b> thus includes an inner side portion <b>15</b> projecting to the inner side of the opening <b>6</b> and contacting an outer edge portion <b>14</b> that is a terminal portion of the Schottky metal <b>11</b> inside the opening <b>6</b>, and an outer side portion <b>16</b> projecting to the outer side of the opening <b>6</b> and opposing the anode electrode <b>9</b> (the Schottky metal <b>11</b> on the peripheral portion <b>10</b>) across the peripheral portion <b>10</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b>. The guard ring <b>13</b> has a depth from the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> of, for example, 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 8 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The guard ring <b>13</b> formed across the interior and the exterior of the opening <b>6</b> covers a boundary portion of the peripheral portion <b>10</b> of the field insulating film <b>5</b> and the Schottky metal <b>11</b> from the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> side. If the guard ring <b>13</b> is not present, an electric field may concentrate at the boundary portion when a reverse bias is applied to the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> and a leak may occur readily. With the structure of the present preferred embodiment, the guard ring <b>13</b> covers the boundary portion and thus the concentration of electric field can be alleviated by a depletion layer that spreads from the guard ring <b>13</b> when a reverse bias is applied and a leak can be suppressed accordingly. Breakdown voltage of the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> is thereby improved.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To manufacture the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b>, first the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> made of the n<sup>&#x2212;</sup> type silicon is grown on the n<sup>+</sup> type silicon substrate <b>2</b>. Here, for example, P or As may be used as the n type impurity.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The trenches <b>7</b> are then formed by anisotropic etching using an unillustrated resist pattern as a mask. The resist pattern has, for example, a stripe-like opening pattern in a region positioned at the opening <b>6</b> in the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>. Inside the opening pattern, the trenches <b>7</b> are formed by selective digging from the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Selective ion implantation of a p type impurity (for example, B) is then performed on a region of the top layer portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> outside the region in which the trenches <b>7</b> have been formed. Then, by performing an annealing process, the p-type impurity is activated and the guard ring <b>13</b> made of the p type diffusion layer is thereby formed in the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The field insulating film <b>5</b> made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is then formed on the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The field insulating film <b>5</b> is then etched using an unillustrated resist pattern as a mask to form the opening <b>6</b> that exposes the central portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> and a portion of the guard ring <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Ti is then deposited on the surfaces of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> and the field insulating film <b>5</b> by a sputtering method to form a Ti layer. The Ti layer is patterned by photolithography to form the Schottky metal <b>11</b>. The Schottky metal <b>11</b> is formed so as to contact the guard ring <b>13</b> and cover the entirety of the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> (including the inner surfaces of the respective trenches <b>7</b>) inside the opening <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Al is then deposited onto the Schottky metal <b>11</b> by a sputtering method, and the resulting Al layer is patterned by photolithography to form the contact metal <b>12</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The trenches <b>7</b> of substantially rectangular cross sections that are formed in the stripe form are defined by a depth D, a width W, and a pitch P. The depth D is a distance from the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> to the bottom surface of each trench <b>7</b> in the direction of the normal to the top surface (topmost surface) of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>.

An oxide film <b>33</b> is formed on an inner wall of each trench <b>32</b>, and a polysilicon <b>34</b> is embedded in the trench <b>32</b> so as to contact the oxide film <b>33</b>. The Schottky metal <b>11</b> is formed so as to contact the polysilicon <b>34</b> and the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> outside the trenches <b>32</b>.

Thus, if a leak current arises when a reverse bias is applied, the leak current flows to the anode electrode <b>9</b> side bypassing through the entirety of the depletion layer <b>50</b> substantially uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the case of the trench MOS type diode <b>31</b>, the depletion layer <b>50</b> spreads from each trench <b>32</b> and surrounds each trench <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Thus, if a leak current arises when a reverse bias is applied, the leak current flows to the anode electrode <b>9</b> side by passing through constricted regions between the depletion layers <b>50</b> spreading from adjacent trenches <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the case of the trench diffusion type diode <b>41</b>, the depletion layer <b>50</b> spreads from each impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> and surrounds each impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Thus, if a leak current arises when a reverse bias is applied, the leak current flows to the anode electrode <b>9</b> side by passing through constricted regions between the depletion layers <b>50</b> spreading from adjacent impurity diffusion layers <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the trench MOS type diode <b>31</b> and the trench diffusion type diode <b>41</b>, a current path during reverse biasing is constricted by the depletion layers <b>50</b> spreading from adjacent trenches <b>32</b> or the depletion layers <b>50</b> spreading from adjacent impurity diffusion layers <b>42</b>. The leak current can thus be lessened.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As described above, with the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a larger forward current (lower forward voltage) can be realized in comparison to any of the planar type diode <b>21</b>, the trench MOS type diode <b>31</b>, and the trench diffusion type diode <b>41</b> and yet reverse characteristics (leak current characteristics) of the same level as those of the planar type diode <b>21</b> can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a schematic sectional view of principal portions of the Schottky barrier diode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. FIG. <b>7</b>B shows a structure where the trench width W in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is increased. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows a structure where the trench interval (pitch P) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is widened. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> shows a structure where the trench interval in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is narrowed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">With the dimensions of the trenches <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> as bases, just the width W is increased with the depth D and the pitch P being fixed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. A proportion of the thin depletion layer <b>50</b> near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b> with respect to the entirety of the depletion layer <b>50</b> is thereby made high. In this case, the area of the bottom surface of each trench <b>7</b> is large and thus a larger current can be made to flow or the forward voltage can be decreased during forward biasing. However, if the width W is too large, the leak current during reverse biasing may be high.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, with the dimensions of the trenches <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> as bases, just the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> is increased with the depth D and the width W being fixed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. In this case, the depletion layer <b>50</b> thins at each mesa portion <b>8</b>. Thus, during reverse biasing, a leak current may flow not just near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b> but also in the respective mesa portions <b>8</b>, and the leak current may thus increase in comparison to the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With the dimensions of the trenches <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> as bases, just the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> is decreased with the depth D and the width W being fixed as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>D. The depletion layer <b>50</b> at each mesa portion <b>8</b> then fills a region inside the mesa portion <b>8</b> and spreads to a region at the cathode electrode <b>3</b> side beyond the mesa portion <b>8</b>. The depletion layer <b>50</b> at the mesa portions <b>8</b> thereby influences the depletion layer <b>50</b> near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>. That is, the depletion layer <b>50</b> thickens near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>. The leak current during reverse biasing is thus lessened due to being impeded by the depletion layer <b>50</b> near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, the number of trenches <b>7</b> is increased by decreasing just the width of the mesa portions <b>8</b> and keeping the width W fixed, and thus the total of the bottom areas of the trenches <b>7</b> can be increased as in the case of widening the width W of the trenches <b>7</b>. A larger current can thereby be made to flow and the forward voltage can be decreased further during forward biasing.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">That is, by decreasing the width of the mesa portions <b>8</b> with the depth D and the width W being at optimal values, the leak current during reverse biasing can be reduced while making a large current flow and decreasing the forward voltage during forward biasing.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Specifically, in this case, the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> is preferably 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m. The depth D is preferably 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m and more preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 0.6 &#x3bc;m. The ratio of the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> with respect to the depth D (the value obtained by dividing the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> by the depth D) is preferably in a range of no less than 0.2 (=0.2/1.0) and no more than 10 (=1.0/0.1) and more preferably in a range of no less than 0.33 (=0.2/0.6) and no more than 2 (=1.0/0.5). Also, the width W is preferably approximately 0.5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, with the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b>, the plurality of trenches <b>7</b> are formed in the top layer portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>, and the Schottky metal <b>11</b> contacts the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> including the inner surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b>. The area of the Schottky junction surface S can thus be made greater than the apparent area of the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> in plan view when the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> is viewed downward along the direction of the normal thereto. That is, the Schottky junction surface S can be formed on the inner surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b> and the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> outside the trenches <b>7</b> (the top surfaces of the mesa portions <b>8</b>). The total of these areas is greater than the apparent area of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> in plan view. The Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> having the large Schottky junction surface S even with a small chip size is thereby realized. Consequently, the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> of large rated current or the Schottky barrier diode <b>1</b> of low forward voltage can be realized with a compact chip size.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Also, the depletion layer <b>50</b> spreading from the Schottky junction surface S is thick near the mesa portions <b>8</b> formed between adjacent trenches <b>7</b> and is thin near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>. The thick depletion layer <b>50</b> near the mesa portions <b>8</b> contributes to the reduction in the leak current during reverse bias application.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, when the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> between the trenches <b>7</b> is wide, the depletion layer <b>50</b> at each mesa portions <b>8</b> stays within the region inside the mesa portion <b>8</b>. In this case, the depletion layer <b>50</b> is thin near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b> and thus the leak current may be high near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b> during reverse biasing. Further, the reduction amount of the forward voltage is low because the increase in the area of the Schottky junction surface S is also low.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">On the other hand, when the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> between the trenches <b>7</b> is narrow, the depletion layer <b>50</b> at the mesa portions <b>8</b> spreads to regions outside the mesa portions <b>8</b> and the depletion layer <b>50</b> thus thickens near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. Although the leak current during reverse biasing can thereby be reduced, the serial resistance of the mesa portions <b>8</b> increases and effects of current increase and forward voltage reduction are thus decreased. Thus, by setting the width of each mesa portion <b>8</b> in the range of 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, the depletion layer <b>50</b> can be made to have a thickness of appropriate value near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>. Specifically, in comparison to the planar type (Schottky barrier) diode <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) of the same chip size, a larger current can be made to flow, the forward voltage can be decreased, and the reverse leak current can be suppressed to a similar level. Also, in each trench <b>7</b>, current flows not only from the bottom surface but also from vicinities of bottom portions of the inner surfaces besides the bottom surface, and thus, by securing the inner surfaces to be as large as possible, a greater current can be made to flow to decrease the forward voltage. For this purpose, the pitch P between trenches <b>7</b> is made narrow to increase the number of the trenches <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Also, when the trenches <b>7</b> are deep, the depletion layer <b>50</b> at the mesa portions <b>8</b> do not readily fill the mesa portions <b>8</b> and thus the depletion layer <b>50</b> thins at the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>. When the trenches <b>7</b> are shallow, the depletion layer <b>50</b> at the mesa portions <b>8</b> readily fill the mesa portions <b>8</b> and spread to regions outside the mesa portions <b>8</b> and thus the depletion layer <b>50</b> thickens at the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>. Thus, by setting the depth D of the trenches <b>7</b> in the range of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m, the depletion layer <b>50</b> can be made to have a thickness of appropriate value near the bottom portions of the trenches <b>7</b>. Specifically, in comparison to the planar type diode <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) of the same chip size, a larger current can be made to flow, the forward voltage can be decreased, and the reverse leak current can be suppressed to a similar level.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Also, in the present preferred embodiment, the plurality of trenches <b>7</b> are formed in a stripe form (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). When the trenches <b>7</b> are formed in the stripe form, the pitch P and the width W of the trenches <b>7</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) can be controlled accurately in the manufacturing process. Device characteristics can thereby be obtained readily as designed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref> are schematic perspective views of Schottky barrier diodes according to first to sixth modification examples and each shows a portion of the arrangement in a broken-away manner. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sectioning planes of the respective portions are shifted for convenience of description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the trenches <b>7</b> are formed along two orthogonal directions. That is, the trenches <b>7</b> are formed to take a lattice form in plan view. In this case, the total area of the inner surfaces of the trenches <b>7</b> formed in the top layer portion of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> increases and thus the area of the Schottky junction surface S can be increased further.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the cross section of each of the trenches <b>7</b> formed in stripe form is formed to a substantially inverted triangular shape that narrows toward the bottom. The area of the Schottky junction surface S is made greater than the apparent area of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> in plan view with this arrangement as well.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the cross section of each of the trenches <b>7</b> formed in stripe form is formed to a semicircular shape that is arcuately recessed toward the bottom. The area of the Schottky junction surface S is made greater than the apparent area of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> in plan view with this arrangement as well. Further, the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> may be modified in accordance with the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> to form the trenches <b>7</b> of arcuate cross section in lattice form.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, the trenches <b>7</b> having the substantially inverted triangular cross section are formed to take a lattice form in plan view. Adjacent trenches <b>7</b> are continuous. The area of the Schottky junction surface S is made greater than the apparent area of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> in plan view with this arrangement as well. The trenches <b>7</b> having the substantially inverted triangular cross section may also be formed in lattice form at lateral and longitudinal intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, the trenches <b>7</b> of partial-spherical forms are formed so as to be continuous laterally and longitudinally.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, the plurality of trenches <b>7</b> that are recessed substantially semispherically from the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b> are formed at predetermined intervals in the top surface of the epitaxial layer <b>4</b>.
