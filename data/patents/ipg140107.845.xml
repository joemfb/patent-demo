<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a sea cucumber cultivator, sea cucumber cultivation baskets are arranged in multiple layers within a housing to protect the sea cucumbers from the external environment, to enable mass production and easy management of sea cucumbers. An inlet pipe and an outlet pipe are arranged to adjust the inflow and outflow of seawater to and from the housing. Each hose outlet is formed at a center region of a lower surface of a bottom of each sea cucumber cultivation basket in each layer so as to supply food for sea cucumbers to the cultivating spaces formed in the cucumber cultivation baskets arranged in multiple layers. Thus, food is discharged through the hose outlets and settles in the baskets to feed sea cucumbers and to enable sea cucumbers to easily intake food.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a sea cucumber cultivator in which sea cucumber cultivation baskets are densely arranged in multiple layers to enable mass production of sea cucumbers, and in which the cultivation environment such as the supply of oxygen, feeding, etc., is optimized to achieve maximal cultivation efficiency. More particularly, the present invention relates to a sea cucumber cultivator in which sea cucumber cultivation baskets are arranged in multiple layers within a housing for protecting sea cucumbers from the external environment, to enable mass production and easy management of sea cucumbers, in which seawater inlet and outlet pipes are configured to adjust the inflow and outflow of seawater to and from the housing, and in which air supply pipes for supplying air containing oxygen are configured to inject air into the housing, so that the cultivation environments may be optimized, resulting in improved quality and harvest rate of sea cucumbers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aquaculture refers to practice of producing seeds of aquatic animals or plants and growing or cultivating the produced seeds in a given water area in order to use adult animals or plants for food or for other purposes. Sea cucumber cultivation may include seed scattering type cultivation of scattering sea cucumber seeds over a suitable cultivation area, embankment type cultivation, hanging type cultivation, land-based aquatic plant type cultivation, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In seed scattering type cultivation, sea cucumber seeds are scattered and grown over a sea area abounding in seaweeds and adult sea cucumbers are picked or harvested by divers. In hanging type cultivation, infant sea cucumbers are accommodated and artificially fed within wicker baskets or cylindrical baskets which are suspended in the sea. In embankment type cultivation, banks are formed using stones so that seawater flows freely through gaps between the stones to maintain good water quality, and infant sea cucumbers within the banks are fed with artificial or natural foods. In the land-based aquatic plant type cultivation, using pieces of polycarbonate plates and/or mesh type sacks, infant sea cucumbers are cultivated together with abalones therein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an aquatic plant for cultivation of sea cucumbers employed in conventional land-based circulation aquatic plant type cultivation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a land-based circulation aquatic plant <b>1</b> has an exposed top face with a rectangular partitioned form using a concrete material. The plant <b>1</b> includes a seawater supply device for supplying the seawater from the sea to the plant. A plurality of strings is disposed across the exposed top face and a plurality of mesh type sacks are hung from the strings so as to be in contact with a bottom of the plant. In some cases, sea cucumbers are cultivated together with abalones.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a fish cultivation aquatic plant used in conventional land-based aquatic plant type cultivation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a conventional fish cultivation aquatic plant <b>2</b> has an exposed top face with a circular or square shape. The plant <b>2</b> includes a discharge pipe through which seawater containing excreta of fish, food residues and/or containments such as organic or inorganic materials is discharged to the coastal area. Such land-based aquatic plant cultivation has become commonplace.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A sea cucumber belonging to echinodermata can not swim unlike fish but crawls on the surface, and is a nocturnal animal. Therefore, sea cucumbers crawl in an attached manner onto bottom and side surfaces of the conventional sea cucumber or fish cultivation plant. However, since the bottom and side surfaces of the conventional sea cucumber or fish cultivation plant are made of hard concrete or FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastic), dissolved oxygen may not be supplied to sea cucumbers through the bottom and side surfaces thereof. Although oxygen may be artificially supplied into the plant, the oxygen may not reach sea cucumbers well due to fast floating of oxygen in water.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, a seawater discharge hole is located at a center of the cultivation plant and thus seawater is discharged at lower or high flow rates. Therefore, sea cucumbers seeds and food may be lost. Otherwise, food settled on the bottom becomes corrupted as time goes by, generating harmful gases. Such harmful gases may suffocate sea cucumbers or the corrupted food may come into contact with the skins of sea cucumbers, thus killing the sea cucumbers. Since sea cucumbers are nocturnal animals and light is not screened from the exposed top face, resulting in a small dark space, a living area of sea cucumbers is small and a population density of the cultivated sea cucumbers is low and sea cucumbers are not raised with good health due to the narrow movement area. In addition to these problems, sea pollution may increase due to the corrupted food residues and weights of sea cucumbers may reduce especially within hot seawater in midsummer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As for the seed scattering type cultivation, sea cucumbers seeds are scattered randomly over a given sea farm and are naturally raised for a certain period until adult sea cucumbers are to be picked or harvested for sale. Therefore, seed scattering type cultivation may be cost-efficient in terms of cultivation but may be labor-intensive in terms of harvesting. In seed scattering type cultivation, not only is it difficult to harvest the scattered sea cucumbers but also survival and collection rates of sea cucumbers may be low because of harmful organisms.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As for hanging type cultivation using wicker baskets or cylindrical baskets, there may occur the following problems: loss of a cultivator due to unique physical nature of the sea, that is, high waves for example from typhoons; death of sea cucumbers due to red tides; weight reduction of sea cucumbers due to high temperature seawater or irregular feeding; increasing effect of stress on sea cucumbers resulting from movement of a cultivator in feeding; and low population density of the cultivated sea cucumber due to a small area of the cultivator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As for embankment type cultivation, there may occur the following problems: weight reduction of sea cucumbers due to high temperature seawater in the summer or frozen seawater in the winter; increase of sea pollution due to food residues; increase of food price for sea cucumbers; and harmful effects on other sea farms due to interruption of seawater flow.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the invention is to provide a sea cucumber cultivator which optimizes cultivation environments for sea cucumbers so as to improve quality and harvest or collection rate of sea cucumbers and hence overcomes all of the drawbacks of the variety of the above mentioned sea cucumber cultivation approaches. This object may be achieved as follows. In the sea cucumber cultivator, sea cucumber cultivation baskets are arranged in multiple layers within a housing for protecting cultivated sea cucumbers from the external environment, to enable mass production and easy management of sea cucumbers. Seawater inlet and outlet pipes are installed to adjust the inflow and outflow of seawater to and from the housing. The seawater inlet and outlet pipes are formed of upper, lower, left and right communication pipes, resulting in smooth inflow and outflow of the seawater into/from the cultivation baskets in the housing. Opening/closing operations of respective valves are controlled such that each of all of the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes may selectively function as the seawater inlet pipe or outlet pipe. Therefore, the communication pipes may be prevented from being clogged with foreign substances by controlling the valves. Air supply pipes for supplying air containing oxygen into the cultivation baskets arranged in a plurality of layers are configured to penetrate the housing for injecting air into the housing. A food supply unit is configured so as to supply food into the cultivation baskets arranged in a plurality of layers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The object of the present invention can be achieved by providing the following sea cucumber cultivators.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A sea cucumber cultivator according to an embodiment of the invention may include a housing having a hollow accommodation space therein, the housing being coupled with inlet and outlet pipes for seawater inflow and outflow, and formed, at side and top portions thereof, with a door unit and an auxiliary door unit for opening/closing the housing;</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">a plurality of cultivation baskets supported in a suspended state in the housing, each of the baskets having a cultivation space to cultivate sea cucumbers; and an air supply unit installed outside the housing to supply air containing oxygen into the housing, the air supply unit including an air inlet pipe penetrating the housing from an outside thereof to an inside thereof and partially protruding toward the inside of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The door unit may be coupled to either or both sides of the housing so as to open/close the housing. A central portion of the door unit may be made of a transparent material so that the inside of the housing is visible.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The auxiliary door unit may include at least one auxiliary door unit installed at the top portion of the housing. The auxiliary door unit may be fixed, at one side thereof, to the housing to open/close the housing using a hinge. A plurality of perforations may be formed in a body of the auxiliary door unit so that air or seawater in the housing is discharged to the outside of the housing. A seawater guide pipe may be formed at the outside of the body so as to guide seawater discharged through the perforations into the body.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A plurality of perforations may be formed at each of the cultivation baskets so that air flows upwardly through the cultivation basket. A plurality of rollers may be installed at a lower surface of a top portion of each cultivation basket at both sides of the cultivation basket so that the cultivation basket is slidably supported by rails having a shape corresponding to the lower surface among rails formed at an inner wall surface of the housing, via the rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A plurality of perforations may be formed at each of the cultivation baskets so that air flows upwardly through the cultivation basket. A plurality of rollers may be installed at a lower surface of a top portion of each cultivation basket at both sides of the cultivation basket so that the cultivation basket is slidably supported by rails having a shape corresponding to the lower surface among rails formed at one side of a frame installed in the housing, via the rollers. The rails formed at the inner wall surface of the housing or at one side of the frame may include a plurality of vertically-spaced rails arranged along the inner wall surface to support the cultivation baskets in a stacked manner.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The frame may be fixed to the housing at upper and lower portions of the inner wall face of the housing, and the frame may include a pair of frames installed at right and left sides of the housing respectively. A plurality of vertically-spaced steps extending toward a center of the housing may be formed at one side of each of the left and right frames, to form the plurality of rails. A plurality of vertically-spaced holders may be installed at the other side of each of the left and right frames, to support a plurality of side plates, each of which is horizontally installed between the inner wall face of the housing and the frame corresponding to the holders.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cultivation baskets may further include connection plates to connect neighboring cultivation baskets among a plurality of the cultivation baskets disposed in a horizontally spaced manner at regular intervals and disposed on one rail so that sea cucumbers move between the neighboring cultivation baskets. The cultivation baskets may further include tilted plates connecting one cultivation basket among a plurality of the cultivation baskets disposed in a vertically spaced manner at regular intervals and another cultivation basket immediately under a cultivation basket horizontally neighboring the former cultivation basket so that sea cucumbers move between the former and latter cultivation baskets.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A plurality of bottom plates coupled to each other may be disposed at a bottom of the housing so as to prevent sea cucumbers seated within the cultivation basket from entering into the outlet pipe. Each locker may be formed at a lower surface of the bottom plate while having a central groove for fastening the bottom plate to the bottom of the housing. An engaging member may be formed on an inner face of a bottom of the housing while having a shape corresponding to that of the central groove of the locker. The locker may be attached to or detached from the engaging member. The cultivator may further include a water storage tank disposed outside the housing so as to communicate with the inlet and outlet pipes and store the seawater. A temperature adjustment unit may be installed at the water storage tank for adjusting a seawater temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inlet and outlet pipes may include an upper communication pipe, lower communication pipe, left communication pipe and right communication pipe communicating with the upper, lower, left and right sides of the housing respectively for inflow or outflow of the seawater. The upper, lower, left and right communication pipes may or may not communicate with, via opening/closing of respective valves, a main inlet pipe for transferring the seawater from the water storage tank to the housing. The respective valves may be controlled such that one or more communication pipes among the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes injects seawater into the housing using opening/closing operation of the valves while one or more other communication pipes among the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes discharges the seawater from the housing through opening/closing operation of the valves.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cultivator may further include a food supply unit installed at the outside of the housing to supply food into the cultivation baskets in the housing. The food supply unit may include a ringer tank having a given accommodation space for storing food for sea cucumbers, a food injection hole for injecting the food and a compressed air injection hole for injecting compressed air; a multifold unit being installed under the ringer tank so as to communicate with the ringer tank and having a plurality of branched pipes; ringer hoses being coupled in a communication manner to discharge ends of the branched pipes and penetrating the auxiliary door unit of the housing and being held at the bottom of the cultivation baskets for supplying the food in the ringer tank into the cultivation baskets; and hose outlets formed at ends of the ringer hoses for discharging the food. As for the plurality of branched pipes, the food injection hole, and the compressed air injection hole, whether or not and/or how much food or air is injected may be controlled depending on opening/closing operations of the valves.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cultivator may further include a support unit provided at both ends of the housing so that the housing is seated thereon. The support unit may include an upper support part and lower support part which are assembled together. Recesses may be formed respectively at facing surfaces of the upper and lower support parts of the support unit while having a shape corresponding to that of an outer wall of the housing to surround the outer wall of the housing. A plurality of the support units may be stacked so that a plurality of the housings is densely arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The air supply unit may include an air inlet pipe having a plurality of branched pipe portions which penetrate the housing and have ends protruding into the housing for inflow of air into the housing; an air storage tank for injecting air into the air inlet pipe; and an evaporator disposed between the air inlet pipe and air storage tank to evaporate the injected air from the air storage tank. The air supply unit may further include an oxygen supply unit for supplying oxygen into the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the embodiments of the invention, sea cucumbers may be securely raised in the housing and the seawater temperature may be adjusted to a regular and suitable level. Thus, sea cucumbers may be securely protected from fluctuation in sea conditions, thereby improving survival and harvest rates of sea cucumbers. Moreover, sea cucumbers may be fed on a regular basis and the population density of sea cucumbers may be greatly increased, resulting in mass production of sea cucumbers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With the temperature adjustment unit installed at the water storage tank, a suitable seawater temperature for cultivating sea cucumbers may be maintained, to shorten time to harvest of sea cucumbers. Further, a large amount of oxygen may be supplied using the air supply unit and dissolved oxygen may be supplied to all of the sea cucumbers seated in the housing through the perforations of the cultivation baskets, thus producing healthy sea cucumbers. The housing may, in nature, screen a substantial amount of light except for a minimum necessary amount of light, to achieve a suitable growth environment according to the nocturnal nature of sea cucumbers.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the embodiments of the invention, the air inlet pipes may be formed at the bottom of the housing and the injection nozzles may be installed at the ends of the air inlet pipes to inject the compressed air periodically and thus form whirlpools from below. Using the formed whirlpools, the supplied food and seawater may be uniformly distributed within the housing in accordance with the physical nature of the sea. Thus, not only may the food be supplied to the cultivation baskets arranged in a stacked way, the connection plates and tilted plates, but also the settled food and sea cucumber excreta on the bottoms of the baskets may be floated or decomposed to be guided into the seawater discharge holes using the injected air containing oxygen. As a result, a large amount of the food and oxygen may be uniformly distributed and a clean and optimal cultivation environment may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Some forms of the support units may be provided so as to increase the population density and moving distance of sea cucumbers. Moreover, some forms of the support units may be recycled, when used in a combined manner with an existing land-based facility for fish cultivation, the seawater polluted with, for example, fish excreta, excess food, organic substances discharged from land-based aquatic plants for fish cultivation, thereby purifying the seawater and thus protecting coastal waters from pollution. Further, using some forms of the support units, the fish may be cultivated out of the housing and sea cucumbers may be cultivated within the housing, leading to a hybrid type cultivation in which the cultivation space may be further optimized and cultivation management may be further simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inlet and outlet pipes may be formed of the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes and the main inlet pipe communicating with the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes. The respective values are controlled such that one or more communication pipes among the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes injects the seawater into the housing using opening/closing operation of the valves while one or more other communication pipes among the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes discharges the seawater from the housing using opening/closing operation of the valves. Thus, the discharge holes of the pipes may be prevented from becoming clogged with foreign substances such as sand due to continuous inflow and outflow of the seawater.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Not only the inflow and outflow of the seawater but also the supply of the food are easily controlled and maintained from the outside of the sea cucumber cultivator. Thus, through the entire process of cultivating sea cucumbers, labor may be minimized and the working processes may be simplified.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to the figures, a sea cucumber cultivator according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. A sea cucumber cultivator mainly includes a housing defined therein with a hollow accommodation space. An inlet pipe <b>110</b> for inflow of seawater and an outlet pipe <b>120</b> for outflow of seawater are coupled to the housing <b>100</b>. A door unit <b>130</b> and an auxiliary door unit <b>131</b> are formed at side and top portions of the housing <b>100</b>, respectively, to open/close the housing <b>100</b>. A sea cucumber cultivator also includes a plurality of cultivation baskets <b>140</b> arranged in the form of multiple vertically-spaced layers within the housing <b>100</b> while being supported in a suspended state by the housing <b>100</b> such that the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> are horizontally uniformly spaced apart from one another in each layer. A sea cucumber cultivator also includes connection plates <b>160</b> each coupled between neighboring ones of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> in each cultivation basket layer, to allow sea cumbers to move between neighboring cultivation baskets <b>140</b>, and tilted plates <b>170</b> each coupled between a corresponding one of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> in an upper one of neighboring ones of the cultivation basket layers and the cultivation basket <b>140</b> of the lower cultivation basket layer arranged beneath the cultivation basket <b>140</b> of the upper cultivation basket layer neighboring the corresponding cultivation basket <b>140</b>, to allow sea cumbers to move between the corresponding cultivation basket <b>140</b> and the cultivation basket <b>140</b> of the lower cultivation basket layer. A sea cucumber cultivator further includes a plurality of coupled bottom plates <b>180</b> disposed at a bottom of the housing <b>100</b> so as to prevent sea cucumbers seated within the cultivation basket <b>140</b> from entering into the outlet pipe <b>120</b>. The air supply unit <b>200</b> is disposed outside the housing <b>100</b> so as to supply air containing oxygen into the housing <b>100</b>. The air supply unit <b>200</b> includes an air inlet pipe <b>150</b> extending from the outside of the housing <b>100</b> to the inside of the housing <b>100</b> and partially protruding into the housing <b>100</b>. The water storage tank <b>300</b> is disposed outside the housing <b>100</b> so as to communicate with the inlet and outlet pipes <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> and store the seawater.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The housing <b>100</b> has a cylindrical form with a hollow space therein for receiving the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>, and is supported in a horizontal manner by a support unit <b>400</b> as will be described later. Within the housing <b>100</b>, rails <b>100</b><i>a </i>are installed to slidably support the plural cultivation baskets <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rails <b>100</b><i>a </i>have an arrangement corresponding to the arrangement of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> where the plural cultivation baskets <b>140</b> are arranged in the form of vertically-spaced multi-layers such that the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> are horizontally spaced apart from one another in each layer, thereby increasing the accommodation density for the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Rollers <b>142</b> are installed at a lower surface of a top portion of each cultivation basket <b>140</b> at both sides of the cultivation basket <b>140</b> so as to enable the cultivation basket <b>140</b> to be slidably guided by the rails <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Stoppers (not shown) are formed at both ends of each of the rails <b>100</b><i>a </i>so that stopping of the cultivation basket <b>140</b> by the stoppers is released when pressure above a given level is applied thereto. Thus, when the housing <b>100</b> is tilted or an operator draws the cultivation basket <b>140</b> with slight force without intention of separation of the cultivation basket <b>140</b>, the cultivation basket <b>140</b> is not easily separated from the rails <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The inlet pipe <b>110</b> for inflow of seawater and the outlet pipe <b>120</b> for outflow of seawater are provided at the housing <b>100</b>. The inlet and outlet pipes <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are preferably centrally installed at the top and bottom portions of the housing <b>100</b> respectively while branching into a plurality of pipe portions. In this case, an adjustment valve for adjusting an inflow amount of the seawater is preferably installed at an end side of each of the branched pipe portions of the inlet pipe <b>110</b> communicating with the inside of the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Here, &#x201c;the end side&#x201d; is a portion of each of the branched pipe portions of the inlet pipe <b>110</b> located outside the housing <b>100</b> to achieve easy operation of the adjustment valve.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Plugs having perforations are preferably fitted in respective outlet ends of the branched pipe portions of the inlet pipe <b>110</b> which are positioned within the housing <b>100</b> so as to prevent waste or containments contained in the seawater to be supplied into the housing from flowing into the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Such plugs having perforations may also be fitted in inlet ends of the branched pipe portions of the outlet pipe <b>120</b> which are positioned within the housing <b>100</b>. The seawater flowing in the inlet and outlet pipes <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> is stored in the water storage tank <b>300</b> installed outside the housing <b>100</b> to be able to store therein a certain amount of seawater and then is circulated, as desired, using a circulation pump mounted on a side of the water storage tank <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A temperature adjustment unit <b>310</b> is installed at the water storage tank <b>300</b> to allow the seawater to be kept at an optimal temperature for sea cucumber cultivation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The temperature adjustment unit <b>310</b> may include a temperature sensor for sensing a temperature of the seawater in the water storage tank <b>300</b>, a heater for heating the seawater when the sensed temperature of the seawater is below a predetermined temperature, and/or a chiller for cooling the seawater when the sensed temperature of the seawater is above the predetermined temperature. Details as to the temperature adjustment unit <b>310</b> are well known and thus further description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The door unit <b>130</b> is installed at either side or both sides of the housing <b>100</b> to open/close the housing <b>100</b>. In this example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the door unit <b>130</b> is provided as a cover in a form of a flange and is coupled to the housing <b>100</b> using a coupling means such as a bolt and nut.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, the coupling manner is not limited thereto. For example, one side of the door unit <b>130</b> may be coupled to a side of the housing <b>100</b> corresponding to one side of the door unit <b>130</b> using a hinge. The coupling manner of the door unit <b>130</b> to the housing <b>100</b> does not limit the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It is preferable that a door center portion <b>130</b><i>a </i>made of a transparent material is provided at a central region of the door unit <b>130</b> so that the inside of the housing <b>100</b> may be visible to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The auxiliary door units <b>131</b> are installed at the top portion of the housing <b>100</b> so that the inside of the housing <b>100</b> may be visible to the operator or the operator may open a door body <b>131</b><i>a </i>to place or take the cultivation basket <b>140</b> into/out of the housing <b>100</b>. A plurality of perforations <b>131</b><i>b </i>is formed in the door body <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the auxiliary door unit <b>131</b> so as to discharge excreta or gas discharged from sea cucumbers in the housing <b>100</b> from the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is preferable that the formation positions of the auxiliary door units <b>131</b> vertically correspond to the positions of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> disposed in the housing <b>100</b> in a uniformly horizontally spaced manner.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A seawater guide pipe <b>132</b> is formed along a peripheral portion of each of the auxiliary door units <b>131</b> so as to guide the seawater discharged through the perforations <b>131</b><i>b </i>of the auxiliary door unit <b>131</b> to an intended discharge place.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The cultivation baskets <b>140</b> are held in a suspended state in the housing <b>100</b> to provide cultivation spaces for sea cucumbers. As previously described, each cultivation basket <b>140</b> is supported by the rail <b>100</b><i>a </i>formed at the inner wall surface of the housing <b>100</b> to be slidable using the rollers <b>142</b> provided on the lower surface of the top portion of the cultivation basket <b>140</b> at both sides of the cultivation basket <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Sea cucumbers, sand and food, etc. are seated in the cultivation space of the cultivation basket <b>140</b>. Sea cucumbers consume the food in the sand to grow.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The connection plates <b>160</b> are interposed between neighboring ones of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> disposed in a horizontally spaced manner at regular intervals in each cultivation basket layer. Thus, sea cucumbers may move between neighboring cultivation baskets <b>140</b> via the connection plates <b>160</b>, thereby achieving increase in the cultivation space for sea cucumbers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is preferable that each of the connection plates <b>160</b> is bent upward at outer edges thereof so as to prevent sea cucumbers from escaping from the plate when moving between the neighboring cultivation baskets <b>140</b> and falling down from the connection plate. In a similar manner to the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>, the connection plates <b>160</b> may also have a plurality of perforations so that oxygen and food are upwardly supplied to upper surfaces of the connection plates <b>160</b> through the perforations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Each tilted plate <b>170</b> is interposed between a corresponding one of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> in an upper one of neighboring ones of the cultivation basket layers and the cultivation basket <b>140</b> of the lower cultivation basket layer arranged beneath the cultivation basket <b>140</b> of the upper cultivation basket layer neighboring the corresponding cultivation basket <b>140</b>, to allow sea cumbers to move between the corresponding cultivation basket <b>140</b> and the cultivation basket <b>140</b> of the lower cultivation basket layer. The slope of the tilted plate <b>170</b> may be determined based on the vertical and horizontal distances between the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The connection plates <b>160</b> and tilted plate <b>170</b> allow sea cucumbers to easily move to any place within the housing <b>100</b>. This effectively increases the cultivation space for sea cucumbers.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The bottom plates <b>180</b> are disposed under the lowest cultivation basket layer, that is, at the bottom of the housing <b>100</b> so as to prohibit sea cucumbers seated in the cultivation basket <b>140</b> from entering the outlet pipe <b>120</b>. A locker <b>181</b> is formed at a lower surface of each bottom plate <b>140</b>, to fasten the bottom plate <b>140</b> to the bottom of the housing <b>100</b>. The locker <b>181</b> is formed with a central groove.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Engaging members <b>184</b> are formed on the inner bottom surface of the housing <b>100</b> so as to have a shape corresponding to that of the central groove of the locker <b>181</b>. In this way, the bottom plates <b>180</b> are attached or detached to or from the housing <b>100</b> at the bottom of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The bottom plates <b>180</b> also have a plurality of perforations so that air containing oxygen flows upward from the bottom of the housing through the perforations.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each bottom plate <b>180</b> includes protrusions <b>182</b> formed on one end of the bottom plate and holes <b>183</b> formed on the other end of the bottom plate at positions corresponding to the protrusions <b>182</b> while having a shape corresponding to that of the protrusions <b>182</b>. Thus, a plurality of bottom plates <b>180</b> may be successively coupled in an end to end manner.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, different than the locker <b>181</b> and engaging member <b>184</b>, guide protrusions <b>100</b><i>b </i>having central grooves are formed at both sides of a given position of the housing <b>100</b> respectively, and side protrusions <b>185</b> are formed at both ends of a bottom plate <b>180</b> to be engaged with the grooves of the protrusions <b>100</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the bottom plate <b>180</b> is supported by the guide protrusions <b>100</b><i>b </i>and is slidable along the grooves of the guide protrusions <b>100</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the bottom plate <b>180</b> and housing <b>100</b> are coupled to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a similar manner to the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>, connection plates <b>160</b> and tilted plates <b>170</b>, the bottom plates <b>180</b> may be covered with a dense mesh having small holes. The bottom plates <b>180</b> may be coupled to the housing <b>100</b> while being covered with the mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The air supply unit <b>200</b> supplies into the housing <b>100</b> air containing oxygen which in turn is supplied to sea cucumbers. The air supply unit <b>200</b> includes the air inlet pipe <b>150</b>, an air storage tank <b>190</b> and an evaporator <b>191</b>. The air inlet pipe <b>150</b> includes a plurality branched pipe portions which penetrate the housing <b>100</b> and have ends protruding into the housing <b>100</b> for inflow of air into the housing <b>100</b>. The air storage tank <b>190</b> supplies air to the air inlet pipe <b>150</b>. The evaporator <b>191</b> is disposed between the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> and air storage tank <b>190</b> to evaporate the supplied air from the air storage tank.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The air supply unit <b>200</b> may include an oxygen supply unit for supplying oxygen into the housing <b>100</b> and an air supply unit for supplying air into the housing <b>100</b>. The oxygen supply unit and air supply unit are separated from each other. Thus, both oxygen and air may be supplied into the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">mow In case air or oxygen in the air storage tank <b>190</b> is present in a liquid state, the air or oxygen may be evaporated using the evaporator <b>191</b>. The evaporator <b>191</b> is necessary in that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the oxygen is generally available in a liquid state. When air or oxygen in the air storage tank <b>190</b> is present in a gaseous state, the evaporator <b>191</b> may be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">An injection nozzle is provided at an end of the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> of the air supply unit <b>200</b> which communicates with the bottom of the housing <b>100</b>. The injection nozzle may inject air so that settled waste, etc. on the bottom of the housing <b>100</b> moves up and is discharged into the outlet pipe <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Therefore, as air flow pipes with ends communicating with the bottom of the housing <b>100</b>, there may exist the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> having the injection nozzle at the end thereof and the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> for supplying the oxygen. If necessary, the injection nozzle may be provided at an end of the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> for supplying the oxygen, so that supply of the oxygen and floating of the waste by a whirlpool may be performed simultaneously using a single air inlet pipe <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Although the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> is configured to penetrate the housing <b>100</b> and extend into the housing <b>100</b>, the configuration of the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> is not limited thereto. As a variant, the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> may be configured to penetrate the auxiliary door unit <b>131</b> and extend into the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">This is because as the number of the pipes penetrating the housing <b>100</b> increases, durability and anti-leakage properties of the housing <b>100</b> decreases. That is, in order to suppress deterioration in durability and anti-leakage, the air inlet pipe <b>150</b> is configured to penetrate the auxiliary door unit <b>131</b>. Further, an anti-leakage means such as a sealant may be applied around a penetration region for suppression of leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The support unit <b>400</b> is provided at both ends of the housing <b>100</b> so that the housing <b>100</b> is seated thereon. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the support unit <b>400</b> includes an upper support part <b>410</b> and lower support part <b>420</b> which are able to be assembled together.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Recesses <b>430</b> are formed respectively at facing surfaces of the upper and lower support parts <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> of the support unit <b>400</b> while having a shape corresponding to that of an outer wall surface of the housing <b>100</b> to surround the outer wall surface of the housing <b>100</b>. By stacking a plurality of support units <b>400</b>, installation space of the housings may be optimized so that as many housings as possible are densely arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">According to another embodiment of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the support unit <b>400</b> may include a cylindrical upper part and a rod-shaped lower part. Such support units may be stacked to form a multi-layer arrangement. With such a configuration, the supporting space may be reduced in size compared to the above described configuration, and, hence, in case of hybrid type cultivation for both of fish and sea cucumbers, movement of fish is not interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the support unit <b>400</b> may include band type frames surrounding and supporting the housing <b>100</b> and a support bar coupled to the frames to support the same.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a configuration of seawater inlet and outlet pipes and an inner configuration of the housing according to another embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a food supply unit according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the inlet and outlet pipes according to this embodiment of the invention have a different configuration from that of the inlet and outlet pipes according to the above-mentioned embodiment. To be specific, the inlet and outlet pipes according to the above-mentioned embodiment are disposed at the upper and lower sides of the housing <b>100</b> respectively, whereas the inlet and outlet pipes according to this embodiment are disposed at upper, lower, left and right sides of the housing <b>100</b>. That is, the inlet and outlet pipes according to this embodiment are formed of an upper communication pipe <b>111</b>, lower communication pipe <b>112</b>, left communication pipe <b>113</b> and right communication pipe <b>114</b> communicating with the upper, lower, left and right sides of the housing <b>100</b> respectively for inflow or outflow of the seawater. The upper, lower, left and right communication pipes <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> may or may not communicate with, via opening/closing of respective values (V), a main inlet pipe <b>115</b> for transferring the seawater from the seawater storage tank <b>300</b> to the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The respective valves are controlled such that one or more communication pipes among the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> supply the seawater into the housing <b>100</b> using opening/closing operation of the valves while one or more other communication pipes among the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> discharge the seawater from the housing <b>100</b> using opening/closing operation of the valves. In this way, each of the upper, lower, left and right communication pipes <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> may selectively function as the seawater inlet pipe or outlet pipe. Therefore, when, in case of the communication pipes having ends formed of a plurality of perforations as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the perforations are clogged with foreign substances such as sand due to continuous inflow and outflow of seawater, the clogging foreign substances may be eliminated from the perforations by controlling the valves so that the communication valves previously functioning as the inlet pipe may function as the outlet pipe and the communication valves previously functioning as the outlet pipe may function as the inlet pipe. That it, the clogging foreign substances may be eliminated by reversing the previous seawater flows.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As a result, according to this embodiment, the foreign substances clogging the communication pipes may be removed through the simple closing/opening operations of the valves without manual intervention and difficult task of removing the clogging foreign substances. Thus, the durability of the cultivator may be improved and maintenance thereof may become easy and flows of the seawater may become smooth, thereby further improving a cultivation environment.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the inner configuration of the housing according to this embodiment of the invention is different from that of the housing according to the above-mentioned embodiment in that frames <b>500</b> are installed in the housing while having rails <b>500</b><i>a </i>for supporting the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>. The frames are fixed to the housing at upper and lower inner wall faces thereof. The frames <b>500</b> include a pair of frames formed at right and left sides of the housing <b>100</b> respectively. A plurality of vertically-spaced steps extending toward the center of the housing <b>100</b> is formed at one side of each of the left and right frames <b>500</b>, to form a plurality of rails <b>500</b><i>a</i>. Also, a plurality of vertically-spaced holders <b>500</b><i>b </i>is installed at the other side of each of the left and right frames <b>500</b>, to support a plurality of side plates <b>186</b>, which is horizontally installed between the inner wall face of the housing <b>100</b> and the corresponding frame <b>500</b> in a vertically spaced manner.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">By defining the inner space of the housing using the frames <b>500</b> and by supporting the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> and side face plates <b>186</b> using the rails <b>500</b><i>a </i>and holders <b>500</b><i>b </i>formed at the frames <b>500</b>, the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> may be manufactured to have a regular size not as in the previously mentioned embodiment, resulting in reduction of manufacturing cost and enabling mass production of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Furthermore, by forming a plurality of the side face plates <b>186</b> having a similar form to the bottom plates <b>180</b> in left and right spaces of the housing <b>100</b> which are occupied by the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> in the previously mentioned embodiment, the cultivation space for sea cucumbers may be increased and the inner space of the housing may be more efficiently utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Above the side face plates <b>186</b>, the above mentioned left and right communication pipes <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are disposed. In order to support such side face plates <b>186</b>, the rails <b>100</b><i>a </i>as in the previously mentioned embodiment or holders <b>100</b><i>c </i>having a 90&#xb0; rotated U-shape may be installed at the inner face of the housing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">If the support structures formed at the inner surface face of the housing <b>100</b> to support the side plates <b>186</b> have the form of the rails <b>100</b><i>a</i>, the support structures of the frames <b>500</b> to support the side plates <b>186</b> should also have the form of the rails <b>500</b><i>a</i>. However, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the support structures are formed to have the form of the holders <b>100</b><i>c </i>or <b>500</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a food supply unit <b>600</b> is installed at the outside of the housing <b>100</b> to supply food into the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> in the housing. The food supply unit <b>600</b> includes a ringer tank <b>610</b> having a given accommodation space for storing therein food for sea cucumbers and a food injection hole <b>611</b> for injecting the food and a compressed air injection hole <b>612</b> for injecting compressed air. The food supply unit <b>600</b> further includes a manifold unit <b>620</b> installed under the ringer tank <b>610</b> so as to communicate with the ringer tank <b>610</b> and having a plurality of branched pipes <b>621</b>. The food supply unit <b>600</b> further includes ringer hoses <b>630</b> coupled in a communication manner to discharge ends of the branched pipes <b>621</b> and penetrating the auxiliary door units <b>131</b> of the housing <b>100</b> and held at the bottom of the cultivation baskets <b>140</b> for supplying the food in the ringer tank <b>610</b> into the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>. The food supply unit <b>600</b> further includes hose outlets <b>640</b> formed at ends of the ringer hoses <b>630</b> for discharging the food.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As to the plurality of branched pipes <b>621</b>, the food injection hole <b>611</b>, and the compressed air injection hole <b>612</b>, whether or not and/or how much food or air is injected is controlled depending on opening/closing operations of the valves (V).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A cleaning door <b>613</b> is installed at the ringer tank <b>610</b> for cleaning the inside of the tank. A food gauge <b>614</b> is installed at an outer wall of the ringer tank <b>610</b> to indicate a food amount remaining in the tank <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The compressed air injection hole <b>612</b> is provided to inject the compressed air as a driving source to forcibly discharge the food stored in the ringer tank <b>610</b> through the branched pipes <b>621</b> to the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>. A compressed air injection hole <b>612</b> is formed at a connection pipe <b>615</b> communicating the ringer tank <b>610</b> and the branch unit <b>620</b> with each other for the purpose of generating and guiding whirlpools, to enable the food in the ringer tank <b>610</b> to be uniformly mixed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The compressed air injection hole <b>612</b> formed at a connection pipe <b>615</b> may also be used in injecting cleaning water for cleaning the inside of the ringer thank <b>610</b>. In this way, by injecting the compressed air at the same time as injecting the cleaning water, cleaning efficiency may be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The ringer hoses <b>630</b> are respectively fixed to supporting holders <b>142</b> installed beneath the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>. The food is discharged through the hose outlets <b>640</b> and then naturally flows downward and accumulates in the cultivation baskets <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Ringer hoses <b>630</b> for the uppermost cultivation baskets <b>140</b> are held by support means such as the support holders installed at an inner surface of an upper portion of the housing <b>100</b>.
