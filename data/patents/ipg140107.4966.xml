<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to torque measurement systems and, more specifically, to techniques for tuning a telemetry system of a torque measurement system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A torque measurement system typically includes a rotor device (rotor) and a stator device (stator). The rotor is generally configured to attach to a rotating system such as an engine turbine, gearbox, transmission, or other piece of rotating equipment. The rotor includes strain gages for sensing torque, rotor electronics (RTE) for performing signal processing operations, and an antenna for inductively receiving power from the stator and for communicating with the stator. The stator is typically stationary and external to the rotating system and includes a coupling module in close proximity to the antenna of the rotor for receiving a signal from the RTE. The coupling module is often times in the shape of a caliper and referred to as a caliper coupling module (CCM). The CCM transfers the signal received from the rotor to stator electronics (STE) that perform signal processing to extract the torque measurements in the signal. The stator may, for example, work in conjunction with a personal computer to process and present the data collected by the RTE. The stator can also transmit instructions to the RTE, provide power to the RTE through inductive coupling, and receive status information transmitted by the RTE.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The rotor and stator each include an inductive antenna for bi-directional communication. Initially, the antennas are manually tuned at the factory where the torque measurement system is assembled. This tuning ensures that the rotor receives an adequate signal from the stator, and vice versa. This initial tuning generally matches the resonant frequency of the RTE and the STE close to the telemetry frequency through the selection of electronic components, such as capacitors. Manufacturing variations in electronic components, ageing of electronic components, as wells as variations in operating conditions, and other variable factors, however, can cause the tuning of the antennas determined during the initial tuning to no longer be accurate once a system is assembled and installed at a customer location. After assembly, however, the rotor antenna and stator antenna are typically not easily tunable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This disclosure generally describes a torque measurement system that includes a rotor device and a stator device. The rotor is generally configured to attach to a rotating system such as an engine turbine, gearbox, transmission, or other piece of rotating equipment. The stator is typically stationary and external to the rotating system and includes a coupling module in close proximity to an antenna of the rotor. The rotor and stator each include an inductive antenna for bi-directional communication. According to techniques of this disclosure, an inductive antenna of the rotor, stator, or both can be automatically tuned in a manner that may improve both power transfer and data transfer between the rotor and stator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example, a torque measurement system includes a stator device configured to receive a signal from a rotor device. The stator device includes a first variable capacitive element and a first micro-controller configured to adjust a first capacitance value of the first variable capacitive element. In another example, a torque measurement system includes a rotor device configured to transmit a signal to a stator device, and the rotor device includes a variable capacitive element and a micro-controller configured to adjust a capacitance value of the variable capacitive element.</p>

The rotor is generally configured to attach to a rotating system such as an engine turbine, gearbox, transmission, or other piece of rotating equipment. The stator device is typically stationary and external to the rotating system and includes a coupling module in close proximity to an antenna of the rotor. The rotor and stator each include an inductive antenna for bi-directional communication. According to techniques of this disclosure, an inductive antenna of the rotor, stator, or both can be automatically tuned in a manner that may improve both power transfer and data transfer between the rotor and stator.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this disclosure, &#x201c;stator tuning&#x201d; generally refers to adjusting parameters, such as a capacitance value, of stator components to adjust the overall tuning of a torque measurement. Similarly, &#x201c;rotor tuning&#x201d; generally refers to adjusting parameters, such as a capacitance value, of rotor components to adjust the overall tuning of a torque measurement system. &#x201c;System tuning&#x201d; or &#x201c;overall tuning,&#x201d; as used in this disclosure can refer to any of stator tuning, rotor tuning, or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates one example of a torque measurement system <b>100</b> configured to implement aspects of this disclosure. Torque measurement system <b>100</b> includes rotor <b>110</b> and stator <b>120</b>. Rotor <b>110</b> includes flange <b>111</b>, holes <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d</i>, ring <b>113</b>, antenna <b>114</b>, and circuitry <b>115</b>. Antenna <b>114</b> and circuitry <b>115</b> may collectively be referred to as the rotor electronics (RTE). Stator <b>120</b> includes coupling module (CM) <b>121</b>, antenna <b>122</b>, signal processing module (SPM) <b>123</b>, and computer <b>124</b>. Rotor <b>110</b> connects to a rotating mechanism such as a turbine of an engine through holes <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>in flange <b>111</b>. Flange <b>111</b> contains a series of strain gages (not shown) for making torque measurements as rotor <b>110</b> rotates. The output of the strain gauges, also referred to as torque measurement signals, is transmitted from the strain gauges on flange <b>111</b> to circuitry <b>115</b>. Circuitry <b>115</b> may be embedded on a printed circuit board and configured to perform a series of signal processing operations, such as amplification, digitization, and/or amplitude modulation, on the strain gage output prior to transmitting the torque measurement signals to stator <b>120</b> via antenna <b>114</b>, which may be embedded in ring <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Antenna <b>114</b> may be configured to both transmit and receive a radio frequency (RF) signal to and from antenna <b>122</b> of stator <b>120</b>. The RF signal can be amplitude modulated to include digital data for purposes of communication. In addition to digital communication data, stator <b>120</b> also wirelessly supplies power to rotor <b>110</b> via electromagnetic induction from antenna <b>122</b> to antenna <b>114</b>. When supplying power but not transmitting data, the RF signal transmitted from stator <b>120</b> to <b>110</b> may not be amplitude modulated. The transmissions between antenna <b>114</b> and antenna <b>122</b> occur at a selected carrier frequency, which is often either approximately 6.78 MHz or 13.56 MHz but may also be at other frequencies. The carrier frequency is also sometimes referred to as the telemetry frequency. When torque measurement system <b>100</b> is in operation, ring <b>113</b> is typically placed less than a few centimeters away from CM <b>121</b> and antenna <b>122</b>. In some implementations CM <b>121</b> can be a caliper coupling module in the shape of a caliper that partially surrounds ring <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Stator <b>120</b> receives the signal with the torque measurement data via antenna <b>122</b> from antenna <b>114</b> through inductive communication. Antenna <b>122</b> and antenna <b>114</b> can be inductively coupled coils, hoop antennas, or other appropriately suited types of antennas. Antenna <b>122</b> may be included in CM <b>121</b> which is located in close proximity to antenna <b>114</b> of rotor <b>110</b>. CM <b>121</b> and SPM <b>123</b> perform various signal processing operations, such as demodulation and amplification, on the received signal to extract the torque measurement data obtained by rotor <b>110</b>. CM <b>121</b>, antenna <b>122</b>, and SPM <b>123</b> may collectively be referred to in this disclosure as stator electronics (STE). Computer <b>124</b> can present the torque measurement data to a user of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is intended to illustrate the functionality of rotor <b>110</b> and stator <b>120</b> by showing one example configuration. The various functional units described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, may be implemented in numerous other configurations. For example, in some implementations the functionality of SPM <b>123</b> and computer <b>124</b> may be combined into a common device or unit. As another example, in some implementations antenna <b>122</b>, CM <b>121</b>, and SPM <b>123</b> may be included in a common device or unit, but in other examples, CM <b>121</b> and SPM <b>123</b> may be separate devices or units communicatively coupled through a wired or wireless channel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The RTE and STE can initially be tuned when rotor <b>110</b> and stator <b>120</b> are assembled. As will be described in more detail below, the STE includes a series LC tuned circuit that includes a capacitor (C) in series with an inductor (L). The current in antenna <b>122</b> may be at a maximum value or close to a maximum value when the resonant frequency of the series LC circuit is approximately equal to the telemetry frequency, i.e. the carrier frequency. Additionally, as will be described in more detail below, the RTE includes a parallel LC tuned circuit, which includes a capacitor (C) in parallel with an inductor (L). The current in antenna <b>114</b> may be at a maximum value or close to maximum value when the resonant frequency of the parallel LC circuit of the RTE is approximately equal to the telemetry frequency. The initial tuning at the time of assembly includes determining a C value for the STE and a C value for the RTE, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tuning performed at the time of assembly, however, may no longer be accurate when the system is installed, at a customer location for example. This is often true because the environments in which torque measurement systems are used tend to have a lot of metal in close proximity to antenna <b>122</b> and antenna <b>114</b>, which can alter the optimal tuning. Additionally, when initially tuning antenna <b>122</b> and antenna <b>114</b>, it can be difficult to account for manufacturing variations that can occur with various components, as well as the changes that can occur to components as the components age and wear. As will be described in more detail below, in accordance with techniques of this disclosure, one or both of antenna <b>114</b> and antenna <b>122</b> can be automatically tunable, thus allowing for the initial tuning done at the factory to be refined once the torque measurement system is installed. By tuning antennas <b>114</b> and/or <b>122</b>, the amount of power received by rotor <b>110</b> from stator <b>120</b> may be increased, and the quality of data communication between rotor <b>110</b> and stator <b>120</b> may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As will be described in more detail below, aspects of the present disclosure include the use of one or more microcontrollers in either or both of rotor <b>110</b> and stator <b>120</b> to perform an automatic tuning procedure. The automatic tuning procedure may, for example, be performed each time the torque measurement system is powered on, periodically, or upon user command. The automatic tuning procedure may include stator tuning, rotor tuning, or both. Rotor <b>110</b> and stator <b>120</b> might typically be coarsely tuned at the time of assembly, and the automatic tuning procedure described in this disclosure may serve as a fine adjustment to that coarse tuning. As will be described in more detail below, the techniques of this disclosure may implement stator tuning by utilizing a variable capacitive element in the STE that can be controlled by a microcontroller to adjust the C value in the LC circuit of the STE. The techniques of the present disclosure may additionally or alternatively implement rotor tuning by utilizing a variable capacitive element in the RTE that can be controlled by a microcontroller to adjust the C value in the LC circuit of the RTE.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>is a graph showing the frequency response of the rotor LC circuit measured independently (curve <b>201</b>), the stator LC circuit measured independently (curve <b>202</b>), the frequency response of the overall system (curve <b>203</b>), and the telemetry frequency (line <b>204</b>). As can be seen by the narrowness of curve <b>202</b> compared to curve <b>201</b>, that STE has a higher degree of selectivity compared to the RTE. Accordingly, the 3 dB-bandwidth (i.e. the frequency at which output power drops by approximately 50%) is approximately two MHz for the RTE but only a few hundred KHz for the STE, making the overall system 3 dB bandwidth approximately 1 MHz. The frequency response of the overall system is a product of both the rotor frequency response and the stator frequency response, but due to the higher degree of selectively of the stator, in some instances, tuning the stator may have more effect on the overall system frequency response.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some implementations, tuning may occur at only the RTE or only the STE. In other implementations, tuning may occur at both the RTE and the STE. In implementations where tuning occurs at the both the RTE and the STE, the tuning may occur concurrently, or the system may first attempt to tune the STE and only tune the RTE if tuning the STE proves to be insufficient, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-2D</figref> are graphs of system frequency response that show the induced voltage in the RTE as a function of frequency response. The telemetry frequency is the frequency of the carrier that powers the RTE. The telemetry frequency is usually determined by a stable frequency source such as a crystal oscillator in the stator electronics and does not typically change with either the stator or rotor electronics tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-2D</figref> show a system response with three unique bands. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the normal data band. Generally, it is desirable to tune the system such that the telemetry frequency is in the normal data band. If the RF power input is adequate, the recovered voltage should also be adequate and the amplitude modulated digital signal should have sufficient modulation depth. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a forbidden band. In this forbidden band shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the voltage induced in the RTE is maximum but an amplitude modulated digital signal does not have sufficient modulation depth for data transfer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> shows the data inversion band. This band generally operates the same as the normal data band, but digital data is inverted. For example, a digital signal of 11010 in the normal band appears as 00101 in the data inversion band. A stator can be configured to detect inverted data, thus making the data inversion band also suitable for data communication. Tuning of the system, as described in this disclosure, generally includes adjusting parameters of the LC tuned circuits in a rotor and/or a stator such that the telemetry frequency is generally in the normal data band or data inversion band but not within the forbidden band.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One objective of stator tuning may be to adjust the gap between the resonant frequency of the stator LC and the telemetry frequency in order to create sufficient power transfer from stator to rotor and reliable data transfer from rotor to stator. Similarly, one objective of rotor tuning is to adjust the gap between resonant frequency of the rotor LC and telemetry frequency to ensure sufficient power transfer from stator to rotor and reliable data transfer from rotor to stator.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram showing components of rotor electronics (RTE) <b>310</b> of a rotor device, such as rotor <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that are configured to receive torque measurements signals from strain gages <b>330</b>. RTE <b>310</b> includes antenna <b>314</b>, fixed capacitor <b>316</b>, variable capacitive element <b>317</b>, signal conditioning module (SCM) <b>319</b>, and micro-controller <b>321</b>. RTE <b>310</b> can both transmit a signal to a stator device and receive a signal from a stator device. When receiving a transmission, RTE <b>310</b> receives an RF signal from a stator device at antenna <b>314</b>. The components shown in box <b>318</b> comprise a parallel LC circuit. Fixed capacitor <b>316</b> has a capacitance value selected during assembly of RTE <b>310</b> to coarsely tune antenna <b>314</b> to the telemetry frequency in the manner described above with relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-D</figref>. As will be described in more detail below, micro-controller <b>321</b> can change the capacitive value of variable capacitive element <b>317</b> such that that the total capacitance of fixed capacitor <b>316</b> and variable capacitive element <b>317</b> can be set to multiple different values. Micro-controller <b>321</b> can either identify the value for variable capacitive element <b>317</b> that produces the best tuning, or can transmit recorded data to a stator device so the stator device can identify the value for variable capacitive element <b>317</b> that produces the best tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Identifying a desired tuning for the LC circuit of box <b>318</b> can be performed by causing micro-controller <b>321</b> to record recovered voltage values (V<sub>RECOVERED</sub>) for various values of variable capacitive element <b>317</b>. Based on the recorded values for V<sub>RECOVERED</sub>, micro-controller <b>321</b> might set variable capacitive element <b>317</b> to a desired value. Alternatively, mircro-controller <b>321</b> may transmit the values of V<sub>RECOVERED </sub>to a stator device so the stator device can determine a desired value for variable capacitive element <b>317</b>. A stator device, such as stator <b>120</b> which includes computer <b>124</b> for example, may have greater computational resources than RTE <b>310</b>, and thus can use more sophisticated techniques for determining a desired tuning than would be practical to implement in RTE <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Determination of a desired value for variable capacitive element <b>317</b> may include testing a group of values and identifying a preferred value from the group. Determination of a desired value may also include testing values for capacitive element <b>317</b> until an adequate value is found instead of testing an entire group of values. Additionally, as will be explained in more detail below, the stator device may use the recorded values of V<sub>RECOVERED </sub>for performing stator tuning. In some implementations the tuning of RTE <b>310</b> may be based only on recorded values for V<sub>RECOVERED</sub>, but in other implementations V<sub>RECOVERED </sub>may be one of multiple variables that are monitored for the purposes of determining a desired tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As will be described in more detail below, RTE <b>310</b> may be configured to operate in a tuning mode, where micro-controller can cause RTE <b>310</b> to transmit a signature byte that contains a series of bits known to a stator. Upon receiving a confirmation of tuning from the stator device, RTE <b>310</b> can enter into a normal operating mode. If, however, RTE <b>310</b> does not receive a confirmation of tuning within a certain period of time, then micro-controller <b>321</b> can adjust the capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In implementation, the functionality of SCM <b>319</b> may perform amplification, filtering, signal rectification, analog-to-digital conversion, low drop out regulation, amplitude shift keying, and numerous other signal processing operations necessary or desirable for purposes of measuring torque values and communicating with a stator device. In some implementations, these various functions may be performed by a plurality of units at various locations throughout RTE <b>310</b>. It should also be noted that the location of variable capacitive element <b>317</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is merely one example configuration. In some configurations, for example, circuitry corresponding to the various functionality of SCM <b>319</b>, such as signal rectification, may occur between fixed capacitor <b>316</b> and variable capacitive element <b>317</b>. The circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is merely intended to be one non-limiting example of the electronics that might be found in a rotor device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram showing components of stator electronics (STE) <b>420</b> of a stator device, such as stator <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. STE <b>420</b> includes an RF generator and filter <b>421</b>, stator antenna <b>422</b>, fixed capacitor <b>423</b>, and variable capacitive element <b>424</b>. The components shown in box <b>425</b> collectively form a series LC circuit. STE <b>420</b> further includes signal processing module (SPM) <b>426</b>, peak detector <b>427</b>, peak comparator <b>428</b>, data inversion detection module <b>429</b>, and micro-controller <b>430</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, STE <b>420</b> may also include circuitry for detecting data inversion as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> and may include amplitude modulation circuitry for modulating a signal with data for purposes of communicating with a rotor device. STE <b>420</b> is configured to both transmit and receive a signal via stator antenna <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To transmit a signal, micro-controller <b>430</b> may cause RF generator and filter <b>421</b> to generate an amplitude modulated signal for transmission to a rotor device. When receiving a signal SPM <b>426</b> can demodulate, filter, differentiate, and amplify the received signal. STE <b>420</b> may perform a wide array of signal processing functions on both transmitted and received signals. For ease of explanation, this disclosure generally ascribes these various functions to SPM <b>426</b>, but in some implementations, these various functions may be performed by a plurality of units at various locations throughout STE <b>420</b>. The circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is merely intended to be one non-limiting example of the electronics that may be found in a stator device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">During tuning, SPM <b>426</b> can be configured to identify a signal from a rotor device by identifying a signature byte transmitted by the rotor device. After SPM <b>426</b> identifies a signal from a rotor, peak detector <b>427</b> can detect the peak output of SPM <b>426</b>, which is one measure of the quality of the received signal. Based on the peak value detected by peak detector <b>427</b>, micro-controller <b>430</b> may either adjust the capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>424</b> or determine that the system is adequately tuned and enter into a normal mode of operation. In some implementations, peak comparator <b>428</b> may compare detected peaks for a set of capacitance values for variable capacitive element <b>424</b>, and micro-controller can set variable capacitive element <b>424</b> to the capacitance that results in the best signal quality, which in this example might be the capacitance that results in the largest detected peak value by peak detector <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, either instead of or in addition to detecting a peak of a signal received at STE <b>420</b>, micro-controller <b>430</b> may also receive, from a rotor device, data identifying a recovered voltage at the rotor device. Based on the recovered voltages at the rotor device, micro-controller <b>430</b> may either adjust the capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>424</b> or determine that the system is adequately tuned and enter into a normal mode of operation. In some implementations, STE <b>420</b> may compare recovered voltages for a set of capacitance values for variable capacitive element <b>424</b>, and micro-controller can set variable capacitive element <b>424</b> to the capacitance that results in the best recovered voltage at the rotor device.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of a variable capacitive component <b>501</b>, which could be used in either a RTE or STE according to the techniques of this disclosure. Variable capacitive component <b>501</b> is configured to be able to produce variable capacitances between lead <b>505</b> and lead <b>506</b>. Variable capacitive component <b>501</b> may, for example, be included in the variable capacitive element <b>317</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or variable capacitive element <b>424</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Variable capacitive component <b>501</b> includes <b>5</b> capacitors (capacitors <b>510</b><i>a</i>-<b>510</b><i>e</i>) connected to one another in parallel. In other configurations, different numbers of capacitors as well as capacitors connected in series may be utilized. Each of capacitors <b>510</b><i>a</i>-<b>510</b><i>e </i>is connected to lead <b>506</b> through a switch (switches <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<b>520</b><i>e</i>). When switch <b>520</b><i>a </i>is closed, capacitor <b>510</b><i>a </i>contributes to the capacitance between leads <b>505</b> and <b>506</b>. When switch <b>520</b><i>a </i>is open, capacitor <b>510</b><i>a </i>does not contribute to the capacitance between leads <b>505</b> and <b>506</b>. Capacitors <b>510</b><i>b</i>-<b>510</b><i>e </i>and switches <b>520</b><i>b</i>-<b>520</b><i>e </i>contribute in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Switches <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<b>520</b><i>e </i>are configured to be controllable by a micro-controller, such as micro-controller <b>321</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or micro-controller <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Switches <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>may comprise digitally controlled switches that enable bi-directional current flow such as transistor-based switches (e.g. MOSFETs), or may be alternate types of switches such as electro-mechanical relays or PIN diode switches.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one example, variable tuning of approximately +/&#x2212;45 pF can be achieved by a configuration that uses 10 pF capacitors for capacitors <b>510</b><i>a </i>and <b>510</b><i>b</i>, a 15 pF capacitor for capacitor <b>510</b><i>c</i>, a 30 pF capacitor for capacitor <b>510</b><i>d</i>, and a 47 pF capacitor for capacitor <b>510</b><i>e</i>. Capacitors in parallel are added to determine a total capacitance. For example, using the example capacitance values given above, if all of switches <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<b>520</b><i>e </i>are open, then the total capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>501</b> is 0 pF. If only switch, <b>520</b><i>a </i>is closed, then the total capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>501</b> is 10 pF. If only switch <b>520</b><i>e </i>is closed then the total capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>501</b> is 47 pF. If all of switches <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<b>520</b><i>e </i>are closed, then the total capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>501</b> is the sum of the capacitances of capacitors <b>510</b><i>a</i>-<b>510</b><i>e </i>(112 pF in this instance). By closing different combinations of switches <b>520</b><i>a</i>-<b>520</b><i>e</i>, the value of capacitive component <b>501</b> can be set to various values between 0 pF and 112 pF. Adding this additional capacitance to a fixed capacitor in either an RTE or STE can change the total capacitance of the system, and hence adjust the tuning of the RTE or STE.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, STEs typically have a higher degree of selectivity compared to RTEs. Accordingly, in an STE, it may be desirable to utilize a variable capacitive element that increments in smaller values than a variable capacitive element used in an RTE. In some implementations, a variable capacitive element like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may use capacitors with greater capacitance, such as 20-30 pF, if variable capacitive component <b>501</b> is going to be implemented in a rotor device, and use capacitors with less capacitance, such as 5-10 pF, if variable capacitive component <b>501</b> is going to be implemented in a stator device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a stator tuning technique consistent with the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a rotor tuning technique consistent with the present disclosure. As will be described in more detail below, the methods or portions of the methods described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> can be performed either independently or concurrently. The methods of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>. To begin stator tuning as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a user of a torque measurement, such as torque measurement system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> powers on a stator device, such as stator device <b>120</b> with STE <b>420</b> (<b>601</b>). STE <b>420</b>, either automatically or upon user command, enters into a tuning mode. STE <b>420</b>, which inductively powers a rotor device, such as rotor device <b>110</b> with RTE <b>310</b>, causes the rotor device to be powered on as part of entering the tuning mode.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When initially powered on, micro-controller <b>321</b> of RTE <b>310</b> begins periodically transmitting via the LC circuit of box <b>318</b> a signature byte to STE <b>420</b>. The signature byte can be a series of bits identifiable by STE <b>420</b>. The stator device receives a signal from rotor device <b>310</b> at the LC circuitry of box <b>425</b> (<b>602</b>) and attempts to identify this signature byte within the received signal received (<b>603</b>). Signal processing module <b>426</b> can process the received signal to determine if the signature byte can be identified (<b>603</b>). If the signature byte cannot be identified within the received signal (<b>603</b>, no), then micro-controller <b>430</b> can adjust the capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>424</b> (<b>604</b>). After changing the capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>424</b>, STE <b>420</b> can continue to receive a signal from the rotor (<b>602</b>) and to identify the signature byte within the received signal (<b>603</b>). This process can repeat until STE <b>420</b> can identify the signature byte within a received signal (<b>603</b>, yes).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Upon identifying the signature byte, peak detector <b>427</b> can further determine a signal quality for the received signal and determine if the signal quality is acceptable (<b>605</b>). As discussed above, the determination of signal quality may be based on one or more characteristics of the signal received by STE <b>420</b>, or may be based on characteristics of the signal received at RTE <b>310</b> that are measured by RTE <b>310</b> and transmitted back to STE <b>420</b>. In one example, RTE <b>310</b> may measure a recovered voltage and transmit back to STE <b>420</b> an indication of the recovered voltage so that STE <b>420</b> can determine if the signal quality is at or above an acceptable level. If the signal quality is of an acceptable level (<b>605</b>, yes), then STE <b>420</b> can send a confirmation of tuning to the rotor device and enter a normal mode of operation (<b>606</b>). A signal may be deemed acceptable if, for example, peak detector <b>427</b> detects a peak for the recovered voltage that is greater than a threshold value. In other implementations, peak comparator <b>428</b> may determine which recovered voltage of a set of recovered voltages results in the largest peak value, in which case a recovered voltage might be deemed acceptable, for example, if it has the largest peak of the set. Micro-controller <b>430</b> can set variable capacitive element <b>424</b> to the capacitance value that resulted in the acceptable signal quality. The confirmation of tuning sent by STE <b>420</b> can indicate to the rotor that a desired tuning has been achieved and that the rotor may enter a normal mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the signal quality of the signal containing the signature byte is determined not to be acceptable (<b>605</b>, no), then micro-controller <b>430</b> can adjust the capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>424</b>, and STE <b>420</b> can repeat the process of receiving a signal from the rotor (<b>602</b>), attempting to a identify a signature byte (<b>603</b>), adjusting capacitance if a signature byte cannot be identified (<b>604</b>), and determining if a signal quality is acceptable (<b>605</b>) until an acceptable signal quality is found (<b>605</b>, yes), and then STE <b>420</b> can send a confirmation of tuning and enter a normal mode of operation (<b>606</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As mentioned, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a rotor tuning technique consistent with the present disclosure. A rotor device, such as rotor device <b>110</b> or <b>310</b>, can be powered on and enter a tuning mode (<b>621</b>). As discussed above, powering on of RTE <b>310</b> may be achieved, for example, by a user powering on a stator device, and the stator device inductively powering RTE <b>310</b>. Upon being powered on, rotor device <b>310</b> can enter a tuning mode in which micro-controller <b>321</b> causes a signature byte or a series of signature bytes to be transmitted via the LC circuit of box <b>318</b> (<b>622</b>). After sending the signature bytes, RTE <b>310</b> can wait a period of time to see if a confirmation of tuning is received from a stator (<b>623</b>). If RTE <b>310</b> receives a confirmation of tuning (<b>623</b>, yes), then RTE <b>310</b> can enter a normal mode of operation (<b>625</b>). If RTE <b>310</b> does not receive a confirmation of tuning within a specified period of time (<b>623</b>, no), then micro-controller <b>321</b> can adjust the capacitance of variable capacitive element <b>317</b> (<b>624</b>), and RTE <b>310</b> can transmit additional signature bytes (<b>622</b>). The process of adjusting variable capacitive element (<b>317</b>), sending signature bytes (<b>622</b>), and waiting for a confirmation of tuning (<b>623</b>) can be repeated multiple times can be repeated until a confirmation of tuning is received, and RTE <b>310</b> enters a normal mode of operation (<b>625</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The period of time RTE <b>310</b> waits to receive a confirmation of tuning may, for example, be enough time for a stator device to execute several iterations of the method described with regards to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Thus, a torque measurement system may attempt to tune the system first by stator tuning, and only if stator tuning is initially not successful does the system begin rotor tuning. Although not explicitly show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, a torque measurement system, such as system <b>100</b>, may be configured to enter an error mode if neither stator tuning or rotor tuning result in a desired overall system tuning.</p>
