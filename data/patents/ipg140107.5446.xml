<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from PCT/EP 03/03044 filed Mar. 24, 2003.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a process for the computer-implemented management of one or more target agreements with one or more parties to the agreement and a target agreement computer system for carrying out such a process. The invention further relates to a computer program product with a computer-readable medium and a computer program stored on the computer-readable medium with program coding means which are suitable for carrying out such a process when the computer program is run on a computer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Managing employee compensation plans has traditionally been done manually on spreadsheets or in-house developed applications. For large organizations, compensation plans are typically complex, involve rewards such as commissions, bonuses, splits, accelerators, draws, caps, etc. and are notoriously difficult to maintain and manage accurately. Target agreements (also called objective agreements) play an important role in modern staff management in conjunction with assessment systems. As a rule, target agreements are used within the framework of a consultation, promotion or annual interview, in which a senior person works together with an employee or a staffer (i.e., a member of staff) or colleague to set qualitative and quantitative goals which will be looked at on a one-off basis or at regular intervals (generally at yearly or half-yearly intervals, but according to recent experience at more frequent intervals) to check the extent to which the goals have been achieved. In the case of performance-related pay, an incentive payment will be made depending on the targets achieved. Obviously, this principle can also be applied to agreements between a client and a contractor, e.g., with a contractor acting on the basis of a consultancy agreement or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are already computer programs in existence for the computer-aided management and calculation of commission on the basis of input target amounts in accordance with an agreement and input actual amounts which are input after examining the degree to which targets have been met. Thus, the known computer programs are solutions in which a number of target agreements are run separately or independently of one another. In other words, known systems merely automatically perform the steps which had previously been done on paper by the parties involved in the target agreement (generally the management and employees). However, there exists a need for a more accurate target agreement system in view of complex plans to be kept, which in the prior art results in organizations and enterprises wasting money by overpaying their staff as the existing systems are not able to keep accurate track of the complex plans underlying the target agreements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast thereto, embodiments of the invention propose a process for computer-implemented management of target agreements and a target agreement computer system with one or more of the features disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, an interface is provided through which target values are imported for the purpose of a comparison of target values with actual values. The comparison of the target/actual values may be carried out in a target agreement computer system. These target values are imported, for example, from a performance target management computer system which manages central data and general and individual target values within the scope of a modern personnel management computer system (Human Capital Management&#x2014;HCM) used for so-called Management By Objectives (MBO) or from a Corporate Performance Management System in the field of strategic management. Embodiments of the invention thus makes it possible to undertake a complex comparison, which is virtually impossible in larger bodies or institutions, between individual agreements and central management decisions with which the outline conditions for the MBO forming the basis for the target agreements are defined and amended.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention can also ensure that the individual target agreements and the basis for calculating incentive payments or commissions are right up to date. Tying the functions anchored in the Human Capital Management framework to the administration of employee data thus leads to a complex performance-dependent calculation of remuneration in the target agreement system. Further, it is easier to measure/monitor the target agreements of the company and transparency is guaranteed as the party to the agreement can inspect them.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, a system is also provided that allows timely accurate collection and processing of relevant data in a complex target agreement environment. The system may provide precise and fast commission and bonus payments, and allow for back-analysis (history of achievements), interim simulations and/or forecasting (extrapolation of current status), thus leading to an improved motivation of members of staff. Further, the system may adapt to changes in calculation rules which occur often and rapidly when changes are made in an organizational structure due to changing business conditions. Thus, incentives and commissions can be better processed in a modern enterprise which has to adjust to market requirements at a heightened pace.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the interface may be constructed by means of an object type category connection or link, making it easier to connect to different systems at the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A suitable object type category preferably comprises obtaining or collecting a target value, determining the actual value, displaying the target agreements, modifying the target agreements and obtaining or collecting the remuneration base value.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, obtaining the target value involves obtaining and providing the target values of the target agreements based on a specific time span and a specific commissions contract (target agreement).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, obtaining the actual value involves obtaining and providing (making available) the actual values achieved in connection with a target agreement based on or related to a specific time span or period and a specific commissions contract.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to yet another embodiment, displaying the target agreements involves displaying the target agreements related to a specific time period in the commissions contract.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In still another embodiment, modifying the target agreements involves modifying the target agreements related to a specific time period in the commissions contract.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, obtaining the remuneration base value involves inputting the remuneration base value, which can vary for different target agreements, into the calculation module.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to yet another embodiment of the invention, standard target agreements are laid down in the target agreement system, on the basis of which individual target agreements can be produced. The personnel management system in turn contains electronic forms, so-called templates, on the basis of which employee-specific documents are generated. When a target agreement is being generated with a specific employee (i.e., a party to the agreement) an allocation is made in the form of a link between the employee-specific document of the HCM or MBO (MBO document) and the target agreement. According to one embodiment of the invention, the link may be made on the basis of an object type link or a so-called logical service. The linking of the personnel administration systems and operative systems, which are normally separated, thus makes it possible to maintain (or attend to) performance targets (or performance objectives) by means of data which will in any case be input into the MBO system (staff management system). Advantageously, the standard target agreement is maintained on a periodic basis.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively or cumulatively, the performance target data can be maintained or attended to (i.e., updated, corrected, adapted, etc.) via a dialogue device of the target agreement system, the input data affecting the MBO documents as a result of the linking of MBO documents with a target agreement or the commission agreement on which it is based. An association between an MBO document and a commission agreement is permissible precisely when the MBO document is based on a template of the MBO system which is associated with a standard target agreement of the target agreement system, which is in turn part of the standard commission contract which forms the basis for the specific commission contract. In another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the templates of the MBO system with the standard agreements of the target agreement system are therefore connected to one another by means of an object type category link or a logical service.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic block diagram representation of a target agreement system <b>10</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Computer system <b>10</b> comprises a server <b>12</b> with a central processing unit CPU <b>14</b>, a network connection <b>16</b> for connection with at least one input/output means <b>18</b>, at least one database means <b>20</b> containing target agreement and commission data relating to target agreement creation between two or more agreement parties. The target agreement system <b>10</b> further comprises an Incentive and Commissions Management (ICM) system <b>22</b>. The system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is used in the management of one or more target agreements (<b>72</b>) with one or more parties to the agreement, the target agreements (<b>72</b>) each comprising at least one performance target. A performance target is a measurable prescribed or set value to be achieved within a given or predetermined time span or period. The value is part of the agreement and might be altered during the agreement life time. At the start of the time span, an individual target agreement is defined and at the end of the time span the degree of achievement of the individual prescribed values and hence of the targets is determined (automatically or via manual input) and an incentive payment dependent thereon is calculated and distributed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a dialogue device or interface may be implemented with a computer (such as I/O device <b>18</b>) in order to attend to or update the performance target data. Further, computerized determining and output means may be provided (e.g., as part of server <b>14</b> or I/O device <b>18</b>) to analyze and output various information based on the data indicating the degree of achievement (past or present). Accordingly, target agreement system <b>10</b> may be adapted to allow for back-analysis (history of achievements), interim simulations and/or forecasting (extrapolation of current status).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, additional embodiments of the target agreement system are described in detail. The ICM system <b>22</b>, which may be advantageously embedded in a SAP R/3 environment, provides for a periodical determination of result achievements of a contracting person (e.g., staffer, employee, colleague, contributor, contractor, etc.) and subsequent incentive payment depending on the targets and results achieved. Therefore, the ICM system <b>22</b> disposes of data relating to standard contracts <b>24</b>, standard agreements <b>26</b> and (individual) commission agreements <b>28</b> by comprising a target agreement managing system <b>30</b> connected to database <b>20</b>. In particular, the ICM system <b>22</b> comprises a calculation module (not shown) in which the definition of an assessment scale for determining the degree of achievement of the prescribed values is laid down, and a remuneration module (not shown) in which the incentive payment for an assessment resulting from the assessment module is laid down.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An ICM system generally consists of three core functions, i.e., compensation management, reporting and modelling, and finds application for example in the management of incentive plans of sales staff working for large companies. However, there is a need for an automated system, according to embodiments of the present invention, which extends beyond the possibilities of known ICM systems into wider business areas to reward staff in other departments, as well as the extended business of channel and distribution partners.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an embodiment of the invention, the target agreement managing system <b>30</b> may be linked to a performance objective management system providing access to administrative data, e.g., personalized target agreements. Possible performance objective management systems are depicted on the right hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. They can comprise systems that are also embedded in the SAP R/3 environment like a Management By Objectives (MBO) system <b>50</b> and/or any other suitable component <b>52</b>, and/or any third party system <b>54</b> that is outside of the SAP environment. Linkage between the ICM system <b>22</b> and the system in which the target values for the performance target are managed may be achieved via interface and remote function call (RFC) capable functional modules, such as BADIs (Business Add-Ins) and BAPIs (Business Application Programming Interfaces), schematically illustrated at <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Appropriate tools can be used to achieve the linkage, such as the MBO standard tool or any other tool designed for the relevant system component.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The connection between the target agreement managing system <b>30</b> and the interface <b>60</b> may be advantageously provided by one or more so-called logic services <b>32</b>, which is a service tool included in the SAP ICM system (logic services may be described as &#x201c;soft&#x201d; interfaces). For this, a new object type class has to be generated in the logic services, comprising the methods <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The methods <b>100</b> may include: obtaining a target value <b>102</b>, determining the actual value <b>104</b>, displaying the target agreements <b>106</b>, modifying the target agreements <b>108</b>, and obtaining the remuneration base value <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In method <b>102</b>, the target values of the target agreements based on a specific time span and a specific commissions contract (target agreement) are obtained and provided. In particular, the target values are obtained or retrieved from the performance target management system, e.g., the MBO system. In method <b>104</b>, the actual values achieved in connection with a target agreement based on a specific time span and a specific commissions contract are obtained and provided. The actual values can also be obtained from the performance target management system, but they could also be obtained from different systems or sources. In method <b>106</b>, the target agreements in relation to a specific time span in the commissions contract are displayed. In method <b>108</b>, the target agreements in relation to a specific time span in the commissions contract are modified. Finally, in method <b>110</b>, the remuneration base value, which can vary for different target agreements, are input into the calculation module of the ICM system <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the target agreement system <b>10</b> may operate as follows. As already pointed out above, the ICM system <b>22</b> comprises a standard contract <b>24</b>, a standard (target) agreement <b>26</b> and an individual commission agreement <b>28</b>. The MBO system <b>50</b> comprises a template <b>62</b>, a criteria group <b>64</b>, a criterion <b>66</b>, a cell <b>68</b> and a column <b>70</b>. The cell <b>68</b> contains the individual data and the column <b>70</b> contains the targets.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the thin line arrows between the block diagram boxes are 1:n arrows, i.e., a single arrowhead stands for an unequivocal unambiguous relation, and a double arrowhead stands for an equivocal ambiguous relation. For example, the standard contract is the basis for a plurality of standard target agreements (double arrowhead pointing from <b>24</b> to <b>26</b>), but each of the plurality of standard target agreements is based on one and only one standard contract (single arrowhead pointing from <b>26</b> to <b>24</b>). This means that there is a 1:n relation between standard contract <b>24</b> and standard target agreement <b>26</b>. The same applies to the relation between standard contract <b>24</b> and commission agreement <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the basis of a standard target agreement <b>26</b> and a commission agreement <b>28</b>, one or more individual target agreements (ITA) <b>72</b> can be generated. Again, there is a 1:n relation between standard target agreement <b>26</b> and commission agreement <b>28</b> on the one hand, and the generated agreements <b>72</b> on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the basis of the template <b>62</b> of the MBO system <b>50</b>, an individual target agreement document <b>74</b> can be generated and assigned to an employee. Again, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is a 1:n relation between template <b>62</b> and document <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Agreement ITA <b>72</b> and document <b>74</b> are newly generated documents. They contain the criteria groups and criteria that are already set up in the template.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It shall be appreciated that up to this stage, there is no interaction between the ICM system <b>22</b> depicted at the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the MBO system <b>50</b> depicted at the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Now, according to an embodiment of the invention, an interface may be provided between the two systems, notably a logic service interface as described above, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by means of thick lined double arrows <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. The interface connection according to the invention provides an interaction and data flow between the standard agreement generation system and the individual data-containing system. In particular, there is a link between the standard agreement <b>26</b> and the template <b>62</b> so that exactly one MBO template is assigned to one ICM standard agreement. This is achieved by entering the name of a relevant MBO template in the customizing database upon generation of a standard agreement form. Any time a change occurs, the customizing data can be maintained within a short time, thus enabling a user to change relations and assignments between a plurality of documents by merely adapting the assignment between higher order documents. As is appreciated, one template which is defined for use with the ICM system can be used for a plurality of standard target agreements.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there can be several documents <b>74</b> assigned to one &#x201c;staffer&#x201d; <b>76</b> (employee, etc.). Each document contains the criteria and criteria groups already embodied in the template. All changes to performance targets will be made exclusively in the MBO system which are then again available to the ICM system, thus rendering the whole process of updating and adapting complex system data less cumbersome. Further, current (actual) data on achievements regarding performance targets entered in the MBO system is readily available for calculation of remuneration and commission payments in the ICM system.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A given MBO document <b>74</b> can be assigned to a given commission agreement on condition that the given document is based on a template which is assigned or linked to a standard target agreement which forms part of the standard commission contract being the basis for the given commission agreement. This results in an assignment of one or more MBO documents to a given commission agreement.</p>
