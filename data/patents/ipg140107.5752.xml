<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A typical user's interaction with messages received over a network is ever increasing. For example, the user may send and receive hundreds of emails and text messages in a given day. These messages may provide a wide variety of functionality. However, as the functionality that is available to the user has continued to increase, so too have the malicious uses of this functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One such example is unsolicited commercial messages, otherwise known as &#x201c;spam&#x201d;. Spam is typically thought of as a message that is sent to a large number of recipients, such as to promote a product or service. Because sending such messages generally costs the sender little or nothing, &#x201c;spammers&#x201d; have developed techniques which send the equivalent of junk mail to as many users as can be located. Even though a minute fraction of the recipients may actually desire the described product or service, this minute fraction may be enough to offset the minimal costs in sending the spam. Consequently, spammers are responsible for communicating a vast number of unwanted and irrelevant messages which may hinder a user's interaction with messages of interest.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Geo-data spam filters are described. In one or more implementations, origin and language data of a message are evaluated to establish a score for the message indicating a likelihood that the message is spam. The evaluation includes comparing the origin data and the language data of the messages to ranked lists of message origins and languages, which may be formed, for example, by tracking interactions of the respective recipient with messages that were previously delivered to the respective recipient. Based on the score established by evaluating the origin data and language data of the message, the message is then filtered for delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one or more implementations, interactions of multiple message recipients with multiple messages are tracked to form aggregated ranked lists of message origins and languages with which the multiple recipients interact positively and aggregated ranked lists of message origins and languages with which the multiple recipients interact negatively. Similarly, interactions of multiple respective recipients with a single message may be tracked. A score for the message may indicate that the message is likely to be spam, for example, if a determination is made that the multiple respective recipients interact negatively with the message. Further communications of the message can then be stopped when a score of the message indicates that it is likely to be spam.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The prevalence of user interactions with messages received over a network is ever increasing. A large part of this increase involves unsolicited messages that the user may consider irrelevant. Consequently, filtering incoming messages may be used to reduce the number of unsolicited messages that are communicated to the user, thereby promoting efficient user interaction with messages that are likely to be of interest to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Geo-data spam filters are described. In one or more implementations, messages may be filtered (e.g. not delivered to a recipient) based on data that describes an origin of the message and/or languages that correspond to the message. For example, an origin IP address of a message may correspond to a country with which the user typically does not interact. In another example, the origin IP address of the message may correspond to a country with which the user typically interacts. Messages to a particular recipient, therefore, may be filtered based on this distinction by delivering messages originating from countries with which a user typically interacts and not delivering messages from countries with which the user does not interact (or interacts negatively).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another example, a user may be familiar with at most a few languages and, therefore, typically interacts with messages written in those languages. Still further, a user typically may not interact with (or interact negatively with) messages written in languages with which the user is not familiar. Thus, messages to a particular recipient may also be filtered by delivering messages in languages with which the user is familiar and not delivering messages in languages with which the user is not familiar.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Ranked lists of message origins and/or languages can also be used by a message filtering service to filter incoming messages. For example, interactions of a user with previously delivered messages can indicate message origins and/or languages with which the user interacts positively (or negatively). The message filtering service, therefore, may form ranked lists of message origins and/or languages by tracking interactions of a user with previously delivered messages. Thus, an incoming message may be filtered for delivery by comparing the origin data and language data of the message to the ranked lists.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that may employ the techniques described herein. Example procedures are then described which may be performed in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the example procedures is not limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example procedures.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE ENVIRONMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of an environment <b>100</b> in an example implementation that is operable to employ geo-data spam filter techniques described herein. The illustrated environment <b>100</b> includes a message filtering service <b>102</b>, a computing device <b>104</b>, and a message distribution service <b>106</b> that are communicatively coupled via network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. Although a single entity is shown, respectively for the message filtering service <b>102</b>, the computing device <b>104</b>, and the message distribution service <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be readily apparent that each of these illustrated entities may also be implemented using a variety of different computing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, the message filtering service <b>102</b>, the computing device <b>104</b> and/or the message distribution service <b>106</b> may be configured as a computer that is capable of communicating over a network connection <b>110</b>, such as a desktop computer, a mobile station, an entertainment appliance, a set-top box communicatively coupled to a display device, a wireless phone, a game console, and so forth. Thus, the message filtering service <b>102</b>, the computing device <b>104</b> and/or the message distribution service <b>106</b> may range from full resource devices with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and/or processing resources (e.g., traditional set-top boxes, hand-held game consoles). Additionally, although a single computing device is shown for the message filtering service <b>102</b>, the computing device <b>104</b> and the message distribution service <b>106</b>, the computing device may be representative of a plurality of different devices, such as multiple servers utilized by a business to perform operations of the message distribution service <b>106</b>, a remote control and set-top box combination, an image capture device and a game console configured to capture gestures, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The message filtering service <b>102</b>, the computing device <b>104</b> and the message distribution service <b>106</b> may also include an entity (e.g., software) that causes hardware of the message filtering service <b>102</b>, the computing device <b>104</b> and/or the message distribution service <b>106</b> to perform operations, e.g., processors, functional blocks, and so on. For example, the message filtering service <b>102</b>, the computing device <b>104</b> and/or the message distribution service <b>106</b> may include a computer-readable medium that may be configured to maintain instructions that cause the computing device, and more particularly hardware of the computing device to perform operations. Thus, the instructions function to configure the hardware to perform the operations and in this way result in transformation of the hardware to perform functions. The instructions may be provided by the computer-readable medium to the computing device through a variety of different configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One such configuration of a computer-readable medium is signal bearing medium and thus is configured to transmit the instructions (e.g., as a carrier wave) to the hardware of the computing device, such as via network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. The computer-readable medium may also be configured as a computer-readable storage medium and thus is not a signal bearing medium. Examples of a computer-readable storage medium include a random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), an optical disc, flash memory, hard disk memory, and other memory devices that may use magnetic, optical, and other techniques to store instructions and other data.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may assume a wide variety of configurations. For example, the network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may include a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless network, a public telephone network, an intranet, the Internet, and so on. Further, network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may be configured to include multiple networks.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The message distribution service <b>106</b> includes one or more messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>), where &#x201c;m&#x201d; can be any integer from 1 to &#x201c;M&#x201d;. Messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) may take any of a variety of message formats, such as email, instant messages, short message service (SMS), voicemail, communications via a social network, and so on. The messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) are communicated from the message distribution service <b>106</b> to the message filtering service <b>102</b> over the network connection <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) communicated via the network <b>108</b> are received by the message filtering service <b>102</b> and may be stored as one or more messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>), where &#x201c;f&#x201d; may be any integer from 1 to &#x201c;F&#x201d;. The messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) may be the same as or different from the messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) received from the message distribution service <b>106</b>. The messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>), for instance, may include additional data to filter the messages for delivery to the computing device <b>104</b>, such as a score that indicates whether a particular message is likely to be spam.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The computing device <b>104</b> is illustrated as including a communication module <b>116</b>. The communication module <b>116</b> is representative of functionality of the computing device <b>104</b> to communicate via network connection <b>110</b>, such as with the message filtering service <b>102</b>. Further, the communication module <b>116</b> is representative of functionality of the computing device <b>104</b> to send and receive messages. For example, the communication module <b>116</b> may be configured to send and receive email. Email employs standards and conventions for addressing and routing such that the email may be delivered across network connections <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> utilizing a plurality of devices, such as routers, or other computing devices (e.g., email servers), and so on. In this way, emails may be transferred within a company over an intranet, across the world using the Internet, and so on. An email for instance, may include a header, text, and attachments, such as documents, computer-executable files, and so on. The header contains technical information about the source and oftentimes may describe the route the message took from the sender to the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another example, the communication module <b>116</b> may be configured to send and receive instant messages. Instant messaging provides a mechanism such that a recipient, when participating in an instant messaging session, may send text messages to other entities using the computing device <b>104</b>. The instant messages are typically communicated in real time, although delayed delivery may also be utilized, such as by logging the text messages when a recipient is unavailable, e.g., offline. Thus, instant messaging may be thought of as a combination of email and Internet chat in that instant messaging supports message exchange and is designed for two-way live chats. Therefore, instant messaging may be utilized for synchronous communication. For instance, like a voice telephone call, an instant messaging session may be performed in real-time such that each user may respond to each other user as the instant messages are received.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet another example, the communication module <b>116</b> represents functionality of the computing device <b>104</b> to communicate with the message filtering service <b>102</b> via network connection <b>110</b> in compliance with various other means for communicating messages, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). The communication module <b>116</b>, for instance, may include functionality to receive and display messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) via a browser. For example, the computing device <b>104</b> typically includes hardware and software to display messages by the illustrated display device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The message filtering service <b>102</b> is illustrated as including a message filtering module <b>118</b>. The message filtering module <b>118</b> is representative of functionality to filter messages for delivery to respective recipients. For example, message filtering module <b>118</b> of message filtering service <b>102</b> filters messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) for delivery to computing device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Message filtering module <b>118</b> may use a number of modules to filter messages for delivery. For example, the message filtering service <b>102</b> may include an evaluation module <b>120</b> and a geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> as shown. The evaluation module <b>120</b> is representative of functionality to evaluate data associated with each of the messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) and thereby establish a score for each message (e.g., a score indicating a likelihood that the message is spam). For example, the messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) provided by the message distribution service <b>106</b> may each include metadata <b>124</b>(<i>d</i>), where &#x201c;d&#x201d; may be an integer between 1 and &#x201c;D&#x201d;. In at least some implementations, the metadata <b>124</b>(<i>d</i>) may include message geo-data <b>126</b>, such as origin data and language data of the message. In this example, the evaluation module <b>120</b> may evaluate the message geo-data <b>126</b> to establish a score for each of the messages. Once the evaluation module <b>120</b> establishes a score for a particular message (e.g., a score indicating whether the message is likely to be spam), the message filtering module <b>118</b> may then filter the message for delivery. For example, if the established score of a message indicates that the message is likely to be spam, the message filtering module <b>118</b> may not have the message delivered, have the message deleted, have the message delivered to a junk folder of the recipient, or the like. If on the other hand, the established score indicates that the message is not likely to be spam, the message filtering module <b>118</b> may simply have the message delivered to a respective recipient's inbox.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The geo-data tracking module <b>122</b>, which as previously stated may be included as part of the message filtering module <b>118</b>, is representative of functionality to track interactions of message recipients with delivered messages. The tracked interactions may be used to form ranked lists that the evaluation module <b>120</b> can compare to the origin data and/or language data of a future message, and thereby establish a spam score for the message. For example, the geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> may track the interactions of a message recipient with messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) delivered to the computing device <b>104</b>. In at least some implementations, the messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) may be delivered to computing device <b>104</b> and stored in storage media <b>128</b>, such as in recipient inbox <b>130</b> of the storage media <b>128</b>. A recipient of the messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) may then interact with the messages (e.g., by reading, replying to, deleting the messages, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The computing device <b>104</b> may record actions taken by the recipient with respect to a particular message. In addition, the computing device <b>104</b> may associate origin data and language data of a particular message with actions taken by the user to form recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>), where &#x201c;g&#x201d; may be an integer between 1 and &#x201c;G&#x201d;. As illustrated, the recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) may be stored in the storage media <b>128</b> of the computing device <b>104</b>. In at least some implementations, the geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> may track the recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) and use the recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) to form ranked lists. For example, the geo-data tracking module may form ranked lists of message origins and languages with which the recipient interacts positively (e.g., origins with which the recipient typically reads, replies to, or archives messages), and ranked lists of message origins and languages with which the recipient interacts negatively (e.g., origins with which the recipient typically deletes, does not read, or moves messages to &#x201c;junk&#x201d; folders).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another example, the geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> may track recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) from multiple message recipients associated with multiple previously delivered messages to form aggregated ranked lists. For example, the geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> may form aggregated ranked lists of message origins and languages with which the multiple recipients interact positively and aggregated ranked lists of message origins and languages with which the multiple recipients interact negatively. In at least some embodiments, the evaluation module <b>120</b> can compare the origin data and/or language data of a message to the aggregated ranked lists. For example, the evaluation module <b>120</b> can compare a message's origin and/or language data to one such aggregated ranked list when a recipient does not have prior message interactions from which ranked lists of message origins and languages can be formed. In this way, aggregated ranked lists may be used as default ranked lists.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In yet another example, the geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> may track recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) from multiple message recipients with respect to a single message. In some implementations, the message filtering module may have future communications of the message stopped, such as when the recipient interactions with the one message indicate that the message is likely to be spam. For example, a message may be delivered to multiple respective recipients who interact negatively with the message (e.g., delete the message without reading). In this example, the recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) of the respective message recipients indicates the negative interactions with the message. Using the recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) from the message recipients, the evaluation module <b>120</b> may establish a score for the message indicating that the message is likely to be spam. As a result, the message filtering service <b>102</b> may stop future communications of the message (or otherwise filter the message for delivery), because the score indicates that the message is likely to be spam. In this way, negative interactions from multiple recipients with respect to a single message may cause future communications of the message to be stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, the message filtering service <b>102</b> may filter copies of a message that have already been delivered when interactions from multiple recipients with the message indicate that the message is likely to be spam. For example, the message filtering service <b>102</b> may cause the already delivered message to be deleted from a respective recipient's inbox, or moved to a junk folder of a respective recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be appreciated that a variety of different devices may be used to implement the functionality of the message filtering service <b>102</b> (e.g., to evaluate the origin data and language data of each of messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>), establish a spam score for the respective message, and filter the messages <b>114</b>(<i>f</i>) for delivery based on the score). Accordingly, the functionality represented by the evaluation module <b>120</b> and the geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> (as well as the message filtering module <b>118</b>) may be distributed across these devices. As but one example, the functionality represented by the evaluation module <b>120</b> and the geo-data tracking module <b>122</b> (as well as the message filtering module <b>118</b>) may be distributed across the message distribution service <b>106</b> and/or the computing device <b>104</b>. Further discussion of the functionality represented by the message filtering service may be found in relation to the following figure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example system <b>200</b> showing the message filtering service <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in greater detail as being in communication with the message distribution service <b>106</b> and the computing device <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> via one or more networks.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The message distribution service <b>106</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is communicatively coupled to message filtering service <b>202</b> and sends the messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) over a network e.g., via the network <b>204</b>. The messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) in the illustrated implementation are communicated in accordance with one or more protocols, such as those described above in greater detail. The message filtering service <b>202</b> may use several modules to filter and establish a score for the messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>), such as the collection of various modules in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that are illustrated as part of the message filtering service <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For instance, the score given to a particular message (e.g., the score indicating whether the message is likely to be spam), may be based on multiple characteristics. In at least some implementations, the score may be based on comparing origin data and language data of a message to ranked lists of message origins and languages. Accordingly, the message filtering service <b>202</b> may employ a message origin module <b>206</b> to extract/generate origin data for a message and a language module <b>208</b> to extract/generate origin data <b>210</b> and language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) (where &#x201c;1&#x201d; can be any integer between 1 and &#x201c;L&#x201d;) for a message.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The message origin module <b>206</b>, for instance, may determine a point of origin for a message, such as by determining an IP address of the message's sender (or by using the sender's domain, a &#x201c;from&#x201d; attribute, ASN, WHOIS, BGP, and so on). The message origin module <b>206</b> may then associate origin data <b>210</b> with the message and store corresponding data in metadata <b>124</b>(<i>d</i>) of the message. The language module <b>208</b>, on the other hand, may determine one or more languages that correspond to a particular message, such as a language in which the message is composed (or a language of the message's header). The language module <b>208</b> may then associate language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) with the message and store corresponding data in metadata <b>124</b>(<i>d</i>) of the message. In one or more implementations, the origin data and/or the language data are not stored with the messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) as metadata <b>124</b>(<i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The message filtering service <b>202</b> is illustrated as having a geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> to form ranked lists, such as ranked lists against which the origin data <b>210</b> and language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) of an incoming message can be compared. As discussed previously, a recipient's interactions with messages may be tracked (e.g., across numerous email messages). The tracked interactions can be subjected to statistical treatment to form lists that indicate how the recipient interacts with messages, such as how the recipient interacts with messages originating from particular countries (or interacts with messages that are composed in particular languages).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> can track interactions to form various origin lists <b>216</b> (<i>o</i>), where &#x201c;o&#x201d; can be any integer between 1 and &#x201c;O&#x201d;. For example, the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> can form ranked lists indicating message origins with which the recipient has positive message interactions, and/or ranked lists indicating message origins with which the recipient has negative message interactions. Similarly, the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> can be used to form various language lists <b>218</b>(<i>n</i>), where &#x201c;n&#x201d; can be any integer between 1 and &#x201c;N&#x201d;. The language lists <b>218</b>(<i>n</i>) may include, for instance, ranked lists indicating languages with which the recipient has positive message interactions, and/or ranked lists indicating languages with which the recipient has negative message interactions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> may rank the origin lists <b>216</b>(<i>o</i>) and the language lists <b>218</b>(<i>n</i>) to help establish a score for a message that indicates whether the message is likely to be spam. For example, the lists may be ranked according to volumes, such as the number of interactions (e.g., positive or negative interactions) with messages received from a particular origin or in a particular language. In addition or alternatively, the lists may be ranked according to percentages, such as by a percentage of message interactions (e.g., positive or negative) from a particular origin or in a particular language.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A recipient, for example, may receive twenty (20) messages from country &#x201c;X&#x201d; and interact positively with ten (10) of those messages (e.g., reading the messages, replying to the messages, etc.). In this example, the recipient may also receive seven (7) messages from country &#x201c;Y&#x201d; and interact positively with all seven (7) of those messages. Further, the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> can form a ranked list that indicates positive interactions with various message origins that is ranked according to volume. In this example, the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> could rank country &#x201c;X&#x201d; ahead of country &#x201c;Y&#x201d; because the recipient had ten (10) positive interactions with messages from country &#x201c;X&#x201d; and seven (7) positive interactions with messages from country &#x201c;Y&#x201d;. In addition or alternatively, geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> can form a ranked list that indicates positive interactions with various message origins that is ranked according to a percentage of positive interactions with the messages received. In this example, the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> could rank country &#x201c;Y&#x201d; ahead of country &#x201c;X&#x201d; because the recipient had positive interactions with one-hundred percent (100%) of the messages from country &#x201c;Y&#x201d; and positive interactions with only fifty-percent (50%) of the messages from country &#x201c;X&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To form the ranked lists, the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> may use the interactions of multiple message recipients with multiple messages. The message filtering service is illustrated as including a geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b> to track recipient interactions with delivered messages. For example, the geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b> may collect recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) from computing devices as described above in. The geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b> may then use the data collected from the computing devices to track the interactions of the multiple respective message recipients with the messages delivered to the recipients. The geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b>, can be communicatively coupled to the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b>, and thereby communicate the tracked recipient interactions to the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b>. The geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> can then use the tracked interactions to form the ranked lists (e.g., origin lists <b>216</b>(<i>o</i>) and/or language lists <b>218</b>(<i>n</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The message filtering service <b>202</b> is also illustrated as including an evaluation module <b>222</b> and a scoring module <b>224</b>, which are representative of functionality to evaluate origin data and language data of a message to establish a score for the message that indicates a likelihood that the message is spam. The evaluation module <b>222</b>, for instance, may determine to use origin data <b>210</b> and language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) of the message to establish the spam score for the message. The origin data <b>210</b> and the language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) of the message may be chosen from a number of factors that can be used to establish a spam score for a message. In at least some implementations, the evaluation module <b>222</b> may determine to use the origin data <b>210</b> and language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) exclusively, or along with other factors to establish the spam score for the message.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The evaluation module <b>222</b> is also representative of functionality to receive origin data <b>210</b> and language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) of a message from the message origin module <b>206</b> and the language module <b>208</b> respectively. With this data, the evaluation module <b>222</b> can compare the origin data <b>210</b> and the language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) of the message to origin lists <b>216</b>(<i>o</i>) and language lists <b>218</b>(<i>n</i>) from the geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b> (e.g., ranked lists associated with the message's respective recipient or aggregated from multiple recipients).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another example, the evaluation module <b>222</b> can compare the origin data <b>210</b> and the language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) of a message addressed to multiple recipients to the ranked lists of those recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The scoring module <b>224</b> is representative of functionality to establish a score for an incoming message that indicates whether the message is likely to be spam. For example, the scoring module may establish a score for a message indicating that the message is likely to be spam, such as when an evaluation of the a message's origin data and/or the language data reveals that the origin data and/or the language data correspond to a message origin or language with which the recipient interacts negatively (or correspond to a message origin or language with which the recipient has not yet interacted). In addition or alternatively, the scoring module <b>224</b> may establish a score for a message addressed to multiple recipients indicating that the message is likely to be spam when the message origin data and/or language data correspond to a message origin or language with which the multiple recipients generally interact negatively (or do not generally interact).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the scoring module may establish a score for the message indicating that the message is not likely to be spam even though the origin data and/or language data correspond to a message origin or language with which the recipient interacts negatively. For example, the evaluation module <b>222</b> may determine to evaluate factors in addition to origin data and language data to determine whether a message is likely to be spam. In this example, the scoring module <b>224</b> may establish a score indicating that the message is not likely to be spam when those other factors indicate that the recipient may interact positively with the message (e.g., when those other factors outweigh the origin data and the language data).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once a spam score is established for a message, the message can be filtered for delivery based on the score. Message filtering service <b>202</b> is illustrated as including a delivery module <b>226</b> and a filtering module <b>228</b> which are representative of functionality to filter and deliver messages to message recipients. For example, the filtering module <b>228</b> may direct the delivery module <b>226</b> not to deliver a message having a score that indicates that the message is likely to be spam. In one or more implementations, the filtering module <b>228</b> may have the message deleted, direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to deliver the message to a junk folder of the recipient, and so on. In addition, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to deliver a message to an inbox of a recipient (e.g., recipient inbox <b>130</b> on computing device <b>104</b>), such as when the score for the message indicates that the message is not likely to be spam.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another example, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to stop future communications of a message, such as when multiple recipients that have already received the message interact negatively with the message. For example, geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b> may track multiple negative interactions of multiple recipients with a particular delivered message. Consequently, the evaluation module <b>222</b> and the scoring module <b>224</b> can update the score of the message to indicate that recipients are typically interacting negatively with the message, such as by updating the score to indicate that the message is likely to be spam. Then, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to filter (e.g., not deliver) the message to recipients that have not yet received the message based on the updated score.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In yet another example, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to stop future communications of messages from a particular origin or in a particular language based on different previously delivered messages. For example, the filtering module <b>228</b> may direct the delivery module <b>226</b> not to deliver incoming messages with particular origin data, such as messages that originate from an IP address or country that is known to be an origin of spam. Likewise, the filtering module <b>228</b> may direct the delivery module <b>226</b> not to deliver incoming messages with particular language data, such as when the recipient (or group of recipients) has interacted negatively with previous messages in the particular language and has not interacted positively with previous messages in the language.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE PROCEDURES</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The following discussion describes geo-data spam filter techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to the environment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a procedure in an example implementation in which origin data and language data of a message are evaluated to filter the message for delivery to a respective recipient by a message filtering service <b>202</b>. Interactions of multiple message recipients with messages delivered prior to a current message are tracked (block <b>302</b>). For example, message filtering service <b>202</b> may deliver prior messages to a recipient, such as a recipient using computing device <b>104</b>. The message filtering service <b>202</b>, such as by leveraging the functionality of the geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b>, may track the interactions of the recipient with each of the prior messages. Further, the recipient's interaction(s) with a particular message (e.g., read, reply to, delete, etc.) may tracked along with origin data and/or language data of the message, and stored as recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The tracked interactions can be used to form ranked lists of message origins and languages (block <b>304</b>). The geo-data/interaction list forming module <b>214</b>, for instance, may use recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) to form origin lists <b>216</b>(<i>o</i>) and language lists <b>218</b>(<i>n</i>), such as ranked lists indicating message origins and languages with which the recipient interacts positively (and lists indicating message origins and languages with which the recipient interacts negatively). In another example, the tracked interactions from multiple recipients can be used to form aggregated ranked lists. These aggregated ranked lists may be used by the evaluation module <b>222</b> as default lists, such as when a recipient does not have prior message interactions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An incoming current message is received from a message distribution service (block <b>306</b>), such as when message filtering service <b>202</b> receives messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) from the message distribution service <b>106</b> over network <b>204</b>. After receiving a message, languages that correspond to the message can be determined, such as by the language module <b>208</b> of the message filtering service <b>202</b>. As discussed in more detail above, the language module <b>208</b> can extract/generate language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) for an incoming message. Additionally, an origin of a message (e.g., a respective sender's IP address) can be determined, such as by the message origin module <b>206</b> of the message filtering service <b>202</b>. As discussed in more detail above, the message origin module can extract/generate origin data <b>210</b> for the message.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Upon receipt of a message, the origin data and language data of the message is evaluated, using the ranked lists, to establish a score for the message (block <b>308</b>). The evaluation module <b>222</b>, for instance, may compare origin data <b>210</b> and language data <b>212</b>(<b>1</b>) from messages <b>112</b>(<i>m</i>) to the origin lists <b>216</b>(<i>o</i>) and language lists <b>218</b>(<i>n</i>) to establish a score for each of the messages that indicates whether the message is likely to be spam.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the evaluation module <b>222</b> may determine to use origin data and language data of incoming messages in addition to other factors (or to the exclusion of other factors) to establish spam scores for the messages. In this way, the score established by the scoring module <b>224</b> may indicate that a message is not likely to be spam, although the origin data and/or the language data of the message correspond to a message origin or language with which the recipient interacts negatively. For example, when the evaluation module <b>222</b> determines to use the origin data and language data (which correspond to an origin and/or language with which the recipient interacts negatively), as well as other factors (which indicate that the message is not likely to be spam), and the other factors outweigh the origin data and language data, the scoring module <b>224</b> may establish the spam score to indicate that the message is not likely to be spam.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the score of a message is established, the message is filtered for delivery to a respective recipient of the message (block <b>310</b>). For example, when the scoring module <b>224</b> establishes a score for a message indicating that the message is likely to be spam, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> not to deliver the message to the message recipient. Similarly, the filtering module <b>228</b> may direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to delete the message or to deliver the message to a junk message folder of the recipient. However, when the scoring module <b>224</b> establishes a score for a message indicating that the message is not likely to be spam, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to deliver the message to the respective recipient's inbox, such as recipient inbox <b>130</b> of computing device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a procedure in an example implementation in which future communications of a message are filtered by a message filtering service <b>202</b> based on interactions of message recipients who have already received the message. In one or more implementations, a message that has been filtered for delivery to multiple respective recipients is delivered based on a score established to indicate whether the message is likely to be spam (block <b>402</b>). For example, message filtering service <b>202</b>, such as by leveraging the functionality of the evaluation <b>222</b> and scoring module <b>224</b>, evaluates a message to establish a score for the message indicating whether the message is likely to be spam. Then, prior to delivery of the message, the message filtering service <b>202</b>, such as by leveraging the functionality of the filtering module <b>228</b>, filters the message for delivery based on the score. The delivery module <b>226</b> may then deliver the filtered message to one or more respective recipients of the message.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The interactions of the multiple respective recipients with the delivered message are tracked (block <b>404</b>). For example, geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b> tracks interactions of the recipients with the message (e.g., read, reply to, delete, etc.), such as by using recipient geo-data <b>132</b>(<i>g</i>) from the multiple recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Once the interactions of recipients having received the message are tracked, the score of the message is updated to indicate the interactions of the respective recipients with the message (block <b>406</b>). For example, a message may be delivered to multiple recipients because the score initially established for the message indicates that the message is not likely to be spam. However, the tracked interactions of the recipients with the message may be generally negative. As described in more detail above, these interactions may be tracked by the geo-data/interaction tracking module <b>220</b>. Using the tracked interactions, the score of the message may be updated to reflect the negative interactions by the recipients, for instance, by the evaluation module <b>222</b> and the scoring module <b>224</b> to indicate that the message is likely to be spam.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the score for a message is updated to reflect the interactions of recipients that have already received the message, future communications of the message can be filtered based on the updated score of the message (block <b>408</b>). In the example discussed just above, for instance, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> not to deliver future communications of the message when the updated score indicates that the message is likely to be spam. Likewise, the filtering module <b>228</b> can direct the delivery module <b>226</b> to delete future communications of the message, or send the message directly to a junk folder of the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some implementations, the filtering module <b>228</b> may filter already delivered copies of a message, the score of which has been updated to reflect the interactions of recipients who have received the message. For example, the filtering module <b>228</b> may cause the already delivered copies of the message to be deleted from respective recipients' inboxes, or moved to junk folders of the respective recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, future communication of messages can be filtered (block <b>410</b>). For example, the interactions of recipients with a previously sent message having particular origin data and language data may be tracked. As described above, a score for the message may be updated to indicate, for instance, that the message is likely to be spam. In the future, different messages that have the same origin data and/or language data as the previously sent message may be received by the message filtering service <b>202</b>. The message filtering service <b>202</b> may filter these different messages for delivery, such as by utilizing the functionality of the delivery module <b>226</b> and the filtering module <b>228</b> to stop delivery of the different messages.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, these further communications may be filtered by assigning a negative spam score to a sender of the email. Thus, in this instance, the spam score assigned to the sender may be used to filter regardless of the origin or language data. Other implementations are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Conclusion</p>
