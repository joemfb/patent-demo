<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Perfluoroelastomers have achieved outstanding commercial success and are used in a wide variety of applications in which severe environments are encountered, in particular those end uses where exposure to high temperatures and aggressive chemicals occurs. For example, these polymers are often used in seals for aircraft engines, in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, in oil-well drilling devices, and in sealing elements for industrial equipment used at high temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The outstanding properties of perfluoroelastomers are largely attributable to the stability and inertness of the copolymerized perfluorinated monomer units that make up the major portion of the polymer backbones in these compositions. Such monomers include tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and perfluoro(alkyl vinyl)ethers (PAVE). In order to develop elastomeric properties fully, perfluoroelastomers are typically crosslinked, i.e. vulcanized. To this end, a small percentage of cure site monomer is copolymerized with the perfluorinated monomer units. Cure site monomers containing at least one nitrile group, for example perfluoro-8-cyano-5-methyl-3,6-dioxa-1-octene, are especially preferred. Such compositions are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,281,092; 4,394,489; 5,789,489; and 5,789,509.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The polymerization processes of perfluoroelastomers are most typically done in the presence of a perfluoro carboxylic acid salt or fluorinated sulfonic acid salt. If the salt contains a metal ion, it contaminates the formed polymer. If the salt is a non-metal, usually the resulting pH of the polymerization media is acidic leading to corrosion of polymerization vessel or downstream lines and vessels, and subsequent contamination of the resulting polymer. Further, coagulation of the emulsion or dispersion is usually accomplished by use of magnesium, barium, or other metallic salts resulting in two distinct problems. First, they add metallic contamination to the elastomeric crumb and second, the metallic salts of the perfluoro carboxylic acids become much more difficult to remove from the crumb.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The prior art further teaches compounding the perfluorelastomer, for example, on a roll mill, Banbury mixer, extruder, or the like. In this step, crosslinking catalysts or other additives may be mixed with the perfluoroelastomer crumb in the melt to facilitate sufficient crosslinking as may be required by the application. For example, one goal may be to attain sufficient crosslinking to achieve good high temperature compression set resistance. Compounding may actually result in the addition of metallic and/or other contaminants by the direct addition via additives; additionally high temperature melt compounding often results in metal contamination by corrosion of the compounding equipment and exposure to environmental contamination. If organic crosslinking agents are used, the resulting articles are usually brown due to thermal decomposition of the agents.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Perfluoroelastomer articles such as seals, O-rings, and valve packings are often highly filled with carbon black or metallic fillers for reinforcement rendering them opaque and providing an additional source of contamination. When exposed to plasmas in end uses such as semiconductor manufacturing, the polymeric component of these articles is etched away, leaving the fillers as undesirable particle contaminants. Furthermore, as the polymer decomposes any fillers such as metals, metal oxides or metal salts originally contained in articles may be released.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recent patents of Saito et al. and Coughlin and Wang (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,512, and WO 02/48200) have discussed the value of producing clear and pure perfluoroelastomer parts with low metal ion contamination. Market forces that are driving the move to clear, clean perfluoroelastomer parts include both the semi conductor industry and the pharmaceutical industry which desires extremely low concentrations of metals. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries desire overall purity and elimination of certain perfluoro carboxylic acids which accumulate in the body is highly desirable. For example, some companies manufacturing fluoropolymer resins or parts have established limits of perfluoro octanoic acid (PFOA), the acid form of ammonium perfluoro octanoate (APFO) which is a common surfactant used in fluoromonomer emulsion polymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the need for crosslinkable perfluoroelastomers and crosslinked parts that have a low metallic ion contamination and a low perfluoro carboxylic concentration has not been met with the usual processes of forming these. Therefore, one embodiment of the present invention is a method for producing perfluoroelastomer compositions having low metallic ion contamination and low perfluoro carboxylic concentration.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This invention relates to crosslinkable perfluoroelastomers and cured perfluoroelastomer articles having low metallic ion concentration and a low concentration of residual fluorosurfactant, and inventive processes for making the same. In the absence of additives, transparent articles having high purity are produced by the methods of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, methods of the present invention minimize contamination in part by minimizing corrosion that results from conventional polymerization processes performed in the presence of perfluorocarboxylic acid salt by using a non-metallic buffer and/or corrosion resistant vessel and/or lines. Corrosion resistant materials useful in the present invention include high Ni alloys, for example, INCONEL&#xae; alloys or HASTELLOY&#xae; alloys. Processes of present invention may also solve the problem of contamination encountered by coagulation of the emulsion or dispersion using metallic salts. For example, by using nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) or ammonium salts like (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>and NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3 </sub>as coagulants, metallic contamination can be minimized or eliminated. Known methods for curing elastomeric resin may result in contamination by using compounding steps that add metallic and/or other contaminants, or by corrosion of the compounding equipment, or exposure to environmental contamination. It has been unexpectedly discovered that perfluoroelastomeric uncrosslinked gum, having a low concentration of perfluoro carboxylic acids or salt containing perfluoro cyano vinyl ether crosslink sites, such as 8-CNVE, can be cured in the mold at about 250&#xb0; C., or greater than 250&#xb0; C., without a compounding step and without the addition of any other chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Combining these inventive steps results in the production of crosslinked perfluoro elastomer parts having metallic ion contamination more than a factor of 100 or a factor of 1000 lower than currently known. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention crosslinked perfluoroelastomeric parts are produced having less than about 3 parts per million (ppm) or more preferably, less than about 0.5 ppm metallic ion. The concentration of perfluoro carboxylic acid also may be less than about 2 ppm, or less than about 1 ppm. Advantageously, crosslinked parts of the present invention may have compression set values measuring less than or equal to about 35% at about 200&#xb0; C. Preferred crosslinked parts are transparent and colorless.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">After polymerization to form crosslinkable terpolymers of the present invention, the gum may be further processed with a finishing step as described in Example 1 below which may facilitate the elimination of some contaminants.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the highly pure crosslinkable terpolymers have low metal ion content (or metal contamination), as well as low fluorosurfactant concentration. The metal content of the crosslinkable terpolymer is less than 200 ppm, and preferably less than 3000 parts per billion (ppb), also preferred less than about 2000 ppb, further preferred less than about 1000 ppb, more preferably less than about 500, and most preferably less than about 200 ppb when measured according to the methods described herein for determining metal content.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention is further directed to a process for making highly pure crosslinked perfluoroelastomeric articles. One embodiment of the present invention comprises a method comprising heating a composition comprising a crosslinkable terpolymer consisting essentially of TFE, PAVE, and nitrile-containing cure-site monomer units, to form highly pure crosslinked composition to which no crosslinking agents have been added. One method comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">1) forming a composition comprising a crosslinkable perfluoroelastomeric terpolymer of the present invention consisting essentially of a) TFE, b) PAVE, and c) nitrile-containing cure site monomer;</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">2) shaping the crosslinkable perfluoroelastomeric terpolymer composition;</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">3) heating said shaped perfluoroelastomeric terpolymer composition, and</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">4) crosslinking the perfluoroelastomer terpolymer by heating,</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">wherein the process is performed without adding or, in the absence of, a crosslinking agent.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method of the present invention may include shaping by molding or other fabrication techniques by means that do not introduce significant metallic contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the method comprises heating and crosslinking the terpolymer having units with nitrile-containing cure sites in the absence of, or without the addition of, one or more crosslinking agents, until sufficient crosslinking is achieved. Crosslinking agents including coagents, catalysts, and the like (such as peroxides, isocyanurates, ammonia-generating compounds, and bisamidoxime) that are typically used for curing crosslinkable polymers, impart contaminants, and are not necessary for crosslinking terpolymers using the novel methods of the present invention. The exclusion of these crosslinking agents from the method of the present invention results in crosslinked compositions having higher purity than achieved by currently known methods. Preferred crosslinked perfluoroelastomers are translucent or transparent after heating.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the method comprises heating and crosslinking shaped perfluoroelastomer to greater than or equal to about 250&#xb0; C. in the absence, or without the addition of crosslinking agents or additives, until sufficient crosslinking is achieved; in a further embodiment, the method comprises heating to greater than or equal to about 300&#xb0; C., in the absence of, or without the addition of, crosslinking agents. Heating and crosslinking are maintained at temperatures and for times sufficient to cure the terpolymer to a desired level. In a further embodiment, the heating and crosslinking are continued for times and temperatures necessary to obtain a specific compression set. For example, the method comprises heating and crosslinking until a crosslinked terpolymer or shaped article is formed having a compression set of less than or equal to about 50% when tested at about 200&#xb0; C. according to the method described herein. In other embodiments the method comprises heating and crosslinking until a crosslinked terpolymer or shaped article has a compression set of less than or equal to about 40%, less than or equal to about 35%, less than or equal to about 30%, or less than or equal to about 10% when tested at about 200&#xb0; C. according to the method used herein, and described below. A crosslinkable terpolymer composition may be heated, for example, for about 30 minutes or greater, or for about 60 minutes or greater, at a temperature of greater than about 250&#xb0; C. or greater than or equal to about 300&#xb0; C., to achieve these properties. Preferred crosslinked compositions of the present invention have a compression set less than or equal to about 40%, and more preferably less than or equal to about 35%, when tested at about 200&#xb0; C. according to the method described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For use in evaluating the crosslinked compositions, compression set is measured according to ASTM D 395-01 Method B, at approximately 25% deflection, for about 70 hours in air. Articles are taken off from the testing device and reheated to the testing temperature for one (1) hour and measured.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Articles made from the perfluoroelastomer terpolymer of the present invention are useful in applications requiring higher purity than can be obtained by currently known methods. A few uses of articles formed from compositions of the present invention include gaskets such as o-rings, tubes, diaphragms, seals and the like. Crosslinkable terpolymers of the present invention may be shaped and cured directly into usable articles.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further embodiment of the present invention the crosslinkable terpolymers may be blended with other materials, such as an additive or filler, to impart or enhance desired properties, or, further, other monomer or polymer compositions. Thus, in one embodiment a blend is formed comprising a composition comprising a crosslinkable fluoroelastomer terpolymer consisting essentially of TFE, PAVE and CNVE, and from about 1-20 wt %, based on the composite weight of at least one additional material selected from fillers and additives, which may be added prior to shaping or forming the composite into an article. For example, one such composite of the present invention is formed having a filler comprising SiO<sub>2</sub>, and preferably, where PAVE comprises PMVE, PEVE, or PPVE and CNVE comprises 8-CNVE. Crosslinkable fluoroelastomer terpolymer composites may have a metal content of less than about 3000 ppb, less than about 2000 ppb, less than 1000 ppb, less than 500 ppb, or less than 200 ppb. Preferred composites, when crosslinked, have a compression set of less than 50%, less than 40% or less than 30%, when tested at 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one other embodiment of the present invention, composites are formed from a blend comprising 1) a composition comprising a crosslinkable terpolymer consisting essentially of TFE, PAVE, and nitrile-containing cure site monomer units, such as the terpolymers of the present invention described above, and 2) functionalized polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). At least one additional material selected from fillers and additives may be added. Composites of functionalized PTFE and crosslinkable fluoroelastomer terpolymers also may have a metal content of less than about 3000 ppb, less than about 2000 ppb, less than 1000 ppb, less than 500 ppb, or less than 200 ppb. Preferred composites, when crosslinked, have a compression set of less than 50%, less than 40% or less than 30%, when tested at 150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The blends may be formed from an emulsion mixture of the crosslinkable terpolymers. In one embodiment, an emulsion mixture comprises an emulsion of a composition comprising a crosslinkable perfluoroelastomer terpolymer consisting essentially of units of TFE, PAVE, and perfluorocyano vinyl ether (CNVE), and a dispersion of at least one additional material selected from fillers and additives. In one embodiment the emulsion of the composition comprising the terpolymer is a microemulsion, and the at least one additional material comprises a dispersion of silica. Preferred terpolymers comprise units of PMVE, PPVE, or PEVE, and 8-CNVE. Methods for forming the emulsions are taught, for example, in the detailed examples herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one other embodiment, an emulsion mixture comprises an emulsion of i) an emulsion comprising the crosslinkable perfluoroelastomer terpolymers of the present invention consisting essentially of units of TFE, PAVE, and CNVE, and ii) a PTFE polymer comprising 0.1-3 mol % perfluorocyano vinyl ether. Preferred terpolymers comprise units of PMVE, PPVE, or PEVE, and 8-CNVE. Methods for forming the emulsions are taught, for example, in the detailed examples herein. Microemulsions and nanoemulsions of functionalized PTFE having particle sizes of less than about 100 nm are preferred. A nano emulsion comprising PTFE polymer functionalized with perfluorocyano vinyl ether, most preferably 8-cyano vinyl ether, and having a particle size of from about 10 nm to 100 nm is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The emulsion mixtures of the present invention may be coagulated to form the blends. For example, one blend of the present invention comprising functionalized PTFE and crosslinkable perfluoroelastomer terpolymer is coagulated to form a functionalized PTFE-filled crosslinkable perfluoroelastomer terpolymer blend, as described herein. The functionalized PTFE may be present in an amount of about 1 to 20 wt % of a dried composite resulting from the emulsion mixture, and the crosslinkable perfluoroelastomer terpolymer in an amount of about 80-99 wt % of a dried composite resulting from the emulsion mixture. The functionalized PTFE-filled crosslinkable terpolymer blend may be crosslinked according to the methods described herein, including heating and crosslinking the blend in the absence of any crosslinking agent, to form a cured functionalized PTFE-filled polymer having properties such as a desired level of crosslinking, compression set and purity values as described previously herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The blends may further comprise at least one additional material such as fillers and additives to impart specifically desired properties to the composite. The at least one additional material comprises about 1 to 20 wt % of the composite, and in one embodiment it is added as a dispersion to an emulsion mixture. In one embodiment silica is added as a dispersion to the microemulsions or the emulsion mixture. In one embodiment, it is desired to add at least one additional material to a functionalized PTFE-filled terpolymer blend prior to shaping, heating and crosslinking the article.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The methanolic HCl derivitization method is used to change the APFO form from the salt or carboxylic acid into its methylester derivative. This form is easily analyzed via Gas Chromatography (GC).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The APFO in about 1 g polymer is extracted and derivitized into 10 ml Methanolic HCl (Part # 33050-U, Supelco) over two hours at 55&#xb0; C. The derivative mixture is then combined with 20 ml of half saturated NaCl/aqueous solution (98+%, Sigma Aldrich) and 10 ml n-Hexane (99+%, Sigma Aldrich). The derivative is extracted into the Hexane layer, which is then removed for GC analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The GC analysis is performed splitless using a non-polar column and an Electron Capture Detector (Examples 2, 3 and 4) or Flame Ionization Detector (Examples 5, 6 and 7).</p>

Different compression set values can be obtained when tested specimens are taken off from the testing device at different temperatures. To avoid this issue, tested specimens taken off from the testing device were reheated to the testing temperature for 1 hour, and then measured according to ASTM D 395-01, i.e., cooling for 30 minutes, etc. The compression set value is given in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As the reaction pressure decreased to 1800 KPa, 20 g TFE was charged into the reactor within 1 minute. Another 20 g TFE was added into the reactor within 1 minute as the reaction pressure decreased to 1600 KPa. The polymerization reaction was stopped after 465 minutes from the initiation of the reaction under 730 KPa. The reactor was cooled and the residual gas was purged. The emulsion latex containing 17.4 wt % solids was obtained. The polymer had 58.7 mol % TFE, 38.2 mol % PMVE and 3.1 mol % 8-CNVE, as determined by solid-state <sup>19</sup>F NMR.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Approximately 1700 g DI water, 300 g 20 wt % APFO aqueous solution, 45 g hexafluorobenzene (HFB) and 3.5 g 8-CNVE [CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CF&#x2014;O&#x2014;(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)&#x2014;CN] were charged into an oxygen-free 4-liter reactor. Then, 130 g TFE was added into the reactor. The reactor was then heated to 70&#xb0; C. under 1200 KPa and the polymerization reaction was initiated by feeding 200.5 g APS aqueous solution (0.5 g APS dissolved in 200 g DI water) within 3 minutes. About 820 g TFE was fed into the reactor to keep a constant pressure of 1200 KPa within 322 minutes. The reactor was cooled and the residual gas was purged. A nano emulsion latex containing 24.2 wt % solids was obtained. The average size of PTFE particles was 19.4 nm in diameter measured by dynamic light scattering (90 Plus, Brookhaven Instruments). The polymer had 99.9 mol % TFE and 0.1 mol % 8-CNVE, as determined by solid-state <sup>19</sup>F NMR.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Approximately 100 g of the terpolymer emulsion was mixed with 14.4 g of the nano PTFE emulsion. The emulsion mixture was coagulated with 5 ml nitric acid (70%, ACS reagent, Aldrich). The liquids were decanted and then the precipitated material was immersed in 100 ml methanol (99.9%, PRA grade, Aldrich) for 24 hours at room temperature. Then, the methanol was decanted and the material was washed with 100 ml methanol. The methanol was decanted and the washed material was dried at 70&#xb0; C. for 48 hours in a convection oven forming a functionalized nano PTFE-filled polymer composite. The APFO residual detected in the dried polymer was less than 2 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The functionalized nano PTFE-filled polymer was molded into AS-568A K214 O-rings heating at 300&#xb0; C. and 1727 psi for 30 minutes and then postcured in air at 250&#xb0; C. for 24 hours. The O-rings made were transparent. The compression set value is given in Table 3.</p>
