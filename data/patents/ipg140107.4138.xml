<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefits of Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-288141 filed in Japan on Nov. 10, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a wide angle optical system and an image pickup apparatus using the same. Especially, this invention relates to a small wide angle optical system which is favorable for photographing an object which is located at a relatively close position and relates to an image pickup apparatus using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As cellular phones, mobile terminals, and notebook computers have become thinner recently, the thin apparatuses require a camera module which is thinned in the direction of the length along the optical axis of the optical system to the utmost limit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to meet the requirement, a large number of single-focus optical systems which are composed of about two or three aspherical lenses have been proposed for the purpose of using the single-focus optical systems for a camera module.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is also a proposal to use for a camera module an image pickup element which has been developed in recent years and the sensitivity of which is not deteriorated by light which is slantingly incident on the periphery of the image pickup element. The use of such image pickup element for a camera module makes it possible to bring an exit pupil position of an optical system near to the image pickup element, so that it is possible to shorten the total length of the optical system by the use of the image pickup element. As a result, it is possible to thin the camera module. This is the reason why the use of such image pickup element for a camera module has been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Kokai No. 2007-3768, Japanese Patent Kokai No. 2007-47513, and Japanese Patent Kokai No. 2007-58153 disclose an optical system which is composed of three lenses and in which an exit pupil position is nearer to an image pickup element, as one example of such optical systems. The optical system which is disclosed in the patent literatures is made as a telephoto type optical system in which a positive lens, a negative lens, and a negative lens are arranged in order from the object side of the optical system, with the aim of shortening the total length of the optical system more.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A wide angle optical system according to the present invention is characterized in that: the wide angle optical system comprises, in order from the object side, an aperture stop, a first lens with positive refracting power, a second lens with negative refracting power, and a third lens; both surfaces of the third lens are an aspherical surface in which refracting power varies in accordance with distance from the optical axis in such a way that the both surfaces have a convex shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the optical axis and have a concave shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the outer circumference of the lens; and the following conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied:

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Before undertaking the description of the embodiments of a wide angle optical system of the present invention and an image pickup apparatus using the same, the operation and effects by the formations of the present invention will be explained. In the present invention, a lens the paraxial focal length of which has a positive value is treated as a positive lens, and a lens the paraxial focal length of which has a negative value is treated as a negative lens.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A wide angle optical system of the present invention comprises, in order from the object side, an aperture stop, a first lens with positive refracting power, a second lens with negative refracting power, and a third lens.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When a telephoto type optical system becomes wide angle, the incident angle of an off-axis principal ray incident on the image pickup surface of an image pickup element arranged on the image side of the telephoto type optical system will become larger. As a result, the sensitivity of the image pickup element deteriorates on the periphery of the image pickup element. However, when an aperture stop is arranged at the object side than every lens as in the wide angle optical system of the present invention, the exit pupil can be kept away from the image surface, so that it is possible to decrease the angle of incidence of light ray which is incident on the periphery of the image pickup element. As a result, it is possible to avoid the deteriorating sensitivity on the periphery of the image pickup element.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, the wide angle optical system according to the present invention is formed so as to satisfy the following condition (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2.2<i>&#x3c;d</i><sub>2</sub><i>/d</i><sub>3</sub>&#x3c;7&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where d<sub>2 </sub>is the thickness of the first lens on the optical axis, and d<sub>3 </sub>is a space distance between the first and second lenses on the optical axis.
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The condition (1) is used for prescribing the position of the image-side surface of the first lens. If d<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>3 </sub>is below the lower limit value of the condition (1), the image-side surface of the first lens becomes too near to the object-side surface of the first lens, so that the difference between the heights of light rays in the two surfaces of the first lens becomes small. As a result, it is impossible to correct an aberration well, and especially, it is impossible to correct a coma well in an optical system having a wide range of image heights like a wide angle optical system according to the present invention. On the other hand, if d<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>3 </sub>is beyond the upper limit value of the condition (1), the image-side surface of the first lens becomes too distant from the object-side surface of the first lens, so that it is impossible to correct well an axial aberration in consideration for aberrations occurring in the surfaces of the other lenses except the first lens. In addition, the image-side surface of the first lens becomes too near to the object-side surface of the second lens in this case, so that it is impossible to correct an aberration related to a principal ray such as a field curvature and an astigmatism, and an aberration such as a coma, with the corrections for the aberrations well-balanced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is more preferable if the wide angle optical system of the present invention is formed so as to satisfy the following condition (1)&#x2032; instead of the condition (1):

</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also, the wide angle optical system according to the present invention is formed in such a way that: both surfaces of the third lens are an aspherical surface in which refracting power varies in accordance with distance from the optical axis in such a way that the both surfaces have a convex shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the optical axis and have a concave shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the outer circumference of the lens; and the following condition (2) is satisfied:

where f is a focal length of the whole of the wide angle optical system and f<sub>3 </sub>is a focal length of the third lens.
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The above-described shapes of both surfaces of the third lens and the condition (2) satisfied by the wide angle optical system make it possible to put the principal point at a position on the object side of the optical system without negating the effect of the second lens with negative refracting power. As a result, it is possible to sufficiently shorten the total length of the optical system to the focal length.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If f/f<sub>3 </sub>is below the lower limit value of the condition (2), the third lens having a high dispersion characteristic has too large refracting power in the central portion of the third lens, so that an axial chromatic aberration remarkably occurs and makes the image quality deteriorate. On the other hand, if f/f<sub>3 </sub>is beyond the upper limit value of the condition (2), the refracting power in the central portion of the third lens becomes too small and the diverging action also becomes weak, so that the position of the principal point shifts to the image side. As a result, the optical system becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the wide angle optical system according to the present invention is formed so as to satisfy the following condition (2)&#x2032; instead of the condition (2), the difference between on-axis refracting power and off-axis refracting power of the third lens is easily made, so that it is easily possible to downsize the optical system more, and a distortion is easy to correct:

As a result, it is possible to avoid the deteriorating sensitivity of the image pickup element on the periphery of the image pickup element.

As a result, it is impossible to sufficiently avoid the deteriorating sensitivity of the image pickup element on the periphery of the image pickup element.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the wide angle optical system according to the present invention, in which both surfaces of the third lens are shaped to be convex toward the object side in the vicinity of the optical axis and to be concave toward the object side in the vicinity of the outer circumference of the lens, is configured to satisfy the condition (4), an image pickup element, if arranged on the image side of the optical system, can receive, on the periphery thereof, an off-axis principal ray incident at a small angle of incidence. As a result, it is possible to avoid deteriorating sensitivity on the periphery of the image pickup element. In addition, such a configuration also makes it possible to correct a distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If d<sub>P7</sub>/f is below the lower limit value of the condition (4), the third lens with the high dispersion characteristic has so large a refracting power in the central portion of the third lens that an axial chromatic aberration is conspicuously generated to degrade the image quality. Furthermore, the convergence action of the third lens in the vicinity of the outer circumference becomes so weak as to give a large angle of incidence to an off-axis principal ray incident on the periphery of the image pickup element.

</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In order to give a wide angle capability to an optical system like a wide angle optical system according to the present invention, the optical system must be formed in such a way that the focal length of the first lens is small. However, the small focal length of the first lens causes the occurrence of a large chromatic aberration. In a wide angle optical system according to the present invention, both surfaces of the third lens are an aspherical surface in which refracting power varies in accordance with distance from the optical axis in such a way that the both surfaces have a convex shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the optical axis and have a concave shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the outer circumference of the lens. That is to say, the image-side surface of the third lens is a surface having inflection points, so that a correction of an axial chromatic aberration in the third lens causes a large chromatic aberration of magnification occurring in the vicinity of the outer circumference of the third lens. Accordingly, a wide angle optical system according to the present invention is preferably formed in such a way that the second lens is made of a material having a high dispersion characteristic in order to correct a chromatic aberration of magnification. In addition, the second lens is preferably given suitable refracting power in order to prevent a coma from increasing. The condition (5) is used for prescribing such second lens.</p>

The formation of a wide angle optical system according to the present invention satisfying the condition (6) makes it possible to arrange the first and second lenses with the first lens close to the second lens, so that the whole of the wide angle optical system is easy to downsize. In addition, because the formation satisfying the condition (6) makes it possible to make a small air space between the first and second lenses, the condition (6) makes it possible to ensure a distance from the object-side surface of the second lens to the image-side surface of the third lens, so that the wide angle optical system easily satisfies the condition (1).</p>

On the other hand, if Exp/f is beyond the upper limit value of the condition (8), the angle of incidence of a light ray which is incident on the periphery of the image pickup element becomes too large in the case of the arrangement of the image pickup element on the image side of the optical system, so that the peripheral performance remarkably deteriorates.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When an optical system is formed like a wide angle optical system according to the present invention in such a way that the optical system comprises, in order from the object side, positive refracting power and negative refracting power, a positive distortion occurs in the optical system. If an image pickup element arranged on the image side of such optical system is displaced along the direction perpendicular to the optical axis so that the image pickup element is not aligned with a lens frame on the optical axis, then a distortion will occur asymmetrically. As a result, quantity of light in the peripheral part becomes asymmetry, so that the asymmetric quantity of light in the peripheral part causes deteriorated image quality. However, the formation of the wide angle optical system satisfying the condition (10) can prevent occurrence of an asymmetric distortion, so that quantity of light in the central part is well-balanced with quantity of light in the peripheral part. As a result, it is possible to prevent image quality from deteriorating.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If ILL is below the lower limit value of the condition (10), the balance of the quantity of light in the peripheral part is lost, so that it is difficult to brighten an image by adjusting the brightness of the image by an electrical correction and asymmetry of the quantity of light in the peripheral part also easily stands out. On the other hand, if ILL is beyond the upper limit value of the condition (10), although the balance of the quantity of light in the peripheral part is improved, a balance between refracting powers of the lenses is lost in the wide angle optical system which is given a wide angle capability. In particular, a balance between refracting powers of the first and second lenses is lost. As a result, the formation of ILL beyond the upper limit value leads to: coma, field curvature, and astigmatism which easily occur; or the large total length of the optical system.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">First, the formation of an image pickup apparatus provided with a wide angle optical system of the present embodiment is explained using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the image pickup apparatus provided with the wide angle optical system of the present embodiment, in order from the object side, an aperture stop S, a first lens L<sub>1</sub>, a second lens L<sub>2</sub>, a third lens L<sub>3</sub>, a CCD cover glass CG, and a CCD having an image pickup surface IM are arranged on the optical axis L<sub>c</sub>. Further, a low pass filter which is given an IR-cut coating, or the like may be arranged between the third lens L<sub>3 </sub>and the CCD cover glass CG.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The first lens L<sub>1 </sub>is a biconvex lens both surfaces of which are an aspherical surface. The second lens L<sub>2 </sub>is a negative meniscus lens both surfaces of which are an aspherical surface, and the convex shape of each of both surfaces of the second lens L<sub>2 </sub>faces toward the image side of the wide angle optical system. The third lens L<sub>3 </sub>is a meniscus lens both surfaces of which are an aspherical surface in which refracting power varies in accordance with distance from the optical axis in such a way that the both surfaces have a convex shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the optical axis and have a concave shape facing toward the object side in the vicinity of the outer circumference.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, the constitution and numerical data of lenses which constitute each optical system according to the present embodiment are shown.</p>
