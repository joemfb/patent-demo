<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Food packaging article comprising a blooming agent, food packages, and methods of food packing comprising the same, are provided herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Meat color is an important quality characteristic of meat that affects its merchantability. Consumers often use color as an indicator of meat quality and freshness. The color of meat is related to the amount and chemical state of myoglobin in the meat. Myoglobin is present in the muscle tissue of all animals and functions to store and deliver oxygen by reversibly binding molecular oxygen, thereby creating an intracellular source of oxygen for the mitochondria. Pork and poultry typically contain lower amounts of myoglobin than beef and thus are lighter in color than beef.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Myoglobin includes an open binding site called heme that can bind certain small molecules, such as molecular oxygen (O<sub>2 </sub>or &#x201c;oxygen&#x201d;), or water. Myoglobin without a molecule bound to the heme site is a purple colored molecule called deoxymoglobin. The presence and type of ligand bound at the myoglobin binding site can alter the color of the myoglobin. The color of the meat product will change based on the amount of myoglobin present and the amount and type(s) of ligand molecule(s) bound to the heme binding site. Molecular oxygen readily acts as a ligand that binds to the heme group, permitting biological transport of oxygen from the blood stream to the mitochondria within cells. When oxygen binds to the heme pocket, purple deoxymyoglobin becomes oxymyoglobin, characterized by a red color. When a water molecule binds to the heme group, the myoglobin molecule turns brown and is referred to as metmyoglobin. The binding of carbon monoxide (CO) can cause a red color similar to that produced by oxygen binding. Nitric oxide (NO) has been described as forming a stable pink color in cured meat.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Historically, fresh meat products available to consumers have been substantially prepared and packaged for end-use at the site of final sale. Product packaging that preserves a desirable color of fresh meat can promote the merchantability and appeal of the meat product for consumers. Existing meat packaging technology can inadequately preserve favorable meat color for various reasons. The conventional packaging format used by the retail grocer for fresh meat is to stretch a thin plastic film around a foam tray that supports the product. The film is permeable to oxygen so that the color of the meat quickly blooms to a bright red. However, the shelf life for the bright red color is only about three days. Thus, this packaging format is undesirable because the color often becomes unacceptable before it can be displayed or sold even though the meat remains nutritious and healthy for consumption. As a result, a packaging format that maintains the fresh meat color for a longer period of time has long been sought for centralized packaging operations. Alternatively, meat has been packaged in oxygen barrier, vacuum bags, which are vacuum sealed and prevent oxygen contact with the meat until the package is opened. Vacuum sealed red meat products are nutritious, healthy and have a long shelf life, however they may result in an undesirable purple meat color in the package that does not bloom to a desirable red color until the meat is exposed to air. Consumer acceptance of meat having a purple color is less than that of meat having a red color. To provide meat with the consumer preferred red color, meat has also been packaged in a modified atmosphere package (&#x201c;MAP&#x201d;), wherein the meat is maintained in a sealed pocket containing an atmosphere that is different than ambient air. For example, one such commercially acceptable MAP contains an atmosphere enriched with oxygen (up to 80% by volume) to better maintain a preferred red color. One case ready MAP maintains meat in carbon dioxide, with very low oxygen content until just before display when the meat is exposed to oxygen to cause blooming to the desired red color. Alternatively, the meat can be contacted with a MAP having an atmosphere containing a small concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) (e.g., 0.4% by volume) to maintain a preferred red meat color. However, while CO-containing MAP can maintain a shelf life comparable to vacuum packaged meat, the red color induced by the presence of CO can be perceived as &#x201c;unnaturally&#x201d; bright red. In addition, the red color developed by CO tends to extend through a significant portion of the meat product, causing a permanent &#x201c;pinking&#x201d; of the interior of the meat which may remain even after the meat has been fully cooked. The bright red CO-myoglobin complex is referred to as carboxymyoglobin. The presence of carbon monoxide can also disfavorably impact sales of CO-containing MAP packages among consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">MAP also requires a headspace for contact of the modified atmosphere with the meat surface to affect the desired color over time. This requirement for a headspace leads to increased package volume, increased transportation costs and storage requirements and also limits the display appearance by making the product less visible due to the high side walls of the container and the gap between the film and the meat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed are packaging articles that maintain a favorable meat color, while providing an adequate or improved shelf life and meat freshness.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Nitrite or nitrate salts, such as sodium nitrite, are often used in curing meat, and can also affect meat color. Nitrate and nitrite additives are generally recognized as safe for use in foods, and are commonly known preservatives used in the curing process for products such as hams, lunchmeat, bologna and hot dogs. Nitrite and nitrates are used to cure and disinfect meats in the meat industry often producing a stable pink to red color in the process. For example, GB 2187081A discloses immersion of meat in an aqueous solution of sodium chloride, polyphosphate ions and nitrite ions to preserve meat. See also McGee, &#x201c;Meat&#x201d;, <i>On Food and Cooking</i>, Rev. Ed., 2004, Chapter 3, pp. 118-178 (Scribner, New York, N.Y.) which is hereby incorporated by reference. The presence of oxygen can oxidize available nitric oxide to nitrite thus reducing its availability to associate with the myoglobin molecule. Packaging films have been described that comprise nitrite or nitrate compounds as a desiccant, a food preservative or as a volatile corrosion inhibitor for packaging of metal products. Anti-fungal agents including food preservatives such as sodium nitrite may be applied on various types of packaging to preserve biodegradable packaging against premature deleterious attack by fungi, as disclosed in JP7-258467A. Oxygen barrier films for packaging food products can contain a nitrate salt as a moisture-absorbing agent within an EVOH barrier material or other layer of a multilayer film, as disclosed in JP5-140344A, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,407,897 (Farrell et al.); 4,425,410 (Farrell et al.); 4,792,484 (Moritani); 4,929,482 (Moritani et al.); 4,960,639 (Oda et al.), and 5,153,038 (Koyama et al.). Nitrate or nitrite products have also been described as being included in packaging films to absorb moisture, e.g., to inhibit corrosion of metal products, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,895,270 (Blaess); 5,715,945 (Chandler); 5,894,040 (Foley et al.); 5,937,618 (Chandler); 6,465,109 (Ohtsuka), and 6,942,909 (Shirrell et al.), U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2005/0019537 (Nakaishi et al.), GB Patent No. 1,048,770 (Canadian Technical Tape, Ltd.), and EP Patent Nos. EP 0 202 771 B1 (Aicerro Chemical Co. Ltd.), and EP 0 662 527 B1 (Cortec Corp.) and EP 1 138 478 A2 (Aicello Chemical Co. Ltd.). None of these barrier films teach a meat-contact portion comprising a nitrite or nitrate material adapted to maintain desirable coloration of a meat product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In many packaging applications, such as vacuum packaging, heat sealable food packaging films are desirable. The packaging can be made from heat sealable films. A typical food packaging bag, pouch or casing can include one, two, or three sides heat sealed by the bag manufacturer leaving one or two open sides to allow product insertion. A typical food container may include a formed tray with a heat sealable lidding film sealed to the tray. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,058,761 (Williams); 5,558,891 (Lawless et al.); and 7,017,774 (Haedt).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Shrinkable films, bags, and casings also have been used to package fresh, frozen and processed meats for wholesale or retail sale and as processing films for cook-in applications and post-cooking pasteurization processes. Meats cured with nitrites and/or nitrates have been packaged in shrink films. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,815,023 (Tatarka et al.); 6,777,046 (Tatarka et al.); 6,749,910 (Georgelos et al.); 5,759,648 (Idlas); 5,472,722 (Burger); 5,047,253 (Juhl et al.); and 4,391,862 (Bornstein et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">What is needed are packaging products, such as food packaging films including a food-contact portion comprising a material adapted to maintain or promote the desirable coloration of a myoglobin containing food product especially fresh meat.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first embodiment, a food packaging article is provided.

Preferably, adhesive layers are positioned between two layers of a multilayer film to maintain the two layers in position relative to each other and prevent undesirable delamination. Unless otherwise indicated, an adhesive layer can have any suitable composition that provides a desired level of adhesion with the one or more surfaces in contact with the adhesive layer material. Optionally, an adhesive layer placed between a first layer and a second layer in a multilayer film may comprise components of both the first layer and the second layer to promote simultaneous adhesion of the adhesive layer to both the first layer and the second layer to opposite sides of the adhesive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;seal layer,&#x201d; &#x201c;sealing layer,&#x201d; &#x201c;heat seal layer,&#x201d; and &#x201c;sealant layer,&#x201d; refer to an outer film layer, or layers, involved in the sealing of the film: to itself; to another film layer of the same film or another film; and/or to another article which is not a film, e.g., a tray. In general, the sealant layer is an interior layer of any suitable thickness, that provides for the sealing of the film to itself or another layer. With respect to packages having only fin-type seals, as opposed to lap-type seals, the phrase &#x201c;sealant layer&#x201d; generally refers to the interior surface film layer of a package.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">&#x201c;Polyolefin&#x201d; is used herein broadly to include polymers such as polyethylene, ethylene-alpha olefin copolymers (EAO), polypropylene, polybutene, and ethylene copolymers having a majority amount by weight of ethylene polymerized with a lesser amount of a comonomer such as vinyl acetate, and other polymeric resins falling in the &#x201c;olefin&#x201d; family classification. Polyolefins may be made by a variety of processes well known in the art including batch and continuous processes using single, staged or sequential reactors, slurry, solution and fluidized bed processes and one or more catalysts including for example, heterogeneous and homogeneous systems and Ziegler, Phillips, metallocene, single site and constrained geometry catalysts to produce polymers having different combinations of properties. Such polymers may be highly branched or substantially linear and the branching, dispersity and average molecular weight may vary depending upon the parameters and processes chosen for their manufacture in accordance with the teachings of the polymer arts.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">&#x201c;Polyethylene&#x201d; is the name for a polymer whose basic structure is characterized by the chain &#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;)<sub>n</sub>. Polyethylene homopolymer is generally described as being a solid which has a partially amorphous phase and partially crystalline phase with a density of between 0.915 to 0.970 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The relative crystallinity of polyethylene is known to affect its physical properties. The amorphous phase imparts flexibility and high impact strength while the crystalline phase imparts a high softening temperature and rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Unsubstituted polyethylene is generally referred to as high density homopolymer and has a crystallinity of 70 to 90 percent with a density between about 0.96 to 0.97 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Most commercially utilized polyethylenes are not unsubstituted homopolymer but instead have C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>8 </sub>alkyl groups attached to the basic chain. These substituted polyethylenes are also known as branched chain polyethylenes. Also, commercially available polyethylenes frequently include other substituent groups produced by copolymerization. Branching with alkyl groups generally reduces crystallinity, density and melting point. The density of polyethylene is recognized as being closely connected to the crystallinity. The physical properties of commercially available polyethylenes are also affected by average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, branching length and type of substituents.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">People skilled in the art generally refer to several broad categories of polymers and copolymers as &#x201c;polyethylene.&#x201d; Placement of a particular polymer into one of these categories of &#x201c;polyethylene&#x201d; is frequently based upon the density of the &#x201c;polyethylene&#x201d; and often by additional reference to the process by which it was made since the process often determines the degree of branching, crystallinity and density. In general, the nomenclature used is nonspecific to a compound but refers instead to a range of compositions. This range often includes both homopolymers and copolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, &#x201c;high density&#x201d; polyethylene (HDPE) is ordinarily used in the art to refer to both (a) homopolymers of densities between about 0.960 to 0.970 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and (b) copolymers of ethylene and an alpha-olefin (usually 1-butene or 1-hexene) which have densities between 0.940 and 0.958 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. HDPE includes polymers made with Ziegler or Phillips type catalysts and is also said to include high molecular weight &#x201c;polyethylenes.&#x201d; In contrast to HDPE, whose polymer chain has some branching, are &#x201c;ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes&#x201d; which are essentially unbranched specialty polymers having a much higher molecular weight than the high molecular weight HDPE.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Hereinafter, the term &#x201c;polyethylene&#x201d; will be used (unless indicated otherwise) to refer to ethylene homopolymers as well as copolymers of ethylene with alpha-olefins and the term will be used without regard to the presence or absence of substituent branch groups.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another broad grouping of polyethylene is &#x201c;high pressure, low density polyethylene&#x201d; (LDPE). LDPE is used to denominate branched homopolymers having densities between 0.915 and 0.930 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. LDPEs typically contain long branches off the main chain (often termed &#x201c;backbone&#x201d;) with alkyl substituents of 2 to 8 carbon atoms or more.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) are copolymers of ethylene with alpha-olefins having densities from 0.915 to 0.940 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The alpha-olefin utilized is usually 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene and Ziegler-type catalysts are usually employed (although Phillips catalysts are also used to produce LLDPE having densities at the higher end of the range, and metallocene and other types of catalysts are also employed to produce other well known variations of LLDPEs).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Ethylene &#x3b1;-olefin copolymers are copolymers having an ethylene as a major component copolymerized with one or more alpha olefins such as octene-1, hexene-, or butene-1 as a minor component. EAOs include polymers known as LLDPE, VLDPE, ULDPE, and plastomers and may be made using a variety of processes and catalysts including metallocene, single-site and constrained geometry catalysts as well as Ziegler-Natta and Phillips catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Very Low Density Polyethylene (VLDPE) which is also called &#x201c;Ultra Low Density Polyethylene&#x201d; (ULDPE) comprise copolymers of ethylene with alpha-olefins, usually 1-butene, 1-hexene or 1-octene and are recognized by those skilled in the art as having a high degree of linearity of structure with short branching rather than the long side branches characteristic of LDPE. However, VLDPEs have lower densities than LLDPEs. The densities of VLDPEs are recognized by those skilled in the art to range between 0.860 and 0.915 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. A process for making VLDPEs is described in European Patent Document publication number 120,503 whose text and drawing are hereby incorporated by reference into the present document. Sometimes VLDPEs having a density less than 0.900 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>are referred to as &#x201c;plastomers&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Polyethylenes may be used alone, in blends and/or with copolymers in both monolayer and multilayer films for packaging applications for such food products as poultry, fresh red meat and processed meat.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, the term &#x201c;modified&#x201d; refers to a chemical derivative, e.g., one having any form of anhydride functionality, such as anhydride of maleic acid, crotonic acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid, etc., whether grafted onto a polymer, copolymerized with a polymer, or otherwise functionally associated with one or more polymers, and is also inclusive of derivatives of such functionalities, such as acids, esters, and metal salts derived therefrom. Other examples of common modifications are acrylate modified polyolefins.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, terms identifying polymers, such as, e.g., &#x201c;polyamide&#x201d; or &#x201c;polypropylene,&#x201d; are inclusive of not only polymers comprising repeating units derived from monomers known to polymerize to form a polymer of the named type, but are also inclusive of comonomers, as well as both unmodified and modified polymers made by, e.g., derivitization of a polymer after its polymerization to add functional groups or moieties along the polymeric chain. Furthermore, terms identifying polymers are also inclusive of &#x201c;blends&#x201d; of such polymers. Thus, the terms &#x201c;polyamide polymer&#x201d; and &#x201c;nylon polymer&#x201d; may refer to a polyamide-containing homopolymer, a polyamide-containing copolymer or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The term &#x201c;polyamide&#x201d; means a high molecular weight polymer having amide linkages (&#x2014;CONH&#x2014;)<sub>n </sub>which occur along the molecular chain, and includes &#x201c;nylon&#x201d; resins which are well known polymers having a multitude of uses including utility as packaging films, bags, and casings. See, e.g., <i>Modern Plastics Encyclopedia, </i>88 Vol. 64, No. 10A, pp 34-37 and 554-555 (McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1987) which is hereby incorporated by reference. Polyamides are preferably selected from nylon compounds approved for use in producing articles intended for use in processing, handling, and packaging food.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The term &#x201c;nylon&#x201d; as used herein it refers more specifically to synthetic polyamides, either aliphatic or aromatic, either in crystalline, semi-crystalline, or amorphous form characterized by the presence of the amide group &#x2014;CONH. It is intended to refer to both polyamides and co-polyamides.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Thus the terms &#x201c;polyamide&#x201d; or &#x201c;nylon&#x201d; encompass both polymers comprising repeating units derived from monomers, such as caprolactam, which polymerize to form a polyamide, as well as copolymers derived from the copolymerization of caprolactam with a comonomer which when polymerized alone does not result in the formation of a polyamide. Preferably, polymers are selected from compositions approved as safe for producing articles intended for use in processing, handling and packaging of food, such as nylon resins approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided at 21 CFR &#xa7;177.1500 (&#x201c;Nylon resins&#x201d;), which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of these nylon polymeric resins for use in food packaging and processing include: nylon 66, nylon 610, nylon 66/610, nylon 6/66, nylon 11, nylon 6, nylon 66T, nylon 612, nylon 12, nylon 6/12, nylon 6/69, nylon 46, nylon 6-3-T, nylon MXD-6, nylon MXDI, nylon 12T and nylon 6I/6T disclosed at 21 CFR &#xa7;177.1500. Examples of such polyamides include nylon homopolymers and copolymers such as those selected form the group consisting of nylon 4,6 (poly(tetramethylene adipamide)), nylon 6 (polycaprolactam), nylon 6,6 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide)), nylon 6,9 (poly(hexamethylene nonanediamide)), nylon 6,10 (poly(hexamethylene sebacamide)), nylon 6,12 (poly(hexamethylene dodecanediamide)), nylon 6/12 (poly(caprolactam-co-dodecanediamide)), nylon 6,6/6 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide-co-caprolactam)), nylon 66/610 (e.g., manufactured by the condensation of mixtures of nylon 66 salts and nylon 610 salts), nylon 6/69 resins (e.g., manufactured by the condensation of epsilon-caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine and azelaic acid), nylon 11 (polyundecanolactam), nylon 12 (polylauryllactam) and copolymers or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In use of the term &#x201c;amorphous nylon copolymer,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;amorphous&#x201d; as used herein denotes an absence of a regular three-dimensional arrangement of molecules or subunits of molecules extending over distances which are large relative to atomic dimensions. However, regularity of structure may exist on a local scale. See, &#x201c;Amorphous Polymers,&#x201d; Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, 2nd Ed., pp. 789-842 (J. Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc. 1985). In particular, the term &#x201c;amorphous nylon copolymer&#x201d; refers to a material recognized by one skilled in the art of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as having no measurable melting point (less than 0.5 cal/g) or no heat of fusion as measured by DSC using ASTM 3417-83. The amorphous nylon copolymer may be manufactured by the condensation of hexamethylenediamine, terephthalic acid, and isophthalic acid according to known processes. Amorphous nylons also include those amorphous nylons prepared from condensation polymerization reactions of diamines with dicarboxylic acids. For example, an aliphatic diamine is combined with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, or an aromatic diamine is combined with an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid to give suitable amorphous nylons.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, &#x201c;EVOH&#x201d; refers to ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. EVOH is otherwise known as saponified or hydrolyzed ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and refers to a vinyl alcohol copolymer having an ethylene comonomer. EVOH is prepared by the hydrolysis (or saponification) of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. The degree of hydrolysis is preferably from about 50 to 100 mole percent, more preferably, from about 85 to 100 mole percent, and most preferably at least 97%. It is well known that to be a highly effective oxygen barrier, the hydrolysis-saponification must be nearly complete, i.e., to the extent of at least 97%. EVOH is commercially available in resin form with various percentages of ethylene and there is a direct relationship between ethylene content and melting point. For example, EVOH having a melting point of about 175&#xb0; C. or lower is characteristic of EVOH materials having an ethylene content of about 38 mole % or higher. EVOH having an ethylene content of 38 mole % has a melting point of about 175&#xb0; C. With increasing ethylene content the melting point is lowered. Also, EVOH polymers having increasing mole percentages of ethylene have greater gas permeabilities. A melting point of about 158&#xb0; C. corresponds to an ethylene content of 48 mole %. EVOH copolymers having lower or higher ethylene contents may also be employed. It is expected that processability and orientation would be facilitated at higher contents; however, gas permeabilities, particularly with respect to oxygen, may become undesirably high for certain packaging applications which are sensitive to microbial growth in the presence of oxygen. Conversely lower contents may have lower gas permeabilities, but processability and orientation may be more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polyester&#x201d; refers to synthetic homopolymers and copolymers having ester linkages between monomer units which may be formed by condensation polymerization methods. Polymers of this type are preferably aromatic polyesters and more preferably, homopolymers and copolymers of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene isophthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate and blends thereof. Suitable aromatic polyesters may have an intrinsic viscosity between 0.60 to 1.0, preferably between 0.60 to 0.80.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">&#x201c;Reduced oxygen atmosphere&#x201d; when referring to a packaged meat product refers to a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in contact with the packaged meat product, in comparison with the partial pressure of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere at standard temperature and pressure at sea level. Reduced oxygen atmosphere packages may include modified atmosphere packages where the oxygen partial pressure is less than that of the Earth's atmosphere at standard temperature and pressure at sea level, or vacuum packages, containing minimal gas pressure in contact with the packaged meat. Modified atmosphere packaging may create a substantially oxygen reduced environment where the oxygen content of less than 3.0% oxygen v/v is desirable, and preferably less than 1.0% oxygen v/v. For processed meat, oxygen content of less than 0.5% v/v is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x201c;Vacuum packaging&#x201d; refers to actively eliminating atmospheric gases, most specifically oxygen, from inside the package and sealing the package so that virtually no gas is able to permeate into the package from outside the package. The result is a package with a minimum amount of oxygen gas remaining in contact with the meat inside the package. The removal of oxygen from the immediate environment of the product slows down bacterial and oxidative deterioration processes thereby keeping the quality of the meat fresher for a longer period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x201c;MAP&#x201d; is an abbreviation for a &#x201c;modified atmosphere package&#x201d;. This is a packaging format where a gas is actively flushed into the headspace of a package prior to sealing. In general, the gas is modified to be different from that normally found in the earth's atmosphere. The result is a package with a considerable volume of gas surrounding the viewing surface of the product within the package. A fresh meat MAP can use either an enriched-oxygen or an oxygen-free atmosphere to effectively extend shelf life.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">&#x201c;RAP&#x201d; is an abbreviation for a &#x201c;reduced atmosphere package.&#x201d; It can be a form of MAP wherein the atmospheric gases are minimal so that the packaging material makes physical contact with the internal contents. RAP can also be a form of vacuum packaging where the atmosphere is not completely evacuated from inside the package. Examples include the conventional fresh meat package such as a &#x201c;PVC stretch wrapped tray&#x201d; and the conventional case ready poultry package where a shrink film or bag is hermetically sealed around a tray of meat. In general the fresh meat in a RAP has a higher profile than the tray used to hold the meat so that the packaging film surrounding the product makes considerable physical contact with the meat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">&#x201c;Consumer Package&#x201d; refers to any container in which a meat product is enclosed for the purpose of display and sale to household consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">&#x201c;Case ready&#x201d; meat refers to a consumer package of fresh meat that is prepackaged and/or labeled at a centralized location and delivered to the retail market in a format whereby it is ready for immediate display and sale. The case ready package actively extends the quality life of a fresh meat product so as to allow for the extra time that it takes to be packaged at a centrally located facility, distributed to the retail grocer and then displayed under lights for consumer selection and purchase.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A &#x201c;myoglobin blooming agent&#x201d; refers to any agent (or precursor thereof) that binds to or interacts with any undenatured myoglobin-containing structure (including but not limited to deoxymyoglobin, oxymyoglobin, metmyoglobin, carboxymyoglobin, and nitric oxide myoglobin) present in a fresh meat product to produce or preserve a desired color, such as a red color indicative of fresh meat. The myoglobin blooming agent may also interact or cause an interaction with hemoglobin present in a meat product so as to produce, maintain or enhance, i.e., &#x201c;fix&#x201d; a desired color. Thus, the myoglobin blooming agent is not a color additive, but it acts as a color fixative. Examples of blooming agents include gases such as oxygen and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">&#x201c;Deoxymyoglobin&#x201d; refers to myoglobin in which no oxygen is present in the heme pocket. The heme iron atom is in the reduced ferrous state. It is theorized that a liquid water molecule is the ligand in the heme pocket. Deoxymyoglobin is associated with the unbloomed purple pigment of fresh meat.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">&#x201c;Oxymyoglobin&#x201d; refers to the oxygenated form of deoxymyoglobin where the heme ligand is an oxygen gas molecule. Oxymyoglobin is associated with the bloomed red pigment of fresh meat</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">&#x201c;Metmyoglobin&#x201d; refers to an oxidized form of myoglobin in which the heme iron is in the oxidized ferric state. Metmyoglobin can be formed when oxygen leaves the heme pocket of oxymyoglobin and takes an electron with it leaving the heme iron atom in the oxidized ferric state. Metmyoglobin causes the characteristic oxidized brown pigment of fresh meat.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">&#x201c;Carboxymyoglobin&#x201d; refers to the undenatured reduced form of the carboxylated deoxymyoglobin pigment where the heme ligand is carbon monoxide. The color of carboxymyoglin is red.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">&#x201c;Nitroxymyoglobin&#x201d; is the undenatured reduced form of the nitrosylated deoxymyoglobin pigment. The heme ligand is a nitrogen monoxide (NO) molecule. Nitrogen monoxide is also referred to as nitric oxide. Nitroxymyoglobin is also referred to as nitric oxide myoglobin, nitrosohaemachromagen, or nitrosomyoglobin among others. Nitroxymyoglobin has the same red color as oxymyoglobin and carboxymyoglobin.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">&#x201c;Nitric oxide metmyoglobin&#x201d; is the undenatured oxidized form of deoxymyoglobin when nitrite is present. It is used to describe the brown color of meat that typically occurs after nitrite is added during the curing process.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">&#x201c;Nitrosohemochrome&#x201d; refers to the nitrosylated protoporphyrin (heme complex) that is detached from the globin protein moiety of the myoglobin molecule. Nitrosohemochrome affords the stable pink to maroon color of cooked cured processed meat, wherein the heme iron is in the reduced state.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">&#x201c;Meat&#x201d; or &#x201c;meat product&#x201d; refers to any myoglobin or hemoglobin containing tissue from livestock such as beef, pork, veal, lamb, mutton, chicken or turkey; game such as venison, quail, and duck; and fish, fishery or seafood products. The meat can be in a variety of forms including primal cuts, subprimal cuts, and retail cuts as well as ground, comminuted or mixed. The meat or meat product is preferably fresh, raw, uncooked meat, but may also be frozen, hard chilled or thawed. It is further believed that meat may be subjected to other irradiative, biological, chemical or physical treatments. The suitability of any particular such treatment may be determined without undue experimentation in view of the present disclosure. As long as the myoglobin blooming agent is effective to promote, develop, enhance or maintain a desirable color, it may be advantageously employed to such end. Preferably the meat is less than 20 days post mortem. More preferably, the meat is less than 12 days or even 6 days or less post mortem.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Primal cuts of meat are also termed wholesale cuts and both terms refer to large sections of a carcass that are usually sold and/or shipped to butchers who further subdivide the primal into subprimals and individual retail cuts for sale to consumers. Examples of primal cuts of beef are: round; rump; loin end; flank; short loin; plate; rib; brisket; shank; and chuck. Examples of pork primals include: loin; leg; shoulder; and belly.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Subprimals are intermediate in size and may be divided further into retail cuts or are sometimes sold as retail cuts. Beef subprimals include: arm; blade; ribs; beef plate; top round; bottom round; ribs; top butt; bottom butt; tenderloin; and top loin. Pork subprimals include: butt shoulder; picnic shoulder; center cut; sirloin; butt end; shank end; side pork and side rib.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Retail cuts of meat are consumer cuts made by dividing wholesale cuts into smaller pieces. Examples of retail cuts of beef include: steaks such as round, top round, cubed, sirloin, t-bone, porterhouse, filet mignon, rib eye, rib, skirt, flank, and tip; roasts such as blade, pot, and chuck; corned brisket; fresh brisket; stew beef; short ribs; kabobs; eye of round; rolled rump; shank cross cuts; steak rolls; ground beef; and beef patties. Examples of retail cuts of pork include: arm roasts and steaks; spareribs; bacon; salt pork; ham; ham steaks; ham slices; pork tenderloin; chops; cutlets; fat back; sausage; links; and ground pork.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">&#x201c;Fresh meat&#x201d; means meat that is uncooked, uncured, unsmoked and unmarinated. &#x201c;Fresh meat&#x201d; includes post mortem meat that has been physically divided, for example, by cutting, grinding or mixing. There is no added salt in fresh meat that has not been enhanced. Naturally occurring sodium typically is less than 50 mg/100 g of meat and accounts for a salt content of less than about 0.15 weight %, preferably less than 0.128 weight %. Values of sodium are in a database for nutritional composition of meat called the &#x201c;National Nutrient Data Bank&#x201d;, and the data is published in Agriculture Handbook No. 8, &#x201c;Composition of Foods&#x2014;Raw, Processed, Prepared&#x201d; referred to in the industry as &#x201c;Handbook 8,&#x201d; both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">&#x201c;Enhanced meat&#x201d; means meat that has added water mixed with other ingredients such as sodium chloride, phosphates, antioxidants, and flavoring, e.g., to make meat moist, more tender and to help enhance shelf-life. Fresh beef, pork or poultry after being &#x201c;enhanced&#x201d; would typically contain 0.3-0.6 weight % salt (sodium chloride).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">&#x201c;Processed meat&#x201d; means meat that has been changed by heat and chemical processes, e.g., by cooking or curing. Cooked ham, hot dogs, and lunch meat are examples of cured processed meat.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">&#x201c;Uncured processed meats&#x201d; are processed meats that do not contain nitrites or nitrates. Uncured processed meats would typically contain greater than 1.0% by weight, typically 1.2-2.0 weight %, sodium chloride (salt). Cooked roast beef and bratwurst are examples of uncured processed meat.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">&#x201c;Cured meat&#x201d; means meat that is preserved through direct addition of nitrite (or nitrate which is converted to nitrite), e.g., having at least 50 ppm sodium nitrite and at least 1% by weight added salt, i.e., sodium chloride, for the purpose of preservation by retarding bacterial growth. Nitrites, nitrates or blends thereof are commonly present with sodium chloride in curing compositions. &#x201c;Uncured meat&#x201d; does not contain added nitrite or nitrate. Wet cured meats are soaked in salt brine. Dry cured meats have salt applied to the surface. Injection cured meats have the curing salts (cure) applied by needle injection into the meat.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Cured processed meats often have 2-3.5 weight % salt. A brine content of 3.5-4.0 weight % (2.6-3.0% on a weight basis in treated meat) as the level of sodium chloride salt (potassium chloride may be substituted for some or all of the NaCl) is needed in processed meat to adequately slow down bacterial growth to permit 60-90 day shelf life, although other means of preservation may also be employed to maintain shelf life at reduced salt levels. According to Pegg, R. B. and F. Shahidi, 2000, Nitrite Curing of Meat. Food &#x26; Nutrition Press, Inc., Trumbull, Conn., cured meats may have typical salt levels of 1.2-1.8 weight % in bacon, 2-3 weight % in hams, 1-2 weight % in sausages and 2-4 weight % in jerkies. It is believed that fresh meat such as beef, pork and poultry has no nitrite or nitrate naturally occurring or added. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) permits ingoing nitrite and nitrate for cured and processed meat at a level up to a maximum of 625 ppm sodium nitrite or 2,187 ppm sodium nitrate in dry cured products. In other applications levels have different limits, e.g., in typical cooked whole muscle meat products the limit as sodium nitrite is 156 ppm and in comminuted meats, 200 ppm. The maximum nitrite usage level in hot dogs or bologna is typically 156 ppm, while that for bacon is 120 ppm. Sodium ascorbate (or similar compounds) may be present in these cures.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In Europe, it is believed that the minimum level of salt and nitrite required by law for curing is 1.0 weight % and 50 ppm respectively. The USDA has stated: &#x201c;As a matter of policy, the Agency requires a minimum of 120 ppm of ingoing nitrite in all cured &#x201c;Keep Refrigerated&#x201d; products, unless the establishment can demonstrate that safety is assured by some other preservation process such as thermal processing, pH or moisture control. This 120 ppm policy for ingoing nitrite is based on safety data reviewed when the bacon standard was developed.&#x201d; (See, &#x201c;Processing Inspectors' Calculations Handbook&#x201d;, Chapter 3, p. 12, revised 1995). The Handbook also states: &#x201c;There is no regulatory minimum ingoing nitrite level however 40 ppm nitrite is useful in that it has some preservative effect. This amount has also been show to be sufficient for color-fixing purposes and to achieve the expected cured meat or poultry appearance.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The meat product can be any meat suitable for human consumption that contains a myoglobin like molecule. References to total myoglobin in a meat product refer to the amount of the myoglobin like molecules that are physiologically present in the meat tissue prior to harvesting for human consumption. Specific meat products contain a level of myoglobin sufficient to provide its characteristic color. Examples of suitable fresh meat cuts include beef, veal, pork, poultry, mutton, and lamb. The concentration of myoglobin varies in these different types of meat products. For example, beef typically contains about 3-20 mg of myoglobin per gram of meat, pork contains about 1-5 mg myoglobin per gram of meat, chicken contains less than about 1 mg myoglobin per gram of meat. Thus, the concentration of total myoglobin compounds in the above described meat products is typically between about 0.5 mg and 25 mg of myoglobin compounds per gram of the meat product.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In fresh meat (postmortem muscle tissue), oxygen can continually associate and disassociate from the heme complex of the undenatured myoglobin molecule. It is the relative abundance of three forms of the undenatured muscle pigment that determines the visual color of fresh meat. They include purple deoxymyoglobin (reduced myoglobin), red oxymyoglobin (oxygenated myoglobin); and brown metmyoglobin (oxidized myoglobin). The deoxymyoglobin form typically predominates immediately after the animal is slaughtered. Thus, freshly cut meat can have a purple color. This purple color can persist for a long time if the pigment is not exposed to oxygen. Cutting or grinding exposes the pigment to oxygen in the atmosphere, and the purple color can quickly convert to either bright red (oxymyoglobin) or brown (metmyoglobin). Thus, although deoxymyoglobin is technically indicative of fresher meat, it is the red or &#x201c;bloomed&#x201d; meat color that consumers use as their primary criterion for perceiving freshness. It is believed without wishing to be bound by the belief that the preferred red color of fresh meat occurs when at least 50% of the deoxymyoglobin molecules are oxygenated to the oxymyoglobin state. Changes in the relative percentage of each of these forms can continue to occur as fresh meat is exposed to oxygen for longer periods of time. The immediate conversion of the purple color to the desirable bright red or undesirable brown can depend on the partial pressure of oxygen at the surface. The purple color is favored at the very low oxygen level, and can dominate at oxygen levels of 0-0.2% by volume. The brown color is favored when the oxygen level is only slightly higher (0.2% to 5.0%). Consumer discrimination typically begins when the relative amount of metmyoglobin is 20%. A distinctly brown color is evident at 40% metmyoglobin, which typically renders the meat unsaleable even though it remains nutritious and healthy for consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Certain biochemical reactions that occur in muscle tissue after death can also affect fresh meat color, such as the presence of active glycolytic enzymes that convert oxygen to carbon dioxide. Reducing coenzymes called metmyoglobin reductases present in meat convert metmyoglobin back to deoxymyoglobin, and their activity is called &#x201c;MRA&#x201d; which is an abbreviation for metmyoglobin reducing activity. MRA can be described as the ability of muscle to reduce metmyoglobin back to its natural deoxymyoglobin state. MRA is lost when the oxidizable substrates are depleted or when heat or acid denatures the enzymes. When the enzymes lose their activity or are denatured, the iron of the heme pigment automatically oxidizes to the metmyoglobin form, and the brown color stabilizes and dominates. MRA persists for a period of time after death depending on the amount of exposure of the meat tissue to oxygen. During this time oxygen is continually consumed by the meat tissue. The oxygen consumption rate is referred to as &#x201c;OCR&#x201d;. When meat that has a high OCR is exposed to oxygen, the oxygen tension is reduced so rapidly that the metmyoglobin is favored below the viewing surface. If it is close to the viewing surface, the perceived color of the meat is affected. The MRA is important to minimize this layer of metmyoglobin that forms between the bloomed surface and purple interior. As the MRA wears out, the brown metmyoglobin layer thickens and migrates toward the surface, thus terminating display life. When the MRA is high, the metmyoglobin layer is thin and sometimes not visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">MRA and OCR relate to determining the types of packaging best suited for retail sale in order to prolong the desirable appearance of meat as long as possible. Hermetically sealed packages with films that are a barrier to oxygen will cause a low oxygen tension on the meat surface. Thus, metmyoglobin formation occurs and the viewing surface changes to an undesirable brown color. However, if the OCR is high enough to keep ahead of the oxygen that migrates across the packaging film, and the MRA is good enough to reduce metmyoglobin that forms on the surface, then native deoxymyoglobin replaces metmyoglobin. After a period of time, the perceived color changes from brown to purple. Both of these colors are unacceptable to the consumer. For this reason, vacuum packaging by itself has historically been an unacceptable format for case ready fresh meat although it is used to ship subprimal and other large cuts of meat from the slaughterhouse to retail butchers for further processing and re-packaging. On the other hand, vacuum packaging is the format of choice for cooked and cured processed meats where the myoglobin pigment, is denatured by heat. Heat from cooking causes the globin portion of the nitrosylated myoglobin molecule to denature and separate from the heme portion. It is the dissociated nitrosylated heme complex that gives cured and processed meats their characteristic color. When oxygen is eliminated from a cured processed meat package, the product's color and flavor can deteriorate slower than when oxygen is present. In the present invention oxygen must be removed from the environment of the raw fresh meat before the preferred color can develop. A certain amount of oxygen penetrates the meat after slaughter and fabrication. This oxygen is eliminated by the OCR/MRA activities. Similarly, those activities facilitate the dominance of the deoxymyoglobin form of the myoglobin molecule. It is believed, but not wishing to be bound by the belief, that the OCR/MRA activities also facilitate the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide when sodium nitrite is used as the myoglobin blooming agent. In this case, the formation of deoxymyoglobin and nitric oxide allows for the development of nitroxymyoglobin. Oxygen itself is a blooming agent because it causes the formation of oxymyoglobin as described earlier herein. However, oxygen interferes with the reactions that form deoxymyoglobin and nitric oxide. Therefore, it interferes with the bloomed color development in the presence of nitrite. Thus, it is a preferred aspect of the present invention that an oxygen barrier layer is selected and configured to protect the meat surface from the ingress of atmospheric oxygen during the formation of the desired bloomed meat color.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Myoglobin Blooming Agents</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a first embodiment, myoglobin blooming agents are provided. A &#x201c;myoglobin blooming agent&#x201d; refers to any agent (or precursor thereof) that binds to or interacts with any undenatured myoglobin-containing structure (including but not limited to deoxymyoglobin, oxymyoglobin, metmyoglobin, carboxymyoglobin, and nitric oxide myoglobin) present in a fresh meat product to produce or preserve a desired color, such as a red color indicative of fresh meat. The myoglobin blooming agent may also interact or cause an interaction with hemoglobin present in a meat product so as to produce, maintain or enhance, i.e., &#x201c;fix&#x201d; a desired color. Thus, the myoglobin blooming agent is not a color additive, but it acts as a color fixative.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one preferred embodiment, the myoglobin blooming agent is a &#x201c;nitric oxide donating compound&#x201d; (&#x201c;NO donor&#x201d;) that provides a nitric oxide (NO) molecule that binds to the myoglobin present in a meat product so as to maintain or promote a reddening or blooming or other favorable coloration of the meat product. A nitric oxide donating compound releases nitric oxide or is a precursor, e.g., nitrate which acts as an intermediate leading to the formation of nitric oxide which binds to a myoglobin molecule in a meat product. Examples of nitric oxide donating compounds include nitrosodisulfonates including for example, Fremy's salt [NO(SO<sub>3</sub>Na)<sub>2 </sub>or NO(SO<sub>3</sub>K)<sub>2</sub>]; inorganic nitrates (MNO<sub>3</sub>) where a suitable counter ion (M<sup>+</sup>) include alkali metals (e.g., sodium, potassium), alkaline earth metals (e.g., calcium), transition metals, protonated primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or quaternary amines, or ammonium, and including for example, saltpeter; and inorganic nitrites (MNO<sub>2</sub>) where suitable counter ions (M<sup>+</sup>) include alkali metals (e.g., sodium, potassium), alkaline earth metals (e.g., calcium), transition metals, protonated primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or quaternary amines, or ammonium.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Nitric oxide donating compounds may donate one molecule of nitric oxide or multiple nitric oxide molecules. In some aspects the nitric oxide donating compound may be a polymeric material which contains several nitric oxide donating sites, and can thereby release multiple molecules of nitric oxide. Preferably, the nitric oxide is released from the polymeric chain. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,357, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes a polymer with a nitric oxide-releasing functional group bound to the polymer. U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,645, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes a polymer in which NO<sub>x </sub>is covalently bound to a polymer by a linking group. U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,479, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes synthetically derived polymeric materials which are derivatized to include nitric oxide adducts. It is to be understood that polymeric materials which contain a nitric oxide donating compound or nitric oxide donating functional group chemically bound to the polymer chain are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one embodiment the nitric oxide donating compound is other than sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one embodiment the nitric oxide donating compound is other than an inorganic nitrate or inorganic nitrite.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another embodiment, the nitric oxide donating compound is an inorganic nitrate or inorganic nitrite other than sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrite and potassium nitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one embodiment the nitric oxide donating compound is other than a nitrosodisulfonate.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Other myoglobin blooming agents within the scope of the present invention include inorganic cyanides (MCN) where suitable counter ions (M<sup>+</sup>) include alkali metals (e.g., sodium, potassium), alkaline earth metals (e.g., calcium), transition metals, protonated primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or quaternary amines, or ammonium; inorganic fluorides (MF) where suitable counter ion (M<sup>+</sup>) include alkali metals (e.g., sodium, potassium), alkaline earth metals (e.g., calcium), transition metals, protonated primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or quaternary amines, or ammonium; isothiocyanates including mustard oil; bacterial cultures that fix nitrogen to provide a source of nitrogen oxide including xanthine oxidase, nitrate reductases, nitrite reductases; betanine; erythrocine; and cochineal extracts.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Other myoglobin blooming agents include nitrogen heterocycles and derivatives. Examples of suitable nitrogen heterocycles include pyridines, pyrimidines (for example dipyridamole), pyrazines, triazines, purines (for example nicotinamide), nicotinates, nicotinamides, niacin (also known as nicotinic acid), isoquinolines, imidazoles and derivatives and salts thereof. It is to be understood that these nitrogen heterocycles may be substituted or unsubstituted. For pyridines and isoquinolines, 3-carbonyl substituted compounds are preferred. Preferably, the nitrogen heterocycle is a pyridine, pyrimidine or imidazole. More preferably the nitrogen heterocycle is an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt or ester of nicotinic acid which may include such esters as methyl nicotinate, ethyl nicotinate, propyl nicotinate, butyl nicotinate, pentyl nicotinate, hexyl nicotinate, methyl isonicotinate, isopropyl isonicotinate, and isopentyl isonicotinate. More preferably the nitrogen heterocycle is an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt or ester of nicotinamide, or imidazole. In another aspect, the nitrogen heterocycle is pyridine, pyrimidine, histidine, N-acetyl histidine, 3-butyroylpyridine, 3-valeroylpyridine, 3-caproylpyridine, 3-heptoylpyridine, 3-capryloylpyridine, 3-formylpyiridine, nicotinamide, N-ethylnicotinamide, N,N-diethylnicotinamide, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, 3-hydroxypyridine, 3-ethyl pyridine, 4-vinyl pyridine, 4-bromo-isoquinoline, 5-hydroxyisoquinoline, or 3-cyanopyridine.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Myoglobin blooming agents also include any compound which acts as a ligand for myoglobin and lead to the formation of the desirable color, or any compound which acts as a substrate leading to the formation of such a ligand. For example, the myoglobin blooming agent can be a carbon monoxide donating compound. Carbon monoxide is known to complex with the heme pocket of myoglobin to form a desirable appearance in meat. A carbon monoxide donating compound is any compound that releases carbon monoxide or acts as a substrate leading to the formation of carbon monoxide. Alternatively, the blooming agent can be a sulfur monoxide (SO) donating compound, a nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) donating compound, an ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) donating compound or a hydrogen sulfide donating compound. Such compounds donate the specified ligand or act as a substrate leading to the formation of the specified ligand. Compounds include ligand/heme/transition metal complexes, and ligand ferrous protoporphyrin complexes, including for example, carbon monoxide/heme/transition metal complexes, and carbon monoxide ferrous protoporphyrin complexes. Carbon monoxide donating compounds, sulfur monoxide donating compounds, nitrous oxide donating compounds and hydrogen sulfide donating compounds include polymeric materials with the appropriate donating functional group chemically bound to the polymer chain.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The myoglobin blooming agent is preferably present in a desired concentration in contact with a meat product. The food contact layer of a packaging film preferably contains a blooming agent in a concentration high enough to produce or preserve a desirable appearance in a meat product. Preferably, the blooming agent is present in a food contact layer in a concentration sufficient to convert at least 50% of the myoglobin molecules on a contacting meat surface to a desired ligand binding state. The concentration of blooming agent is preferably selected to bind ligands producing desirable appearance or color of the meat to the myoglobin molecules in the outermost &#xbc;-inch or less of the meat product. For example, a nitric oxide donating myoglobin blooming agent is desirably present in a concentration sufficient to convert at least 50% of the myoglobin molecules on the contacting meat surface to nitric oxide myoglobin.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">When the blooming agent is niacin, the concentration of niacin chosen is greater than the concentration of niacin naturally found in meat. According to Richardson et al., (1980, Composition of foods. Sausage and luncheon meats (Raw, Processed, Prepared) Handbook No. 8-7, USDA, Science and Education Administration, Washington, D.C.), niacin naturally occurs in poultry and red meat at about 0.05-0.09 mg/g. In the present invention, when niacin is employed as the blooming agent and incorporated in the meat product, it is typically used in amounts greater than 0.1 mg/g of meat.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The myoglobin blooming agent may be coated on the interior layer of a polymeric film by spraying or dusting or other application means or the blooming agent may be incorporated within the interior layer.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In other aspects, the myoglobin blooming agent is incorporated within the myoglobin-containing fresh meat product or coated on the surface of the myoglobin-containing fresh meat product. The myoglobin blooming agent may be coated on myoglobin-containing fresh meat product prior to packaging by spraying, dusting, dipping or other application means. The myoglobin blooming agent may be incorporated within the myoglobin-containing fresh meat product by mixing the blooming agent directly with the meat, such as with ground meat, for example. Alternatively an aqueous composition of the blooming agent may be prepared and mixed with the meat. The aqueous composition may be a slurry of the myoglobin blooming agent with water or a solution of the myoglobin blooming agent in water.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Other additives known to one skilled in the art can be added in addition to the blooming agent. These additives can be added directly to the food product or to the packaging film, either incorporated within or coated or dusted on the surface. Examples of other additives include monosodium glutamate, salt, cereal, soybean flour, soy protein concentrate, lactose, corn syrup solids, antimycotics (which suppress the growth of yeasts and molds), antibiotics, sugar, glycerol, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, &#x3b1;-tocopherol, phosphates, rosemary extract and sodium benzoate.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Myoglobin blooming agents and solutions or dispersions thereof may be colorless such as sodium nitrate, or, e.g., such as sodium nitrite may have an intrinsic pale color (i.e., may not be totally colorless), but this color does not typically have sufficient intensity itself to act as a significant colorant or color additive. However, this does not preclude either the use of colored myoglobin blooming agents which impart an intrinsic color or the, combination of a myoglobin blooming agent in combination with one or more natural and/or artificial colorants, pigments, dyes and/or flavorants such as annatto, bixin, norbixin, beet powder, caramel, carmine, cochineal, turmeric, paprika, liquid smoke, erythrosine, betanine, one or more FD&#x26;C colorants, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The myoglobin blooming agent is believed to cause an interaction with myoglobin in meat products, thereby maintaining, promoting or enhancing a desirable meat color. Myoglobin includes a non-protein portion called heme and a protein portion called globin. The heme portion includes an iron atom in a planar ring. The globin portion can provide a three-dimensional structure that surrounds the heme group and stabilizes the molecule. The heme group provides an open binding site that can bind certain ligands having the proper shape and electron configuration to the iron atom. When a ligand enters and binds to the heme pocket, the electron configuration of the ligand can change the shape of the globin portion of the molecule in a manner that affects light absorption characteristics of the heme group. Therefore, the presence or absence of a ligand such as oxygen in the heme pocket, and the ligand itself can result in visible color changes of myoglobin.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">When there is no ligand in the heme pocket, myoglobin is called deoxymyoglobin, which has a purple color (which is sometimes characterized as purple, deep red, dark red, reddish blue or bluish red). Molecular oxygen, O<sub>2 </sub>(&#x201c;oxygen&#x201d;) readily acts as a ligand that binds to the heme group, permitting biological transport of oxygen from the blood stream to the mitochondria within cells. When oxygen binds to the heme pocket, purple deoxymyoglobin becomes oxymyoglobin, characterized by a red color. Upon dissociation of the oxygen ligand from oxymyoglobin, the iron atom is oxidized leaving the iron in the ferric state. The oxidation of the iron atom renders the molecule incapable of normal oxygen binding. As the chemical state of iron can change from ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), the three-dimensional structure of the globin part can change in a manner that allows water molecules to bind to the heme pocket. Binding of a water molecule in the ferric iron containing heme pocket affects light absorption of the heme pocket. The oxidized form of myoglobin with a water molecule in the heme group is referred to as metmyoglobin and its color is brown. The oxidation of the iron atom is believed to result in a brown color. Heme ligands other than oxygen or water may also affect meat color. For example, the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) may cause fresh meat to have a desirable bright red color similar to oxygen. Although it has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO) can cause a dull red or stable pink in the case of cured meat which also contains sodium chloride, it has been discovered that in the absence of oxygen NO may produce a desired bright red color similar to that caused by oxygen in uncooked meat, especially in fresh, raw, unprocessed or uncured meat. It has been discovered that the development of this desired bright red color may take many hours and typically may take from 1 to 5 days and that initially, the meat color in a vacuum package having an oxygen barrier may turn to an undesirable brown until the unexpected transformation to the desired red takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Other variables that affect the stability of the globin portion also affect the affinity of the heme group for oxygen and the tendency of the chemical state of the iron atom to become oxidized. Acidity and high temperature, such as that associated with cooking, can denature the globin part thus leading to instability of the heme group. In the absence of stabilizing ligands, the oxidation of the heme iron is automatic when the globin is denatured.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Polymeric Food Packaging Films</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the present invention, oxygen barrier, food packaging articles may include food contact surfaces comprising a myoglobin blooming agent are provided. A &#x201c;food contact surface&#x201d; refers to the portion of a packaging material that is designed to contact a packaged meat product surface. Preferably, the food packaging article includes a food contact surface comprising a myoglobin blooming agent in an amount effective to promote or maintain a desirable color after contact with a meat product. The myoglobin blooming agent (MBA) preferably will contact the meat surface in an amount sufficient to produce a desired red color which preferably does not penetrate to an undesirable depth of the food thickness under reduced oxygen conditions (this color may take awhile to develop, e.g., 1 to 5 days). Beneficially, the MBA may be present on the film food contact surface (or on the myoglobin-containing food product surface) in an amount of from about 0.01 to 3 to 5 to 10 &#x3bc;moles/in<sup>2 </sup>and in increments of 0.1 &#x3bc;mole thereof. Greater or lesser amounts of MBA may be used, and the color intensity may thereby be varied depending upon the relative presence or absence of myoglobin.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Thus, the food contact surface of the food packaging article preferably contains a myoglobin blooming agent in a concentration high enough to produce and/or maintain a desired surface coloration of a fresh meat product, but low enough to prevent undesirable extension of the color into the body of the meat product. Preferably, the myoglobin blooming agent is present on a food contact surface in a concentration that is sufficient upon contact with a meat surface to convert at least 50% of the targeted myoglobin molecules to a desired ligand binding state. The available amount or concentration of myoglobin blooming agent is preferably selected to bind ligands producing desirable coloration of the meat to the myoglobin molecules in the outermost %-inch, or &#x2159;, &#x215b;, 1/10, 1/12, 1/16 or 1/20-inch or less of the meat product, although deeper penetrations may be accomplished if desired. For example, a nitric oxide donating myoglobin blooming agent is desirably present in a concentration sufficient to convert at least 50% of the myoglobin molecules on the contacting meat surface to nitric oxide myoglobin. The myoglobin blooming agent may be coated on a monolayer film or on the interior layer of a multilayer film or it may be incorporated therein.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The myoglobin blooming agent is preferably evenly or uniformly distributed on the surface of the food contact surface The minimum amount required to cause the desired coloration depends on the concentration of myoglobin present in the food product. For example, beef products containing 10 mg/gm of myoglobin may require 10 times more myoglobin blooming agent than poultry products containing 1 mg/gm of myoglobin. Also, if the desired depth of penetration is 0.25 inches, then, in order to affect all of the myoglobin molecules (molecular weight of myoglobin is about 17,000 g/mole) in 1 square inch of beef to a depth of 0.25 inches, there would have to be at least 2.4 &#x3bc;moles (micromoles) of the myoglobin blooming agent available for transfer via the surface of 1 square inch of film (one square inch of beef to a depth of about 0.25 inches equals about 4.1 grams of meat (specific gravity of 1 gm/cc)). Sodium nitrite as a preferred myoglobin blooming agent has a molecular weight of 69 g/mole. Thus 2.4 &#x3bc;moles of NaNO<sub>2 </sub>weighs 0.166 mg and the total amount of myoglobin in 4.1 grams of meat containing 10 mg/gm is 41 mg. Beef meat typically contains myoglobin at a level of 3-10 mg/gm. The preferred amount of myoglobin blooming agent that would be present on the article is 0.72-2.4 &#x3bc;moles/in<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, pork contains myoglobin at a level of 1-3 mg/gm. A packaging article for this application would provide 0.24-0.72 &#x3bc;moles/in<sup>2</sup>. Poultry having less than 1 mg/gm of myoglobin would preferably use a packaging article providing less than 0.24 &#x3bc;moles/in<sup>2</sup>, e.g., 0.12 &#x3bc;moles/in<sup>2</sup>. An article using sodium nitrite (MW=69 g/mole) as a myoglobin blooming agent would preferably provide 0.050-0.166 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>for beef meat products; 0.017-0.050 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>for pork meat products; and less than 0.017 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>for poultry meat products. An article providing 0.17 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>would be suitable for a variety of types of fresh meat.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">A higher amount of myoglobin blooming agent may be preferred for darker colored muscles that may contain higher levels of myoglobin. When the myoglobin blooming agent is incorporated into the polymer matrix that comprises the food contact layer of a monolayer or multilayer packaging film, only a portion of it is able to effectively migrate from the film surface to the product's surface to interact with the myoglobin. Film inclusion levels of up to 20 times or higher of the amount required for effective color fixing is anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Thus, the amount of myoglobin blooming agent per unit area of the food contact surface can be selected to provide a desired food coloration of a packaged fresh meat product surface. For example, the food contact layer can include about 0.005 to about 0.900 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>of a myoglobin blooming agent such as sodium nitrite, preferably about 0.010 to about 0.400 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>and most preferably about 0.100 to about 0.300 mg/in<sup>2</sup>. For beef products, a food contact layer may include e.g. about 0.200 to about 0.250 mg/in<sup>2</sup>, e.g., of a sodium nitrite myoglobin blooming agent, while lower concentrations, e.g., of about 0.100 to about 0.150 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>may be used for pork products.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">A uniform dispersion or coating having particle size of 35 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) or less, preferably 10 &#x3bc;m or less is desirable. Although larger particle sizes may also be used, the film prior to use is less aesthetically pleasing. If particle size is too large, an initial spotty appearance may result although results tend to even out and become more uniform over time and such desirable color uniformity (i.e., lack of spottiness or blotches) is often present upon color transformation from brown to red. Advantageously, the myoglobin blooming agent may be applied in a manner to wet out the surface of the food contact layer of the film using film forming agents, surfactants, binding agents and other compounds for the purpose. For example, the myoglobin blooming agent according to the present invention may be sprayed on a food contact surface of the film. Tubular films and casings also may be coated by other means (including the well known methods of dipping and slugging). Typical myoglobin blooming agents do not easily pass through the film wall and therefore it is preferable to slug the myoglobin blooming agent inside the tube and/or apply the myoglobin blooming agent to the inner surface of the tube during (e.g., during a shirring operation) via a spray, because external application (e.g., by dipping) would require a complex and more costly operation of turning the tube inside out to provide contact between the myoglobin blooming agent and the meat contact surface. Application of other additives and coating compositions via solution spraying during or just prior to shirring is convenient, economical and facilitates placement of a regular measured distribution of a coating on the interior tube surface. For example, lubricants and other compositions have been applied by various means such as slugging, spraying, or contact coating the inner surface of a tubular polymeric casing via a shirring mandrel and such means are well known (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,378,379 (Shiner); 3,451,827 (Bridgeford); 4,397,891 (Kaelberer et al.); 5,256,458 (Oxley et al.); 5,573,800 (Wilhoit); and 6,143,344 (Jon et al.), which are all incorporated by reference in their entireties.) Packages made according to the present invention, may be coated with the inventive myoglobin blooming agent by slugging to provide a uniformly thick coating.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Tubular forms or nontubular (e.g., sheets or webs) forms of the food packaging film may be coated by dry or wet spraying or dusting or by roll coating or coating using a Mayer bar or doctor blade, or by printing means (e.g., using gravure or flexography printing) or by using electrostatic transfer. Also, application may occur at various points in the manufacturing process including for example, by blending, incorporation in a masterbatch or addition to the polymeric layer prior to extrusion, or by dusting, spraying or coating during or after extrusion or during bubble or tube formation or during winding, or bag making e.g. in a dusting or powdering step.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In one embodiment of the invention, it is contemplated that a food contact layer may comprise between about 1,000 ppm (0.1%) and about 50,000 ppm (5.0%) of a myoglobin blooming agent, more preferably about 5,000 ppm to about 25,000 ppm, and most preferably about 7,500 ppm to about 20,000 ppm. Typically, a food contact layer comprises about 1.5 weight % to about 2.0 weight % or less (15,000 ppm-20,000 ppm) of a nitrite salt for packaging a fresh ground beef product, or about 0.75 weight % to about 1.5 weight % of a nitrite salt for packaging a fresh, pork meat product. Amounts in a range of 0.75 to 2.25 weight % may be advantageously employed for a variety of meats.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">According to the invention, single-layer food packaging films may be provided that comprise a myoglobin blooming agent. In another embodiment the food packaging film may also be a multilayer film. The inventive food packaging films can have any suitable composition or configuration. Preferably, the food packaging film fulfills multiple functional requirements which may be present in one or more or a combination of layers. For example a single layer film may combine the functions of oxygen barrier and myoglobin blooming agent contact with one or more additional functions such as puncture resistance, abuse resistance, printability, moisture barrier, heat sealability, transparency, high gloss, low toxicity, high temperature resistance, low temperature flexibility, etc. Alternatively, multiple layers may be employed to add functionality. The present invention is adapted for use in a wide variety of commercially available packaging films such as those sold by: Curwood, Inc. under the trademarks ABP, Clear-Tite, Cook-Tite, Perflex, Pro-Guard, Pro-Tite, Curlam&#xae;, Curlon&#xae; and Surround; and by others e.g. marketed by the Alcan, Asahi, Cryovac, Kureha, Vector, Pactiv, Printpack, Viskase and Wipak, under the trademarks or brand names Cryovac&#xae; T-Series, Cryovac&#xae; E-Seal Materials, Alcan Q&#xae; Series, Alcan Peel Rite&#x2122; Peel Systems, Alcan Q<sup>4 </sup>Forming Films, Krehalon&#xae;, Alcan Mara Flex&#xae; Non-Forming Films, Wipak Combitherm, Wipak Bialon, Wipak Biaxer, and Wipak Biaxop. A typical beneficial food packaging film according to embodiments of the present invention may have an interior surface food contact layer which also serves as a sealant layer, and a heat resistant and abuse resistant exterior surface layer with a core layer there between which comprises an oxygen barrier material. Another common suitable film has adhesive layers on either side of the core oxygen barrier layer to connect with the surface layers.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In another embodiment of the invention, a food package may comprise a myoglobin-containing food product such as fresh meat having a water content of at least 5 weight %; and a container comprising an oxygen barrier thermoplastic film having a polymeric food contact layer and a tray; wherein the container encloses the food product in a reduced oxygen environment; and the food product is maintained in a modified atmosphere comprising a nitrogen or sulfur containing gaseous myoglobin blooming agent, or mixtures thereof. The MBAs described throughout this specification may also be used in this embodiment. It is further contemplated that either gaseous or non-gaseous MBAs may be used as well as combinations thereof in various embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The multilayer food packaging film embodiments of the present invention may have an exterior surface and an interior surface, and include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or more polymeric film layers.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Film Thickness</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The food packaging article may be in the form of a monolayer or multilayer film having a total thickness of less than about 10 mils, more preferably the film has a total thickness of from about 0.5 to 10 mils (12.7-254 microns (&#x3bc;)). Advantageously, many embodiments may have a thickness from about 1 to 5 mils, with certain typical embodiments being from about 1.5 to 3 mils. For example, entire single or multilayer films or any single layer of a multilayer film can have any suitable thicknesses, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 mils, or any increment of 0.1 or 0.01 mil therebetween. Thicker and thinner films are also provided. Although suitable films for packaging foodstuffs as thick as 4 mils (101.6 microns) or higher, or as thin as 1 mil (25.4 microns) or less may be made, it is expected that the most common films will be between about 1.5-3 mil (38-76 microns). Especially preferred for use as films for food packaging are films where the multilayer film has a thickness of between about 2 to 3 mils (50.8-76.2 microns). Such films may have good abuse resistance and machinability.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The food packaging article may be in the form of a monolayer or multilayer sheet having a total thickness of at least 10 mils, more preferably the sheet has a total thickness of from about 10 to 50 mils, most preferably the sheet has a total thickness of from about 10 to 30 mils.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Food Contact/Heat Sealing Lavers</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">It is essential that the food packaging film of the present invention has a food contact layer. This food contact layer may also function as a heat sealing or heat sealable layer to facilitate formation of hermetically sealed packages, although tubular plastic casings may also be used and sealed, e.g., by clips as known in the art. Preferred films of the present invention utilize a food contact layer which has heat sealing properties.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The terms &#x201c;heat sealing layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;sealant layer&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to a layer which is heat sealable, i.e., capable of fusion bonding by conventional indirect heating means which generate sufficient heat on at least one film contact surface for conduction to the contiguous film contact surface and formation of a bond interface therebetween without loss of the film integrity. The bond interface between contiguous inner layers preferably has sufficient physical strength to withstand the packaging process and subsequent handling including, e.g., tensions resulting from stretching or shrinking attendant with the presence of a food body sealed within a package utilizing a film having a heat sealable layer. Advantageously, the bond interface is preferably sufficiently thermally stable to prevent gas or liquid leakage therethrough when exposed to above or below ambient temperatures, e.g., during one or more of the following: packaging operations, storage, handling, transport, display, or processing of food. Heat seals may be designed to meet different conditions of expected use and various heat seal formulations are known in the art and may be employed with the present invention. In certain optional embodiments, heat seals may be subjected to pasteurization or cook-in temperatures and conditions, e.g., in a sealed bag, vacuum skin package (vsp) or sealed tray form. For use in cook-in applications heat seals should withstand elevated temperatures up to about 160-180&#xb0; F. (71-82&#xb0; C.) or higher e.g. 212&#xb0; F. (100&#xb0; C.) for extended periods of time, e.g., up to 4 to 12 hours in environments which may range from heated humidified air or steam to submersion in heated water. Preferably, the food contact or heat seal layer is heat sealable to itself, but may be sealable to other objects, films or layers, e.g., to a tray when used as a lidding film, or to an outer layer in a lap seal or in certain tray overwrap embodiments. Also, in certain embodiments, the myoglobin blooming agent containing food contact layer need not be heat sealable.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A sealing layer is preferably positioned at or near the interior surface of the packaging film, and can be an interior surface layer which allows a monolayer or multilayer film to be formed into a resulting package, e.g., when used as a clamshell container, sealed to a tray, e.g., when used as a lidding film, or sealed to a lidding film, e.g., when used as a tray. The sealant layer may comprise a myoglobin blooming agent and a suitable heat-sealable polymer, such as an ethylene-&#x3b1;-olefin copolymer, nylon blends or ionomer. The exterior layer may also be a heat sealable layer and used in place of or in addition to the interior layer for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The food contact layer may comprise a sealant layer and may comprise a heat sealable polymeric material such as a polyolefin or blend thereof, e.g., polyethylenes such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), ethylene &#x3b1;-olefin copolymers, including, e.g., plastomers, very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) or polypropylene homopolymers, polypropylene copolymers, or homogeneous polyolefin resins, such as those made with constrained geometry catalysts or metallocene single-site catalysts, including, e.g., copolymers of ethylene or propylene with at least one C<sub>4-8 or higher </sub>&#x3b1;-olefins (e.g., butene-1, hexene-1 or octene-1 or combinations thereof) with a majority of polymeric units derived from ethylene or propylene. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, ethylene butyl acetate copolymers (EBA), ethylene methyl acetate copolymers (EMA), ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers (EMAA) or ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers (EEA) are also suitable materials for forming the inner surface heat sealable layer. A food contact and/or sealant layer may also comprise an ionomer which is essentially a metal salt neutralized copolymer of ethylene and acrylic or methacrylic acid. Suitable sealant/food contact layer materials often include ionomers, polyolefins or blends thereof, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,964,816; 6,861,127; 6,815,023; 6,773,820; 6,682,825; 6,316,067; and 5,759,648; 5,663,002; and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos.: 2005/0129969 (Schell et al.); and 2004/0166262 (Busche et al.) which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Food contact or sealant layers may also comprise nylon, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonates, cyclic olefin copolymers, polyacrylonitrile or copolymers or blends thereof. The food contact layer may be 100% of the thickness of the total structure. The food contact or sealant layers in multilayer structures may be of any thickness with thicknesses in multilayer structures of up to 1% to 5% to 15% to 50% or more of the total thickness contemplated. Preferred examples of such sealable resins comprising a food contact and/or sealant layer include ethylene &#x3b1;-olefin copolymers commercially available from: Dow Chemical Company under a trade names of &#x201c;AFFINITY&#x201d;, &#x201c;ATTANE&#x201d; or &#x201c;ELITE&#x201d; (including octene-1 as &#x3b1;-olefin); and ExxonMobil Co. under a trade name of &#x201c;EXACT&#x201d; (including hexene-1, butene-1 and octene-1 as comonomer); ionomers commercially available from DuPont Company under the trade name Surlyn&#xae;.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Barrier Layers</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Barrier layers can be made comprising a myoglobin blooming agent. The barrier layer preferably functions as a gas barrier layer, although other types of barriers such as moisture barrier layers can also include the myoglobin blooming agent. The gas barrier layer is preferably an oxygen barrier layer, and is preferably a core layer positioned between the first and second layers. For example, the oxygen barrier layer can be in contact with a first surface layer and an adhesive layer or may be sandwiched between two tie layers and/or two surface layers.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">To achieve all the benefits of the present invention it is essential that the myoglobin blooming agent film be used in a package in combination with a reduced oxygen atmosphere. The barrier layer can provide a suitable barrier to oxygen for the desired preservation of the article to be packaged under the anticipated storage conditions. In one aspect, an oxygen barrier is used in the meat package or packaging film that is maintained at a reduced oxygen atmosphere. The oxygen barrier is preferably selected to provide oxygen permeability sufficiently diminished to permit a desirable color to be induced or maintained within the packaged meat. For example, a film may comprise an oxygen barrier having an oxygen permeability that is low enough to reduce the myoglobin reducing activity of metmyoglobin reducing enzymes in the meat, and/or maintain a reduced oxygen atmosphere in contact with the meat to reduce oxygen binding to myoglobin on the surface of the packaged fresh meat.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The oxygen barrier layer can comprise any suitable material, such as nylon, EVOH, PVOH, polyvinylidene chloride, polyamide, polyester, polyalkylene carbonate, polyacrylonitrile, nanocomposite, a metallized film such as aluminum vapor deposited on a polyolefin, etc., as known to those of skill in the art. The oxygen barrier layer of a film may preferably comprise EVOH, although oxygen barrier layers comprising polyvinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer (PVDC or VDC-VC) or vinylidene chloride-methylacrylate copolymer (VDC-MA) as well as blends thereof may also be preferable. The barrier layer may also provide desirable optical properties when stretch oriented, including transparency and low haze and a stretching behavior compatible with the layers around it. It is desirable that the thickness of the barrier layer be selected to provide the desired combination of the performance properties sought, e.g., with respect to oxygen permeability, shrinkage values especially at low temperatures, ease of orientation, delamination resistance, and optical properties. Suitable thicknesses in multilayer films are less than 15%, e.g., from 3 to 13% of the total film thickness and preferably less than about 10% of the total thickness of the multilayer film. Greater thicknesses may be employed however oxygen barrier polymers tend to be relatively expensive and therefore it is expected that less costly resins will be used in other layers to impart desirable properties once a suitable thickness is used to achieve the desired gas barrier property for the film layer combination. For example, the thickness of a core oxygen barrier layer may advantageously be less than about 0.45 mil (10.16 microns) and greater than about 0.05 mil (1.27 microns), including 0.10, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, or 0.45 mil thick.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Preferably, multilayer films include a core oxygen barrier layer. Any suitable material can be used to form an oxygen barrier layer. The oxygen barrier layer of a film may preferably comprise EVOH, although oxygen barrier layers comprising polyvinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer (PVDC or VDC-VC) or vinylidene chloride-methylacrylate copolymer (VDC-MA) as well as blends thereof, may also be preferable. One preferred EVOH barrier material is a 44 mol % EVOH resin E151B sold by Eval Company of America, under the trade name Eval&#xae; LC-E151B. Another example of an EVOH that may be acceptable can be purchased from Nippon Gohsei (or Soarus, LLC in the USA) under the trade name Soarnol&#xae; AT (44 mol % ethylene EVOH) or Soarnol&#xae; ET (38 mol % ethylene EVOH). Oxygen barrier films comprising EVOH for packaging food products containing a myoglobin blooming agent can be formed by methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,018,719; 6,815,023; 6,777,046; 6,511,688; 5,759,648; 5,382,470; and 4,064,296 all of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Suitable nylons or nylon blends may also be used to impart oxygen barrier properties. Combinations of barrier materials may also be used. For example, multiple barrier layers of nylon and EVOH are often used to impart suitable barrier properties in food and meat packaging as are blends of EVOH and nylon. These and other known materials can also be used to form an oxygen barrier layer.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">For perishable food packaging, the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) permeability desirably should be minimized. Typical oxygen barrier films will have an O<sub>2 </sub>permeability of less than about 310 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2 </sup>for a 24 hour period at 1 atmosphere, 0% relative humidity and 23&#xb0; C., and preferably less than 75 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/day, more preferably less than 20 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/day. Barrier resins such as PVDC or EVOH in the core layer may be adjusted by blending in compatible polymers to vary orientation parameters or the gas permeability, e.g. O<sub>2</sub>, of the films. The thickness of the core layer may also be varied and beneficially may be from about 0.05 to about 0.30 mils (1.3-7.62 microns).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Abuse-Resistant Outer Layer</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Since it is seen by the user/consumer, in both the monolayer and multilayer packaging film embodiments of the invention, the exterior surface of the film should enhance optical properties of the film and may preferably have highgloss. Also, it should withstand contact with sharp objects and provide abrasion resistance, and for these reasons, it is often termed the abuse-resistant layer. This exterior abuse-resistant layer may or may not also be used as a heat sealable layer. As the exterior surface layer of the film, this layer most often is also the exterior layer of any package, bag, pouch, tray or other container made from the inventive film, and is therefore subject to handling and abuse, e.g., from equipment during packaging, and from rubbing against other packages and shipping containers and storage shelves during transport and storage. This contact causes abrasive forces, stresses and pressures which may abrade away the film causing defects to printing, diminished optical characteristics or even punctures or breaches in the integrity of the package. Therefore the exterior surface layer is typically made from materials chosen to be resistant to abrasive and puncture forces and other stresses and abuse which the packaging may encounter during use. The exterior surface layer should be easy to machine (i.e., be easy to feed through and be manipulated by machines, e.g., for conveying, packaging, printing or as part of the film or bag manufacturing process). It should also facilitate stretch orientation where a high shrinkage film is desired, particularly at low temperatures such as 90&#xb0; C. and lower. Suitable stiffness, flexibility, flex crack resistance, modulus, tensile strength, coefficient of friction, printability, and optical properties are also frequently designed into exterior layers by suitable choice of materials. This layer may also be chosen to have characteristics suitable for creating desired heat seals which may be resistance to burn through, e.g., by impulse sealers, or may be used as a heat sealing surface in certain package embodiments, e.g., using overlap seals.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The exterior layer may be formed of a similar blend to that of the interior layer. In one embodiment, at least one and preferably both interior and exterior layers utilize polyolefin resins, preferably a blend of (i) EVA, (ii) EAO (such as VLDPE), and (iii) an ethylene-hexene-1 copolymer having an mp of 80 to 98&#xb0; C., preferably 80 to 92&#xb0; C. Each of the three polymers typically comprises 20 to 40 weight % of the layer. EVA, when used in the outer layer preferably has 3% to 18% vinyl acetate content to provide good shrinkability, if shrinkability is desired. Blends of EAOs are also usefully employed in the outer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The exterior layer thickness is typically 0.5 to 1.0 mils. Thinner layers may be less effective for abuse resistance, however thicker layers, though more expensive, may advantageously be used to produce films having unique highly desirable puncture resistance and/or abuse resistance properties. Heavy gauge films, typically 5 to 7 mils or more, are needed in demanding applications, which are usually satisfied by very expensive and complex laminated film structures and/or secondary packaging materials such as bone guards, pads, and overwrap.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In one barrier layer embodiment of this invention, an exterior thermoplastic layer of the enclosing multilayer film is on the opposite side of a core layer from the interior layer, and in direct contact with the environment. In a suitable three layer embodiment, this exterior layer is directly adhered to the core layer which is preferably an oxygen barrier layer.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Intermediate Layers</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">An intermediate layer is any layer between the exterior layer and the interior layer and may include oxygen barrier layers, tie layers or layers having functional attributes useful for the film structure or its intended uses. Intermediate layers may be used to improve, impart or otherwise modify a multitude of characteristics, e.g., printability for trap printed structures, shrinkability, orientability, processability, machinability, tensile properties, drape, flexibility, stiffness, modulus, designed delamination, easy opening features, tear properties, strength, elongation, optical, moisture barrier, oxygen or other gas barrier, radiation selection or barrier, e.g., to ultraviolet wavelengths, etc.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Tie Layers</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In addition to the exterior layer, the interior layer, and intermediate layer such as a barrier layer, a multilayer packaging film can further comprise one or more adhesive layers, also known in the art as &#x201c;tie layers,&#x201d; which can be selected to promote the adherence of adjacent layers to one another in a multilayer film and prevent undesirable delamination. A multifunctional layer is preferably formulated to aid in the adherence of one layer to another layer without the need of using separate adhesives by virtue of the compatibility of the materials in that layer to the first and second layers. In some embodiments, adhesive layers comprise materials found in both the first and second layers. The adhesive layer may suitably be less than 10% and preferably between 2% and 10% of the overall thickness of the multilayer film. Adhesive resins are often more expensive than other polymers so the tie layer thickness is usually kept to a minimum consistent with the desired effect. In one embodiment, a multilayer film comprises a three layer structure with an adhesive layer positioned between and in contact with the first layer and the second layer. In another embodiment, a multilayer film comprises a multilayer structure comprising a first adhesive layer positioned between and in direct contact with the exterior layer and a core oxygen barrier layer; and preferably and optionally, has a second tie layer between and in direct contact with the same core oxygen barrier layer and the interior layer to produce a five layer film.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Multilayer films can comprise any suitable number of tie or adhesive layers of any suitable composition. Various adhesive layers are formulated and positioned to provide a desired level of adhesion between specific layers of the film according to the composition of the layers contacted by the tie layers.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">For example adhesive layers in contact with a layer comprising polyester, such as PET, preferably comprise a suitable blend of polyolefins with other adhesive polymers. One preferred component of an adhesive layer in contact with a PET polyester layer is EMAC SP 1330 (which reportedly has: a density of 0.948 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; melt index of 2.0 g/10 min.; a melting point of 93&#xb0; C.; a softening point of 49&#xb0; C.; and a methyl acrylate (MA) content of 22%).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The interior, exterior, intermediate or tie layers may be formed of any suitable thermoplastic materials, for example, polyamides, polystyrenes, styrenic copolymers, e.g., styrene-butadiene copolymer, polyolefins, and in particular members of the polyethylene family such as LLDPE, VLDPE, HDPE, LDPE, ethylene vinyl ester copolymer or ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymer, polypropylenes, ethylene-propylene copolymers, ionomers, polybutylenes, alpha-olefin polymers, polyesters, polycarbonates, cyclic olefin copolymers, polyurethanes, polyacrylamides, anhydride-modified polymers, acrylate-modified polymers, polylactic acid polymers, or various blends of two or more of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In another embodiment, the exterior, interior and/or one or more intermediate layers can comprise or consist essentially of a nylon blend composition. Preferably, the nylon blend composition comprises at least an amorphous nylon such as nylon 6I/6T copolymer, in combination with at least one semi-crystalline nylon homopolymer or copolymer such as nylon 6/12, nylon 6/69, nylon 6/66, MXD6 nylon, nylon 6, nylon 11, or nylon 12.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In another embodiment of the invention, one or more of the exterior, interior and/or one or more intermediate layers comprises at least one polyester polymer. Preferred polyester polymers comprise aromatic polyesters and more preferably, are homopolymers or copolymers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate and blends thereof. Suitable polyesters may have an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.60 to about 1.2, preferably between 0.60 to 0.80. The polyester may be an aliphatic polyester resin, but is preferably an aromatic polyester resin. For example, polyester materials can be derived from dicarboxylic acid components, including terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid as preferred examples, and also dimers of unsaturated aliphatic acids. Examples of a diol component as another component for synthesizing the polyester may include: polyalkylene glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, hexamethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and polytetramethylene oxide glycol; 1,4-cyclohexane-dimethanol, and 2-alkyl-1,3-propanediol. More specifically, examples of dicarboxylic acids constituting the polyester resin may include: terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, 5-t-butylisophthalic acid, naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, diphenyl ether dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane-dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, and dimer acids comprising dimers of unsaturated fatty acids. These acids may be used singly or in combination of two or more species. The diols may be used singly or in combination of two or more species.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Polyester compositions that comprise an aromatic polyester resin comprising an aromatic dicarboxylic acid component can be preferred in some aspects, including, e.g., polyesters between terephthalic acid (as a dicarboxylic acid) and diols having at most 10 carbon atoms, such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate. Particularly preferred examples thereof may include: copolyesters obtained by replacing a portion, preferably at most 30 mol %, more preferably at most 15 mol %, of the terephthalic acid with another dicarboxylic acid, such as isophthalic acid; copolyesters obtained by replacing a portion of the diol component such as ethylene glycol with another diol, such as 1,4-cyclohexane-dimethanol (e.g., &#x201c;Voridian 9921&#x201d;, made by Voridian division of Eastman Chemical Co.); and polyester-polyether copolymers comprising the polyester as a predominant component (e.g., polyester-ether between a dicarboxylic acid component principally comprising terephthalic acid or/and its ester derivative and a diol component principally comprising tetramethylene glycol and tetramethylene oxide glycol, preferably containing the polytetra methylene oxide glycol residue in a proportion of 10-15 weight %). It is also possible to use two or more different polyester resins in mixture. Examples of preferred polyesters are available under the trademarks Voridian 9663, Voridian 9921 and EASTAR&#xae; Copolyester 6763, all from Eastman Chemical Company, Kingsport, Tenn., U.S.A. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,964,816 to Schell et al. and 6,699,549 to Ueyama et al. which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, both disclose multilayer structures comprising a polyester layer, and a polyamide layer.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Optional Additives to Layers</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Various additives may be included in the polymers utilized in one or more of the exterior, interior and intermediate or tie layers of food packaging comprising the same. For example, a layer may be coated with an antiblock powder. Also, conventional antioxidant, antiblock additives, polymeric plasticizers, acid, moisture or gas (such as oxygen) scavengers, slip agents, colorants, dyes, pigments, organoleptic agents may be added to one or more film layers of the film or it may be free from such added ingredients. If the exterior layer is corona treated, slip agent may be used or not, but it will contain or be coated with an antiblock powder or agent such as silica or starch. Processing aides are typically used in amounts less than 10%, less than 7% and preferably less than 5% of the layer weight. A preferred processing aid for use in the outer layer of the film includes one or more of fluoroelastomers, stearamides, erucamides, and silicates.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Preferred films may also provide a beneficial combination of one or more or all of the properties including low haze, high gloss, high or low shrinkage values at 90&#xb0; C. or less, good machinability, good mechanical strength and good barrier properties including high barriers to oxygen and water permeability.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Methods of Manufacture</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The inventive monolayer or multilayer packaging film may be made by conventional processes which are modified to provide for inclusion of a myoglobin blooming agent. These processes to produce flexible films may include, e.g., cast or blown film processes. The monolayer and multilayer films may be manufactured by known methods in the art as modified as described herein for inclusion of a myoglobin blooming agent. Descriptions of suitable film manufacturing and orientation processes are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,759,648; 6,316,067 and 6,773,820, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0166262 (Busche et al.), entitled, &#x201c;Easy Open Heat-Shrinkable Packaging,&#x201d; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Various manufacturing methods may be used as will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the present teaching. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,448,792 (Schirmer) discloses a method comprising the steps of coextrusion, biaxial orientation and irradiation, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,741,253 (Brax et al.) discloses a method of extrusion, irradiation, extrusion lamination/coating and biaxial orientation, and both patents are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The processes may be modified to eliminate uniaxial or biaxial orientation or to add a subsequent annealing step to form a non-shrink film.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In a preferred process for making films, the resins and any additives are introduced to an extruder (generally one extruder per layer) where the resins are melt plastified by heating and then are transferred to an extrusion (or coextrusion) die for formation into a tube and/or flat sheet. Extruder and die temperatures will generally depend upon the particular resin or resin containing mixtures being processed and suitable temperature ranges for commercially available resins are generally known in the art, or are provided in technical bulletins made available by resin manufacturers. Processing temperatures may vary depending upon other process parameters chosen. However, variations are expected which may depend upon such factors as variation of polymer resin selection, use of other resins, e.g., by blending or in separate layers in the multilayer film, the manufacturing process used and particular equipment and other process parameters utilized. Actual process parameters including process temperatures are expected to be set by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation in view of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As generally recognized in the art, resin properties may be further modified by blending two or more resins together and it is contemplated that various resins including, e.g., homopolymers and copolymers may comprise or be blended into individual layers of the multilayer film or added as additional layers, such resins include polyolefins such as ethylene-unsaturated ester copolymer resins, especially vinyl ester copolymers such as EVAs, or other ester polymers, very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), ionomers, polypropylenes, or blends thereof. Other polymers that may be included as separate layers or in combination include polyamides such as nylon, PVDC, EVOH, and PET. These resins and others may be mixed by well known methods using commercially available tumblers, mixers or blenders.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Also, if desired, well known additives such as antioxidant, processing aids, slip agents, antiblocking and antifogging agents, pigments, etc., and mixtures thereof may be incorporated into the film. For example, the myoglobin blooming agent containing layer and/or other layers may further comprise an antioxidant, a slip agent, an antiblock agent, a colorant, a color enhancer, a flavorant, an odorant, an organoleptic agent, a coefficient of friction modifying agent, a lubricant, a surfactant, an encapsulating agent, an oxygen scavenger, a pH modifying agent, a film forming agent, an emulsifier, a polyphosphate, a humectant, a drying agent, an antimicrobial agent, a chelating agent, a binder, a starch, a stabilizer, a buffer, a phospholipid, an oil, a fat, a protein, a polysaccharide, a transfer agent, or a combination thereof. Examples of particular compositions that may be added include: &#x3b1;-tocopherol; alcohol; annatto; ascorbic acid; beet powder; BHA; BHT; bixin; caramel; carmine; carotenoid pigment; casein; cochineal; cyclodextrin; dextrin; erucamide; ethoxylated mondiglycerides; fluoroelastomer; food grade oil; glycerine; lecithin; liquid smoke; nisin; norbixin; pediocin; polysorbate; potassium chloride; rosemary extract; shellac; sodium chloride; sodium erythorbate; starch; trisodium polyphosphate; turmeric; water; water soluble cellulose ether; and zein. Examples of coloring agents include methionine, cysteine and cooked cured meat pigments. Cooked cured meat pigments comprise a mononitric oxide complex of protoporphyrin Fe (II). Cooked cured meat pigments can be formed by reacting red blood cells with a nitrosating agent and a reductant and elevated temperatures as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,230,915; 5,443,852, and 5,425,956, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Various polymer modifiers may be incorporated for the purpose of improving toughness, orientability, extensibility and/or other properties of the film. Other modifiers which may be added include modifiers which improve low temperature toughness or impact strength and modifiers which reduce modulus or stiffness. Exemplary modifiers include styrene-butadiene, styrene-isoprene, and ethylene-propylene copolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;machine direction&#x201d;, herein abbreviated &#x201c;MD&#x201d;, refers to a direction &#x201c;along the length&#x201d; of the film, i.e., in the direction of the film as the film is formed during extrusion and/or coating. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;transverse direction&#x201d;, herein abbreviated &#x201c;TD&#x201d;, refers to a direction across the film, perpendicular to the machine or longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Typically, films are made heat shrinkable by stretch orientation. Stretch orientation may be accomplished by various known methods e.g. machine direction (MD) orientation is preferably accomplished with the use of sets of nip rolls rotating at different speeds to stretch or draw the film, sheet or tube in the machine direction thereby causing machine direction elongation which is set by cooling. Other methods include tentering which is commonly employed to orient sheets, or the well-known trapped bubble or double bubble technique for orienting tubes as for example described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,456,044 (Pahlke) which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In the bubble technique, an extruded primary tube leaving a tubular extrusion die is cooled, collapsed and then preferably oriented by reheating and inflating to form an expanded secondary bubble, which is again cooled and collapsed. This collapsed stretched film may be wound on a reel as a tube or slit into sheets or webs and wound, or it may be further processed, e.g., by annealing or irradiation as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Heat shrinkable films are typically biaxially stretched. Transverse direction (TD) orientation is accomplished by the above noted inflation to radially expand the heated film which is cooled to set the film in an expanded form or by pulling the film in the transverse direction during tentering. Orientation may be in either or both directions. Preferably, a primary tube is simultaneously biaxially stretched radially (transversely) and longitudinally (machine direction) to produce a multilayer film which is heat shrinkable at temperatures below the melting points of the major polymeric components, e.g., at 90&#xb0; C. or lower. The stretch ratio during orientation should be sufficient to provide a film with a total thickness of 10 mil or less and preferred films will be under 5 mil and typically between about 1.0 and 4.0 mils. The MD stretch ratio is typically 2%-6 and the TD stretch ratio is also typically 2&#xbd;A-6. An overall or total stretch ratio (MD stretch multiplied by TD stretch) of about 6&#xbc;x-36x is suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The general annealing process by which biaxially stretched heat shrinkable films are heated under controlled tension to reduce or eliminate shrinkage values is well known in the art. If desired, films may be annealed to produce lower shrinkage values as desired for the particular temperature. Accordingly, using an annealing process, heat-shrinkable films may be made into non-shrink films suitable for use in certain embodiments as described herein</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Optionally, films of the present invention may be subject to a variety of irradiative treatments. In the irradiation process, the film is subjected to an energetic radiation treatment, such as corona discharge, plasma, flame, ultraviolet, X-ray, gamma ray, beta ray, and high energy electron treatment. These irradiative treatments may be performed for a variety of reasons including e.g. modifying surface characteristics to improve surface adhesion to a variety of substances such as meat or printing ink, or to improve internal layer adhesion to ameliorate intralayer adhesion and avoid undesirable delamination. An important known use of irradiation is to induce cross-linking between molecules of the irradiated material. The irradiation of polymeric films to induce favorable properties such as crosslinking is well known in the art and is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,737,391 (Lustig et al.) and 4,064,296 (Bornstein et al.), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Bornstein et. al. discloses the use of ionizing radiation for crosslinking the polymer present in the film. In some preferred embodiments, it is preferred to crosslink the entire film to broaden the heat sealing range. This is preferably done by irradiation with an electron beam at dosage levels of at least about 2 megarads (MR) and preferably in the range of 3 to 8 MR, although higher dosages may be employed. Irradiation may be done on the primary tube, with or without additional layers being coated thereon, or after biaxial orientation. The latter, called post-irradiation, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,391 (Lustig et al.). An advantage of post-irradiation is that a relatively thin film is treated instead of the relatively thick primary tube, thereby reducing the power requirement for a given treatment level.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Alternatively, crosslinking may be achieved by addition of a chemical crosslinking agent or by use of irradiation in combination with a crosslinking modifier added to one or more of the layers, as for example described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,328 (Evert et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Fundamental to the present invention is inclusion of a myoglobin blooming agent with an oxygen barrier film. The packaging films can have any suitable structure, but it is essential that the myoglobin blooming agent be on, or in, or able to migrate to, a food contact surface of the film.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Whether the myoglobin blooming agent is coated on or incorporated within an interior food contact layer, it may be applied by any suitable method, e.g., as described above, including dry or wet spraying, dusting, blending, coating, e.g., with transfer rollers, slugging, inclusion in a masterbatch, printing, etc. The myoglobin blooming agent is preferably evenly dispersed over the contact surface of the layer and/or throughout the entire layer to enable any length of film incorporating the layer to include approximately similar amounts of the compound within the sealing layer for a uniform transfer to meat via surface contact.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Where the myoglobin blooming agent is coated on the film food contact layer surface it may be conveniently applied at various times. For example, the agent may be applied to the meat surface, e.g., by dipping or spraying just before packaging, or during a bag making operation with or without admixture with starch used as a means to facilitate subsequent bag opening. It may be applied during winding operations attendant to slitting operations or during pouch making or tube making. It may be applied before or after irradiative treatments. It may be applied with or in place of starch utilizing electron beam irradiation and/or corona treatment as further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,611 (Wilhoit et al.) which is hereby incorporated by reference. Many myoglobin blooming agents are soluble in water or alcohol, and solutions of a myoglobin blooming agent may be coated on films either alone or incorporated with other agents such as film forming and/or wetting agents or other materials such as zein, casein, dextrin, starch, or shellac, etc. used, e.g., with respect to transferring bixin as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,344 (Jon et al.), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The agent may also be applied in an aqueous solution to a film whose food contact surface has been modified to be hydrophilic or adapted or otherwise modified to adsorb or absorb water or oil based liquids containing a myoglobin blooming agent. According to the present invention in one aspect, transferable modifier-containing films may be utilized to transfer myoglobin blooming agents using, e.g., films having a food contact layer formulation suitable for effecting transfer as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,288,532 (Juhl et al.); 5,374,457 (Juhl et al.); 5,382,391 (Juhl et al.); and 6,667,082 (Bamore et al.) which are all hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Where the myoglobin blooming agent is incorporated within the interior layer, it may be added to a base polymer before or during extrusion of the film. The base polymer may be any suitable polymer e.g. a polyolefin such as a polyethylene, and may be very low density polyethylene (VLDPE or ULDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), EVA, polypropylene, ionomer, nylon, PVDC, PET, etc. Melt blending is a suitable method of mixing the base polymer and the myoglobin blooming agent. The individual component materials may be combined in a high intensity mixing device such as an extruder. The base polymer is melted to form a viscous liquid or &#x201c;melt.&#x201d; The myoglobin blooming agent may be combined with the polymer before, during, or after melting. The high intensity mixing device is used to attempt to uniformly disperse the myoglobin blooming compound within the base polymer. The quality and functionality of the dispersed agent can depend upon the choice of myoglobin blooming agent, the composition of the base polymer and the mixing device. It is desirable to achieve good mixing for uniform dispersion of the myoglobin blooming agent within the melt; the presence of poorly wetted particle agglomerations is undesirable. It may be desirable to include additives in the blend such as, e.g., antioxidant, antiblock or slip agents.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The myoglobin blooming agent may be either directly added to the base polymer or provided in a solution such as an aqueous or oil based solution that is added to the polymer either before or during the melt state of the polymer. For direct addition of a solid, granular or particulate agent grinding the solid agent to produce smaller particles is expected to provide a more uniform dispersion. It is expected that for a water soluble material, providing the myoglobin blooming agent as an aqueous solution may provide better dispersion of the compound within the polymer relative to addition of undissolved agent. An aqueous solution may be prepared from a water soluble myoglobin blooming agent, preferably close to the saturation concentration of the aqueous solution and may e.g. include between about 20 weight % and about 42 weight % of a compound which acts as a myoglobin blooming agent. This aqueous solution may be directly introduced into a polymer melt, e.g., in an extruder heated to a temperature above 300&#xb0; F. to facilitate mixing to form a blend. If added as a solution provision should be made for venting water vapor from the extruder. The polymer blend containing a myoglobin blooming agent may be either extruded into pellets, or directly as a film.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The myoglobin blooming agent may be mixed with a carrier resin or base polymer to form a masterbatch. Pellets from the masterbatch may be convenient for subsequent use in fabricating articles. Pellets from the masterbatch may then be mixed with the base polymer or another polymer during a film forming process.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">When used to create a masterbatch, a sufficient amount of the solution may be introduced into the polymer melt to obtain a blend having a high concentration of myoglobin blooming agent, e.g., between about 2 weight % and about 10 weight % myoglobin blooming compound, and preferably between about 4 weight % and about 6 weight %.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Monolayer Barrier Films</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In one embodiment of the invention, monolayer oxygen barrier packaging films are provided which comprise a food contact layer including a myoglobin blooming agent. The agent may either be coated onto the surface of the monolayer film or it may be incorporated therein, e.g., during the extrusion process. Such film provides an oxygen barrier and may have a myoglobin blooming agent coated on or incorporated therein.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Multilayer Barrier Films</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Multilayer oxygen barrier films having a myoglobin blooming agent that contacts a packaged meat product surface can desirably promote, preserve or enhance a desirable myoglobin-mitigated red color.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In one aspect of the embodiment, a myoglobin blooming agent is included in the food contact layer, which is preferably a sealant layer. Multilayer films advantageously may utilize one or more additional layers to provide beneficial film properties. Multilayer films have increased flexibility of application over monolayer films in that specific layers may be provided to incorporate specific features. Sometimes materials which may be unsuitable alone may be advantageously employed in a multilayer construction. For example, EVOH has oxygen barrier properties which are very sensitive to moisture and detrimentally impacted thereby, but when protected from contact with moisture by adjacent moisture barrier layers EVOH may provide a film having an excellent oxygen barrier. Oxygen barrier layers may be positioned between an abrasion or abuse resistant layer and a food contact layer containing myoglobin blooming agent to protect the oxygen barrier and permit thinner oxygen barrier layers to be used. Where EVOH barrier materials are used, it is contemplated that a polyamide-containing layer may optionally be in contact with the EVOH material. Non-limiting examples of various preferred multilayer film configurations include the following:</p>

<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Forming Films</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Thermoformable multilayer films are useful for forming dimensionally stable structures for packaging food and other products. The structures or containers are made by softening a portion of the film through application of heat, distorting the softened film to a desired shape, and cooling the film to set the shape. Commonly, hot dogs are packaged in containers made from thermoformable films. The thermoformable films as described herein may be used in accordance with the present invention by including a blooming agent in the inner layer in contact with the food product.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Thermoformable films may be made by flat die mono or coextrusion, slot cast mono or coextrusion or single-bubble blown coextrusion. Films made by these processes may be non-oriented or oriented by tentering or expanded bubble to an extent that allows for further orientation/stretching. Suitable formable films characterized as being nonoriented may have a heat shrinkage value less than about 5% at 90&#xb0; C. in either or both the machine direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD) as measured before thermoforming.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">A typical thermoformable film may include an outer layer comprising a blend of a very low density polyolefin, ethylene vinyl acetate, and a compatibilizer; an intermediate layer comprising a mixture of nylon copolymer and an amorphous nylon; an inner layer comprising a polyolefin or ionomeric polymer; and at least one adhesive that bonds said outer, intermediate, and inner layers together. Examples of such films are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,861,127 to Glawe et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Another thermoformable film may include a first layer of polyester, the polyester being selected from the group consisting of a homopolymer or copolymer of ethylene terephthalate, ethylene naphthalate and blends thereof; a second layer of an adhesive; and a third layer comprising a nylon blend, the third layer preferably being a blend between about 100% (weight) to about 71% (weight) of a nylon selected from the group consisting of nylon 4,6 (poly(tetramethylene adipamide)), nylon 6 (polycaprolactam), nylon 6,6 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide)), nylon 6,9 (poly(hexamethylene nonanediamide)), nylon 6, 10 (poly(hexamethylene sebacamide)), nylon 6,12 (poly(hexamethylene dodecanediamide)), nylon 6/12 (poly(caprolactam-co-dodecanediamide)), nylon 6,6/6 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide-co-caprolactam)), nylon 11 (polyundecanolactam), nylon 12 (polylauryllactam) and alloys or mixtures thereof; and between about 0% (weight) to about 29% (weight) of an amorphous nylon; wherein the first layer, the second layer and the third layer are formed into a flexible film by a coextrusion process to form a film that has a heat shrinkage value measured before thermoforming of less than about 5% in the machine direction at 90&#xb0; C. less than about 5% in the transverse direction at 90&#xb0; C., and a percent elongation at break at room temperature greater than about 250 in the machine direction and greater than about 250 in the transverse direction. Optionally, the second layer and third layer have a combined thickness of 10 mils or less. Examples of such films are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,964,816 to Schell et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Still other thermoformable films include a seven layer structure include with layers in sequence comprising nylon, adhesive, nylon, adhesive, nylon adhesive, and a polymer sealant material. Preferably, the polymer sealant material is selected from the group consisting of low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, very low density polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer, ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene acrylic acid copolymer, an ionomer, and combinations thereof. Preferably, the film does not include an EVOH core layer. The film may have a thickness between 5 mils and about 10 mils. Examples of such films are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,068,933 and 6,562,476 to Shepard et al., which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. If such films do include an EVOH core layer, it is preferable that the multilayer structure includes in sequence layers comprising nylon, adhesive, nylon, EVOH, nylon, adhesive and nylon blend, a heat sealable polymer. The nylon layers may include two or more layers of nylon coextruded to form a single layer of nylon. The film may include a layer of ionomer between the heat sealable polymer and the adhesive layer. The film may include an outer layer comprising an anhydride modified polyolefin. Examples of such films are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,942,927 to Shepard et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">While thermoformable films may retain flexibility after being shaped, certain films may also have sufficient rigidity after being formed to serve as packing trays. Such rigid trays often have flexible films peelably sealed to flanges extending from the top of the trays. For making deep trays, thermoforming techniques such as vacuum forming, pressure forming, plug assist or mechanical forming processes are useful. To effectively soften the multilayer sheet so it can be easily thermoformed into containers having uniform sidewall thicknesses, the films are often preheated to a temperature between about 375&#xb0; F. to about 425&#xb0; F. Examples of such trays and peelable film lids are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,541 to Newman et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Packing trays may also be made from composites of cardboards and extruded thermoformable laminate films, with film lids sealed to the flanges around the top of the tray. Examples of such trays are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,651,874 to Pedersen et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Such packages may be useful for modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) where the air in the sealed package is replace by or supplemented with gas such as carbon monoxide. In accordance with the present invention, it will be understood that the above forming films may be used by themselves or in combination with other film substrates, e.g., oriented polyethylene terephthalate, as non-forming films. Non-limiting examples of various non-forming film configurations which may be used as film lids include the following:</p>

<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Food Packaging</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In another embodiment, food packages are provided that comprise a myoglobin-containing fresh meat product. The food packages preferably include a polymeric film comprising a blooming agent and an oxygen barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The fresh meat product can be any meat suitable for human consumption that contains a myoglobin-containing molecule. References to total myoglobin in a meat are intended to include any myoglobin-containing structure, including any ligand present in the myoglobin structure (e.g., deoxymyoglobin, oxymyoglobin, metmyoglobin, carboxymyoglobin, and nitric oxide myoglobin). Preferably, the meat product contains a level of myoglobin sufficient to provide or maintain a desirable appearance or color. Examples of suitable meat cuts include beef, veal, pork, mutton, lamb, poultry, chicken, turkey, duck, goose, game, fish and seafood. The concentration of myoglobin varies in different types of meat products, but preferably the myoglobin content of the meat product is high enough to provide a desired color when about 50% of the myoglobin structures in the meat are converted to a ligand binding state that produces the desired color. Typically, beef contains about 3-10 mg of myoglobin per gram of meat, pork contains about 1-3 mg myoglobin per gram of meat, and chicken contains less than about 1 mg myoglobin per gram of meat. For example, the concentration of total myoglobin compounds in the meat product may be between about 0.1 mg and 25 mg of myoglobin compounds per gram of the meat product. Preferably, the concentration of total myoglobin compounds may be between about 3 and about 20 mg per gram of fresh meat product. In other embodiments, the concentration of total myoglobin compounds may between about 1 and about 5 mg per gram of fresh meat product. In yet other embodiments, the concentration of total myoglobin compounds is at least 1 mg per gram of fresh meat product. In still other embodiments, the concentration of total myoglobin compounds is less than 1 mg per gram of fresh meat product.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The uncooked meat product is desirably a fresh meat product provided within a period of time postmortem to provide a desired level of freshness and safety. Preferably, a food product comprising myoglobin is packaged less than 20 days post-mortem, more preferably less than 14, 12, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. Typically, the food product is a fresh meat packaged between about 2 days and 14 days post-mortem, and more preferably between about 2 days and about 12 days.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Typically, meat comprises moisture (water), protein and fat. Fresh meat can include about 60% to about 80% moisture content, with lean meats typically having higher moisture content. Fresh meat products such as ground beef, chicken and pork often have a moisture content of about 68% to about 75%, depending on the fat content of the meat (meats with higher fat contents tend to have lower moisture content and vice versa). Cured meats often have higher moisture content due to injection with water-based preserving compounds. Sausage products may have lower moisture content. For example, pork sausage may have a moisture content of about 40% or higher. Preferably, the packaged meat product can have a moisture content of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The food package preferably includes a polymeric oxygen barrier film comprising blooming agent, but may also include a film in combination with a food product which has been surface coated with a myoglobin blooming agent prior to packaging. The food package may further comprise an oxygen barrier layer as part of the film forming the food package. The oxygen barrier layer may comprise any suitable material and in a multilayer embodiment is preferably positioned between the abuse resistant exterior layer and an interior food contact layer. An oxygen barrier layer may be an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) or PVDC. The gas barrier layer of the food package is described above with reference to the multilayer packaging films. One or more tie layers may also be included. The tie layers of the food package are described above with reference to the multilayer packaging films.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Preferably, the food package is a case-ready meat product comprising a fresh meat product that includes myogobin. Case-ready meat products can be generally defined as fresh meat that is prepackaged and optionally prelabeled at a centralized location and delivered to the retail market prepared for final sale. Increasingly, meat products such as ground beef, turkey and chicken products delivered to U.S. domestic supermarkets for retail sale are delivered in case-ready packaging. For many supermarkets, especially so-called &#x201c;mega-grocery stores,&#x201d; case-ready meat products provide not only cost savings in terms of minimizing or eliminating on-site butchering and packaging, but also increased sanitation and decreased incidence of product spoilage.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Product packaging that preserves the desirable color of meat, especially fresh meat, can promote the merchantability and appeal of the meat product for consumers. To meet the increasing demand for case-ready meat products, the case-ready meat product preferably provides a predetermined weight and/or volume of a common meat product, such as chicken breast and ground beef. The case-ready meat product can include a polymeric film to maintain freshness, such as a film as described herein. The meat product may be provided fresh, frozen, hard chilled, thawed, enhanced, processed or cooked, and the films advantageously provide protection at various temperatures. Selection of films for packaging food products can include consideration of such criteria as barrier properties, cost, durability, puncture resistance, flex-crack resistance, food packaging law compliance, e.g., United States Food &#x26; Drug Administration (FDA) approval, machinability, optical properties such as gloss and haze, printability, sealability, shrinkability, shrink force, stiffness, and strength. Packaging that preserves desirable meat coloration can promote the merchantability of meat products.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">In another aspect, the packaged food product includes a fresh meat contacting a thin plastic film comprising a myoglobin blooming agent on a food contact surface, stretched around a foam tray that supports the product. The film is preferably a multilayer film that is sufficiently non-permeable to oxygen so that the color of the meat can be preserved in a desirable color (e.g., red) for more than about three days, preferably for 5, 7, 10, 15 or more days. Preferably, the meat product is packaged in vacuum containers such as heat shrinkable or non-heat shrinkable pouches or bags, formed pockets, trays or clam shells, which are vacuum sealed and prevent oxygen contact with the meat until the package is opened. The vacuum container includes a food contact surface including the myoglobin blooming agent.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">In prior art case ready applications, the meat product is sometimes packaged in a modified atmosphere package (&#x201c;MAP&#x201d;), wherein the meat is maintained in a sealed pocket containing a headspace with an atmosphere that is different than ambient air. For example, a MAP can maintain red meat in carbon dioxide, with very low oxygen content, e.g., in a multipack where the master package is subsequently opened and the contained individual packages in oxygen permeable films are exposed to the atmosphere thereby causing the meat to bloom red. Also, the preferred color of fresh meat can be promoted and maintained using a MAP with enriched oxygen content. Similarly, a MAP with small concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) can be used to cause and maintain a preferred red color of fresh meat. Methods of treating fresh meat with carbon monoxide prior to packaging have also been developed for case ready packaging applications. The bright red CO-myoglobin complex is referred to as carboxymyoglobin. The presence of carbon monoxide can also disfavorably impact sales of CO-containing meat products among consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">It is contemplated that the present invention may be used in combination with MAP. For example, in a tray package where the film contacts a significant portion, but not all, of the food product's viewable surface, a CO containing atmosphere can be used to cause a desirable color on the food surface areas that do not make direct contact with the packaging film. This embodiment may beneficially be used, e.g., in certain types of tray overwrap and tray packaging where the film may typically be in contact with the top surface of the food but not in all places along the side or in tray or non-tray packages of irregular shaped items having gaps between adjacent meat surfaces, e.g., such as may be found in products such as whole birds or shaped products such as crown ribs for roasting.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The food packages typically comprise a multilayer polymeric film. The food packages preferably include one or more polyamide core layers in contact with the EVOH-polyamide multilayer oxygen barrier layer of the first embodiment. The food packages can include a three-layer oxygen barrier formed from an EVOH layer in contact with a first polyamide layer on one side and a second polyamide layer on the opposite side. The food package can also include a heat resistant layer, a sealant layer and one or more adhesive layers having any suitable composition, as described with respect to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The polyamide layers in contact with the EVOH barrier layer can comprise or consist essentially of a polyamide or polyamide blend composition described with respect to the first embodiment. Preferably, the polyamide layers have the same composition as an exterior heat resistant layer comprising a nylon blend composition.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Preferably, the heat resistant layer can comprise or consist essentially of a blend of an amorphous nylon copolymer, a low temperature polyamide and a high temperature polyamide. The heat resistant layer is preferably positioned at or near the exterior surface of the packaging film, and can be an exterior layer, but can also form a polyamide layer. In some embodiments, the food package can further comprise a sealant layer positioned at or near the interior surface of the package, for example as an interior layer. The sealant layers of the food package are described above with reference to the multilayer packaging films.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The sealant layer is preferably positioned at or near the interior surface of the package, for example as an interior layer. Adhesive layers may also be included between a heat resistant exterior layer and the first polyamide layer or between the sealant layer and the second polyamide layer. In some embodiments, the food package can be a cook-in package, preferably when the food package comprises a sealant layer formed from a material that is compatible with cooking conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">If desired, the food packages may be heat-shrinkable. The food packages preferably include a multilayer oxygen barrier component, and if heat shrinkable, preferably have a total free shrink measured at 90&#xb0; C. of at least 30%, 40% or 50% in at least one of the machine direction or transverse direction. The food packages preferably have a free shrink of at least 30% at 90&#xb0; C. in one direction, more preferably at least 30% in two directions, where each direction is either a machine direction or a transverse direction. Even more preferably, the food packages have a free shrink of at least 40% in a first direction and at least 50% in a second direction. The food packages are preferably biaxially oriented, heat-shrinkable, or both. Preferably, the packages have a total free shrink at 90&#xb0; C. of at least about 80%. For example, the food packages can have a free shrink value at 90&#xb0; C. between about 80% and about 120% at 90&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the food packages can have a total free shrink at 90&#xb0; C. of at least about 90%, more preferably at least about 95%, still more preferably at least about 100% and even more preferably at least about 105%.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Food packages preferably comprise at least one heat resistant layer can comprise or consist essentially of a blend of an amorphous nylon copolymer, a low temperature polyamide and a high temperature polyamide. The heat resistant layer can be positioned at or near the exterior surface of the packaging film, and can be an exterior layer. The heat resistant layer can be biaxially oriented. Some embodiments may provide a five layer heat-shrinkable and heat resistant food package or pouch formed from multilayer coextruded films. Food packages can also be formed from seven layer which may be heat shrinkable or non-heat shrinkable and heat resistant coextruded films. In some embodiments, the heat-shrinkable food package can be a cook-in package, preferably when the food package does not comprise a sealant layer. &#x201c;Cook-in&#x201d; is the term used to indicate a film or bag in which a foodstuff is pasteurized or cooked. This film or bag is used to hold together, protect and/or form the shape of the foodstuff by a food processor (manufacturer) during the cooking or pasteurization process after which the film may be removed (sometimes termed &#x201c;stripped&#x201d;), or may be left on as a protective barrier during shipping, and optionally even left on during retail sale.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Food packages formed from multilayer films having two to fourteen layers are contemplated herein, where each layer is selected from the group consisting of: layers comprising a heat resistant and nylon blend composition, adhesion layers, oxygen barrier layers, moisture barrier layers, bulk layers and sealant layers. Preferably, the exterior surface layer comprises a nylon blend composition having an amorphous nylon copolymer and a low temperature polyamide. Also preferably, the interior surface layer is a sealant layer.</p>

<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Vacuum Skin Packaging</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Vacuum skin packaging (VSP) is another process well known in the art that uses a thermoplastic packaging material to enclose a product. Various apparatus and processes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,835,618; 3,950,919 and Reissue 30,009, all issued to Perdue. The vacuum skin packaging process is in one sense a type of thermoforming process in which an article to be packaged serves as the mold for the thermoform. An article may be placed on a support member, a card, either rigid or semi-rigid, or other bottom, and the supported article is then passed to a chamber where a top film is drawn upward against a heated dome and then draped over the article. The movement of the plastic top film is controlled by vacuum and or air pressure, and in a vacuum skin packaging arrangement, the interior of the container is evacuated before final sealing of the top film to the support. Thermoformable material may be used as both the top film and bottom support in conjunction with an intermediate support for products held on either side of the support as shown for example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,045.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">In vacuum skin packaging, a product to be packaged is placed on a product supporting member. The product serves as the mold for a thermoformable polymeric film. The thermoformable film is formed about the product by means of differential air pressure. However, the term &#x201c;vacuum skin packaging&#x201d; (hereinafter, &#x201c;VSP&#x201d;) refers to not only the fact that the thermoformable film is formed around the product by vacuum or differential air pressure, but also to the fact that the product is packaged under vacuum, with the volume containing the product being evacuated during the packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Vacuum skin packaging processes generally use a vacuum chamber with an open top. The product (on an impermeable backing board through which vacuum is not drawn), is placed on a platform within the vacuum chamber. The top of the chamber is covered by a sheet of film which is clamped tightly against the chamber to form an air-tight closure. The chamber is evacuated while the film is heated to its forming and softening temperature. The platform is then raised to drive the product into the softened film, and air reintroduced into the chamber can be used about the film to force it tightly around the product.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">In vacuum skin packaging, it is also known to release the vacuum and allow ambient air into the chamber, after the chamber has been evacuated and the product driven into the heat-softened film, or vice versa. In this manner, the thermoplastic film molds more or less over and against the product, since there is a vacuum inside the package, and ambient air pressure, or more than ambient air pressure, immediately outside of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Vacuum skin packaging generally uses a rigid tray, such as made from a thermoformable film, to support a product. The clear top film, such as made from a thermoformable film, which may or may not be a biaxially oriented film, is formed or draped around the product during the vacuum packaging procedures. The film forms a skin around the entire viewing surface of the product. Preferably, the food contact layer of the clear top film includes a blooming agent. Optionally, the tray may also include a blooming agent in the food contact layer. Examples of vacuum skin packaging trays, films and processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,611,456 to Gillio-tos et al.; 5,846,582 to Mayfield et al.; and in 5,916,613 to Stockley III, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Method of Packaging</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In another aspect of the invention, methods of packaging a myoglobin-containing food product are provided. In an embodiment of the invention, a method of manufacturing a vacuum package of fresh meat may be provided which comprises: supplying a container comprising a film having a layer comprising a myoglobin blooming agent and wherein the film is substantially impermeable to oxygen; placing a retail cut of fresh meat within the container; removing the atmosphere within the container; causing a transparent portion of the film to make direct contact with at least a portion of the meat surface; hermetically sealing the container to enclose the fresh meat and prevent contact of oxygen from outside the container therewith; providing a compact package having a sufficiently reduced internal oxygen level to promote a meat surface favoring deoxymyoglobin or metmyoglobin and the corresponding purple and brown colorations associated therewith over formation of oxymyoglobin; and storing the package under refrigeration conditions for a sufficient time to permit the reducing activity of the enclosed meat to favor nitroxymyoglobin formation on the meat surface to an extent whereby a corresponding red color associated therewith is formed to produce a visibly red meat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Variations of the above embodiment may utilize the wide selection of MBAs, polymers, films, attributes and parameters disclosed herein as will be recognized by one skilled in the art in view of the present teaching.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The meat product may be packaged in a suitable food package and/or packaging film, such as the packages and films described herein. Preferably, the meat product is contacted by the myoglobin blooming agent containing food contact surface of the packaging. The myoglobin blooming agent (MBA) preferably will contact the meat surface in an amount sufficient to produce a desired red color which preferably does not penetrate to an undesirable depth of the food thickness under reduced oxygen conditions (this color may take awhile to develop e.g. 1 to 5 days). Beneficially, the MBA may be present on the film food contact surface (or on the myoglobin food surface) in an amount of from about 0.05 to 3 to 5 to 10 &#x3bc;moles/in<sup>2 </sup>and in increments of 0.1 &#x3bc;mole thereof. Greater or lesser amounts of MBA may be used and the color intensity may thereby be varied depending upon the relative presence or absence of myoglobin. The food contact layer preferably has between about 0.001 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>and about 0.900 mg/in<sup>2 </sup>of a myoglobin blooming agent such as NaNO<sub>2</sub>. Also the packaging should maintain the food product in a reduced oxygen package environment having a reduced gaseous oxygen partial pressure. The reduced oxygen package may comprise an oxygen barrier layer having an oxygen transmission rate of less than about 310, 200, 100, 75, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5 or 3 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hours measured at 0% relative humidity and 23&#xb0; C. Preferably, the oxygen barrier layer has an oxygen transmission rate of less than about 310 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hours measured at 0% relative humidity and 23&#xb0; C., more preferably less than about 75 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hours, and most preferably less than about 20 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hours. It may be further desirable to bring the packaging with the food product enclosed therein to a temperature of about 4&#xb0; C. (40&#xb0; F.) or higher to facilitate bloom, after which the temperature may be adjusted to the desired optimum temperature for storage, transit or display.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">In many packaging applications, such as vacuum packaging, heat sealable food packaging films are desirable. Such bags and pouches can be made with heat sealable layers. A typical food packaging pouch can include three sides heat sealed by the pouch manufacturer leaving one open side to allow product insertion. Flexible food package containers such as bags or pouches may be made by transversely cutting tubular stock of monolayer or multilayer film and cutting off the tube portion containing the sealed end; by making multiple spaced apart transverse seals on tubular stock and cutting open the side of the tube; by superimposing flat sheets of film and sealing on three sides; or by folding a flat sheet and sealing on two sides. A processor may then insert e.g. fresh, frozen, hard chilled, thawed, raw, enhanced, cured or processed meat, ham, poultry, primal or subprimal meat cuts, ground beef, or other myoglobin containing products, making a final seal to hermetically enclose the product in the bag. This final seal preferably follows gas evacuation (e.g., by vacuum removal). Flexible food packaging containers such as bags or pouches can be made by transversely sealing tubular stock of monolayer or multilayer film and cutting off the tube portion containing the sealed end; by making two spaced apart transverse seals on tubular stock and cutting open the side of the tube; by superimposing flat sheets of film and sealing on three sides; or by folding a flat sheet and sealing two sides. The final seal after insertion of a food product may be a clip, but is usually a heat seal similar to the initial seals produced by the bag manufacturer although the actual heat sealing equipment may vary. Hot bar and impulse sealers are commonly used to make heat seals.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">The food packaging film may also be used in embodiments employing trays e.g. as a lidding film or tray overwrap. Equipment such as tray sealers that are made by Ossid Corporation of Rocky Mount, N.C., U.S.A. or ULMA Packaging, Inc. of Woodstock, Ga., U.S.A., may be used to package poultry such as chicken or other meats. Tray packaging may optionally involve replacement of the gaseous environment within the package by one or more gases to provide some advantage such as to assist product preservation, but to enjoy preferred benefits of the present invention at least a portion of the oxygen barrier film should be in contact with a food surface under reduced oxygen conditions to fix color in that contact area in a manner where a consumer or potential purchaser may view the color fixed meat surface through a transparent portion of the film.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Suitably at least 10%, preferably at least 20% and more preferably at least 30% or 50% or more of the surface of the oxygen barrier film is transparent to allow visual perception of food color therethrough after packaging. Meats having a bright red color are believed to be more visible, and have greater definition to distinguish the meat's physical topography, texture, and color variation e.g. such as that found in marbling. It is further believed, without wishing to be bound by the belief, that the whites of meat components such as fats, skin and white muscle fibers are enhanced by having proximate myoglobin bound by myoglobin blooming agents which fix a bright red color as opposed to purplish, bluish or brownish colors. Thus, the whites appear whiter in poultry and other meats including beef and pork. This in turn causes consumers to have a perception of greater clarity of the meat surface which increases consumer confidence in their purchase over meats having less visible surface characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0020" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The following are examples and comparative examples.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Experimental results and reported properties of the following examples are based on the following test methods or substantially similar test methods unless noted otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Oxygen Gas Transmission Rate (O<sub>2 </sub>GTR): ASTM D-3985-81</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR): ASTM F 1249-90</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Gauge: ASTM D-2103</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Melt Index: ASTM D-1238, Condition E (190&#xb0; C.) (except for propene-based (&#x3e;50% O<sub>3 </sub>content) polymers tested at Condition TL (230&#xb0; C.))</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Melting point: ASTM D-3418, DSC with 5&#xb0; C./min heating rate</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Shrinkage Values: Shrinkage values are defined to be values obtained by measuring unrestrained shrink of a 10 cm square sample immersed in water at 90&#xb0; C. (or the indicated temperature if different) for five seconds. Four test specimens are cut from a given sample of the film to be tested. The specimens are cut into squares of 10 cm length in the machine direction by 10 cm length in the transverse direction. Each specimen is completely immersed for 5 seconds in a 90&#xb0; C. (or the indicated temperature if different) water bath. The specimen is then removed from the bath and the distance between the ends of the shrunken specimen is measured for both the MD and TD directions. The difference in the measured distance for the shrunken specimen and the original 10 cm side is multiplied by ten to obtain the percent of shrinkage for the specimen in each direction. The shrinkage of four specimens is averaged for the MD shrinkage value of the given film sample, and the shrinkage for the four specimens is averaged for the TD shrinkage value. As used herein the term &#x201c;heat shrinkable film at 90&#xb0; C.&#x201d; means a film having an unrestrained shrinkage value of at least 10% in at least one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Shrink Force: The shrink force of a film is that force or stress required to prevent shrinkage of the film and is determined from film samples taken from each film. Four film samples are cut 1&#x2033; (2.54 cm) wide by 7&#x2033; (17.8 cm) long in the machine direction and 1&#x2033; (2.54 cm) wide by 7&#x2033; (17.8 cm) long in the traverse direction. The average thickness of the film samples was determined and recorded. Each film sample is then secured between the two clamps spaced 10 cm apart. One clamp is in a fixed position and the other is connected to a strain gauge transducer. The secured film sample and clamps are then immersed in a silicone oil bath maintained at a constant, elevated temperature for a period of five seconds. During This time, the force in grams manifested by the shrink tension of the film at the elevated temperature is recorded. At the end of this time, the film sample is removed from the bath and allowed to cool to room temperature whereupon the force in grams at room temperature is also recorded. The shrink force for the film sample is then determined from the following equation wherein the results are obtained in grams per mil of film thickness (g/mil):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Shrink Force (g/mil)=<i>F/T </i>wherein F is the force in grams and T is the average thickness of the film samples in mils.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Provided below are non-limiting examples of the compositions, films and packages disclosed herein. In all the following examples, unless otherwise indicated, the film compositions are produced generally utilizing the apparatus and method described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,456,044 (Pahlke), which describes a coextrusion type of double bubble method, and in further accordance with the detailed description above. All percentages are by weight unless indicated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Single-layer and multilayer tubular films are made by a biaxial stretching orientation process. Films of five or more layers are also contemplated. The inventive multilayer films may include additional layers or polymers to add or modify various properties of the desired film such as heat sealability, interlayer adhesion, food surface adhesion, shrinkability, shrink force, wrinkle resistance, puncture resistance, printability, toughness, gas or water barrier properties, abrasion resistance and optical properties such as gloss, haze, freedom from lines, streaks or gels. These layers may be formed by any suitable method including coextrusion, extrusion coating and lamination.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">A solution of a desired myoglobin blooming agent (MBA) such as described above is prepared by dissolving a suitable amount of the blooming agent in a solvent. A suitable concentration of a blooming agent is approximately 0.60 moles of blooming agent in 60 g of solvent. The solution is made at room temperature by gently agitating the solvent/MBA mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Dow ATTANE&#xae; 4201-G VLDPE (obtained from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.) is loaded into the hopper of a gravimetric dosing unit that is positioned to feed the polymer into the main feed port of an APV Extrusion Systems MP 2050 50 mm corotating twin screw extruder. The feeder is configured to dose the ATTANE at a rate of 41 kg/h. The mixing elements of the twin screw extruder are arranged in a fashion that allows for feeding and melting of the VLDPE, injection and mixing of the solvent/MBA solution, removal of the solvent, pressurization of a die and formation of continuous strands of a homogeneous VLDPE/MBA blend.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The twin screw extruder is electrically heated so that the feed zone is at 200&#xb0; F. and the rest of the extruder at 330&#xb0; F. When the extruder zones achieve the intended temperatures, the drive motor is engaged to rotate the extruder screws at about 578 RPM. The ATTANE VLDPE is dosed into the primary feed port at 41 kg/h. Once a stable, homogeneous extrudate is achieved, the solvent/MBA mixture is injected into the molten VLDPE at an injection port. A gear pump is used to deliver the blooming agent/solvent solution to the injection port. The injection point is placed in a section of the extruder configured to have high free volume and low pressure. The rate of delivery of the solution is calculated by the time change in mass of the solvent/blooming agent mixture. The intended concentration of 5% is achieved by adjusting the pump speed. A suitable pump speed is about 33 RPM. The solvent/MBA delivery rate is preferably about 5.4 kg/h.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">The mixing elements of the extruder are arranged in a fashion such that the liquid solvent/MBA solution is prevented from moving upstream to the primary feed port. Full bore orifice plugs are used to prevent the unwanted upstream migration.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Following injection, the solvent/MBA solution rapidly increases in temperature. The solvent fraction of the solution evaporates and eventually boils. The resultant solvent escapes through an atmospheric pressure vent port. Some solvent may also escape through the primary feed port. Following a mixing section, the VLDPE/MBA blend moves into a pressurization section and finally, into an eight-hole strand die. Upon exiting the die, the resultant continuous strands are cooled in a water bath. At the exit of the water bath, an air knife removes some of the moisture clinging to the surface of the stands. After leaving the influence of the air knife, the strands are cut into discrete pellets by a rotating knife-style pelletizer. These pellets are subsequently dried in a convection oven at about 50&#xb0; C., packed in aluminum foil containing bags and stored for use and referred to as masterbatch pellets. Non-limiting examples of various masterbatch preparation techniques are described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/408,221, entitled &#x201c;Process for Introducing an Additive into a Polymer Melt&#x201d; by Nelson et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Films are prepared from the masterbatch pellets. The loading level of the masterbatch pellets is varied to produce VLDPE films with an effective blooming agent concentration, and packages are prepared using the film as an inner layer. Food products, in particular, meat products, are vacuum packaged within the packages and observed over a period of time.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Masterbatch pellets from Example 1 are used with base polymer Dow ATTANE 4201 VLDPE resin to make the inner layer of a thermoformable multilayer film. The film has the layers of 85% nylon 6-15% nylon 6I/6T (11 weight %)/tie (20 weight %)/85% nylon 6-15% nylon 6I/6T (8.5 weight %)/EVOH (9.4 weight %)/85% nylon 6-15% nylon 6I/6T (8.5 weight %)/tie (20 weight %)/70% VLDPE-30% Masterbatch (22.6 weight %). The film is made in a single-bubble process to make a nonoriented thermoformable film.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 3a, 3b and 3c</heading>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">A steer was slaughtered and three days postmortem, the meat therefrom was formed into ground chuck. Approximately five pounds of this ground chuck were portioned into vacuum pouches and the meat flattened to 0.75 inch thickness. After 7 days of refrigerated storage the meat was cut into 2.5 by 3.5 inch rectangular samples. For Example 3a, a 300 mg dietary tablet produced by Vitamin World containing 100 mg of nicotinic acid in combination with dicalcium phosphate, cellulose, vegetable stearic acid, silica and vegetable magnesium stearate was placed on one of the meat samples, and then subsequently, skin packed on a Multivac T200 machine using a polyolefin based VSP film having an EVOH oxygen barrier layer and a polyethylene food contact layer. The bloomed color of red meat began proliferating from the meat closest to the tablet after 24 hours of refrigerated storage.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">For Example 3b, a second rectangular formed sample of ground chuck was sprayed with an aqueous niacin solution and packaged as described in Example 3a. The niacin solution was obtained by dissolving a similar niacin tablet into water. A bloomed red color developed on the surface of the meat sample. However the intensity of the red color was less than that which formed around the tablet.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">For Example 3c, a control example was constructed by packaging a third sample of formed ground beef as described above in Example 3a but without adding niacin. The color on the surface of the sample remained purple without formation of the red color that was observed in Examples 3a and 3b.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">All three packages made in Examples 3a, 3b and 3c were opened and examined 15 days after packaging. Upon opening the packages, the color of the meat in each package bloomed to a uniform red color. Cooking on an outdoor gas fired grill produced nondistinguishable results for the three examples. The internal color of both treated and untreated samples had a pink cast. No persistent pinking was observed on the niacin treated meat.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 4a, 4b and 4c</heading>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Lean chuck containing approximately 5% visual fat was ground 4 days after slaughter. The ground meat was portioned into flexible oxygen barrier bags and vacuum packaged on a Koch chamber machine. The color of the meat turned from red to a dark purple within 4 hours. For Example 4a, after 24 hours of refrigerated storage, one of the vacuum packages of ground lean beef was opened and niacin was mixed with a portion of the meat to produce ground beef containing 0.025 weight % of niacin. This mixture was then placed on a white polypropylene oxygen barrier tray containing an EVOH barrier layer. Similarly, for Example 4b, another portion of the packaged meat was opened and placed into the same type of tray without any niacin addition. Both trays of ground chuck were vacuum skin packaged on a Multivac T200 machine with an oxygen barrier vacuum skin packaging (VSP) film having an EVOH barrier. For Example 3c, another portion of packaged meat was opened and placed onto a tray without any added niacin. The tray was then packaged on the Multivac T200 machine with a VSP film containing a sealant with 2.0 weight % sodium nitrite. After 24 hours of refrigerated storage, the niacin-treated meat sample, Example 4a, had bloomed to the preferred red color whereas the untreated meat sample, Example 4b, exhibited a dull purple color characteristic of vacuum packaged fresh meat. The meat on the third tray with the nitrite containing film, Example 4c, had turned a grayish purple during the initial 24 hours after which time the color bloomed to the bright red color.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The color of the niacin-treated meat was darker than the meat in the package with the nitrite containing film. The bottom side and the center parts of the niacin-treated meat were of the same deep red color as the surface. The red color of the meat in the nitrite containing film penetrated about 1/16<sup>th </sup>to &#x215b;<sup>th </sup>inch into the surface of the meat.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">After 1 week of refrigerated storage, all three meat samples were unpackaged. The meat samples were then placed on an outdoor gas fired grill. They were slowly cooked at 200-250&#xb0; F. for approximately 45 minutes with turning every 5-10 minutes so as to achieve a well done level of cooking. The color of the cooked surfaces and the internal portions of the niacin-treated beef packaged with the oxygen barrier VSP film and the untreated beef packaged with the oxygen barrier VSP film were the same. A red color persisted on the top viewing film contact surface of the beef containing no added niacin which was packaged with the nitrite containing film, Example 4c, at the same depth of penetration as was observed in the raw product. The color of the opposite surface and the center portion of this sample was the same as the control, Example 4b, and the niacin treated sample, Example 4a.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Nicotinic acid powder (obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.) is blended with Dow ATTANE&#xae; 4203 VLDPE pellets (0.5 dg/min; 0.912 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; ethylene/octene copolymer; obtained from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.) by tumble blending until the powder uniformly coats the surfaces of the pellets. The quantities are selected such that the nicotinic acid content is 5% by weight (14.25 kg of VLDPE and 0.75 kg of nicotinic acid). The blend is loaded into the hopper of a gravimetric dosing unit positioned to feed the polymer into the main feed port of an APV Extrusion Systems MP 2050 50 mm corotating twin screw extruder. The feeder is configured to dose the nicotinic acid/VLDPE blend at a rate of 36 kg/h. The mixing elements of the twin screw extruder are arranged in a fashion that accommodates feeding of the nicotinic acid/VLDPE blend, intensively mixing the nicotinic acid into the VLDPE, pressurization of a die and formation of continuous strands of the homogeneous blend.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">The twin screw extruder is electrically heated so that the feed zone is at about 200&#xb0; F., and the rest of the extruder at about 320&#xb0; F. The nicotinic acid/VLDPE tumble blend is dosed into the primary feed port at about 36 kg/h. Once a stable, homogeneous extrudate is achieved, continuous strands are cooled by transport through a water bath. At the exit of the water bath, an air knife removes some of the moisture clinging to the surface of the stands. After leaving the influence of the air knife, the strands are cut into discrete pellets by a rotating knife-style pelletizer. The resultant pellets are somewhat tan in color. Over time, a powdery build-up is noted at the exit of each of the die holes.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Example 6</heading>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Example 5 is repeated except that nicotinamide (obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.) is substituted for nicotinic acid. It is observed that the resultant pellets are brown.</p>
<heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Example 6 is repeated except that the rotation rate of the extruder screws is reduced to about 200 RPM. The color of the pellets is a very light tan and they exhibit very glossy surfaces. The strands are stable and manufacturing efficiency is much improved versus Example 6.</p>
<heading id="h-0028" level="1">Example 8</heading>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Example 5 is repeated except that the rotation rate of the extruder screws is reduced to about 200 RPM. As in Example 7, the color of The pellets is much lighter. The rate of accumulation of a powdery build-up around the die holes is substantially slower than the rate observed in Example 5.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The MBA containing resins of Examples 5-8 may all be used to form containers suitable for packaging myoglobin containing food to maintain a desirable surface color therein.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Films, bags and packages may also employ combinations of characteristics as described in one or more embodiments.</p>
