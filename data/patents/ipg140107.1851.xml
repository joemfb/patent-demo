<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Provided is a method of resecting a luminal structure, such as a colon. A first luminal structure and a second luminal structure are defined by severing the original luminal structure. The second luminal structure is secured to the distal end of an elongate body disposed within the second luminal structure. Refraction of the elongate body forms a circumferential fold in the second luminal structure and isolates a tissue mass between the circumferential fold and the distal end of the elongate body. The second luminal structure is then transected circumferentially at or adjacent the circumferential fold, thus severing the tissue mass. The tissue mass is then removed by retracting the distal end of the elongate body. The free end of the second luminal structure is approximated with the free end of the first luminal structure and secured by conventional surgical methods. Instrumentation for use with the inventive method is also provided.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In 2001 an estimated 107,300 new cases of Colon Cancer were diagnosed and colon cancer resulted in 48,100 estimated deaths. Resection of the large intestine is a frequently performed operation most commonly used to treat colon cancer, the third most common cancer in both men and women in the U.S. at the time of this writing. Colectomy is also used in the treatment of conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and in cancer prevention in patients with conditions such as Familial Polyposis.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A move to less invasive surgeries has seen the advent of the laparoscopic-aided colectomy, in which the surgeon uses laparoscopic instruments to perform the bulk of the operation and finally, when the resected portion of colon is ready to be removed, an incision is made in the abdomen and the colon is removed. This operation spares the patient the large incisions that were required prior to the use of laparoscopic instruments, however, still necessitates a 12 cm incision for specimen removal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided is a method of resecting a luminal structure, such as a colon, which obviates the need for large incisions. The instrumentation used with the inventive method removes the need to make an incision in order to remove the resected structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the illustrative embodiment of a colon resection, the instrumentation disclosed herein addresses the need to make an incision in the abdomen in order to remove the resected colon. Rather than subject the patient to any incision other than the small, 1-2 cm, incisions required of the laparoscopic instruments, the invention includes instrumentation and associated methods that allow the resected colon to be removed through the anus. This method reduces duration of hospital stays by decreasing the trauma to the patient in the operating room. By avoiding a large incision the incidence of wound infections is lessened as is the incidence of incisional hernias and wound dehiscence, feared complications of large incisions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first embodiment, the invention includes a method of resecting a portion of a luminal structure by defining a first luminal structure and a second luminal structure by severing the original luminal structure. The interior tissue of the second luminal structure is secured to the distal end of an elongate body disposed within the second luminal structure. Partial retraction of the distal end of the elongate body forms a circumferential fold in the second luminal structure and isolates a tissue mass between the circumferential fold and the distal end of the elongate body. The second luminal structure is then transected circumferentially at or adjacent the circumferential fold, thereby severing the tissue mass. The tissue mass is then removed by retracting the distal end of the elongate body. The free end of the second luminal structure is then urged against the free end of the first luminal structure and the two structures are secured by conventional surgical methods, such as with a surgical stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an alternate embodiment, the invention includes a method of resecting a portion of a luminal structure by inserting a device with 3 tissue fixing heads into a luminal structure past a desired point of resection. For ease of reference, the tissue fixing heads are referred to as the distal head, medial head and proximal head. The distal head is disposed on the distal end of a first elongate body. The medial head and proximal head are disposed on the distal end of a second elongate body that has a lumen running through its length. The second elongate body therefore slides over the first elongate body. The medial head is adjacent the distal head when the second elongate body is at its further extent over the first elongate body.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Once positioned, a first suture is tied around the outside of the luminal structure between the distal head and medial head such that the tissue of the luminal structure is held securely against the distal head or first elongate body. A second suture is similarly tied around the outside of the luminal structure between the medial head and proximal head. The luminal structure is then transected between the first and second sutures thereby defining a first luminal structure and a second luminal structure. The second elongate body is then partially retracted (over the first elongate body) causing the medial and proximal heads to move away from the distal head and the free end of the second luminal structure to fold in circumferentially on itself (invaginate).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A third suture is tied around the interior of the circumferential fold thereby isolating a tissue mass between the third suture the medial head. The tissue mass is then severed and withdrawn by retracting the second elongate body. The free end of the second luminal body (adjacent the third suture) is then urged into contact with the free end of the first luminal body (adjacent the first suture) by sliding a joining device over the first elongate body into operative communication with the distal head. The free ends are then secured to one another by known surgical methods, such as with a surgical stapler.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention, along with its multiple embodiments, is described here in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical structures. As used herein, and as is traditional, the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers that structure, or that portion of a structure, which is farthest from the point of insertion to the luminal structure and/or the operator. The term &#x201c;proximal,&#x201d; in keeping with its traditional meaning, refers that structure, or that portion of a structure, which is closest the point of insertion to the luminal structure and/or the operator. While the description of the invention relates to resection of a portion of the colon, other embodiments may be utilized including utility in other luminal structures. Therefore, structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, colectomy device <b>10</b> comprises distal approximating device <b>20</b> and folding device <b>30</b>. Distal approximating device <b>20</b> further comprises guide tube <b>22</b> having leading end <b>24</b> and distal head <b>26</b>. Guide tube <b>22</b> is a semi-rigid, non-compressible (lengthwise) structure. Optionally, guide tube <b>22</b> is steerable device such as the steerable endoscope described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,203. In one embodiment, distal head <b>26</b> is an anvil adapted to cooperate with a surgical stapler. In an alternate embodiment, distal head <b>26</b> comprises an expandable member and/or a gripping mechanism for gripping the wall of the colon. The expandable member may be an inflatable balloon or a mechanically expandable mechanism, as is known in the art. The gripping mechanism may comprise a plurality of circumferentially located ports within which attachment points, e.g., needles, hooks, barbs, etc., may be retractably positioned about an exterior surface of the expandable member. Alternatively, the gripping mechanism may be a vacuum gripper through a plurality of circumferentially located ports around distal head <b>26</b> or other known gripping mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Folding device <b>30</b> further comprises elongate body <b>32</b> having a lumen there through (not shown) and fixing mechanism <b>34</b>. Fixing mechanism <b>34</b> further comprises proximal head <b>36</b> and medial head <b>38</b>. Folding device <b>30</b> is provided such that it is slidably moveable over guide tube <b>22</b>. Proximal head <b>36</b> and medial head <b>38</b> can be static structures or can comprise an expandable mechanism as with distal head. Furthermore, proximal head <b>36</b> and medial head <b>38</b> can include a gripping mechanism, discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cutaway drawing showing colectomy device <b>10</b> positioned within luminal structure <b>12</b>, here a colon. In this example, distal head <b>26</b>, medial head <b>38</b> and proximal head <b>36</b> are all positioned such that tumor (<b>19</b>) is proximal in relation to fixing mechanism <b>34</b>. In other words, the diseased portion of colon is between the area of insertion (here the anus) and proximal head <b>36</b>. The position of fixing mechanism <b>34</b> can be confirmed with an x-ray or with visualization with a colonoscope. The operator next inserts the laparoscopic instruments as usual and begins dissecting the colon's mesentery and ligating its blood supply. It is possible that the operator may find the added weight of colectomy device <b>10</b> in the colon slows progress. Optionally, colectomy device <b>10</b> can be inserted after the dissection.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the section of colon to be removed (<b>17</b>) has been successfully mobilized (its blood supply cut off), first suture <b>40</b> is placed around the exterior of the colon wall adjacent the proximal side of distal head <b>26</b>. Second suture <b>42</b> is similarly placed around the exterior of the colon wall between medial head <b>38</b> and proximal head <b>36</b>. Following the placement of the sutures the colon would be cut between first suture <b>40</b> and second suture <b>42</b> thereby forming first luminal structure <b>100</b> and second luminal structure <b>200</b>. First suture <b>40</b> and second suture <b>42</b> are placed with laparoscopic techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although this embodiment uses laparoscopically placed sutures, any method of circumferentially securing the luminal tissue firmly against guide tube <b>22</b> is contemplated. For example, distal head <b>26</b> can be a gripping mechanism (as discussed above), such as a vacuum, that applies sufficient gripping force to hold free end <b>105</b> of first luminal structure <b>100</b> tightly against guide tube <b>22</b> and/or the proximal surface of distal head <b>26</b>. Similarly, fixing mechanism <b>34</b> can be adapted with a similar gripping mechanism sufficient to hold free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure against elongate body <b>32</b> between proximal head <b>36</b> and medial head <b>38</b>. Alternatively, fixing mechanism <b>34</b> can be adapted with a gripping mechanism sufficient to hold free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure against either the proximal surface of medial head <b>38</b> and/or the distal surface of proximal head <b>36</b>. The circumferentially secure attachment of the luminal wall to a surface of colectomy device <b>10</b>, such as guide tube <b>22</b>, prevents leakage of the contents of the colon into the peritoneal (i.e. abdominal) cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure <b>200</b> is then folded inward (invaginates) circumferentially to form a circumferential fold and a tissue mass (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>). In a first embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a colonoscope (not shown) is inserted through the anus so that fixing mechanism <b>34</b> can be visualized. Air, or any suitable gas, is introduced into the second luminal structure causing it to radially expand. Fixing mechanism <b>34</b> is then slowly retracted, over guide tube <b>22</b>, causing free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure <b>200</b> to fold inward forming circumferential fold <b>220</b> and tissue mass <b>230</b>. Tissue mass <b>230</b>, generally, comprises the portion of tissue between circumferential fold <b>220</b> and second suture <b>42</b>. The stopping point of retraction is where the mesentery (source of blood supply) is still attached to the colon (not shown). A colonoscope and/or laparoscope can be used to monitor the process.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An alternate embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, utilizes a ring structure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to assist in forming circumferential fold <b>220</b> and tissue mass <b>230</b>. Ring structure <b>60</b> comprises outer tube <b>62</b>, T-shaped head <b>64</b> and loop <b>66</b>. Outer tube <b>62</b> is a hollow, semi-rigid tube with a lumen there through. Loop <b>66</b> is formed from semi-rigid, preferably solid, rod <b>66</b><i>a </i>which exits T-shaped head <b>64</b> on a first end <b>64</b><i>a </i>and then circles around to attach to the other side of the T-shaped head <b>64</b> on a second end <b>64</b><i>b</i>. The semi-rigid material of loop <b>66</b> is slidably disposed within the lumen of outer tube <b>62</b> to dilate loop <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Returning now to the alternate embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a colonoscope (not shown) is inserted through the anus so that fixing mechanism <b>34</b> can be visualized. Air, or other suitable gas, is introduced into second luminal structure <b>200</b> causing it to radially expand. Ring structure <b>60</b> is then inserted longitudinally over colectomy device <b>10</b> until loop <b>66</b> is adjacent the interior of free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure <b>200</b>, and by extension fixing mechanism <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once ring structure <b>60</b> is inserted to where loop <b>66</b> is around fixing mechanism <b>34</b>, loop <b>66</b> is expanded radially by sliding rod <b>66</b><i>a </i>forward. Fixing mechanism <b>34</b> is then slowly retracted, over guide tube <b>22</b>, causing free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure <b>200</b> to fold inward forming circumferential fold <b>220</b> and tissue mass <b>230</b>. Ring structure <b>60</b> is also retracted, however, but at about half the rate of fixing mechanism <b>34</b> as it is used to ensure the colon folds inward upon itself. A colonoscope and/or laparoscope can be used to monitor the process. The stopping point of retraction is where the mesentery (source of blood supply) is still attached to the colon (not shown). When the colon has been folded upon itself a sufficient amount, ring structure <b>60</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once circumferential fold <b>220</b> and tissue mass <b>230</b> are properly defined, suturing device <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is used to place third suture <b>44</b> on the inner surface circumferential fold <b>220</b>. Third suture <b>44</b> firmly secures the tissue of circumferential fold <b>220</b> against guide tube <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Suturing device <b>70</b> comprises semi-rigid rod <b>72</b> and suture loop <b>74</b>. Suture material <b>74</b><i>a </i>is disposed through lumen <b>76</b> in rod <b>72</b>. A locking device (not shown) allows suture material <b>74</b><i>a </i>to be pulled through lumen <b>76</b> to tighten suture loop <b>74</b> but does not allow the loop to loosen once tightened. The diameter of the locking device is less than the diameter of the inner diameter of rod <b>72</b> so that suture loop <b>74</b> is tightened when rod <b>72</b> is pushed inward and/or the suture material <b>74</b><i>a </i>is pulled proximally through lumen <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Suturing device <b>70</b> is inserted longitudinally with folding device <b>30</b> in the lumen formed by suture loop <b>74</b>. Suture loop <b>74</b> passes over folding device <b>30</b> and past fixing mechanism <b>34</b> until it is adjacent the inner surface of circumferential fold <b>220</b>. Rod <b>72</b> is then pushed forward, causing the locking device to cinch suture loop <b>74</b> against guide tube <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). An electric cautery knife on the colonoscope, or other cutting device, is then used to transect the colon wall proximally of circumferential fold <b>220</b> thereby severing tissue mass <b>230</b>. Tissue mass <b>23</b>, which is retained by fixing mechanism <b>34</b>, is removed through the anus by retracting fixing mechanism <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Proximal approximating device <b>80</b> is then used to join free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure <b>200</b> to free end <b>105</b> of first luminal structure <b>100</b>. Proximal approximating device <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) comprises elongate body <b>82</b>, which has a lumen there through, and joining mechanism <b>84</b> disposed on the distal end of elongate body <b>82</b>. In one embodiment, joining mechanism <b>84</b> is a surgical stapling device similar to the transanal, circumferential staplers known in the art (i.e. PROXIMATE ILS&#x2122; and ENDOPATH STEALTH&#x2122; intraluminal staplers from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.). In this embodiment, joining mechanism <b>84</b> is a surgical stapler adapted to cooperate with an anvil disposed on distal head <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Proximal approximating device <b>80</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is inserted longitudinally over guide tube <b>22</b>. Proximal approximating device <b>80</b> is slidably displaced over guide tube <b>22</b>, and/or guide tube <b>22</b> is withdrawn through the lumen of proximal approximating device <b>80</b>, until free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure <b>200</b> and free end <b>105</b> of first luminal structure <b>100</b> are adjacent. Joining device <b>84</b> is then activated thereby affixing free end <b>205</b> of second luminal structure <b>200</b> to free end <b>105</b> of first luminal structure <b>100</b>. The final result is the anastomosed colon as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
