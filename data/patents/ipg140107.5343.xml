<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/202,597 filed on Mar. 16, 2009 and entitled, &#x201c;ROAD MAP BASED NAVIGATION IN SENSOR NETWORKS SYSTEM AND METHOD&#x201d; for all purposes. The entirety of this application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Path planning and navigation have been studied for many years in connection with a variety of fields of study such as, for example, in the fields of Robotics and Computational Geometry. In these or similar contexts, environmental conditions are presumed to be globally available and such information is further presumed to be universally shared with all other elements. Thus, centralized computing can be conducted with nearly perfect global knowledge of the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, navigation through a wireless sensor network presents a number of difficulties. For example, in such cases, the navigation typically must be performed in a distributed manner over a self-organized network consisting of a huge number of nodes. Thus, environmental information typically must be rapidly captured with respect to the distributed nodes. In addition, such navigation architecture would, in many cases, be required to rapidly adapt and react to environmental variations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Previous research has been directed toward problems relating to solving the minimum or maximum exposure path in a network. In particular, conventional literature largely relies on exhaustive search over the entire network, which can be too slow for many practical applications. In addition, conventional systems have also proposed the use of heuristics to compute paths in a distributed manner. However, these solutions treat individual sensor nodes as adversaries rather than utilizing them as infrastructures and thus do not provide an adequate solution for navigation in dynamic environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosed subject matter in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the disclosed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter disclosed herein, in one or more aspects thereof, comprises an architecture that can determine safety-oriented navigation paths in connection with a wireless sensor network deployed in a hazardous environment. Appreciably, the hazardous environment differs from a static environment that can be effectively navigated by avoiding certain predetermined locations, since hazards can be newly arisen, migrate to different locations, or dissipate entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance therewith and to other related ends, the architecture can employ a monitor component that can be configured to receive a hazard signal from at least one alarming sensor included in a sensor array, wherein the hazard signal indicates a detected presence of danger proximal to the at least one alarming sensor. The sensor array can be distributed in a local environment, thus, the local environment can be defined by a detection radius of the sensor array.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the architecture can include a mapping component that can be configured to construct a road map scaled to dimensions of the local environment. The road map can include a route backbone that depicts one or more recommended paths through the local environment selected based upon a distance from the detected presence of danger.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of one or more non-limiting embodiments. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the claimed subject matter may be employed and the claimed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and distinguishing features of the claimed subject matter will become apparent from the following detailed description of the various embodiments when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One or more embodiments are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">What is disclosed herein generally relates to a road map based navigation system and method, termed as RMB, which provides human navigation in the distributed sensor networks without relying on location information. RMB can embed a distributed road map in the sensor network, which can operate as a public infrastructure (e.g., the sensors can be treated as waypoints for constructing suitable courses or other navigation) for providing guidance information for internal inquiries. Multiple individual entities can issue queries to the road map and can be instructed with regard to recommended routes to safely avoid emergency or dangerous situations or the like. Also detailed are efficient mechanisms to update the road map system according to the variations of dangerous areas while maintaining its accuracy and effectiveness. The incurred network traffic cost is bounded by O(&#x221a;{square root over (n)}) where n is the network size. This approach is effective and highly scalable when the network size is large and multiple users are simultaneously navigated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In general, RMB comprises four stages. They are: (1) building the road map, (2) guiding or navigating entities through suitable paths, (3) reacting to emergency dynamics, and (4) further improving route efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In broad terms, at the first stage, the basic framework (e.g., route backbone) of the road map can be constructed by concatenating the medial axis of the safe region. At the second stage, the road map framework can be utilized as a backbone for navigating different entities inside the field. An exit in one of the cells can be identified and a route connecting the exit and the internal user can be constructed. Thus, each entity can be guided through the roads to reach the destination exit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At the third stage, the variation of dangerous areas can be categorized according to four basic types, including emerging, expanding, shrinking, and diminishing. An updating principle can then be implemented which additively rebuilds the road map according to the emergency dynamics and affects only a local district, by maintaining a status in each node in the field to record the set of the closest dangerous points to that node and the distance between a gateway. Each time a point is switched into or out of a dangerous area, only those points which have correlations to it are updated, such as considering the updated node as the closest dangerous point. The fourth stage relates to construction of shortcuts as supplements to the original recommended paths to improve route efficiency and/or traversal speed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be appreciated that the embedded distributed road map system in the sensor network can provide entities navigating routes with maximum safety without relying on predetermined location information of the sensor network. Rather, the road map can be generated according to the distribution of dangerous areas and thus characterizes the features of safety in the field. The navigation system can maintain the road map as a public infrastructure, and guide different entities across the field through the same paths that are constructed or change based upon the behavior or existence of detected dangerous conditions. Such can mitigate the unnecessary overhead extent in conventional systems of individually planning routes for different users. The road map can further be updated in an event-driven manner when the dangerous areas vary.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Given that in conventional systems unawareness of location information always leads to low efficiency of the system, since additional requirements of frequent global information exchange and coordination to assist local decisions is necessitated. Moreover, global collaboration can be quite expensive in terms of reaction time, which is infeasible under many emergency situations. Accordingly, RMB addresses these issues in a scalable way. The road map provides for an updating scheme that additively rebuilds the road map system in the event of changes in dangerous areas, which involves fewer global operations, mitigates network overhead, and thereby is able to accommodate more requests simultaneously over a larger area.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used in this application, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;system,&#x201d; or the like can, but need not, refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component might be, but is not limited to be, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a controller and the controller can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, the various embodiments may be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof to control a computer to implement the disclosed subject matter. The term &#x201c;article of manufacture&#x201d; as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media.

Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer-readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving electronic mail or in accessing a network such as the Internet or a local area network (LAN). Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope or spirit of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, the word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather, use of the word exemplary is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion. As used in this application, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is intended to mean an inclusive &#x201c;or&#x201d; rather than an exclusive &#x201c;or.&#x201d; Therefore, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, &#x201c;X employs A or B&#x201d; is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then &#x201c;X employs A or B&#x201d; is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances. In addition, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;hazard&#x201d; or &#x201c;danger&#x201d; generally refer to a condition extant in an environment that is potentially harmful or disruptive to the safety of some entity, such as a human, in the environment or to an action or behavior thereof. Hazards or dangers can be sufficiently serious to necessitate or encourage evacuation of the entity from the local environment or to a safe area therein.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, sensor array <b>120</b> as well as other references to multiple sensors are intended to refer to a sensor network in which all or a portion of the sensors in the sensor network are equipped for communication with one another, typically in a wireless manner. Typically, a sensor network comprises numerous sensors that can be spatially deployed in the field under surveillance, monitoring physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, light, radiation, vibration, composition, sound and so on. Sensors can be randomly deployed in disaster areas or inaccessible terrain, which can enable the sensor network a wide variety of applications. Sensor networks can be specifically adapted to many applications, including, e.g., environment and habitat monitoring, battlefield surveillance, healthcare, traffic control or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In more detail, a sensor can be a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into signals which can be received and/or interpreted by suitable instruments or other sensors. Sensors can consist of a sensing unit, a processing unit, a transceiver unit, a power unit, usually a battery, as well as other suitable components, either hardware or software. The envisaged size of a single sensor node can vary from shoebox-sized nodes down to devices the size of grain of dust. Sensor nodes can communicate with one other within their communication range, classically through radio transmission, cooperatively forming the sensor network to perform a specific sensing task.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Most existing applications treat the sensor network as a media of data acquisition, concentrating on organizing a data-centric network for efficiently collecting, routing, and processing in-network sensory data. Recently, however, researchers have explored more versatile applications of sensor networks beyond simply viewing them as tools for monitoring the physical world. For example, in a field deployed with sensors capable of detecting disruptive or dangerous events like a chemical spill or outbreak of fire, the sensor network can be employed to aid navigation, thereby guiding the movements of evacuees out of danger, which is further detailed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Accordingly, the disclosed subject matter particularly relates in part to utilizing a sensor network as a reactive architecture, which can facilitate guidance to locations of safety and/or away from danger. In other words, a sensor network, in the presence of hazards, focus on in-situ entity interactions with the sensor network infrastructure. Moreover, in general, it is not necessary to employ one or more sinks as data processing centers, yet there need not further be any need for collecting and/or analyzing in the aggregate all the sensory data distributed over the field. Rather, all operations can be carried out in a distributed manner between various entities (e.g., <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>) and the sensor network. For example, individual entities can be provided the ability to issue queries and follow the recommended routes to safely avoid emergency or dangerous situations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To further underscore distinctions between the subject matter disclosed herein and conventional systems, it should be appreciated that existing approaches require location information associated with each sensor. In contrast, the disclosed subject matter can provide navigation without any pre-knowledge of either entity location or sensor location. It should be appreciated that in many realistic situation, where emergency conditions exist and emergency guidance is sought, an expectation of pre-known positions of the sensors is often unrealistic. By removing this constraint, sensors can be randomly deployed in a rapid manner, with very little warning and without significant preparation of the environment beforehand. Thus, the applicability of the disclosed subject matter can be greatly extended.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the disclosed subject matter can operate in light of emergency dynamics, which has not yet been explored by previous approaches. Moreover, an efficient updating scheme that can locally update the navigation routes when danger zones vary or migrate, which can substantially reduce network overhead and provide substantial scalability. Under realistic models, it is necessary to expect conditions in dangerous areas to be changing (e.g., emergency dynamics) in unpredictable and potentially rapid ways. Such variations will often degrade the effectiveness or even overwhelm existing designs that do not specifically consider the impact of variations of, e.g., dangerous areas. Accordingly, the disclosed subject matter can provide timely and efficient re-planning and updating of safe routes for the users in the event of variations with respect to dangerous areas.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Continuing the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> can further include mapping component <b>110</b> that can be configured to construct road map <b>114</b> scaled to dimensions of local environment <b>112</b>. As discussed, due to the inherent scalability, local environment <b>112</b> can be virtually any size, in this case, limited only by the dimensions and detection radius of sensor array <b>120</b>. Road map <b>114</b> can include route backbone <b>132</b> that depicts one or more recommended paths <b>130</b> through local environment <b>112</b>, which can be selected based upon a distance from detected presence of danger <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Given that road map <b>114</b> is intended to be a model or representation of local environment <b>112</b>, there exist numerous relationships between elements physically extent in local environment <b>112</b> and modeled or virtualized elements included in road map <b>114</b> such as a relationship between the physical recommended path <b>130</b> that traverses local environment <b>112</b> and its modeled counterpart, route backbone <b>132</b> included in road map <b>114</b>. For the remainder of this document, care is taken to distinguish between related elements, however, it should be appreciated that where there is little chance for confusion or ambiguity to arise, corresponding terms (such as those listed in boxes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> respectively) might be utilized interchangeably. For example, while alarming sensor <b>106</b> refers specifically to an element of local environment <b>112</b>, it should not cause confusion for the terms &#x201c;alarming node&#x201d; (e.g., alarming node <b>116</b>, which is a corresponding representation of alarming sensor <b>106</b> constructed in road map <b>114</b>) to be employed in connection with local environment <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, several of the terms and/or reference numerals listed in boxes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> will be introduced or further detailed with reference to the remaining figures which are intended to be referred to in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Hence, while still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but turning now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, graphic depiction <b>200</b> of example local environment <b>112</b> is provided. Graphic depiction <b>200</b> illustrates sensor array <b>120</b> dispersed throughout local environment. Here, as is likely to be typical, a majority of the sensors are nominal sensors <b>108</b> (depicted as white circles), for which no presence of danger <b>124</b> or other alarming condition is detected. Additionally, a number of the sensors are alarming sensors <b>106</b> that have detected a presence of danger <b>124</b>. By combining detected presences of danger for all alarming sensors <b>106</b>, we see three distinct danger areas <b>140</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>140</b><sub>3</sub>. Also depicted are an example recommended path <b>130</b> that can be constructed based upon an identification of sensors in the sensor array that are a certain minimum distance from one or more danger areas <b>140</b>. Furthermore, safe area <b>150</b>, mobility entity <b>160</b> and gateway sensor <b>170</b> also reside in local environment <b>112</b>. Once these elements are connected to recommended path <b>130</b>, instructions for a safe evacuation of mobile entity can be provided. As an example, graphic depiction <b>200</b> can represent an individual (e.g., mobile entity <b>160</b>) who located in a forest, with the danger regions <b>140</b> indicated detected presence of a fire.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Similarly, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an example road map <b>114</b> corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is illustrated. Since road map <b>114</b> is intended to represent a model of local environment <b>112</b>, the example road map <b>114</b> includes corresponding elements, such as route backbone <b>132</b>, danger regions <b>142</b> (corresponding to the danger areas <b>140</b> of local environment <b>112</b>), exit point <b>152</b>, evacuating entity <b>162</b> and gateway node <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While still referencing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, and continuing the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be appreciated that in one or more aspect, route backbone <b>132</b> can comprises a set of edges that join a sequence of adjacent nodes that correspond to respective locations within local environment <b>112</b> of nominal sensors <b>108</b> included in the sensor array. Accordingly, mapping component <b>110</b> can identify at least one safe area <b>150</b> within local environment <b>112</b> and can plot exit point <b>152</b> on road map <b>114</b>, wherein exit point <b>152</b> can correspond to the at least one safe area <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, mapping component <b>110</b> can also identify at least one mobile entity <b>160</b> extant in the local environment <b>112</b> and can plot at least one evacuating entity <b>162</b> on the road map connected to a proximal point of route backbone <b>132</b>. Furthermore, mapping component <b>110</b> can connect the at least one exit point <b>152</b> to the route backbone <b>132</b> with an edge that (1) intersects a proximal point, denoted a gateway (e.g., <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>), on the route backbone and (2) depicts recommended path <b>130</b> through local environment <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be understood that in one or more aspect, mapping component <b>110</b> can connect the at least one exit point <b>152</b> to gateway <b>172</b> of route backbone based upon a concatenation of a medial axis of exit point <b>152</b>, wherein the medial axis can include a set of points, each of which is a minimum distance from at least two danger regions <b>142</b>. These danger regions <b>142</b> can be readily detected since mapping component <b>110</b> can include in road map <b>114</b> at least one danger region <b>142</b> that corresponds to danger area(s) <b>140</b> a in the local environment <b>114</b> that encompasses a contiguous set of alarming sensors <b>106</b>. Moreover, when considering regions beyond the scope of local environment <b>112</b>, which can relate to how the borders of local environment <b>112</b> are treated, various options exist. For example, in one aspect mapping component <b>110</b> can treat regions beyond the local environment <b>112</b> that correspond to areas outside the detection radius of sensor array <b>120</b> as one or more of the at least one danger region <b>142</b>. Additionally or alternatively, mapping component <b>110</b> can treat at least one region beyond the local environment <b>112</b> that corresponds to areas outside the detection radius of sensor array <b>120</b> as a safe region <b>150</b>, thus plotting an exit point <b>152</b> on road map <b>114</b> to correspond to the safe region <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In accordance with the above, one can consider the scenario of sensor network navigation on the field under emergencies, where there might be several dangerous areas that threaten the safety of human beings or other mobile entities. As discussed, a wireless sensor network can be deployed on the field, and each entity can be equipped with a communicating device like 802.15.4 compatible Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) that can interface with the sensors. By measuring the strength and direction of wireless signals, the entity is able to track any targeted sensor node without fore knowledge of the location of the sensor. An objective of a successful navigation is to plan a path for the user to one or more pre-known exits on the field which lead to safe departure, bypassing all dangerous areas. Thus, the recommended route can be represented by a sequence of sensor nodes and the entity can be directed along those sensor nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, graphic model <b>300</b> is presented illustrating an example outline of danger regions <b>142</b>. As noted supra, given that an initial stage is to build the road map, RMB can treat any targeted area or curve as a set of points and each point can correspond to a sensor node. Therefore, let the entire emergent field be region E. Further, let n be the number of dangerous areas and the i-th dangerous area is D<sub>i</sub>={d|d is the alarming sensor node which detects the dangerous event}, i=1 . . . n. The combination of dangerous areas is region</p>

and the remained safe region is R=E\D, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Accordingly, the road map is built in region R, since entities are presumed to only move outside dangerous areas for ensuring safety.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In further detail, s.danger marks whether the current node resides within or outside a dangerous area. In this example, s.danger is 0 if the current node is outside the dangerous area and s.danger is set to the ID of the dangerous area if the current node resides in such a dangerous area. Appreciably, s.border can be a Boolean variable that indicates whether the current node is on the boundary of the dangerous area. Moreover, s.mDist records the distance (hops) from the current node to the nearest dangerous area, and s.mSet records the set of nodes on the boundaries of dangerous areas that are of s.mDist to the current node. s.road is a Boolean variable that indicates whether the current node is on the road map backbone. s.nextHop stores the ID of the next hop node along the path direction on the road. s.rDist records the minimum distance (hops) to the dangerous areas on the path from the current node to the exit. s.potential records the potential value of the ordinary nodes</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For each dangerous area, every node inside the dangerous area can generate a random number as s.danger and flood that number across the danger area. The smallest number can be selected as the ID of the associated dangerous area, which is further detailed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, graphic depiction <b>400</b> illustrates an example scheme for discovering or defining boundaries for danger areas. Based upon the foregoing alarming node <b>402</b> has generated the smallest random number, 1. Thus, each node can set the s.danger to this value. For the example in the upper portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the smallest number of the dangerous area is 1. Accordingly, every node inside that area should update each s.danger to 1, which is illustrated in the lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Furthermore, nodes beyond the confines of the dangerous areas set s.danger to 0, since these nodes are nominal and/or not in an alarming state, which is depicted in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides graphic depiction <b>500</b> illustrating boundary nodes, again with an upper portion associated with random IDs and a lower portion associated with like IDs. With alarming nodes all set to 1, and nominal nodes set to 0, it is readily apparent that pairs of neighboring sensors with different outcomes will represent boundary nodes <b>502</b> when instant node is an alarming node <b>106</b>. In other words s.border can be set for the nodes within a dangerous area that detect a comparison inequality for s.danger, signifying these nodes are boundary nodes. In the lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this example depicts a total of 7 boundary nodes that are grey-filled, two of which are labeled with reference numeral <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, graphic depiction <b>600</b> illustrating in more detail construction of the route backbone is provided. In particular, graphic depiction <b>600</b> illustrated a set of nominal nodes (white circles) and a set of alarming nodes that are further distinguished as either standard alarming nodes <b>106</b> (black fill) or boundary nodes <b>502</b> (grey fill). The set of alarming nodes are further presented in two distinct danger regions <b>142</b>, distinguished in this case by subscripts.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Boundaries nodes <b>502</b> for danger regions <b>142</b> can flood the status information to the rest of the field. Accordingly, each node can record the distance to the nearest boundary node <b>502</b> in s.mDist and the set of nodes on the borders of dangerous areas that are s.mDist away in s.mSet. The node whose s.mSet contains boundary nodes on two or more dangerous areas can set s.road to Y, signifying that at least one portion of route backbone <b>132</b> will intersect the node. For example in graphic depiction <b>600</b> illustrates node A is 2-hops away from both the nearest boundary nodes <b>502</b>, B and C, and therefore records s.mDist=2 and s.mSet={B, C}. Since B and C are from different dangerous areas, A sets s.road=Y.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, let the medial axis Z={z|z is the sensor node with s.road=Y}. The basic framework (e.g., route backbone <b>132</b>) of the road map <b>114</b> can be constructed by concatenating the medial axis of region R as illustrated. Thus, in one or more aspect of the disclosed subject matter, mapping component <b>110</b> can assign a potential value to a node included in road map <b>114</b> based at least in part upon data received from a corresponding sensor, wherein the potential value is inversely proportional to a distance between the corresponding sensor and a nearest danger area <b>140</b> (or danger region <b>142</b>). Accordingly, mapping component <b>110</b> can maximize a minimum distance from all or a portion of danger regions included in road map <b>114</b> to construct route backbone <b>132</b> and, further can assign a direction to one or more segment of the route backbone <b>132</b> based upon descending potential values for nodes included in the one or more segment, which is further discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, mapping component <b>110</b> can connect exit point <b>152</b> or an evacuation entity <b>162</b> to the route backbone <b>132</b> based upon descending potential values for connected nodes extending from the exit point <b>152</b> or the evacuation entity <b>162</b> to the route backbone <b>132</b>. Appreciably, the potential value of the node can be determined based at least in part upon information that propagates from a gateway sensor <b>170</b> that corresponds to a gateway node <b>172</b> for the road map <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In more detail, the information can propagate from the gateway sensor <b>170</b> to other sensors in the sensor array <b>120</b> that correspond to nodes included in the road map <b>114</b>, wherein the information includes, e.g., (1) an indication of distance to a nearest danger area <b>140</b>, denoted d<sub>c</sub>, (2) an indication of a distance to the gateway sensor <b>170</b> that increases as the information propagates to subsequent other sensors, denoted d<sub>r</sub>, and (3) a direction for the route backbone <b>132</b> for nodes along the route backbone <b>132</b>, denoted D. Accordingly, mapping component <b>110</b> can construct route backbone <b>132</b> based upon a comparison between multiple nodes included in the road map <b>114</b>, wherein the comparison selects nodes associated with a larger d<sub>c</sub>, or a smaller d<sub>r </sub>when d<sub>c </sub>are equal for compared nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> respectively depict two examples of basic route backbones that navigate dangerous regions. The road map framework can divide a region, R, into different components, called cells, which are denoted C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2 </sub>. . . C<sub>n</sub>. Each cell contains a dangerous area inside it. With the potential value s.potential=1/s.mDist, the ordinary nodes around the dangerous area in the cell comprise a virtual power field. In practical usage, however, when sensor nodes are sparsely deployed over the field, the nodes on the road backbone may not be connected into one component. To solve this difficulty, we compromise the accuracy of the medial axis, letting s.mSet of each node store the boundary nodes of both s.mDist and s.mDist+1 distance to it. By such means, the medial axis is indeed broadened and more nodes are dedicated on the road backbone, largely increasing the connectivity of route backbone <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">RMB will typically default to treating the area out of the sensor field as dangerous, since without any sensing information about such area we consider it dangerous in order to increase the safety of navigation. The consequent road map is then built as depicted by graphic depiction <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, illustrating 7 distinct cells. We can also choose to consider the sensor field boundary safe, for example in the case where we have some preliminary information on the boundary, e.g., the sensor field is indoor environment safely surrounded by walls or fences or the like. In this case, the road map is built as shown by graphic depiction <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Since the two cases are essentially similar, without loss of generality, in the following, we mainly focus on the first case.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">To describe the above in consistent terms, in one or more aspect, road map <b>114</b> can include multiple danger regions <b>142</b> (as well as, potentially, boundaries of road map <b>114</b>) and mapping component <b>110</b> can divide road map <b>114</b> into multiple cells (e.g., C<sub>1 </sub>. . . ) with each cell including exactly one danger region <b>142</b> and at least one exit point <b>152</b> that represents a boundary along route backbone <b>132</b> between at least two adjacent cells or a final destination for an evacuating entity <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, graphic depiction <b>900</b> provides a route backbone and assigns directions to segments of the route backbone. Appreciably, at this point it is readily apparent that the road map framework can be utilized as a backbone for navigating different users inside the field. Exploring a route from the internal entity (e.g., entity <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>) to the exits can therefore include: (1) connecting the exits and internal entity to the road backbone, respectively; (2) assigning directions on the road map; (3) navigating each user to the destination exit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For the sake of simplicity, assume there is only one exit point <b>152</b>, even though it should be appreciated that numerous exit points could exist. In order to build a route connecting the exit and the road map backbone, we find the exit in the cells. The route extends from the exit at each point along the most descending direction of the virtual field until it reaches the border of the cell, e.g., the road backbone. In the discrete sensor network, the most descending direction is to select among all its direct neighbors the one which has the least potential value s.potential for a node. The route connecting the destination exit intersects the road backbone at a point we call the gateway (e.g., gateway <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>). Building a route connecting the internal entity and the road map backbone is a similar process that the route extends from the internal entities.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Directions for the road map (characterized by graphic depiction <b>900</b> as arrows) can indicate a safe path towards the gateway for each point on the backbone. Thus, it is prudent to choose a path maximizing the closest distance to the dangerous areas. Such can be achieved by flooding from the gateway throughout the road backbone. As introduced above, the flooded message F (not shown) contains two items, d<sub>c</sub>, which records the minimum number of hops to the dangerous areas along the road from the current node to the gateway, and d<sub>r</sub>, which records the number of hops along the road from the current node to the gateway. The basic idea is to choose a path with a minimum d<sub>c</sub>, and with shortest d<sub>r </sub>while several paths have the same minimum d<sub>c</sub>. Each point receives the flooded information from different directions. Usually, the flooded information only comes from the two directions along the road but possibly multiple directions at the branch points where multiple roads segments intersect. A suitable programmatic example of this process is detailed in connection with Algorithm 1, listed below.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, graphic depiction <b>900</b> also illustrates that navigating each entity to the destination exit includes three stages: (1) Each entity is guided from the inside of the cell to the road backbone. (2) Along the road backbone, entities from different cells are navigated towards the gateway. (3) The &#x201c;last-mile&#x201d; navigation is guided along the route that connects the exit and the gateway on the road map.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, computer implemented system <b>1000</b> that provides additional features in connection with determining safety-oriented navigation paths through dangerous environments is depicted. Generally, system <b>1000</b> can include substantially any suitable feature or aspect discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or elsewhere herein. For example, system <b>1000</b> can include monitor component <b>102</b> that can receive hazard signal <b>104</b> from an alarming sensor <b>106</b> as substantially detailed supra. In addition, system <b>1000</b> can also include mapping component <b>110</b> that can construct road map <b>114</b>, also previously detailed in connection with system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Additionally or alternatively, system <b>1000</b> can further include one or more additional components such as navigation component <b>1002</b>, update component <b>1008</b>, and/or shortcut component <b>114</b>. In more detail, navigation component <b>1002</b> that can configure a set of instructions <b>1004</b> to guide mobile entity <b>1006</b> along at least a portion of recommended path <b>130</b> to at least one safe area <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">On the other hand, update component <b>1008</b> can be configured to continuously monitor data received from sensor array <b>120</b>. Based upon such monitoring, update component <b>1008</b> can facilitate at least one real time update <b>1010</b> to road map <b>114</b> upon detection of variation <b>1012</b> for one or more danger area <b>150</b> in the local environment <b>112</b>, which in turn can correspond to one or more danger region <b>152</b> in the road map <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be understood that in one or more aspect, update component <b>1008</b> can categorize variation <b>1010</b> as one of (1) an expanding variation identified based upon an indication of a nominal sensor <b>108</b> that is adjacent to an alarming sensor <b>106</b> transitioning to from nominal mode to alarming mode, (2) a shrinking variation identified based upon an indication of an alarming sensor <b>106</b> that is adjacent to at least one other alarming sensor <b>106</b> transitioning from alarming mode to shrinking mode, (3) an emerging variation identified based upon an indication of a nominal sensor that is adjacent to no alarming sensors transitioning from nominal mode to alarming mode, or (4) a diminishing variation identified based upon an indication of an alarming sensor that is adjacent to no other alarming sensors transitioning from alarming mode to nominal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In accordance therewith, update component <b>1008</b> can include in road map <b>114</b> an expanding node in connection with the expanding variation and increases dimensions of an adjacent danger region <b>142</b> to include the expanding node. Additionally or alternatively, update component <b>1008</b> can include in the road map a shrinking node in connection with the shrinking variation and decreases dimension of an adjacent danger region to exclude the shrinking node. Similarly, update component <b>1008</b> can include in the road map an emerging node in connection with the emerging variation and add a new danger region to the road map. Likewise, update component <b>1008</b> can include in the road map a diminishing node in connection with the diminishing variation and removes an associated danger region from the road map <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">While the above relates to dynamically redrawing danger regions <b>142</b>, it should be understood that update component <b>1008</b> can also redraw route backbone <b>132</b> based upon these changes. For example, update component <b>1008</b> can modify a d<sub>c </sub>value only for nodes that are nearer to the emerging node or the expanding node than to any other node extant in a danger region <b>142</b>. As another example, update component <b>1008</b> can modify a d<sub>c </sub>value only for nodes that are nearer to the shrinking node or the diminishing node than to any other node extant in a danger region <b>142</b>, wherein a modification to a d<sub>c </sub>value facilitates re-construction of the route backbone <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In more detail, when reacting to emergency dynamics (e.g., expanding, emerging, shrinking or diminishing danger regions <b>142</b>), it is readily apparent that for safety of evacuating entity, such changes should be reflected in the route backbone <b>132</b>. Moreover, due to the emergency dynamics, the dangerous areas might vary during the navigation process, so it is prudent to allow for such changes rapidly. There are several basic types of variation of dangerous areas which include emerging, expanding, shrinking, and diminishing. In RMB, the variation of dangerous areas is considered as a continuous process of switching a series of points into or out of the dangerous areas. The expanding of a dangerous area corresponds to a point beside the dangerous area is switched into the dangerous area. The shrinking of a dangerous area corresponds to a point on the boundary of the dangerous area is switched out of the dangerous area. The emerging of a dangerous area corresponds to a point inside the safe district is switched into a dangerous area. The diminishing of a dangerous area corresponds to the last point of the dangerous area is switched to be safe</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The updating principle additively rebuilds the road backbone according to the variations of dangerous areas. Each point in the field maintains a status recording the set of the closest dangerous points to it and the distance between them. Each time a point is switched into a dangerous area, we only update those points which will take it as their closest dangerous point. Similarly, each time a point is switched out of a dangerous area, we only update those points which record it as their previously closest dangerous point. Each time a sensor node is switched into or out of the dangerous area, it generates a report and floods it within those nodes that record it in their s.mSet. Those nodes accordingly update their s.mDist and s.mSet. The potential values of s.potential for those nodes are also updated. The road map backbone is then updated, and corresponding nodes update their s.road. The gateway node reinitiates a flood within the road backbone to reassign the path directions</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Continuing with the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, system <b>1000</b> can further include shortcut component <b>1014</b> that can identify one or more shortcut path <b>1016</b> between two inscribed points extant on the route backbone. The inscribed points, as well as other features associated with optimizing path distance are further detailed infra in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. However, briefly, shortcut path <b>1016</b> can differ from the path described by route backbone <b>132</b>. Particularly, shortcut path <b>1016</b> can represent a shortest distance between the two inscribed points while maintaining a minimum distance from a nearest danger region <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Shortcut component <b>1014</b> can further facilitate inclusion of the one or more shortcut path <b>1016</b> to road map <b>114</b>, which can be potentially be included in instructions <b>1004</b> delivered to mobile entity <b>1006</b>. It should be appreciated that the existence of a shortcut vis-&#xe0;-vis route backbone <b>132</b> is not necessarily guaranteed to result. Rather, shortcuts are typically the result of the inclusion of multiple danger regions <b>142</b>. Accordingly, shortcut component <b>1014</b> can initiate identification of the one or more shortcut path <b>1016</b> when road map <b>114</b> is divided into multiple cells.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Moreover, upon identification of the one or more shortcut path <b>1016</b>, shortcut component <b>1014</b> can establish a direction, D, for the one or more shortcut path <b>1016</b> consistent with an associated route backbone portion direction. Such can be initiated upon inclusion of the one or more shortcut path to the road map or upon an event signaled when an evacuating entity encounters one of the two inscribed points.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Turning now simultaneously to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, graphic depiction <b>1100</b> illustrates construction of inscribed points for identifying shortcuts over route backbone, while graphic depiction <b>1200</b> illustrates identification and/or construction of shortcuts.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As noted above, given the time factor can be significant in the navigation process, in order to reduce excessively long routes, we modify the road backbone as follows. Let the inscribed points P={p<sub>ij</sub>|p<sub>ij </sub>is the point on the road backbone between neighboring cells C<sub>i </sub>and C<sub>j </sub>that has the shortest distance d<sub>ij </sub>to the dangerous areas D<sub>i </sub>and D<sub>j</sub>, 1&#x2266;i,j&#x2266;n}, as illustrated by graphic depiction <b>1100</b>. Accordingly, in each cell we build a shortcut between each pair of neighboring inscribed points. The shortcut is a shortest path connecting two inscribed points that is no closer to the dangerous area than the closest end. It is built through a constraint flooding within the area of points farther to the dangerous area than the two inscribed points, as shown in graphic depiction <b>1200</b>. These shortcuts are used as supplements for the original roads.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A direction can be assigned to the shortcut if there is a directional path between its two ends on the original road map backbone and the assigned direction is the same with the original direction. For those shortcuts without directional paths between their two ends on the original road map backbone, we simply do not assign any direction for them. Later when the users are navigated along the road map backbone, they will move along those shortcuts with directions if they encounter any.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When there are two or more exits in the field, we can further improve the route safety and efficiency by navigating the users to relatively safer and closer exit. In this case, each exit connects it to the road backbone and floods their gateway information along the backbone. Each point on the backbone selects its direction heading towards the route with the minimum distance to the dangerous areas. Among the routes of the same distance to the dangerous areas, it chooses the shortest one. The resulted directional road is multiple trees rooted at different exit gateways. Again, we can supplement the road map with shortcuts to improve the route efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">With the foregoing in mind, the following propositions in connection with RMB should be readily apparent:</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">First, the local minimum points of the virtual power field in each cell only reside on the medial axis. This guarantees that we can successfully build a route connecting the exit and the road backbone without halted at an intermediate point of local minimum. Such a route ensures that any point on the route is not closer to the dangerous area than the destination exit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Second, on the road backbone, from any point to the gateway, the path along the assigned directions maximizes the minimum distance to the dangerous areas.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Third, the selected navigation route maximizes the minimum distance of all possible routes to the dangerous areas. This shows that the selected route provides user guaranteed safety in global span. Each user along the selected route never moves unnecessarily close to the dangerous areas. Meanwhile, the safety is globally guaranteed in the sense that we cannot find another route which is more distant away from the dangerous areas.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Fourth, for any given path segment on the selected navigation route, any substitute path will not be farther to the dangerous areas. This guarantees that any intermediate local path segment on the selected route yields the largest distance to the dangerous areas. We call this property local safety. Local safety provides the user even stronger safety guarantee at each intermediate step such that at any local step, the selected route guides the user through the safest way.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Fifth, the impact of the emergency dynamics in the field is local. When the dangerous area in a cell expands or shrinks continuously, only the points within that cell are affected. The emerging of a new dangerous point affects the points within the newly constructed cell and the diminishing of a dangerous point affects the points within the original cell. In short, any emergency dynamic affects only a local district bounded within the cell of the dangerous area. All points outside this district maintain their original status.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Sixth, after expanding or shrinking one point on A, the average sector-like region affected is of size O(s&#x2032;/&#x221a;{square root over (s)}), assuming the sizes of a dangerous area A and its surrounding cell c are s and s&#x2032; respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Seventh, the amortized size of the sector-like region affected by the variation of dangerous areas is O(&#x221a;{square root over (n)}). In each updating process when emergency varies, our method rebuilds the shape of the new road map with the cost of flooding and updating a local district of an amortized size O(&#x221a;{square root over (n)}). After rebuilding the shape of the new road map, we accordingly reassign the directions along the road backbone, which incurs local overhead on the compact backbone.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Eighth, the navigation route explored from the modified road map is a Max-Min route in terms of the distance to the dangerous areas.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> illustrate various methodologies in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the embodiments are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the various embodiments. Additionally, it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, exemplary computer implemented method <b>1300</b> for facilitating safety-based navigational guidance through a dangerous area is provided. Generally, at reference numeral <b>1302</b>, a road map can be generated to represent a model of a local environment.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Moreover, at reference numeral <b>1304</b>, at reference numeral <b>1304</b>, nodes of the road map can be assigned to correspond to respective locations within the local environment of a set of networked sensors whose sensor detection radii define boundaries for the local environment. Hence, for each sensor that appears in the local environment a corresponding node can be implemented in the road map. These nodes can serve as waypoints when constructing safe paths. Moreover, additional nodes can be added to the road map even when no corresponding sensor exists, which is detailed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">At reference numeral <b>1306</b>, a notification from at least one alarming sensor indicating a presence of danger in an area surrounding the at least one alarming sensor can be received. For example, the notification can be electronically received by suitable hardware such as s receiver or transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Accordingly, at reference numeral <b>1308</b>, at least one safe path for navigating the local environment based upon a distance of nominal sensors from the at least one alarming sensor can be determined. These calculations can be employed for construction of a safe route through the local environment. At reference numeral <b>1310</b>, the at least one safe path in the road map can be represented as a route backbone that intersects nodes that correspond to the nominal sensors included in the at least one safe path.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, exemplary computer implemented method <b>1400</b> for providing addition features in connection with for facilitating safety-based navigational guidance through a dangerous area is depicted. At reference numeral <b>1402</b>, at least one exit point corresponding to a target destination for a mobile entity in the local environment can be included in the road map. Likewise, at reference numeral <b>1404</b>, at least one evacuation entity that corresponds to the mobile entity can be included in the road map. Similarly, at reference numeral <b>1406</b>, a gateway node extant on both the route backbone and a medial axis for the exit point can be included in the road map. Having fully constructed the route backbone and attached the target location to the destination location instructions for navigation can ensue.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">However, to provide additional detail, it should be appreciated that, for example, at reference numeral <b>1408</b>, the at least one safe path for navigating the local environment can be determined further based upon distances from a nearest danger area and from the gateway node acquired by the set of sensors by way of message flooding propagating to successive sensors and origination from a sensor corresponding to the gateway node.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Moreover, at reference numeral <b>1410</b>, a direction for at least one segment of the route backbone can be determined based upon the information retained or propagated from the set of sensors. Thus, at reference numeral <b>1412</b>, instructions for directing the evacuating entity to the exit point can be provided while maximizing a minimum distance from a danger area based upon the route backbone.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, method <b>1500</b> for providing for updating and/or optimizing with respect to a road map for traversing a dynamic environment is illustrated. At reference numeral <b>1502</b>, a transition notification can be received from at one sensor in the set of sensors indicating the at least one sensor has switched from a nominal mode to an alarming mode or switched from an alarming mode to a nominal mode. Accordingly, emergence dynamics, for example, and be detected and accounted for.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">For instance, at reference numeral <b>1504</b>, the at least one sensor can be characterized as one of an expanding node, a shrinking mode, an emerging node, or a diminishing node based upon the transition notification and whether any node adjacent to the at least one node corresponds to an alarming sensor. Such characterization is described in more detail supra. As a result of such characterization, at reference numeral <b>1506</b>, dimensions of a danger region can be updated to include or exclude the at least one sensor, again, based upon the characterizing of reference numeral <b>1504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Moreover, at reference numeral <b>1508</b>, nodes of the route backbone can be updated by modifying distance data retained by corresponding sensors by way of message flooding only for sensors in which the at least one sensor newly represents a nearest danger region or was previously designated as the nearest danger region.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">At reference numeral <b>1510</b>, the road map can be separated into distinct cells with each cell comprising a single danger region and at least one exit point representing a boundary along the route backbone between at least two adjacent cells or an original exit point.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In addition, at reference numeral <b>1512</b>, at least one shortcut between two inscribed points existing on the route backbone can be included in the road map. It should be appreciated that the shortcut path differs from the route backbone and further represents a shortest distance between the two inscribed points while maintaining a minimum distance from a nearest danger region.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of an exemplary computer system operable to execute the disclosed architecture.

Additionally, while one or more embodiments described above may be suitable for application in the general context of computer-executable instructions that may run on one or more computers, those skilled in the art will recognize that such embodiments also can be implemented in combination with other program modules and/or as a combination of hardware and software.</p>
