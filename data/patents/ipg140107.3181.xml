<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C 119(a) to Korean Application Nos. 10-2010-0121243 and 10-2011-0123016, filed on Dec. 1, 2010 and Nov. 23, 2011, in the Korean intellectual property Office, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate generally to a semiconductor package and a method for manufacturing the same, and more particularly, to a semiconductor chip having a conductive protrusion formed therein to facilitate a test of a package, a semiconductor package using the same, and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With broadening uses of miniaturized and high-performance electronic products such as mobile products, the efforts for miniaturized, high-capacity semiconductor memory devices continue. To improve the memory capacity, a plurality of semiconductor chips may be mounted and assembled in a single package. Packaging is generally considered to be more effective and less costly to increase storage capacity as compared to improving the degree of high integration in the semiconductor chip. Therefore, a variety of attempts to increase the storage capacity of a semiconductor memory device through a multi-chip package having a plurality of semiconductor chips therein are being made.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The multi-chip package may have a vertical configuration or a horizontal configuration. The vertical configuration comprises a plurality of semiconductor chips stacked vertically, and the through-silicon via (TSV) is one of the key technologies for this type of multi-chip package with high density and high performance. The package employing TSVs has a configuration that a plurality of semiconductor chips are coupled in a vertical direction through TSVs which are formed in the respective semiconductor chips at a wafer level.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system in package (hereafter, referred to as SIP) is known as a package in which the same kind or various kinds of semiconductor devices are vertically stacked at a chip level or wafer level and the stacked wafers or chips are coupled to each other through TSVs. In such an SIP, the data storage density may be increased by stacking vertically the same kind of chips. Furthermore, various types of package may be manufactured by stacking various types of chips.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hands, before the memory chips are stacked over the substrate, the performance of the memory chip needs to be tested. A memory chip includes a large number of bumps formed in a lower portion thereof, but the size and pitch of the bumps are very small. Therefore, a probe test is difficult to be performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment of the present invention relates to a semiconductor chip which is capable of testing whether a circuit layer normally operates or not and whether a circuit layer is electrically coupled or not, for each single package product, while realizing a fine pitch, and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, a semiconductor chip includes: a first substrate having one surface and the other surface facing the one surface; a first test TSV passing through the first substrate from the one surface to the other surface; and a conductive protrusion electrically coupled to the first test TSV and protruding from the other surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The conductive protrusion may be positioned at an edge of the substrate, which deviates from the center of the first test TSV.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The semiconductor chip may further include a land portion coupling the conductive protrusion and the first test TSV. The land portion may be coupled to the first test TSV through a rearrangement interconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, a semiconductor package includes: a substrate; two or more semiconductor chips stacked over the substrate and each having one surface and the other surface facing the one surface and comprising a test TSV passing through the semiconductor chip from the one surface to the other surface; and a conductive protrusion protruding from the other surface of the uppermost semiconductor chip among the semiconductor chips and electrically coupled to the test TSV.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The conductive protrusion may be positioned at an edge of the substrate, which deviates from the center of the test TSV.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The semiconductor package may further include a land portion formed on the other surface of the uppermost semiconductor chip and coupling the conductive protrusion and the test TSV.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The land portion may be coupled to the test TSV through a rearrangement interconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The semiconductor package may further include a controller between the substrate and the semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor package includes: stacking a first semiconductor chip over a second semiconductor chip, the first semiconductor chip having one surface and the other surface facing the one surface and comprising a first test TSV passing through the first semiconductor chip from the one surface to the other surface; forming an insulation layer on the other surface of the first semiconductor chip, and patterning the insulation layer to expose the first test TSV; and forming a conductive protrusion which is electrically coupled to the exposed first test TSV and protrudes from the other surface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method may further include forming a land portion electrically coupling the exposed first test TSV and the conductive protrusion, before the forming of the conductive protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The conductive protrusion may be positioned at an edge of the first semiconductor chip, which deviates from the center of the first test TSV.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The forming of the conductive protrusion may include: positioning a mask over the first semiconductor chip; mounting a solder ball in an open portion of the mask; and performing a reflow process such that the solder ball is fused to the first test TSV.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereafter, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6G</figref>, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor chip in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the following descriptions, duplicated portions of the above descriptions will be omitted or simply described.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> having a first surface <b>401</b><i>a </i>and a second surface <b>401</b><i>b </i>facing away from the first surface <b>401</b><i>a </i>is prepared. Then, a semiconductor device such as a transistor is formed on the first surface <b>401</b><i>a </i>by a well-known semiconductor manufacturing technology. The region where the semiconductor device is formed is referred to as an active region <b>402</b>. Strictly speaking, the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is not identical to the first substrate <b>401</b> obtained by sawing the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b>. However, for convenience of description, the same reference numeral is used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the case of a memory device, the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> may include a single crystal silicon substrate, but the present invention is not limited thereto. The semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> may include a substrate formed of GaAs, LiTaO<sub>3</sub>, LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, or sapphire as well as a polycrystalline silicon substrate. That is, different substrates may be used depending on which semiconductor device is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a first test TSV <b>540</b> and a first signal TSV <b>640</b> are formed. The first test TSV <b>540</b> and the first signal TSV <b>640</b> may be formed by a TSV formation technology. For example, a bonding pad (not illustrated) may be formed on the first surface <b>401</b><i>a </i>of the semiconductor substrate, and a trench is formed adjacent to the bonding pad. The trench may be formed by a laser drill or a deep reactive ion etching (RIE) method, and may include a vertical trench and a tapered trench. After the trench formation process, a chemical or physical treatment may be performed to remove residue occurring during the trench formation process and facilitate the following plating process, thereby improving plating adhesion. Then, a seed metal layer is formed, and the first test TSV <b>540</b> may be formed by burying a conductive material in the trench through electroplating. The first test TSV <b>540</b> and the first signal TSV <b>640</b> may have front bumps <b>5401</b> and <b>6401</b> formed at one ends thereof, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, a carrier wafer <b>110</b> is bonded at the first surface <b>401</b><i>a </i>of the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> having the TSVs <b>540</b> and <b>640</b> formed therein, and the second surface <b>401</b><i>b </i>of the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> is ground to expose the TSVs <b>540</b> and <b>640</b>. Here, the grinding may be performed in such a manner that the levels of the upper surfaces of the exposed TSVs are identical to the level of the second surface <b>401</b><i>b </i>of the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b>. The carrier wafer <b>110</b> may be formed of glass or silicon. The carrier wafer <b>110</b> is temporally attached to easily handle the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> which became thin by removing the upper portion (the other surface) of the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> to a predetermined thickness. The carrier wafer <b>110</b> is attached through an adhesive layer formed of an adhesive agent which may be easily removed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The grinding process to reduce the thickness of the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> may be performed by a typical grinding apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device. For example, the grinding process may be performed by a grinding device including a loading area, a rough machining area, a finish machining area, and an unloading area. The rough machining is to roughly grind the second surface <b>401</b><i>b </i>of the loaded substrate, and the finish machining is to more smoothly grind the second surface <b>401</b><i>b </i>of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, a first insulation layer <b>410</b> is formed over the ground second surface <b>401</b><i>b </i>of the semiconductor substrate, and then patterned to expose the upper portion <b>540</b><i>b </i>of the first test TSV <b>540</b>. The first insulation layer <b>410</b> may be formed through a thin film formation process such as spin coating, sol-gel coating, deep coating, vacuum deposition, or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, when the first insulation layer <b>410</b> includes silicon oxide, CVD or thermal oxidation may be used, and when the first insulation layer <b>410</b> includes photoresist, spin coating may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The patterning method of the first insulation layer <b>410</b> may be selectively used depending on the type of insulation material. For example, when the insulation material is photoresist, an exposure and development method may be used. For another example, when the insulation material is silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), photoresist is applied onto the silicon oxide, and patterned through exposure and development, and the upper portion <b>540</b><i>b </i>of the first TSV <b>540</b> is exposed through a dry etching process using CF<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2 </sub>gas or a wet etching process using buffered HF (BHF). Then, a known technology such as O<sub>2 </sub>plasma ashing is used to remove remaining photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, a land portion <b>420</b> is formed to be coupled to the test TSV <b>540</b> having the exposed upper surface. The land portion <b>420</b> may be formed by electroless plating, electroplating, vacuum deposition, or sputtering. For example, photoresist is applied, and a region where the land portion <b>420</b> is to be formed is exposed through exposure and development. Then, electroplating is used to form the land portion formed of a metallic material. For another example, a metallic material is first deposited, and photoresist is applied. Then, a portion of the photoresist where the land portion <b>420</b> is to be formed is removed through a lithography process, and the deposited metallic material is patterned by an etching process such as dry etching or wet etching, using the remaining photoresist as an etch mask.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, the second insulation layer <b>430</b> is formed and patterned to expose the region <b>420</b><i>b </i>where a conductive protrusion is to be landed. The second insulation layer <b>430</b> may include the same material as or a different material from the first insulation layer <b>410</b>, and may be formed by the same manufacturing process or different manufacturing processes. The patterning of the second insulation layer <b>430</b> may be performed according to the above-described patterning process of the first insulation layer <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6G</figref>, the carrier wafer <b>110</b> attached to the semiconductor substrate <b>401</b> is de-bonded, a saw tape <b>120</b> is attached, and the substrate <b>400</b> is sawed into individual semiconductor chips. The sawing of the substrate <b>400</b> may be performed by diamond sawing or laser sawing.</p>

For example, an eutectic Pb&#x2014;Sn alloy (63Sn/37Pb) used as general solder has a fusing point of 183&#xb0; C. Therefore, the temperature of the reflow process may be raised to 183&#xb0; C. or more or a temperature which is higher by 5 to 30&#xb0; C. than the fusing point, in order to secure an excellent solder flow and a perfect fusing quality.</p>
