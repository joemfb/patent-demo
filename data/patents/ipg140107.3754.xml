<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0104176, filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, on Nov. 2, 2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(a) Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD), and more particularly to a device and method that reduces flickers and blurs in the LCD during display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(b) Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The LCD, one of the most commonly used flat panel displays, includes two display panels with field generating electrodes such as a pixel electrode and a common electrode formed thereon, and a liquid crystal layer formed therebetween. In the LCD, a voltage is applied to the field generating electrodes to generate an electric field on the liquid crystal layer to determine alignment of liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal layer and control polarization of incident light, thereby allowing display of images.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The LCD also includes switching elements connected with pixel electrodes and a plurality of signal lines such as gate lines and data lines for controlling the switching elements to apply a voltage to the pixel electrodes. The gate lines transfer gate signals generated by a gate driving circuit, the data lines transfer data voltages generated by a data driving circuit, and the switching elements transfer data voltages to the pixel electrodes according to the gate signals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A gate driving circuit and a data driving circuit may be directly mounted as a plurality of IC chips on a display panel or mounted on a flexible circuit film attached to a display panel. The IC chips represent a high percentage of the fabrication cost of the LCD. For a large-scale LCD with a high resolution, because the data driver IC chips are expensive as compared to the gate driving circuit chips, the number of data driver ICs needs to be reduced</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cost of the gate driving circuit can be reduced by integrating it together with the gate line, the data line, and the switching element. However, the complex structure of the data driving circuit makes it difficult to integrate the data driving circuit with the display panel, so it is important to reduce the number of data driving circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Pixels of an LCD include parasitic capacitance when the signal lines overlap. The parasitic capacitance causes a kickback voltage when a gate-on voltage becomes a gate-off voltage, after a data voltage is applied. The kickback voltage causes a slight reduction in the level of the data voltage. When the next gate-on voltage is changed to the gate-off voltage, the data voltage is further reduced due to the kickback voltage. This causes a difference between a positive polarity pixel voltage and a negative polarity pixel voltage to occur, causing a screen to flicker and display blurs. Thus, there is a need for an LCD with less flickering and blurring.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the first and second rows of pixels PXr<b>1</b> and PXr<b>2</b> and the first and second gate drivers <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R are called a first group pixel row, and the third and fourth rows of pixels PXr<b>3</b> and PXr<b>4</b> and the gate drivers <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R are called a second group pixel row.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The liquid crystal panel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> has a structure such that the two rows of pixels of the first group are repeated, and successively, the two rows of pixels of the second group are repeated. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the structure is repeated in the rows of pixels starting from the fifth row of pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the pixel rows of the first group and the pixel rows of the second group are repeated twice, but the present invention is not limited thereto, for example, the pixel rows of the first group and the pixel rows of the second group can be repeated three or four times.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The data driver <b>500</b> is connected with the data lines D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m </sub>of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b>, selects a gray voltage from the gray voltage generator <b>800</b>, and applies the selected gray voltage as a data signal to the data lines D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m</sub>. When the gray voltage generator <b>800</b> does not provide all the voltages with respect to every gray level, but only provides a predetermined number of reference gray voltages, the data driver <b>500</b> generates gray voltages with respect to all gray levels by dividing the reference gray voltages, and selecting a data signal among them.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The signal controller <b>600</b> controls the gate drivers <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R and the data driver <b>500</b>.</p>

Alternatively, the drivers <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, and <b>800</b> can be integrated together with the signal lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2n </sub>and D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m </sub>and the TFT switching elements Q on the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b>. In addition, the drivers <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, and <b>800</b> can be integrated as a single IC chip, and at least one of these circuits can be positioned outside the single IC chip.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The signal controller <b>600</b> receives input image signals R, G, and B and input control signals for controlling display of the input image signals from an external graphics controller (not shown). The input control signals may include, for example, a vertical synchronization signal Vsync, a horizontal synchronization signal Hsync, a main clock signal MCLK, or a data enable signal DE.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The signal controller <b>600</b> appropriately processes the input image signals R, G, and B according to operational conditions of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> based on the input image signals R, G, and B and the input control signals, generates a gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> and a data control signal CONT<b>2</b>, and transmits the gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> to the gate drivers <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R and the data control signal CONT<b>2</b> and the processed image signal DAT to the data driver <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> includes a scanning start signal STV for instructing start of scanning, and at least one clock signal for controlling an output period of the gate-on voltage Von. The gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> may additionally include an output enable signal OE for limiting a duration of the gate-on voltage Von.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The data control signal CONT<b>2</b> includes a horizontal synchronization start signal STH for indicating that image data has begun transmission to one row of pixels PX, and a load signal LOAD for indicating application of data signals to the data lines D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m</sub>, and a data clock signal HCLK. The data control signal CONT<b>2</b> may additionally include an inversion signal RVS for inverting polarity of a voltage of a data signal with respect to the common voltage Vcom (which is called &#x2018;polarity of a data signal&#x2019;).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The data driver <b>500</b> receives the digital image signal DAT with respect to one row of pixels PX according to the data control signal CONT<b>2</b> received from the signal controller <b>600</b>, selects a gray voltage corresponding to each digital image signal DAT, converts the digital image signal DAT into an analog data signal, and applies it to a corresponding data line D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The gate drivers <b>400</b>L and <b>400</b>R apply the gate-on voltage Von to the gate lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2n </sub>according to the gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> received from the signal controller <b>600</b>, to turn on switching elements Q connected with the gate lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2n</sub>. Then, the data signal that has been applied to the data lines D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m </sub>is applied to the corresponding pixels PX through the switching elements Q that have been turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The difference between a voltage of the data signal applied to the pixels PX and the common voltage Vcom appears as a charge voltage of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc, namely, as a pixel voltage. Arrangement of liquid crystal molecules is changed according to the size of the pixel voltage, and polarization of light that passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>3</b> is changed accordingly. The change in the polarization appears as a change in transmittance of light by a polarizer attached on the display panel assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">This process is repeatedly performed by units of one horizontal period (namely, &#x2018;<b>1</b>H&#x2019; which is equivalent to one period of the horizontal synchronization signal Hsync and the data enable signal DE), whereby the gate-on voltage Von can be sequentially applied to all the gate lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2n </sub>to apply the data signals to all the pixels PX, thereby displaying an image of one frame.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When one frame is finished, the next frame is started and a state of the inversion signal RVS applied to the data driver <b>500</b> is controlled (&#x2018;frame inversion&#x2019;) so that polarity of the data signals applied to each pixel PX can be opposite to the polarity of a previous frame. Even in one frame, the polarity of a data signal flowing through one data line can be changed according to characteristics of the inversion signal RVS (e.g., row inversion, dot inversion), or the polarity of a data signal applied to one row of pixels can be different (e.g., column inversion, dot inversion).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The driving operation of the LCD according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>.</p>

Subsequently, the gate-on voltage Von is also applied to the other pair of gate lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2n </sub>and switching elements Q connected to the gate line are also turned on. Then, the data signals that have been applied to the data lines D<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>m </sub>are applied to the corresponding pixels PX through the turned-on switching elements Q.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">However, due to parasitic capacitance existing between the gate lines G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2n </sub>and the pixel electrode <b>191</b>, when the gate-on voltage is lowered to the gate-off voltage, the data voltage is slightly reduced, generating a first kickback voltage Vkb.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Subsequently, when the next gate-on voltage is lowered to the gate-off voltage, a second kickback voltage Vkb is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At the pixel electrode <b>191</b> where the second kickback voltage Vkb is generated, a pixel electrode voltage is adjusted closer to the common voltage Vcom at a portion that is inverted from negative (&#x2212;) polarity to positive (+) polarity, so that the corresponding pixels PX become brighter than a normal state.</p>
