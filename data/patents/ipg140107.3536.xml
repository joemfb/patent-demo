<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter herein generally relates to switch elements in electric systems and in particularly to systems and methods for determining a physical status of a switch element in an electric system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles require onboard batteries to power their electric drive systems. The performance requirements of such vehicles generally require combining a large number of batteries together to provide a sufficiently high voltage and current for powering the electric drive system. For example, Li-ion batteries can be stacked to produce battery packs or modules with very high voltage and current capabilities. In conventional electric or hybrid electric vehicles, such Li-ion batteries often are configured to generate voltages on the order of 400V DC.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, in such vehicle applications, the battery voltage is applied to the drive system under control of a battery management system (BMS) electronic controller. Specifically, the battery is connected to the vehicle via a contactor or other type of switch element controlled by the BMS. Throughout the lifetime of the vehicle, it is possible that the contactors may fail or degrade, resulting in improper operation. Such contactor faults or failures can arise from the very large operating currents and transients that are typically conducted by the contactors during operation of the vehicle. For example, currents in electric vehicles can exceed 200 A under some conditions. As a result, the switch elements used to connect the battery to the vehicle may become stuck open or closed under mechanical and/or electrical stress during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When such contactor failures occur, it is generally desirable to generate control signals for the BMS such that the battery can be disabled to prevent further damage to the vehicle or to reduce the risk of injury to the driver or passengers of the vehicle. Further, it is generally desirable to generate signals such that service personnel can easily assess and repair the contactor failure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional methods for detecting the physical state of a contactor, a relay, or other types of switch elements in high voltage DC systems typically rely on providing a control loop based on coupling a waveform on a first side of a switch element and thereafter detecting the waveform on the second side of the switch element. For such applications, optocouplers have historically been used for several reasons. In particular, optocouplers have historically provided favorable droop, backswing, and common mode characteristics as compared to other coupling methods. Additionally, configuration of conventional optocoupler devices is well-understood. Further, optocoupler circuits have historically been less expensive and smaller than other types of signal coupling devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, optocouplers have several disadvantages. First, the use of multiple optocouplers to couple and detect waveforms in a circuit generally requires fairly complex supporting circuitry. In particular, such circuits generally require additional power rails and circuit paths for operating multiple optocouplers. This not only increases overall circuit complexity, but also increases the chances of interference between components in the circuit and power requirements for monitoring the contactor. Second, the characteristics of optocouplers can vary during the operation and lifetime of the optocoupler. That is, as a function of time and/or temperature, optocoupler can exhibit variations in current transfer ratios and propagation delays, non-linear transfer characteristics, and other characteristics. Further, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the optocouplers can degrade and wear out over time. Accordingly, the reliability and lifetime of optocouplers is typically limited. However, despite the limitations of optocouplers described above, optocouplers still remain the preferred means of coupling waveforms into a control loop.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention concern new systems and methods for determining the physical status of switching elements. In a first embodiment of the invention, a system for monitoring a state of a switch element connecting a DC power supply to a load is provided. The system includes a transformer having first and second windings, a first end of the second winding electrically coupled to a first switch node of the switch element. The system also includes a transmit circuit configured for providing a first waveform at the first winding. The system further includes a sensor element having galvanically isolated input nodes and output nodes and configured for inducing a monitor signal at the output nodes in response to a signal at the input nodes, where the input nodes electrically coupling a second end of the second winding and a second switch node of the switch element. Additionally, the system includes a receive circuit coupled to the output nodes of the sensor element and configured for generating one or more output signals in response to the monitor signal. In the system, capacitor elements are provided for DC isolating the second winding with respect to the first switch node and the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second embodiment of the invention, a battery operated system is provided.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is described with reference to the attached figures, wherein like reference numerals are used throughout the figures to designate similar or equivalent elements. The figures are not drawn to scale and they are provided merely to illustrate the instant invention. Several aspects of the invention are described below with reference to example applications for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One having ordinary skill in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. In other instances, well-known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the invention. The present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described above, the detection of switch element failures in high voltage DC systems is of concern, particularly in the field of electric vehicles. However, in the case of electric vehicles, additional requirements can apply since such vehicles are being used by consumers and will be in service for a relatively long period of time (&#x3e;3 years). Thus, the systems for detecting contactor failures need to provide high reliability, long operational lifetimes, low power requirements, and insensitivity to environmental conditions. As described above, optocouplers generally have low reliability, short operational lifetimes, high power requirements, and are sensitive to variations in temperature. Accordingly, optocouplers are not the ideal devices for providing time-varying signals in electric vehicles and other electric systems with similar requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the limitations of conventional optocoupler-based monitoring techniques and the additional requirements for electric vehicles, the various embodiments of the invention provide new systems and methods for determining the state of a switch element in DC electric systems. In the various embodiments of the invention, the switch element is monitored by providing a short-circuit path connecting between the first and second nodes of the switch element. This short-circuit can be defined by the second winding of a transformer, where the windings are DC isolated from the DC power supply. Thus, a monitoring loop is defined by the combination of the short-circuit path and the switch element. In operation, a waveform is generated and applied across the first winding of the transformer. In response, a waveform is produced across the second winding. When the contactor is closed (i.e., the electric system is in operation), the waveform can propagate along the monitoring loop. A sensor element in short-circuit path can then be used to detect the presence or absence of the waveform. The output of the sensor element can thereafter be used to generate signals indicating the physical status of the switch element or whether a fault or failure has occurred at the switch element.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The use of a transformer for coupling a waveform into the monitoring loop has several advantages over conventional, pure-optocoupler-based methods. First, a transformer does not require additional power rails, unlike an optocoupler. That is, it is not necessary to provide additional power rails to bias the phototransistors of a conventional optocoupler that will generate the waveform. Rather, the waveform provided at the first winding powers the transformer. Second, a DC isolated transformer is typically simpler to configure and provides substantially greater isolation between blocks in a circuit as compared to optocouplers. Third, a transformer is a simpler device as compared to an optocoupler. Thus, a monitoring circuit using a transformer can be formed using a relatively smaller number of components. Also, recent advances in compact and integrated circuit (IC) based transformers now provide transformers that can be formed in a relatively smaller area and have significantly lower power requirements than circuits using optocouplers. For example, some IC transformer configurations can provide over a 50% reduction in power. Fourth, transformers are generally less prone to degradation, drift, or variation due to time or temperature. Thus, transformers can provide more predictable transfer ratios and functions. Accordingly, transformers can provide substantially greater reliability, predictability, and operational lifetimes as compared to optocouplers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An additional advantage of utilizing a transformer to couple the waveform into the monitoring loop is that transformers generally have a higher bandwidth than optocouplers and can therefore support higher data transfer rates. Therefore, the waveform coupled into the control loop can not only be used to determine the state of the switch element, but also be used for reliability transmitting large amounts of data to the BMS or other components during operation of the electric system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of an exemplary DC electric system <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. System <b>100</b> includes a DC power supply <b>102</b>. The supply <b>102</b> can consist of one or more DC power sources, such as batteries, AC/DC converters, a chemical fuel cells, solar cells, generators, and alternators, to name a few. However, the various embodiments of the invention are not limited in this regard and any other types or any combination of DC power sources can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the power supply <b>102</b> is electrically coupled to a load <b>104</b> via a switch element <b>106</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;switch element&#x201d; refers to any type of device, electrical circuit, or other component configured for selectively disconnecting portions of an electric circuit. In the various embodiments of the invention, the switch element can include devices consisting of mechanical switches, solid-state switches, switching tubes, and/or any other type of switch technologies. In some configurations, the switch element <b>106</b> can be controlled directly or indirectly. For example, the switch element <b>106</b> can be controlled using a control system <b>108</b> for the power supply <b>102</b>, where the control system operates automatically or in response to user input via a user interface <b>110</b>. The control system <b>108</b> can be the BMS or other devices or systems for controlling the operation in electric system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, the status of the switch element <b>106</b> can be monitored via the use of a short-circuit path <b>112</b> coupled to the ends or nodes of switch element <b>106</b> to form a monitoring loop <b>114</b> operating in parallel with the supply loop <b>115</b> formed by power supply <b>102</b>, switch element <b>106</b>, and load <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the path <b>112</b> includes a transformer <b>116</b>, with a first winding <b>116</b>A and a second winding <b>116</b>B, and a sensor element <b>118</b>, with input nodes <b>118</b>A and output nodes <b>118</b>B. In particular, the path <b>112</b> is defined by second winding <b>116</b>B and electrical path between the input nodes <b>118</b>A. Additionally, the short-circuit path <b>112</b> also includes elements for preventing the power supply <b>102</b> from discharging electrons into the path <b>112</b>. Specifically, path <b>112</b> includes at least first and second capacitor elements <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> for providing DC isolation between transformer <b>116</b> and power supply <b>102</b>. Further, no connection or path to ground is provided in path <b>112</b>, effectively limiting path <b>112</b> to signals generated in path <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the various embodiments, the sensor element <b>118</b> can be an optocoupler, another transformer, or any other device in which the input nodes <b>118</b>A are galvanically isolated from the output nodes <b>118</b>B. Further, path <b>112</b> can include other components <b>124</b> for monitoring, matching, or any other purposes. For example, in one embodiment, component <b>124</b> can include a read resistor. In such a configuration, the control system <b>108</b> or other component of system <b>100</b> can be configured to monitor the voltage across the read resistor and detect the waveform propagating through monitor loop <b>114</b>. The data in the waveform can then be extracted and used by system <b>100</b> or any other device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> can include a transmit circuit <b>126</b> for transmitting a waveform across the first winding <b>116</b>A. In some configurations, the transmit circuit <b>126</b> can be directly coupled to the first winding <b>116</b>A. In other configurations, the transmit circuit <b>126</b> can be directly coupled to the first winding <b>116</b>A via coupling elements <b>128</b>. For example, the coupling elements <b>128</b> can be capacitive elements to provide DC isolation between the transmit circuit <b>126</b> and the first winding <b>116</b>A. In such configurations, the transformer <b>116</b>, the capacitors <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> and coupling elements <b>128</b> define a DC isolated transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the various embodiments of the invention, the transmit circuit <b>126</b> can be any type of circuit for generating a waveform. For example, the transmit circuit <b>126</b> can be formed using RC, LC, or crystal oscillator circuits, monostable, bistable, and astable multi-vibrator circuits, IC-based timer circuits, diode or transistor-based non-linear waveform circuits, rectifier circuits, and digital circuit-based signal generating circuits and devices, to name a few. However the various embodiments are not limited in this regard and any other types of circuits and/or devices for generating a waveform can be used in the various embodiments. Additionally, the transmit circuit <b>126</b> can be configured to provide a constant waveform or to transmit data by providing a time-varying waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> can include a receive circuit <b>130</b> coupled to the output nodes <b>118</b>B. The receive circuit <b>130</b> can be configured to include logic for generating signals indicative of the current or actual physical state of the switch element <b>106</b>. Further, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can also be configured to include logic for generating a fault signal when the current physical state of the switch element <b>106</b> fails to match the target physical state of the switch element <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One exemplary process for operating system <b>100</b> operates is follows. First, the control system <b>108</b> can generate signals or instructions for setting a state of the switch element <b>106</b>. For example, if load <b>104</b> is a drive system for an electric vehicle and operation is desired, the control system <b>108</b> can send signals to switch element <b>106</b> to cause it to close and thus connect DC power supply <b>102</b> to load <b>104</b>. Alternatively, if operation of the vehicle needs to be paused or terminated, the control system <b>108</b> can send signals to switch element <b>106</b> to cause it to open and thus disconnect DC power supply <b>102</b> from load <b>104</b>. Concurrently, transmit circuit <b>126</b> can generate a waveform propagating through first windings <b>116</b>A. Responsive to this waveform, the transformer <b>116</b> is operable to inductively induce a voltage signal across second windings <b>116</b>B defining a waveform. Depending on the configuration of transformer <b>116</b>, the waveforms at windings <b>116</b>A and <b>116</b>B can be same or different.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">If switch element <b>106</b> is open, the waveform at the second winding <b>116</b>B will not propagate along monitor loop <b>114</b>. However, when switch element <b>106</b> is closed, the waveform at the second winding <b>116</b>B will propagate along monitor loop <b>114</b>. A portion of the waveform can also propagate into the power supply loop <b>115</b> formed by the DC power supply <b>102</b>, the switch element <b>106</b>, and the load <b>104</b>. However, interference in the operation of load can be avoided by configuring the transmit circuit <b>126</b> and/or the transformer <b>116</b> to provide a waveform having an amplitude that is substantially less than the voltage of the DC power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Regardless of whether or not a waveform is propagating along monitor loop <b>114</b>, the sensor element <b>118</b> generates a monitor signal at the output nodes <b>118</b>B based on the signal at the input nodes <b>118</b>A. In the various embodiments, because the short-circuit path <b>112</b> is DC isolated using at least capacitor elements <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and no path to a ground is available in the path <b>112</b>, the sensor element <b>118</b> is also effectively isolated from the power supply loop <b>115</b>. Thus, even in the absence of a waveform in path <b>112</b>, the monitor signal will not be based on the DC signal from the DC power supply <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The monitor signal can be generated in a variety of ways at the sensor element <b>118</b>. For example, in one configuration, the sensor element <b>118</b> can be an optocoupler. Thus, depending on the signal present at input nodes <b>118</b>A, the transistor in the optocoupler can be turned on or off to provide the monitor signal. In another configuration, the sensor element <b>118</b> can be a transformer where nodes <b>118</b>A and <b>118</b>B define the ends of first and second windings. Thus, a signal is induced at nodes <b>118</b>B (i.e., the second winding) based on the signal present at nodes <b>118</b>A (i.e., at the first winding). This induced signal thus provides the monitor signal. In some embodiments, the use of a transformer for the sensor element <b>118</b> can provide many, if not all the advantages described above.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, if data needs to be transmitted to the receive circuit <b>130</b>, a transformer for the sensor element <b>118</b> may be required if the data rate from the transmit circuit is sufficiently high. That is, although conventional optocouplers can be biased to provide a larger bandwidth to support higher data rates, this is generally at the cost of the current transfer ratio (CTR) of the optocoupler. Accordingly, this can lead to lower efficiency in the optocoupler, lower sensitivity of the phototransistor, and can require a significantly more complex circuit for detecting changes in the phototransistor current. In contrast, the data rate of a transformer is primarily dependent on the resonant frequency of the transformer. Accordingly, the amount of data that can be transmitted is directly tied to the quality and cost of the transformer used, not by the biasing of the transformer. Additionally, provided that a waveform with sufficient energy (i.e., amplitude) is provided, the need for complex circuitry to detect the signal is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the monitor signal is generated by sensor element <b>118</b> is output at output nodes <b>118</b>B, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can then process the monitor signal. First, the monitor signal can be used to generate a signal representing the actual contact state of the switch element <b>106</b>. That is, based on the characteristics of the monitor signal, the receive circuit can generate a signal that indicates whether the switch element <b>106</b> is actually open or closed. For example, if the monitor signal is a waveform when the switch element <b>106</b> is closed, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can be configured to include elements for detecting the absence or presence of signal at output nodes <b>118</b>B. In such configurations, if the sensor element <b>118</b> outputs a waveform at output nodes <b>118</b>B, a small signal transistor can be used to detect the presence of the waveform. Alternatively, a microprocessor, peak detector, or logic gate could also be used. However, the various embodiments of the invention are not limited to these methods. Further, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can also communicate a signal indicating the actual contact state to other components in system <b>100</b>, such as control system <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition to determining the actual contact state of the switch element <b>106</b>, the receive circuit can also be configured to generate a fault signal indicating that the actual contact state does not match an intended or target contact state. That is, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can include logic or functionality for receiving a signal representing the target contact state. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the control system <b>108</b> or other component of system <b>100</b> can provide such a signal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In operation, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can compare the actual contact state and the target contact state. For example, the receive circuit can include logic for comparing the signals representing the actual and target contact states. If the states fail to match, a fault signal can be generated. In some configurations, the receive circuit can be configured to maintain the fault signal until the occurrence of a reset event. That is, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can be configured to reset the fault signal when it is powered down. Alternatively, the receive circuit <b>130</b> can also be configured to reset the fault signal when an external reset signal is received. In one configuration, such an external signal can be provided by the user via user interface <b>110</b> and control system <b>108</b> to the receive circuit <b>130</b>. In another configuration, such an external signal can be automatically generated when a component, such as the switch element <b>106</b> is replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the fault signal can be used to prevent further operation of system <b>100</b>. For example, the fault signal can be used to operate a secondary or backup switch element <b>132</b> to disconnect DC power supply <b>102</b> from load <b>104</b>. Alternatively, the fault circuit can be used to limit the operation of system <b>100</b>. For example, the fault signal can also be used to activate an auxiliary, short-term DC power supply and disconnect the main power supply. Alternatively, the fault signal can be used to begin a timer in control system <b>108</b> or elsewhere and thereafter indicate to the user that at the end of the timer countdown, the system <b>100</b> will be deactivated. Such configurations can be useful for ensuring that an electric vehicle or other electric system can be placed in a safe state without increasing risk of harm to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of an exemplary DC electric system <b>200</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, system <b>200</b> includes components or elements <b>102</b>-<b>116</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>122</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Accordingly, the description above with respect to these components and elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be sufficient for describing the configuration and/or operation of these components and elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the transmit circuit <b>126</b> is implemented using a 555 timer IC <b>228</b>. In particular, the time IC <b>228</b> is configured to operate in an astable multivibrator mode to provide a waveform comprising a continuous stream of rectangular pulses. Accordingly, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the transmit circuit <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> would include other components in addition to the timer IC <b>228</b>. For example, the timer IC <b>228</b> in transmit circuit <b>126</b> would be configured to be connected to a supply voltage (VDD), a ground or reference voltage, resistors, and capacitors. The types and arrangement of these components with respect to timer IC <b>228</b> would be selected to provide a desired waveform. In one embodiment, a 250 kHz rectangular waveform is provided. However, the various embodiments of the invention are not limited in this regard and any other waveform can also be used with an appropriate detection circuit, provided that the waveform has sufficient energy such that transformer energy losses are not significant.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The output of the timer IC <b>228</b> can be coupled, directly or indirectly, to a first end of first winding <b>116</b>A of transformer <b>116</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The second end of the first winding <b>116</b>A can coupled to a ground or reference voltage. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the ends of first winding <b>116</b>A are coupled using coupling elements <b>128</b>. Specifically, capacitors are used to couple the transmit circuit <b>126</b> and a ground voltage to the first and second ends of first winding <b>116</b>A, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes a read transistor <b>224</b>. Such a transistor can be used for matching the input of sensor element <b>118</b> to the output of other components in system <b>200</b>. However, read transistor <b>224</b> can also be used to independent monitor the monitor loop <b>114</b>. Accordingly a sensor <b>225</b> can be provided to allow the signal across read transistor <b>224</b> to be detected and used for such purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sensor element <b>118</b> is implemented as an optocoupler including one or more LEDs <b>218</b>C defining the input nodes <b>118</b>A and an NPN phototransistor <b>218</b>D defining the output nodes <b>118</b>B. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sensor element <b>118</b> includes two LEDs. Thus, in configurations where the response of the phototransistor <b>218</b>D is comparable or better than that of the LEDs, the monitor signal comprises waveform with a frequency that is effectively twice that of the waveform at the input nodes <b>118</b>A. Similar to the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the output nodes <b>118</b>A of sensor element <b>118</b> are coupled to a receive circuit <b>118</b>. Alternatively, in configurations where the response of the phototransistor <b>218</b>D is slower than that of the LEDs, the monitor signal comprises a continuous signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the receive circuit <b>130</b> is configured to generate a signal indicating the actual contact state. Further, the receive circuit <b>130</b> is configured to compare the actual contact state signal to a target contact state signal. Thereafter, if the actual and target contact state signals fail to match, a fault signal is generate. Further, the fault signal is maintained until the receive circuit is powered down. One possible configuration for implementing this functionality is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the output nodes <b>118</b>B are coupled to the ground and input nodes of an amplifier circuit <b>231</b> formed by transistor <b>232</b> and resistors <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>238</b>. The configuration and arrangement of these elements can be select to provide an appropriate logic signal to exclusive-OR (XOR) gate <b>240</b>. Further, the configuration and arrangement of these elements can be select to provide such a logic signal in response to the configuration of the monitor signal. For example, in the case of the monitor signal comprising a waveform, the transistor <b>232</b> can be a small-signal transistor. However, the invention is not limited to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for amplifier <b>231</b>. Rather, amplifier <b>231</b> can be formed using different combinations of elements.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This logic signal generated by amplifier <b>231</b> represents the actual (i.e., physical) contact state of the switch element <b>106</b>. This logic signal can be provided, directly or indirectly, to control system <b>108</b>. Control system can then generate at UI <b>110</b> a display or other indication of the physical state of switch element <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To compare the actual contact state signal from the amplifier and the target contact state signal, a comparison of these signals can be performed using the XOR gate <b>240</b>. The target contact state signal can be provided, directly or indirectly from control system <b>108</b>. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that receive circuit <b>130</b> can include components to provide an appropriate logic signal for the XOR gate <b>240</b> based on the target state signal. In operation, as long as the target and actual contact state signal match, the XOR gate <b>240</b> provides a first value, indicating a match. However, upon the actual contact state signal varying from the target contact state signal, the output of the XOR gate <b>240</b> changes and a second value is provided, indicating a difference and thus a fault.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although the output of XOR gate <b>240</b> indicates when a fault has occurred, in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the receive circuit includes components for maintaining a signal indicating a fault until a reset event occurs. Thus, the fault signal is maintained even when the switch element <b>106</b> resumes normal operation. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the receive circuit <b>120</b> can include a gated latch circuit <b>242</b>. In operation, the gated latch circuit <b>242</b> is configured to store and output a first signal (indicating no fault) when the XOR gate <b>240</b> is providing a first value and to allow changes in the first signal. When the gated latch circuit <b>242</b> receives the second value from the XOR gate <b>240</b>, the gate latch circuit <b>242</b> is configured to store and output a second signal (indicating a fault). However, the gated latch circuit <b>242</b> is also configured to prevent the any further changes in the stored value, and consequently in its output until power to the gate latch circuit is discontinued. As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, several types of gated latch circuits can be used for this purpose.</p>
