<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Apparatuses and methods consistent with the present invention relate to a balance filter packaging chip having a balun mounted therein and a manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly, to a balance filter packaging chip having a balun mounted therein and a manufacturing method thereof, wherein the balun is fabricated on a packaging substrate so that a chip size can be reduced, and a manufacturing process thereof can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A balun (balance to unbalance transformer) is a matching transformer used for preventing the break of ground balance of a balanced circuit when a circuit balanced to the ground is coupled with an amplifier circuit of which one end is grounded, or for connecting a circuit balanced to the ground to an unbalanced circuit such as a coaxial cable in a VHF (Very High Frequency) band transmission circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A filter is one type of electronic circuits that passes only the signals of a desired waveform, filtering those of an undesired waveform. Generally, the filter is constructed with a combination of inductance L and capacitance C. A filter employing an element such as a Lecher wire or a coaxial cable is used in a VHF band of very high frequencies, and a waveguide filter is used in microwave bands of frequencies higher than frequencies of the VHF band.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, filters of special purpose include a CR filter having capacitance and resistance, a crystal filter using mechanical resonance, a mechanical filter, and the like. The filters by function are categorized into an LPF (Low Pass Filter) passing only signals below a certain frequency, a HPF (High Pass Filter) passing only signals above a certain frequency, a BPF (Band Pass Filter) passing signals of a certain frequency band, and a BEF (Band Elimination Filter) suppressing only signals of a certain frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram for showing a configuration of conventional balun and balance filter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an antenna <b>10</b> receives signals transmitted in a wireless manner and transmits the received signals to a balun <b>20</b>. The balun <b>20</b> converts the wireless signal received from the antenna <b>10</b> into two signals having a phase difference of 180 degrees each other, and outputs the two signals to a balance filter <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Since the two signals having a phase difference of 180 degrees each other are inputted to the balance filter <b>30</b>, the balance filter is superior to an unbalance filter in terms of power efficiency. Therefore, the balance filter <b>30</b> consumes less battery power than the unbalance filter, and does not require large signal amplitude so that relatively less noise occurs. Owing to such advantages, the use of the balun and the balance filter are required.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The conventional technology manufactures the balun and the balance filter separately and then connects them together in a hybrid method, or manufactures the balun and the balance filter together through an integration process. The conventional methods cause problems in that an element size becomes large or the product yield goes lower due to a complicated process since the filter is processed together.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention has been developed in order to address the above and other aspects associated with the conventional arrangement. An aspect of the present invention is to provide a balance filter packaging chip having a balun mounted therein and a manufacturing method thereof, wherein the balun is fabricated on a packaging substrate so that a chip size can be reduced as well as a manufacturing process thereof can be simplified.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method further comprises an operation of plating the at least one certain portion of the at least one electrode with gold (Au) after operation (e) is performed.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a certain area on the lower surface <b>311</b> of the packaging substrate <b>310</b> is etched in order for the cavity <b>302</b> to be formed, but the etching may be omitted. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the metal layer <b>320</b> is evaporated on the whole bottom surface of the packaging substrate <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the packaging substrate <b>310</b> is patterned in order for the via holes <b>330</b> passing through the packaging substrate <b>310</b> to be formed, and then the via holes <b>330</b> are formed. Through the photoresist coating used in a semiconductor process, at least one or more via holes <b>330</b> are formed. The via holes <b>330</b> can be formed through a Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) process.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The via holes <b>330</b> pass through the packaging substrate <b>310</b>, and exposes the metal layer <b>320</b> below the packaging substrate <b>310</b>. In here, the number of the via holes <b>330</b> can be arbitrarily established according to the number of the terminals provided for the balance filter <b>390</b> which is packaged. On the other hand, it is preferable, but not necessary, in aspect of chip size reduction, for the via holes <b>330</b> to be formed to pass through to the inside of the cavity <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, after the metal layer <b>320</b> is patterned in a certain form, the via holes <b>330</b> are filled with the conductive material <b>333</b> by using the metal layer <b>320</b> as a seed layer. The via holes are filled such that the via holes <b>330</b> are soaked into liquid metal, electricity is supplied to the metal layer <b>320</b>, and coated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, the electrodes <b>340</b> connected to the upper portion <b>331</b> of the via holes <b>330</b> are formed. The electrodes <b>340</b> are formed such that a metal material is evaporated on the upper surface of the packaging substrate <b>310</b> and then patterned.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As well known, the balun <b>301</b> is formed with a capacitor and an inductor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, the capacitor <b>350</b> is first evaporated on a certain location in order for the balun <b>301</b> is mounted on the upper surface of the packaging substrate <b>310</b>. The capacitor <b>350</b> contains a lower electrode <b>351</b>, a dielectric material <b>352</b>, and an upper electrode <b>353</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>, passivation is performed with the insulator <b>360</b>, while certain portions of the electrodes <b>340</b> and capacitor <b>350</b> remain patterned. Polymer can be used as the insulator <b>360</b>, and benzocyclobutene (BCB) can be used as the polymer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>, the unpassivated portions of the electrodes <b>340</b> and capacitor <b>350</b> are plated with metal in the same manner as the via holes <b>330</b> are filled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>. The inductor <b>370</b> is connected in the patterning manner to the portion connected to the capacitor <b>350</b>. Accordingly, the electrodes <b>340</b> have the extended electrodes <b>341</b> and <b>342</b> to connect to external signals.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>, while a certain portions <b>341</b> and <b>342</b> of the electrodes <b>340</b> remain patterned, the passivation is performed once more with the insulator <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>, the extended electrodes <b>341</b> and <b>342</b> are generally formed of metal such as copper (Cu). The extended electrodes are plated with gold (Au) <b>343</b> and <b>344</b> for oxidation prevention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L</figref>, the packaging substrate <b>310</b> is combined with the device substrate <b>380</b>. To do so, the balance filter <b>390</b> is mounted or evaporated on the upper surface of the device substrate <b>380</b>. As described above, if the device substrate <b>380</b> is a PCB, the balance filter <b>390</b> can be embedded in the device substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The bonding layer <b>400</b> is stacked between a certain portion of the metal layer <b>320</b> evaporated on the lower surface <b>311</b> of the packaging substrate <b>310</b> and the layer <b>391</b> formed on a certain portion of the upper surface of the device substrate <b>380</b>, and then bonds the packaging substrate <b>310</b> with the device substrate <b>380</b>. Here, the layer <b>391</b> electrically connects the bonding layer <b>400</b> and the balance filter <b>390</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M</figref>, finally, a certain amount of lead (Pb) <b>345</b> and <b>346</b> is attached over the plated portions <b>343</b> and <b>344</b> of the extensions <b>341</b> and <b>342</b> of the electrodes <b>340</b>, so the balance filter packaging chip <b>300</b> is manufactured and thus conveniently connected to external terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The packaging chip as described above is manufactured in a wafer level. That is, two sheets of wafer that combine the packaging substrate <b>310</b> and the device substrate <b>380</b> are diced, and the balance filter packaging chip <b>300</b> having the balun <b>301</b> mounted therein is finally manufactured. Accordingly, the balance filter packaging chip <b>300</b> having the balun <b>301</b> mounted therein according to the process as described above is small in size, and can be manufactured through a process relatively simpler than conventional.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As aforementioned, the present invention can manufacture a balun on a packaging substrate, thereby reducing the element size and simplifying a process.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The foregoing exemplary embodiment and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses.
