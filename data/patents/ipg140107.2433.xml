<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a fluorine-free photoacid generator (PAG) and a photoresist composition containing the same. The PAG is characterized by the presence of an onium cationic component and a fluorine-free fused ring heteroaromatic sulfonate anionic component containing one or more electron withdrawing substituents. The onium cationic component of the PAG is preferably a sulfonium or an iodonium cation. The photoresist composition further contains an acid sensitive imaging polymer. The photoresist composition is especially useful for forming material patterns on a semiconductor substrate using 193 nm (ArF) lithography.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to photolithography, and more particularly to fused ring heteroaromatic photoacid generators which are fluorine-free and efficiently generate acids upon exposure to UV light. This invention is also directed to resist compositions containing the inventive fluorine-free fused ring heteroaromatic photoacid generators and methods of using the resist compositions in photolithography.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Miniaturized electronic components such as integrated circuits are typically manufactured using photolithography technology. In a photolithography process, a photoresist layer is formed on a substrate, such as a silicon wafer. The substrate is baked to remove any solvent remained in the photoresist layer. The photoresist is then exposed through a photomask with a desired pattern to a source of actinic radiation. The radiation exposure causes a chemical reaction in the exposed areas of the photoresist and creates a latent image corresponding to the mask pattern in the photoresist layer. The photoresist is next developed in a developer solution, usually an aqueous base solution, to remove either the exposed portions of the photoresist for a positive photoresist or the unexposed portions of the photoresist for a negative photoresist. The patterned photoresist can then be used as a mask for subsequent fabrication processes on the substrate, such as deposition, etching, or ion implantation processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One type of photoresist employed in the prior art is a chemically amplified photoresist which uses acid catalysis. Chemically amplified photoresists have increased sensitivity to exposure energy over non-chemically amplified photoresists. A chemically amplified photoresist is especially useful when relatively short wavelength radiation is employed, such as deep UV radiation (150-315 nm wavelengths) and mid-UV radiation (350-450 nm wavelengths).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical prior art chemically amplified photoresist, for example, is formulated by dissolving an acid sensitive base polymer and a photoacid generator (PAG) in a casting solution. The base polymer in a chemically amplified positive photoresist typically has acid labile groups bonded to the polymer backbone. When such a photoresist is exposed to radiation, the PAG absorbs photons and produces an acid. The photo generated acid then causes catalytic cleavage of the acid labile groups. A single acid molecule generated in this manner may be capable of cleaving multiple acid labile groups on the base polymer. Thus, fewer photons are needed to render the exposed portion of the photoresist soluble in the developer solution.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because of the relatively low intensity of a 193 nm laser source and relatively high binding energy of acid labile groups in a 193 nm photoresist, PAGs which can produce stronger Bronsted acid with high sensitivity are preferred to realize such a chemical amplification in commercial 193 nm photolithography. Fluorine-containing PAGs, such as perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFAS), are generally preferred PAGs in 193 nm photoresist system partially because they result in generation of strong acids.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, however, there has been a desire in the microelectronics industry to eliminate the use of perfluorinated carbons (PFCs) including PFOS and PFAS due to their detrimental effects on environment, human and animals. Thus, there is a desire to find alternative PAGs which can be used without adversely impacting the performance of lithographic processes. There has also been a desire to minimize or eliminate fluorine content in photoresist in order to improve etch resistance and to improve process latitude in high numeric aperture (NA&#x3e;0.95) imaging processes. Accordingly, there is a need for new and improved fluorine-free PAGs and chemically amplified photoresist compositions that enable the substantial reduction or avoidance of fluorine content in photoresist compositions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides fluorine-free photoacid generators which are a viable alternative to the PFC-containing photoacid generators currently used in the industry. This invention also provides photoresist compositions containing such a fluorine-free photoacid generator that show excellent optical clarity and thermal stability and have lithographic performance equal to or better than that of photoresists having the PFC-containing photoacid generators.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0061">As shown in Scheme 1, in one embodiment, the synthesis of the fluorine-free fused-ring heteroaromatic PAGs starts from the nitro substitution reaction of a fused-ring heteroaromatic sulfonyl chloride, followed by a one-pot reaction to convert the nitro-substituted fused-ring heteroaromatic sulfonyl chloride to its corresponding silver sulfonate. The nitro-substituted fused-ring heteroaromatic sulfonyl chloride reacts with silver carbonate to afford the silver salt in solid phase at almost quantitative yield. The resulting silver salt then reacts with a corresponding sulfonium (or iodonium) source to afford the desired fluorine-free fused-ring heteroaromatic PAG. The chemical structures of the resulting fluorine-free fused-ring heteroaromatic PAGs can be confirmed by their NMR spectra. In the instance of synthesis of the triphenyl sulfonium mono nitro-benzo[b]thiophene-2-sulfonate (TPSTBNO) as shown in Scheme 1, the resulting PAG is a mixture of two isomers A and B with a molar ratio of 65:35.</p>

The imaging polymer may be either a positive-tone imaging polymer or a negative-tone imaging polymer. When the imaging polymer is a positive-tone imaging polymer, it preferably includes acid sensitive side chains which can undergo catalytic cleavage in the presence of an acid generated by the inventive PAG. In such a polymer, the acid sensitivity exists because of the presence of acid sensitive side chains that are bonded to the polymer backbone. Such acid sensitive polymers including acid sensitive side chains are conventional and are well known in the art. Preferably, the imaging polymer is one suitable for use in 193 nm (ArF) lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0070">In some embodiments, the acid sensitive side chains of the acid sensitive polymers are protected with various acid labile protecting groups that are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the acid sensitive side chains may be protected with high activation energy protecting groups such as t-butyl ester or t-butyl carbonyl groups, a low activation energy protecting group such as acetal, ketal, or silyethers, or a combination of both low and high activation energy protecting groups may also be used.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0097">The substrate in the present invention is suitably any substrate conventionally used in processes involving photoresists. For example, the substrate can be silicon, silicon oxide, aluminum-aluminum oxide, gallium arsenide, ceramic, quartz, copper or any combination thereof, including multilayers. The substrate can include one or more semiconductor layers or structures and can include active or operable portions of semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0098">The material layer may be a metal conductor layer, a ceramic insulator layer, a semiconductor layer or other material depending on the stage of the manufacture process and the desired material set for the end product. The photoresist compositions of the invention are especially useful for lithographic processes used in the manufacture of integrated circuits on semiconductor substrates. The photoresist compositions of the invention can be used in lithographic processes to create patterned material layer structures such as metal wiring lines, holes for contacts or vias, insulation sections (e.g., damascene trenches or shallow trench isolation), trenches for capacitor structures, ion implanted semiconductor structures for transistors, etc. as might be used in integrated circuit devices.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0099">In some cases, a bottom antireflective coating and/or underlayer coating (e.g., a planarizing underlayer) may be applied between the photoresist layer and the material layer. In other cases, a top antireflective coating layer may be applied over the photoresist layer. The invention is not limited to the use of antireflective reflective coatings and/or underlayer materials, nor specific compositions of those coatings or materials.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0100">The photoresist layer may be formed by virtually any standard means including spin coating. The photoresist layer may be baked (post applying bake (PAB)) to remove any solvent from the photoresist and improve the coherence of the photoresist layer. The preferred range of the PAB temperature for the photoresist layer is from about 70&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C., more preferably from about 90&#xb0; C. to about 130&#xb0; C. The preferred range of thickness of the first layer is from about 20 nm to about 400 nm, more preferably from about 50 nm to about 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0101">The photoresist layer is then patternwise exposed to the desired radiation. The radiation employed in the present invention can be visible light, ultraviolet (UV), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and electron beam (E-beam). It is preferred that the imaging wavelength of the radiation is about 248 nm, 193 nm or 13 nm. It is more preferred that the imaging wavelength of the radiation is about 193 nm (ArF laser). The patternwise exposure is conducted through a mask which is placed over the photoresist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0102">After the desired patternwise exposure, the photoresist layer is typically baked (post exposure bake (PEB)) to further complete the acid-catalyzed reaction and to enhance the contrast of the exposed pattern. The preferred range of the PEB temperature is from about 70&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C., more preferably from about 90&#xb0; C. to about 110&#xb0; C. In some instances, it is possible to avoid the PEB step since for certain chemistries, such as acetal and ketal chemistries, deprotection of the resist polymer proceeds at room temperature. The post-exposure bake is preferably conducted for about 30 seconds to 5 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0103">After PEB, if any, the photoresist structure with the desired pattern is obtained (developed) by contacting the photoresist layer with an aqueous alkaline solution which selectively dissolves the areas of the photoresist which were exposed to radiation in the case of a positive photoresist (or the unexposed areas in the case of a negative photoresist). Preferred aqueous alkaline solutions (developers) are aqueous solutions of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The resulting lithographic structure on the substrate is then typically dried to remove any remaining developer. If a top antireflective coating has been used, it is preferably also dissolved by the developer in this step.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0104">The pattern from the photoresist structure may then be transferred to the exposed portions of underlying material layer of the substrate by etching with a suitable etchant using techniques known in the art; preferably the transfer is done by reactive ion etching or by wet etching. Once the desired pattern transfer has taken place, any remaining photoresist may be removed using conventional stripping techniques. Alternatively, the pattern may be transferred by ion implantation to form a pattern of ion implanted material.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Synthesis of mono nitro-benzo[b]thiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0107">To a solution of benzo[b]thiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride (1.165 g, 5 mmol) in 25 mL of dichloromethane was added 3.6 mL of concentrated nitric acid (&#x2267;22.05 mol/L) dropwise, the resulting mixture was refluxed overnight and cooled to room temperature before it was poured into 20 gram of crushed ice. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted by 220 mL 2 dichloromethane. The organic layers were combined and dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Solvent was then removed by rotary evaporator. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography with an eluent of hexane, followed by a gradient eluent of hexane/ethyl acetate (6/1-3/1) to afford 0.58 g of product (mixture of 65% of 4-nitro-benzo[b]thiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride and 35% of 7-nitro-benzo[b]thiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride).</p>

The resulting suspension was stirred overnight for 9 days, until no starting material is shown on the thin layer chromatography with an eluent of hexane/ethyl acetate (1:4). The mixture was filtered through half an inch of Celite&#xae; and the solid was washed with 3&#xd7;40 mL acetonitrile. The organic filtrate was combined and organic solvent was removed via rotary evaporator to dryness and thus afforded 0.668 g of viscous solid with a yield of 98.2%. The resulting compound was not purified for further reactions.</p>

The resulting mixture was stirred overnight for 3 days before it was filtered. The resulting solution was filtered though 1 inch of Celite&#xae;/aluminum oxide basic/Celite&#xae; layer and washed with 25 mL of acetonitrile and 25 mL of acetone. The organic solvent was removed via rotary evaporator and the residue was re-dissolved in 50 mL of 2-butanone, dried over magnesium sulfate over night and filtered though 1 inch of Celite&#xae;. Solvent was removed by rotary evaporator and dried over vacuum oven to dryness and thus afforded 0.71 g of product with a yield of 70%. A melting point of 243&#xb0; C. was obtained with TPSTBNO in a DSC measurement (10&#xb0; C./min, nitrogen 5 mL/min). No obvious decomposition up to 250&#xb0; C. was observed in the DSC measurement.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0117">Lithographic Evaluation:</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0118">For lithographic evaluation, the prepared photoresists formulation was spin-coated for 30 seconds onto an antireflective coating material layer applied on silicon wafers. In the case of 193 nm immersion lithography, a topcoat layer was applied above photoresist layer. The resist film was baked at 110 C for 60 seconds on a hotplate for 60 seconds. The wafers were then exposed to 193 nm radiation (ASML, scanner 0.75 NA, and ASML, immersion scanner 1.35 NA, respectively). The exposure pattern was an array of lines and spaces of various dimensions down to 50 nm. The exposed wafer was then post-exposure baked on a hot plate at 120 C for 60 seconds. The wafers were puddle developed by 0.263 N TMAH developer for 60 seconds. The resulting patterns of the photoresist imaging layers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photospeed results were obtained from the images of 150 nm line/150 nm space and 50 nm line/50 nm space, respectively.</p>
