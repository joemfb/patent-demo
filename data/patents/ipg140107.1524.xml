<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present subject matter relates generally to wind turbines and, more particularly, to a root attachment for a wind turbine rotor blade assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wind power is considered one of the cleanest, most environmentally friendly energy sources presently available, and wind turbines have gained increased attention in this regard. A modern wind turbine typically includes a tower, generator, gearbox, nacelle, and one or more rotor blades. The rotor blades capture kinetic energy from wind using known foil principles and transmit the kinetic energy through rotational energy to turn a shaft coupling the rotor blades to a gearbox, or if a gearbox is not used, directly to the generator. The generator then converts the mechanical energy to electrical energy that may be deployed to a utility grid.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To ensure that wind power remains a viable energy source, efforts have been made to increase energy outputs by modifying the configuration of the rotor blades of a wind turbine. One such modification has been to include aerodynamic enhancement features, such as an airfoil-shaped sleeve or wing, at the blade root of the rotor blade. Specifically, the blade root of a rotor blade is typically cylindrically shaped to facilitate connection of the rotor blade to the hub of the wind turbine, which is not an effective shape capturing energy from the wind. As such, aerodynamic enhancement features may be attached to the rotor blade at the blade root in order to increase the wind capturing capability of the rotor blade.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, conventional aerodynamic enhancement features are attached to the blade root in a cantilevered arrangement, thereby subjecting the airfoil enhancement features to significant deflection and/or loading during operation of the wind turbine. Accordingly, in order to maintain their airfoil shape and/or otherwise avoid material failure, these aerodynamic enhancement features are typically formed from relatively thick walls or shells having a solid, uniform cross-section. As such, the amount of material used to form conventional aerodynamic enhancement features is significantly high, thereby increasing the material costs and weight of such features.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, an aerodynamic enhancement feature for a blade root that may be formed from a reduced amount of material while still being capable of withstanding the deflection and/or loading that occurs during operation of a wind turbine would be welcomed in the technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present subject matter is directed to a rotor blade assembly for a wind turbine. The rotor blade assembly may generally include a rotor blade extending between a blade root and a blade tip. The rotor blade may include a pressure side and a suction side extending between a leading edge and a trailing edge. In addition, the rotor blade assembly may include a root attachment coupled to the rotor blade at or adjacent to the blade root. The root attachment may include a wall panel having an inner side and an outer side, wherein the wall panel defines a non-uniform cross-section between the inner and outer sides.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, the present subject is directed to a root attachment for a wind turbine rotor blade having a blade root. The root attachment may include a wall panel configured to be coupled to the rotor blade at or adjacent to the blade root. The wall panel may define at least a portion of an airfoil shape and may include an inner side and an outer side. In addition, the wall panel may define a non-uniform cross-section between the inner and outer sides.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates perspective view of one embodiment of a wind turbine <b>10</b>. The wind turbine <b>10</b> includes a tower <b>12</b> with a nacelle <b>14</b> mounted thereon. A plurality of rotor blades <b>16</b> are mounted to a rotor hub <b>18</b>, which is, in turn, connected to a main flange that turns a main rotor shaft. The wind turbine power generation and control components are housed within the nacelle <b>14</b>. It should be appreciated that the wind turbine <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is provided for illustrative purposes only to place the present subject matter in an exemplary field of use. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art should understand that the present subject matter is not limited to any particular type of wind turbine configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is illustrated a suction side view of one embodiment of one of the rotor blades <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The rotor blade <b>16</b> generally includes a blade root <b>20</b> and a blade tip <b>22</b> disposed opposite the blade root <b>20</b>. The blade root <b>20</b> may generally have a substantially cylindrical shape and may be configured as relatively thick and rigid section of the rotor blade <b>16</b> so as to withstand the bending moments and other forces generated on the blade <b>16</b> during operation of the wind turbine <b>10</b>. In addition, the blade root <b>20</b> may also be configured to be mounted or otherwise attached to the hub <b>18</b> of the wind turbine <b>10</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the blade root <b>20</b> may include an outwardly extending blade flange <b>24</b> configured to be aligned with and mounted to a corresponding attachment component <b>26</b> of the hub <b>18</b> (e.g., a pitch bearing or any other suitable load transfer component). In such an embodiments, the blade flange <b>24</b> may generally define a plurality of bolt holes <b>28</b> having a bolt hole pattern corresponding to the pattern of bolt holes <b>30</b> defined in the attachment component <b>26</b>. Thus, the rotor blade <b>16</b> may be rigidly attached to the hub <b>18</b> using a plurality of bolts <b>32</b> or any other suitable fastening mechanisms and/or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rotor blade <b>16</b> may also generally define any aerodynamic profile or shape. For example, in several embodiments, the rotor blade <b>16</b> may define an airfoil shaped cross-section, such as by defining a symmetrical or cambered airfoil shaped cross-section. Thus, rotor blade <b>16</b> may include a suction side <b>34</b> and a pressure side <b>36</b> extending between a leading edge <b>38</b> and a trailing edge <b>40</b>. Further, the rotor blade <b>16</b> may have a span <b>42</b> defining the total length between the blade root <b>20</b> and the blade tip <b>22</b> and a chord <b>44</b> defining the total length between the leading edge <b>38</b> and the trailing edge <b>40</b>. As is generally understood, the chord <b>44</b> may generally vary in length with respect to the span <b>42</b> as the rotor blade <b>16</b> extends from the blade root <b>20</b> to the blade tip <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, there is illustrated one embodiment of a rotor blade assembly <b>100</b> having a root attachment <b>102</b> for improving the energy output of a wind turbine <b>10</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a suction side view of one embodiment of the rotor blade assembly <b>100</b>, particularly illustrating the root attachment <b>102</b> coupled to a rotor blade <b>16</b> of the rotor blade assembly <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the rotor blade assembly <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> taken about line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b>. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an enlarged, cross-sectional view of a portion of the root attachment <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It should be appreciated that the rotor blade <b>16</b> of the rotor blade assembly <b>100</b> may generally be configured as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In general, the root attachment <b>102</b> of the rotor blade assembly <b>100</b> may be configured to be coupled to the rotor blade <b>16</b> at or adjacent to the blade root <b>20</b>, thereby providing additional blade area at or adjacent to the blade root <b>20</b> for capturing the energy of the wind flowing past the wind turbine <b>10</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one embodiment, the root attachment <b>102</b> may be coupled to the rotor blade <b>16</b> so as to extend in a spanwise direction between a first end <b>106</b> and a second end <b>108</b>, with the first end <b>106</b> being generally disposed at and/or adjacent to a hub/blade interface <b>110</b> defined between the blade root <b>20</b> and the hub <b>18</b> and the second end <b>108</b> being generally disposed at and/or adjacent to a maximum chord location <b>112</b> of the rotor blade <b>16</b>. However, in other embodiments, the root attachment <b>102</b> may be configured to extend in a spanwise direction along any other portion of the rotor blade <b>16</b>. For instance, in alternative embodiments, the first end <b>106</b> of the root attachment <b>102</b> may be disposed at any other suitable location along the rotor blade <b>16</b>, such as by being disposed at any location between the interface <b>110</b> and the maximum chord location <b>112</b>. Similarly, the second end <b>108</b> of the root attachment <b>102</b> may be disposed at any other suitable spanwise location, such as by being disposed at a location outboard or inboard of the maximum chord location <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, in several embodiments, the root attachment <b>102</b> may be configured as an aerodynamic enhancement feature for the blade root <b>16</b> and, thus, may at least partially define an airfoil shape (e.g., by at least partially defining a symmetrical or cambered airfoil shaped cross-section) so as to improve the overall aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor blade assembly <b>100</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the root attachment <b>102</b> may be configured as a sleeve designed to encase or surround the portion of the rotor blade <b>16</b> disposed at and/or adjacent to the blade root <b>20</b>. In such an embodiment, the root attachment <b>102</b> may generally define a complete airfoil shaped cross-section and may include a pressure side <b>114</b> and a suction side <b>116</b> extending between a leading edge <b>118</b> and a trailing edge <b>120</b>. However, in other embodiments, the root attachment <b>102</b> may be configured to define only a portion of an airfoil shape. For example, as will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the rotor blade assembly <b>100</b> may include a root attachment(s) <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> defining only a leading edge portion or a trailing edge portion of an airfoil shape.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in several embodiments, the root attachment <b>102</b> may be formed by one or more wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> generally defining the outer shell or skin of the root attachment. For instance, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the root attachment <b>102</b> may include a first wall panel <b>122</b> generally forming the pressure side <b>114</b> of the airfoil shape defined by the root attachment <b>102</b> and a second wall panel <b>124</b> generally forming the suction side <b>116</b> of the airfoil shape defined by the root attachment <b>102</b>, with the first and second wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> being coupled to one another at the leading and trailing edges <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> of the root attachment <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, the first and second wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be configured to form any other suitable portion of the overall shape of the root attachment <b>102</b>, such as by configuring the first wall panel <b>122</b> to form the portion of the root attachment <b>102</b> extending outward from the blade root <b>20</b> towards the leading edge <b>118</b> and by configuring the second wall panel <b>124</b> to form the portion of the root attachment <b>102</b> extending outwardly from the blade root <b>20</b> towards the trailing edge <b>120</b>. Moreover, in further embodiments, the root attachment <b>102</b> may be formed by a single, continuous wall panel, by two wall panels as described above or by three or more wall panels coupled together to form the overall shape of the root attachment <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the root attachment <b>102</b> may include an inner side <b>126</b> and an outer side <b>128</b>. Additionally, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may define a wall thickness <b>130</b> between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. In general, the inner side <b>126</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be defined by the inner perimeter formed by the innermost points and/or surfaces of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and the outer side <b>128</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be defined by the outer perimeter formed by the outermost points and/or surfaces of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. For instance, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the inner side <b>126</b> is defined by a continuous boundary line extending generally tangent to and/or connecting the innermost points and/or surfaces <b>132</b> of the illustrated wall panel <b>122</b>. Similarly, the outer side <b>128</b> is defined by a continuous boundary line extending generally tangent to and/or connecting the outermost points and/or surfaces <b>134</b> of the wall panel <b>122</b>. Thus, in such an embodiment, the wall thickness <b>130</b> at any point along the wall panel <b>122</b> may generally be defined between such boundary lines.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, in accordance with several embodiments of the present subject matter, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may generally define a non-uniform cross-section between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. Specifically, instead of having a solid or uniform cross-section between the inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may include gaps, openings, channels, hollow portions and/or the like within the area defined between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. For instance, in a particular embodiment of the present subject matter, at least a portion of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may define a corrugated cross-sectional shape between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">By configuring each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> to have a non-uniform cross-section between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, the disclosed wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be capable of handling deflections and/or stresses more efficiently than wall panels having a solid or uniform cross-section. For instance, the non-uniform cross-section may provide an increase in the second moment of inertia of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, thereby creating stiffer wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> that are capable of resisting increased deflection (e.g., due to the wind forces acting on the root attachment <b>102</b>). In addition, by utilizing a non-uniform cross-section, at least a portion of the material forming each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be moved away from the wall panel's neutral bending axis. Accordingly, such material may be equipped with a greater mechanical advantage to handle loads (e.g., bending loads), thereby reducing the stresses acting on each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. Moreover, such an increased capability to handle deflections and/or stresses may be achieved with a reduction in the amount of material required to form each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. As such, the material cost for producing each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, as well as the overall weight of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, may be reduced. This reduction in material also results in the root attachment having less mass, thereby reducing the amount of loads that would otherwise be transmitted into the rotor blade <b>16</b> as a result of the root attachment <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In general, it should be appreciated that any suitable non-uniform cross-section may be defined between the inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. For instance, as indicated above, in several embodiments, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may define a corrugated cross-sectional shape. However, in other embodiments, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may define any other suitable non-uniform cross-section between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in several embodiments, at least a portion of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be configured as an undulating or channeled wall and, thus, may define a plurality of alternating channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. Specifically, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may define a plurality of inner channels <b>136</b> having an open end along the inner side <b>126</b> of the wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and a plurality of outer channels <b>138</b> having open end along the outer side <b>128</b> of the wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, with the inner and outer channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> alternating along the length of the wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In general, the alternating channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> defined by each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may have any suitable shape. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are formed between substantially parallel oriented segments of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> such that each channel <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> defines a generally rectangular shape. However, in other embodiments, the channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> may define any other suitable shape. For instance, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be configured so as to define a plurality of alternating channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> that have a generally triangular shape. Specifically, in such an embodiment, the portions of the wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> forming the sides of each channel <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> may extend diagonally between alternating ridges <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> that, when connected by a boundary line, generally define the inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, respectively. In another embodiment, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be configured so as to define a plurality of alternating channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> between its inner and outer sides <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> that have a generally arcuate or semi-elliptical shape. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may define a curved or wavy pattern such that the inner channels <b>136</b> are defined between adjacent valleys <b>146</b> that, when connected by a boundary line, generally define the inner side <b>126</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and the outer channels <b>138</b> are defined between adjacent peaks <b>148</b> that, when connected by a boundary line, generally define the outer side <b>128</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, in embodiments in which at least a portion of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> is configured as an undulating or channeled wall and, thus, defines a plurality of alternating channels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, the disclosed wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may also include one or more additional components and/or features designed to enhance the overall aerodynamic performance of the root attachment <b>102</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in one embodiment, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may include an outer sidewall <b>150</b> covering the outer channels <b>138</b>. Specifically, the outer sidewall <b>150</b> may be configured as a cover layer extending over the outer channels <b>148</b> and may include a generally continuous, outer surface defining the outer side <b>128</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. As such, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may define a smooth, aerodynamic surface along its outer side <b>128</b>, thereby improving the capability of the root attachment <b>102</b> to capture energy from the wind.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be appreciated that, in addition to the outer sidewall <b>150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or as an alternative thereto, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may include an inner sidewall (not shown) covering the inner channels <b>136</b> and generally defining the inner side <b>126</b> of the wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. It should also be appreciated that the outer sidewall <b>150</b> may be formed integrally with the channeled portion of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> or the outer sidewall <b>150</b> may be configured as a separate component configured to be separately mounted to the channeled portion of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. For instance, in one embodiment, the outer sidewall <b>150</b> may be formed over the channeled portion of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, such as by using a wet lay-up process to form the outer sidewall over the channeled portion or by using a shrink-wrapping process to form the outer sidewall over the channeled portion.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may include a filler material <b>152</b> disposed within the outer channels <b>138</b>. Specifically, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the filler material <b>152</b> may be disposed within each outer channel <b>138</b> such that an outer surface <b>154</b> of the filler material <b>152</b> is generally aligned with and/or tangent to the outer side <b>128</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. As such, a generally continuous and smooth aerodynamic surface may be defined along the outer side <b>128</b> of each wall panel <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be appreciated that, in addition to the filling each of the outer channels <b>138</b> with the filler material <b>152</b> or as an alternative thereto, the filler material <b>152</b> may be disposed within the inner channels <b>136</b>. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the filler material <b>152</b> may generally comprise any suitable material. For instance, in several embodiments, the filler material <b>152</b> may comprise a relatively lightweight material, such as a cork material, an adhesive and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it should be appreciated that, in several embodiments, the root attachment <b>102</b> may also include one or more support members <b>156</b> configured to provide structural support (e.g., increased stiffness) to the wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the root attachment <b>102</b> may include one or more support members <b>156</b> extending between the inner sides <b>126</b> of the wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. In another embodiment, the root attachment <b>102</b> may include one or more support members <b>156</b> extending between the rotor blade <b>16</b> and one or more of the wall panels <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, such as by coupling one or more support member(s) <b>156</b> between the blade root <b>20</b> and the inner side(s) <b>126</b> of the wall panel(s) <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, further embodiments of suitable wall panels <b>222</b> that may be utilized to form the disclosed root attachment <b>102</b> are illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter.

In general, the connection members <b>264</b> may be configured to extend between the inner and outer sidewalls <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> such that the wall panel <b>222</b> defines a non-uniform cross-section between its inner and outer sides <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>. For instance, the connection members <b>264</b> may be spaced apart from one another or may have a particular shape such that gaps, openings and/or the like are defined between the inner and outer sides <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> of the wall panel <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In several embodiments, the connection members <b>264</b> may be configured as separate wall segments extending between the inner and outer sidewalls <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>.

Additionally, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the connection members <b>264</b> comprise relative straight wall segments and, thus, extend linearly between the inner and outer sidewalls <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>. However, in alternative embodiments, the connection members <b>264</b> may be arcuate and, thus, may extend along a curved path between the inner and outer sidewalls <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Moreover, in several embodiments, the connection members <b>264</b> may define closed or open shapes between the inner and outer sidewalls <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, there is illustrated a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of a rotor blade assembly <b>300</b> in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, unlike the embodiment described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the rotor blade assembly <b>300</b> includes separate root attachments <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> coupled to the rotor blade <b>16</b> in a cantilevered arrangement at and/or adjacent to the blade root <b>20</b>. In general, each root attachment <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> may be configured to define a portion of an airfoil shape. Specifically, as shown, the rotor blade assembly <b>300</b> includes a first root attachment <b>301</b> generally defining a leading edge portion of an airfoil shape and a second root attachment <b>302</b> generally defining a trialing edge portion of an airfoil shape. As such, when the first and second root attachments <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> are coupled to the rotor blade <b>16</b>, a substantially continuous airfoil shape may be defined at and/or adjacent to the blade root <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the first root attachment <b>301</b> may generally be formed by one or more wall panels <b>322</b> coupled to and extending outwardly from the rotor blade <b>16</b> so as to define a leading edge portion of an airfoil shape.

Similarly, the second root attachment <b>302</b> may generally be formed by one or more wall panels <b>324</b> coupled to and extending outwardly from the rotor blade <b>16</b> so as to define a trailing edge portion of an airfoil shape.
