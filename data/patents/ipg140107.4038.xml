<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to apparatus and methods for producing a orientation-dependant radiation (ODR) source for use in systems employing such methods and apparatus. Specifically, the invention relates to an optical target for use with image metrology technology for precision spatial measurement and image-based motion analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates to new technology that allows for 3-D motion capture using a single camera. Prior patents that generally disclose the basic concepts include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,936,722; 5,936,723; and 6,384,908, and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2010/00046857; 2007/0280508; and 2004/0233461, which are all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pub. No. 2010/00046857 discloses a target constructed by applying artwork on the front and back of a transparent substrate, such as a glass or plastic plate. The target enables of six-degree of freedom location of an object by way of a single camera. The x and y location is determined by the position of a landmark that can be readily detected, even in an uncontrolled scene. Such a landmark is commonly called a robust landmark. The robust landmark can be a starburst in the center of the target, as in FIGS. 9-11 of U.S. Pub. No. 2010/00046857. The starburst may be black or white. The z location is determined by the spacing of the four circles (also referred to as secondary landmarks) from the center of the starburst, along with other data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The target disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2010/00046857 is a three-layer structure of substrate, front artwork, and rear artwork. The regions that extend radially outward from the starburst and between the secondary landmarks (i.e., the regions labeled 311<i>a</i>-316<i>b </i>in FIGS. 9-11) are grating regions that produce moir&#xe9; patterns. The moir&#xe9; patterns are seen as light and dark fringes that change in response to changes in orientation of the target. Small rotations produce moir&#xe9;-pattern displacements that are visible to the eye. With the out-of-plane rotations revealed by the moir&#xe9; patterns, the system is able to determine the six degree of freedom (&#x201c;6-DOF&#x201d;) pose of the target from a single camera image.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the invention provides a target for use in a system for optical tracking of motion of an object to which the target is affixed, the target comprising: an optically transparent substrate having a front surface and a rear surface; front artwork applied to the front surface of the substrate; rear artwork applied to the rear surface of the substrate; a robust landmark comprising of an image of the front and rear artwork, the robust landmark including a circular border defining an area of the robust landmark, and alternating spokes and interstitial spaces within the circular border; and orientation dependent radiation regions occupying at least a portion of the interstitial spaces of the robust landmark.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the orientation dependent radiation regions extend radially outside of the robust landmark. In some embodiments, the spokes and interstitial spaces are generally wedge-shaped. In some embodiments, the spokes are defined by a first feature in the front artwork and a second feature in the back artwork. In some embodiments, the first feature comprises a radial-edge boundary and the second feature comprises a circumferential-edge boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the invention provides a target comprising: an optically transparent substrate; an orientation dependent radiation region positioned on the substrate; a robust landmark positioned on the substrate; and at least one target identification marking that is rotationally oriented relative to the target in order to provide in-plane rotation information.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the orientation dependent radiation region comprises two orientation dependent radiation regions, and the target identification marking is positioned between the two orientation dependent radiation regions. In some embodiments, the target identification marking is positioned outside of the robust landmark and circumferentially between the orientation dependent radiation regions. In some embodiments, the robust landmark includes a spoke, and the target identification marking is positioned radially outward from the spoke. In some embodiments, the target identification marking comprises a plurality of markings that provide multi-bit identification. In some embodiments, the target identification marking comprises sixteen possible markings that provide 16-bit identification.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, the invention provides a target comprising: a substrate having a total area; an orientation dependent radiation region positioned on the substrate; and a robust landmark positioned on the substrate, the robust landmark having a landmark area that is at least 10% of the total area. In some embodiments, the landmark area is at least 20%, 30%, or 47% of the total area.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the invention provides a target comprising: a substrate having a substrate width; an orientation dependent radiation region positioned on the substrate; and a robust landmark on the substrate, the robust landmark having a landmark width; wherein the landmark width is at least 36% of the substrate width. In some embodiments, the landmark width is at least 50%, 60%, or 77.5% of the substrate width.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the invention provides a target comprising: a substrate having a substrate width; an orientation dependent radiation region positioned on the substrate, the orientation dependent radiation region having an ODR area; and a robust landmark on the substrate, the robust landmark occupying a landmark area; wherein the landmark area is at least 20% of the ODR area. In other embodiments, the landmark area is at least 40%, 80% or 120% of the ODR area.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the invention provides a target comprising: a substrate; and orientation dependent radiation regions positioned on the substrate; wherein the orientation dependent radiation regions are generally wedge-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the target further comprises a robust landmark that includes spokes that define a center of the target; wherein the orientation dependent radiation regions are spaced circumferentially relative to the center. In some embodiments, the orientation dependent radiation regions extend radially further than the spokes of the robust landmark. In some embodiments, the spokes are generally wedge-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the invention provides a target for use in a system for optical tracking of motion of an object to which the target is affixed, the target comprising: an optically transparent substrate having a front surface and a rear surface, both the front surface and rear surface being parallel to a plane; front artwork applied to the front surface of the substrate; rear artwork applied to the rear surface of the substrate; and a robust landmark comprising an image of the front and rear artwork; wherein portions of the front artwork and rear artwork included in the robust landmark appear to move with respect to each other in an image of the target having been tilted about an axis within the plane, such that a direction of tilt of the target can be determined from the apparent relative movement of the portions of the front artwork and rear artwork.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.</p>

Consequently, an object to which the target <b>150</b> is affixed can be tracked in 6-DOF. The six degrees of freedom consist of translation along an x-axis <b>161</b>, translation along a y-axis <b>162</b>, translation along a z-axis <b>163</b> (extending out of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, perpendicular to both the x-axis <b>161</b> and the y-axis <b>162</b>&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), pitch <b>164</b> (i.e., rotation about the x-axis <b>161</b>), yaw <b>165</b> (i.e., rotation about the y-axis <b>162</b>), and roll <b>166</b> (i.e., rotation about the z-axis <b>163</b>).</p>

The border regions <b>430</b> include a radial width <b>480</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) between the inner edge <b>460</b> and the outer edge <b>470</b>. The inner edges <b>460</b> of the border regions <b>430</b> together define an imaginary inner landmark circle <b>490</b>, and the outer edges <b>470</b> together define an imaginary outer landmark circle <b>495</b>.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The retro-reflective film <b>240</b> is bonded or attached on the rear surface <b>290</b> to efficiently return light from the light source <b>120</b> to the camera <b>130</b>. The terms retro-reflective film and retro-reflector means a device or surface that reflects light back to the light source <b>120</b> with a minimum scattering of light. A retro-reflector is distinguished from a planar mirror which reflects light at an angle equal to the angle of incidence; a planar mirror will only reflect light back to its source in the manner of a retro-reflector when the angle of incidence is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The target <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a four-layer structure (front artwork <b>220</b>, substrate <b>210</b>, rear artwork <b>230</b>, retro-reflective layer <b>240</b>). In other embodiments, backlighting can be used in the place of the retro-reflective film <b>240</b>. This would result in a three-layer structure in which there is no retro-reflective film <b>240</b> and the target <b>150</b> is illuminated from the rear surface <b>290</b>, so that the camera <b>130</b> receives light shining through the target <b>150</b>. As will be described in more detail below, the target <b>150</b> includes grating regions that create moir&#xe9; patterns as the target <b>150</b> is tilted. The combination of the retro-reflective film <b>240</b> and such grating regions give rise to the name &#x201c;retro-grate reflective target&#x201d; or &#x201c;RGR target,&#x201d; which is one type of target <b>150</b> in which the present invention may be embodied.

The white regions in the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> are open regions that permit light to pass through, and the darker regions block light.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to provide positional and attitudinal information about the target <b>150</b>, an image of the illustrate target <b>150</b> includes five elements: (i) a robust landmark; (ii) an orientation dependent radiation source; (iii) a cosine disambiguation feature; (iv) secondary landmarks; (v) and a unique identifier. These elements of an image of the target <b>150</b> are provided by the appearance of the various aspects of the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> from the perspective of the camera <b>130</b>. One aspect of the present invention is arranging the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> in the smallest possible target <b>150</b> that still satisfies these five elements, and in particular maximizes the size of the robust landmark with respect to the overall size of the target <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Robust Landmark</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The illustrated robust landmark <b>500</b> is of the starburst variety and occupies the area within the outer landmark circle <b>495</b>. The area of the robust landmark <b>500</b> is the area within the outer landmark circle <b>495</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the robust landmark <b>500</b> includes three elements: spokes <b>510</b>, interstitial spaces <b>520</b>, and a border <b>530</b>. The robust landmark <b>500</b> is centered on the front center point <b>350</b>. When viewed along the z-axis <b>163</b> (i.e., directly from the front), the front center point <b>350</b> is in front of the rear center point <b>410</b>. The front center point <b>350</b> and rear center point <b>410</b> define the z-axis <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The spokes <b>510</b> and the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> are centered on and symmetrical about the front center point <b>350</b>. The spokes <b>510</b> and interstitial spaces <b>520</b> are identical, pie-shaped regions that are bounded on their sides by the edges <b>360</b> of the v-shaped portions <b>310</b> and at their radial perimeter by the inner landmark circle <b>490</b>. The spokes <b>510</b> and interstitial spaces <b>520</b> alternate and evenly divide the area of the inner landmark circle <b>490</b>. Each spoke <b>510</b> has adjacent interstitial spaces <b>520</b> on either side, and each interstitial space <b>520</b> has adjacent spokes <b>510</b> on either side. There are an equal number of spokes <b>510</b> and interstitial spaces <b>520</b>. In the illustrated embodiment there are four of each, but in other embodiments there may be more or fewer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The spokes <b>510</b> in the illustrated embodiment are the white regions bounded by the edges <b>360</b> and the inner edge <b>460</b> of the border regions <b>430</b>. The interstitial spaces <b>520</b> are a composite of the portions of the v-shaped portions <b>310</b>, front grated portions <b>330</b>, and rear grated portions <b>420</b> that extend into the inner landmark circle <b>490</b>. Stated another way, the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> include all portions of the robust landmark <b>500</b> within the inner landmark circle <b>490</b> and between the spokes <b>510</b>. The border <b>530</b> is annular or ring-shaped and occupies the space between the inner landmark circle <b>490</b> and the outer landmark circle <b>495</b>. The border <b>530</b> is a composite of the border regions <b>430</b> and those portions of the v-shaped portions <b>310</b>, front grated portions <b>330</b>, and rear grated portions <b>420</b> between the inner landmark circle <b>490</b> and outer landmark circle <b>495</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The spokes <b>510</b> have a first density, the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> have a second density, and the border <b>530</b> has a third density. The term &#x201c;density,&#x201d; as used in this specification, refers to the darkness of the area. The first density is different from the second and third densities. The second and third densities may be different from each other or in other embodiments can be equal. Both the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> and the border <b>530</b> include portions of the front grated portions <b>330</b> and rear grated portions <b>420</b>. The front grated portions <b>330</b> and rear grated portions <b>420</b> generate moir&#xe9; patterns which shift as the target <b>150</b> is tilted. As a result, both the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> and border <b>530</b> include portions of moir&#xe9; patterns which have variable densities. The border <b>530</b> has a constant density outside of the spokes <b>510</b> (owing to the border regions <b>430</b>) and a variable density outside of the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> (owing to the moir&#xe9; patterns). The interstitial spaces <b>520</b> has constant density alongside the spokes <b>510</b> (owing to the v-shaped portions <b>310</b>) and variable density in the middle where the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> do not bound the spokes <b>510</b> (owing to the moir&#xe9; patterns).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The robust landmark <b>500</b> is characterized by being readily detected under given conditions. The term &#x201c;robust landmark&#x201d; is used in this specification consistently with the definition of robust landmarks provided on page 92 of PCT Application Publication No. WO/2001/035052, published May 17, 2001. That application provides: &#x201c;In particular, one embodiment of the invention is directed generally to robust landmarks for machine vision (and, more specifically, robust fiducial marks in the context of image metrology applications), and methods for detecting such marks. For purposes of this disclosure, as discussed above, a &#x2018;robust&#x2019; mark generally refers to an object whose image has one or more detectable properties that do not change as a function of viewing angle, various camera settings, different lighting conditions, etc. In particular, according to one aspect of this embodiment, the image of a robust mark has an invariance with respect to scale or tilt; stated differently, a robust mark has one or more unique detectable properties in an image that do not change as a function of the size of the mark as it appears in the image, and/or an orientation (rotation) and position (translation) of the mark with respect to a camera (i.e., a viewing angle of the mark) as an image of a scene containing the mark is obtained. In other aspects, a robust mark preferably has one or more invariant characteristics that are relatively simple to detect in an image, that are unlikely to occur by chance in a given scene, and that are relatively unaffected by different types of general image content. These properties generally facilitate automatic identification of the mark under a wide variety of imaging conditions.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In operation, the target <b>150</b> is moved with 6-DOF. Because of the depth <b>250</b> of the substrate <b>210</b>, the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> appear to move with respect to each other during out-of-plane movement. The operating parameters of the system <b>110</b> dictate how much out-of-plane movement must be accommodated by the geometry of the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b>. To accommodate any out-of-plane movement, the v-shaped portions <b>310</b> must extend beyond the inner landmark circle <b>490</b> to accommodate apparent shifting of the border regions <b>430</b> while still maintaining an edge <b>360</b> that reaches all the way to the inner edge <b>460</b> so that the spokes <b>510</b> are clearly defined. This is why the v-shaped portions <b>310</b> extend into the border regions <b>430</b> when the target <b>150</b> is viewed from the front (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The over-extension of the v-shaped portions <b>310</b> accommodates apparent shortening of the edges <b>360</b> in an image of the target <b>150</b> when the target <b>150</b> has been tilted out-of-plane.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With respect to the &#x201c;minor dimension&#x201d; requirement, upon out-of-plane tilting (i.e., pitch <b>164</b> and yaw <b>165</b>) of the robust landmark <b>500</b>, the inner landmark circle <b>490</b> will appear in the image as an ellipse. As an example, if the performance requirements for a given system <b>110</b> are to track the target up to 60&#xb0; of out-of-plane tilt <b>164</b>, then the robust landmark <b>500</b> must have an inner landmark circle <b>490</b> with a 12 pixel diameter in the image taken by the camera <b>130</b>. If tilted 60&#xb0;, the inner landmark circle <b>490</b> will appear as an ellipse with a minor dimension of 6 pixels (the cosine of 60&#xb0; is 0.5, so the minor dimension will appear as half of the in-plane dimension).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For a readily detectable robust landmark <b>500</b>, the setup for tracking a target will be determined by the following several factors: measurement volume, camera resolution, and robust landmark size. Measurement volume is the area of an image captured by the camera and a depth which is determined by the focus of the camera. When tracking a target such as the target <b>150</b> described in this specification, the camera focus is typically fixed at setup to define a measurement volume, and the focus remains fixed during tracking of the target.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The interplay of measurement volume, camera resolution, and robust landmark size is as follows. For a given measurement volume, the resolution of the camera can be decreased as the size of the robust landmark increases. For a given camera resolution, the measurement volume may be increased as the size of the robust landmark increases. For a given robust landmark size, the measurement volume may be increased as the resolution of the camera increases.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The most expensive component of the target tracking system <b>110</b> is typically the camera <b>130</b>, and the cost of the camera <b>130</b> is driven in large part by its resolution. Assuming that the cost of the camera <b>130</b> is an important factor when setting up the target tracking system <b>110</b>, and assuming that it is desirable to maximize the measurement volume capability of the system <b>110</b>, then it is also desirable to maximize the size of the robust landmark <b>500</b>. The size of the robust landmark <b>500</b> is necessarily limited by the physical size of the substrate <b>210</b> of the target <b>150</b>, and there are practical limitations on how large a target <b>150</b> can be for a given target tracking system <b>110</b> (such limitations depending in part on environment and the size of the object to which the target <b>150</b> is attached). It is therefore desirable to maximize the size of the robust landmark <b>500</b> in a given target <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For human motion analysis applications, it is desirable to have a large measurement volume, combined with unintrusive motion-tracking targets, while operating with moderate-cost, high frame rate cameras. Such applications would therefore find it desirable to provide a small target <b>150</b> having a large robust landmark <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For motion tracking with an MR scanner, the target size is at a premium, because of restricted space within the scanner. For a given measurement volume and camera resolution in such application, the lower size limit of the target <b>150</b> will be dictated by the ratio of the size of the robust landmark <b>500</b> to the overall size of the target <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Orientation Dependent Radiation Source</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The front gratings <b>330</b> and rear gratings <b>420</b> are one example of a larger classification of features termed orientation dependent radiation (&#x201c;ODR&#x201d;) sources. For convenience, the combined front gratings <b>330</b> and rear gratings <b>420</b> (which appear in combination only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) will be referred to in this specification as the ODR regions <b>610</b>. ODR regions <b>610</b> produce radiation (e.g., light waves, as in the illustrated embodiment) in a shape or pattern that can be interpreted by the processor <b>140</b> to refine an approximate estimate of out-of-plane tilt (i.e., pitch <b>164</b> and yaw <b>165</b>) of the target <b>150</b> and produce a precise estimate of out-of-plane tilt. In the illustrated embodiment, the front gratings <b>330</b> and rear gratings <b>420</b> filter radiation in the form of light that is either reflected (if the target <b>150</b> is a four-layer assembly with a retro-reflective layer <b>240</b>) or directly shone through the rear gratings <b>420</b> and front gratings <b>330</b> (if a three-layer assembly that is backlit), to form moir&#xe9; patterns in the ODR regions <b>610</b> that appear in an image of the target <b>150</b>. The front and rear gratings are designed such that the moir&#xe9; patterns will have brightness no more than half the brightness of the spokes <b>510</b> in an image of the target <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ODR regions <b>610</b> extend into and occupy a portion of the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> and border <b>530</b> of the robust landmark <b>500</b> and also extend radially outwardly beyond the robust landmark <b>500</b> (i.e., beyond the outer landmark circle <b>495</b>). Extending the ODR regions <b>610</b> into the robust landmark <b>500</b> permits the overall target <b>150</b> size to be reduced without reducing the size of the robust landmark <b>500</b>. To properly extract out-of-plane tilting information from the moir&#xe9; patterns, the ODR regions <b>610</b> must have a size that permits several cycles of the moir&#xe9; patterns to be analyzed from the image of the target <b>150</b>. A minimum physical dimension of the ODR regions <b>610</b> is achieved in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The ratio of robust landmark <b>500</b> area to the overall area of the target <b>150</b> is one advantage of the present invention, as prior art targets have been arranged with no overlap of the ODR regions and the robust landmark (see for example the arrangement in FIGS. 9-11 of U.S. Pub. No. 2010/00046857). The ODR regions in the prior art have been entirely outside of the robust landmark.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Cosine Disambiguation Feature</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As discussed in U.S. Pub. No. 2010/00046857, paragraphs [0015]-[0017], the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> will undergo foreshortening along an axis of out-of-plane tilting of the target <b>150</b>. However, the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> will have essentially the same appearance whether the angle of tilting is positive or negative. The direction or branch of such out-of-plane tilting, is therefore ambiguous based on the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> individually. This is called cosine ambiguity. The observation of the apparent relative movement of the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> can be used to resolve such cosine ambiguity.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Because the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> exist in parallel planes that are separated by the depth <b>250</b> of the substrate <b>210</b>, the front artwork <b>220</b> will appear to shift with respect to the rear artwork <b>230</b> as the target <b>150</b> is tilted out-of-plane. More specifically, the v-shaped portions <b>310</b> of the front artwork <b>220</b> and the border regions <b>430</b> of the rear artwork <b>230</b> will appear to shift with respect to each other. This apparent shifting causes an apparent shift of the inner edge <b>460</b> of the border regions <b>430</b> with respect to the center point <b>350</b>, and a resultant apparent lengthening or shortening of the edges <b>360</b> of the v-shaped portions <b>310</b>. Since the edges <b>360</b> define the boundaries of the spokes <b>510</b>, the spokes <b>510</b> will appear to lengthen and shorten depending on the direction of tilt.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, pitch <b>164</b> in the positive direction (i.e., the direction of rotation for pitch <b>164</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which follows the right hand rule) will cause an apparent shortening (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;foreshortening&#x201d;) of the edges <b>360</b> of the top spoke <b>510</b> (i.e., the spoke <b>510</b> at twelve o'clock in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a lengthening of the edges <b>360</b> of the bottom spoke <b>510</b> (i.e., the spoke <b>510</b> at six o'clock in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The aspects of the front artwork <b>220</b> and rear artwork <b>230</b> that can be used to determine the direction of out-of-plane tilt of the target <b>150</b> may be referred to as a cosine disambiguation feature of the target <b>150</b>. In the illustrated target <b>150</b>, the cosine disambiguation feature is the combination of the v-shaped portions <b>310</b> in the front artwork <b>220</b> and the border regions <b>430</b> in the rear artwork <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Secondary Landmarks</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The secondary landmarks are used to measure the distance of the target <b>150</b> from the camera <b>130</b> (i.e., the distance of the target <b>150</b> in the z-direction <b>163</b>). More specifically, assuming that degree and direction of out-of-plane tilt of the target <b>150</b> is known, the distance of the center <b>350</b> target <b>150</b> from the camera <b>130</b> will be indicated by the apparent distances between the several secondary landmarks <b>450</b> in an image of the target <b>150</b>. For a given degree and direction of out-of-plane tilt of the target, the closer the secondary landmarks <b>450</b> appear to each other in the image, the further the target <b>150</b> is from the camera <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The secondary landmarks <b>450</b> should be positioned as far from the center point <b>350</b> as possible, within the physical confines of the target size. Wider separation of the secondary landmarks <b>450</b> provides the opportunity for more fine measurement of distances. In the illustrated embodiment, the secondary landmarks <b>450</b> are the black triangles in the four corners of the target <b>150</b>. The secondary landmarks <b>450</b> are not required to be robust.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Unique Identifier</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The unique identifier in the illustrated embodiment is provided by the encoding sixteen encoding segments <b>497</b><i>a</i>, <b>497</b><i>b</i>, <b>497</b><i>c</i>, <b>497</b><i>d </i>in the four encoding regions <b>440</b>. The first encoding segment <b>497</b><i>a </i>(counter-clockwise-most position) of each encoding region <b>440</b> can be designed so that only one of the first encoding segments <b>497</b><i>a </i>is marked white. Identifying and locating this mark relative to the rest of the target <b>150</b> will provide an initial indication of the roll <b>166</b> of the target <b>150</b> (i.e., it resolves the 4-way ambiguity inherent in the target <b>150</b>). Precise determination of the roll <b>166</b> is determined from an analysis of other features of the target <b>150</b>, such as the radial edge <b>360</b> boundaries of the spokes <b>510</b>. The remaining encoding segments <b>497</b><i>b</i>, <b>497</b><i>c</i>, <b>497</b><i>d </i>of the encoding regions <b>440</b> can be used to establish a unique serial number for the target <b>150</b>. The serial number would comprise a unique sequence of white and dark encoding segments <b>497</b><i>b</i>, <b>497</b><i>c</i>, <b>497</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The encoding regions <b>440</b> are radially outward of the spokes <b>510</b> and circumferentially between the ODR regions <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Example</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one example, the front surface <b>280</b> of the target <b>150</b> is square and has edges of 40 mm (i.e., it is a 40 mm&#xd7;40 mm square). The area of the front surface <b>280</b> (which will also be referred to as the &#x201c;surface area of the target <b>150</b>&#x201d;) is 1600 mm<sup>2</sup>. The inner landmark circle <b>490</b> of the robust landmark <b>500</b> has a diameter of 28 mm (i.e., each spoke <b>510</b> has a radius <b>465</b> of 14 mm). The outer landmark circle <b>495</b> has a diameter of 31 mm (i.e., the radius <b>475</b> is 15.5 mm). The border <b>530</b> has a width of 1.5 mm. The area of the robust landmark <b>500</b> is about 754 mm<sup>2</sup>. The robust landmark <b>500</b> is therefore about 77.5% of the width of the target <b>150</b> and occupies about 47% of the surface area of the target <b>150</b>. In other embodiments, the area of the robust landmark <b>500</b> is at least 10%, 20%, or 30% of the total area of the target <b>150</b>. In other embodiments, the width of the robust landmark <b>500</b> is at least 36%, 50%, or 60% the width of the target <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another way to describe the size of the robust landmark <b>500</b> is to compare the area of the robust landmark <b>500</b> (i.e., 754 mm<sup>2</sup>) to the area of the ODR regions <b>610</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the ODR regions <b>610</b> have an area of about 628 mm<sup>2 </sup>for all four regions combined. As such, the ODR regions <b>610</b> have a combined area that is about 120% of the total area of the target <b>150</b>. In other embodiments, the ODR regions <b>610</b> may have a combined area that is as low as 25% the total area, or at least 40% or 80% the total area of the ODR regions <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an example system <b>110</b>, a performance requirement might be that the target <b>150</b> must occupy an image region of no less than 40&#xd7;40 pixels in order to be processed. The 40&#xd7;40 pixel limitation dictates the minimum size of the starburst landmark <b>500</b> that will be readily detected for a given measurement volume and camera resolution. If the target is a 40&#xd7;40 mm square, and the camera or imager has a resolution of 1000&#xd7;1000 pixels, then the maximum working volume has a frontal area of 1 meter square. To increase the size of the working volume, either the target <b>150</b> must be made larger (bringing problems of attachment, weight, etc.) or the camera <b>130</b> must be higher resolution (bringing problems of cost, reduced frame rate, increased image processing).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Other RGR Target Design Considerations</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Because of substrate <b>210</b> thickness and refraction, a feature on the rear surface <b>290</b> of the target <b>150</b> appears displaced relative to a feature at the same location on the front surface <b>280</b>, unless viewed directly from the front of the target <b>150</b> along the z-axis <b>163</b>. Because the robust landmark <b>500</b> in the illustrated target <b>150</b> is comprised of the front artwork <b>220</b> and the rear artwork <b>230</b>, the robust landmark <b>500</b> includes features that appear to displace relative to each other as the target <b>150</b> is pivoted out-of-plane.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Each of the five landmarks <b>500</b>, <b>450</b> in the target <b>150</b> will preferably have a uniform intensity difference along their perimeters to enable precision location. The grating regions <b>330</b>, <b>420</b>, by virtue of the moir&#xe9; patterns, do not have uniform intensity, or a uniform intensity difference at their edge.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The target <b>150</b> combines at least a portion of the grating regions <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> into a portion of the robust landmark <b>500</b>. More specifically, the target <b>150</b> includes a portion of the grating regions <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> into the interstitial spaces <b>520</b> of the robust landmark <b>500</b>. This is a substantial improvement over the prior art target disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2010/00046857 because it permits a significant reduction of the required apparent target size, with associated benefits of larger working volume, lower weight targets, lower resolution cameras, reduced cost, higher speed and/or reduced image processing burden.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The inter-spoke regions of ODR-producing regions in the form of moir&#xe9; patterns are generally wedge-shaped and are positioned circumferentially between the spokes <b>510</b> of the robust landmark <b>500</b>. By virtue of this arrangement, the robust landmark <b>500</b> can be made much larger relative to the size of the target <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Operation</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In operation, the target <b>150</b> can be readily located by the digital imaging and processing system <b>110</b>, and used to determine the positioned and orientation of the target <b>150</b> (and the object on which the target <b>150</b> is attached). The following process is not intended to be limited to the specific order described below.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">First, the robust landmark <b>500</b> is identified by looking for its unique configuration. Once identified, its x and y location can be easily determined by measuring x and y coordinates to the center <b>350</b> of the robust landmark <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, the target <b>150</b> is identified (if more than one target <b>150</b> is used) by locating and analyzing the identification markings or encoding segments <b>497</b><i>a</i>, <b>497</b><i>b</i>, <b>497</b><i>c</i>, <b>497</b><i>d</i>. These markings can also be used to resolve the 4-way ambiguity of the target <b>150</b>, as noted above. Precise determination of the roll <b>166</b> (in-plane rotation) of the target <b>150</b> can be determined by analyzing the position and orientation of the radial-edge boundaries <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The ODR regions <b>610</b> of the target <b>150</b> are then identified and analyzed. Due to the change in radiation of the moir&#xe9; patterns as a function of its orientation, analysis of the ODR regions <b>610</b> will provide an indication of the out-of-plane rotation of the target <b>150</b>. Cosine ambiguity can be addressed by comparing front-surface marking (e.g., the radial-edge boundaries <b>360</b>) to back-surface markings (e.g., the circumferential-edge boundaries <b>460</b>), as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Finally, the secondary landmarks or locatable features <b>450</b> are located and measured to determine the z-coordinate of the target <b>150</b> relative to the camera <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a target having ORD regions that occupy at least a portion of the area of a robust landmark area. This permits the ratio of robust landmark size to target size to be maximized. Various features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the following claims.</p>
