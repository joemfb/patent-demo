<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to selecting an optimal travel route.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many vehicles now include navigation systems that help the driver get to a desired destination. In more detail, the navigation system includes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver that receives a navigation message transmitted from a GPS satellite, and a sensor such as a gyroscope and speed sensor to detect a travel status of the moving vehicle. The navigation system installed in the vehicle also determines a current location of the traveling moving vehicle through a dead-reckoning process that uses the navigation message received by the GPS receiver and a travel status detect signal of the moving vehicle detected by the sensors. The current location of the moving vehicle is then matched and displayed together with map data on a display screen of the navigation system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, the user of the moving vehicle may check the current location of the moving vehicle and the shortest route from the current location to a destination using the navigation system. The user can also previously map out a route to travel under the guidance of the navigation system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the related art navigation system selects a travel route only using traffic information based on a current time, and thus does not reflect a current road network and flow status.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to address the above-noted and other problems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and terminal that utilizes predicted information about a road traffic flow status.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention provides in one aspect a method of selecting a travel route. The method includes receiving message information that includes traffic information, determining whether the message information includes message management information including time information for message management, status information indicating current traffic congestion status information or predicted traffic congestion status information, and location information including link identifiers assigned to road sections each indicating a location corresponding to the current traffic congestion status information or the predicted traffic congestion status information, receiving first and second location values for searching the travel route, and calculating travel prediction information of all road sections from a first position to a second position by applying each weight value previously set for each road section according to at least one of the current traffic congestion status information and the predicted traffic congestion status information from the first position to the second position that correspond to the first and second position values.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for selecting a travel route. The apparatus includes a receiving device configured to receive message information including traffic information, a traffic information extracting unit configured to determine whether the message information includes message management information including time information for message management, status information indicating current traffic congestion status information or predicted traffic congestion status information, and location information including link identifiers assigned to road sections each indicating a location corresponding to the current traffic congestion status information or the predicted traffic congestion status information, and to extract the current traffic congestion status information or the predicted traffic congestion status information, an input unit configured to receive first and second location values for searching the travel route, and a processing device configured to calculate travel prediction information of all road sections from a first position to a second position by applying each weight value previously set for each road section according to at least one of the current traffic congestion status information and the predicted traffic congestion status information from the first position to the second position that correspond to the first and second position values.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A navigation system installed in a vehicle according to embodiments of the present invention interfaces with a traffic information providing server and/or a broadcast station that collects and provides traffic information. The traffic information is broadcast according to the TPEG (Transport Protocol Expert Group) standards and the DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcast) transport standards. Other broadcast or transmission standards may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an overview illustrating a traffic information providing system according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the traffic information providing system includes a network <b>5</b>, a traffic information providing server <b>10</b>, a broadcast station <b>15</b> and a vehicle <b>20</b>. The network <b>5</b> includes a wired/wireless communication network such as a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, various traffic information are collected through the network <b>5</b>, and the collected traffic information are processed by the traffic information providing server <b>10</b> and then transmitted to the broadcast station <b>15</b>. Then, the broadcast station <b>15</b> inserts the processed traffic information into a broadcast signal and broadcasts the signal to the vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the traffic information providing server <b>10</b> re-configures various traffic information collected from diverse sources (e.g., an operator input, the wired/wireless Internet, a transparent data channel (TDC), a digital broadcast service such as a multimedia object transport (MOT), a different server or a probe car, etc.) into a traffic information format such as a format according to the TPEG standard, namely, a standard for a traffic information service, and transmits the information to the broadcast station <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The broadcast station <b>15</b> inserts the traffic information in a broadcast signal and wirelessly transmits the broadcast signal to an information reception terminal (i.e., navigation terminal) installed in the vehicle <b>20</b>. The TPEG format will be described in more detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, the traffic information includes information about various traffic conditions used when navigating roads, the ocean, air space, etc. The traffic information includes information about an accident, a road situation, a traffic congestion, a road construction, a road closure, a public traffic network delay, an aviation operation delay, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, the broadcast station <b>15</b> receives the processed traffic information from the traffic information providing server <b>10</b> and wirelessly transmits the signal to the vehicle <b>20</b> according to various digital broadcast standards. That is, the broadcast standards include diverse digital broadcast standards such as a Europe-bound digital audio broadcasting (DAB) standard based on Eureka-147 (ETSI EN 300 40), a terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB) or a satellite DMB (S-DMB), a digital video broadcast terrestrial (DVB-T) standard, a digital video broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H) standard, a media forward link only (MFLO) standard, and the like. The broadcast station <b>15</b> may also transmit the traffic information via a wired/wireless network such as the wired/wireless Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, the vehicle <b>20</b> refers to all types of carriers implemented using a mechanic or electronic devices to move human beings or objects (i.e., articles or items), such as general passenger cars, buses, trains, ships, aircrafts, etc. In the embodiments of the present invention, the traffic information reception terminal is mounted in the passenger car, but the present invention also applies to other types of transporting means.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also, the vehicle <b>20</b> including the traffic information reception terminal receives TPEG data in the TPEG format from the broadcast station <b>15</b>, processes the received data, and transfers the processed data via graphic, text and/or audio to the user of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will also be referred to in this description. The traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> can be an in-dash type terminal or an on-dash type terminal depending on how the terminal is installed in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In more detail, the in-dash type traffic information reception terminal is fixedly inserted in a certain space allocated within a dash board of the vehicle, and the on-dash type traffic information reception terminal is mounted on the dash board or installed on a certain support (cradle) near the dash board in the vehicle. In addition, the on-dash type traffic information reception terminal is detachable and thus can be separated from the vehicle and carried, and is thus also called a portable navigation device.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> includes all types of information processing devices that can receive and/or process traffic information such as various mobile (portable) terminals that may perform a navigation function by interworking with a GPS receiver that receives a navigation message from a GPS satellite within the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> includes a GPS receiver <b>110</b>, a broadcast signal receiver <b>120</b>, a traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b>, a memory <b>140</b>, a controller <b>150</b>, a display <b>160</b>, an input unit <b>170</b> and a voice output unit <b>180</b>. The GPS receiver <b>110</b> receives a navigation message transmitted from the GPS satellite via an antenna ANT and provides the message to the controller <b>150</b>. Thus, the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> can be used to navigate the vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the broadcast signal receiver <b>120</b> receives a broadcast signal from the broadcast station <b>15</b> via the antenna ANT. The broadcast signal received by the broadcast signal receiver <b>120</b> includes traffic information structured according to the TPEG standard and a binary format for scene (BIFS) and additional information such as various supplementary data, as well as video and audio data according to the various standards such as the T-DMB or the S-DMB, the DAB, and the DVB-T or DVB-H, etc., as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the broadcast signal receiver <b>120</b> tunes to a signal band provided by the traffic information, demodulates the tuned signal, and outputs the demodulated signal. The traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> then receives the demodulated signal from the broadcast signal receiver <b>120</b>, decodes the received signal into a TPEG message sequence configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, interprets each TPEG message of the sequence, and transfers traffic information and/or a control signal according to the message content to the controller <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The controller <b>150</b> then stores the received traffic information in the memory <b>140</b>. Further, the memory <b>140</b> includes a non-volatile memory that stores programs and data required for performing various functions provided by the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> and a volatile memory that temporarily stores various data generated according to an operation of the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In particular, the non-volatile memory of the memory <b>140</b> stores various data used for selecting an optimum route to reach a destination. For example, the memory <b>140</b> stores congestion traffic information about a road section extracted by the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> together with a correspondingly determined weight value in the form of a look-up table, for example, such that information can be quickly read and used in the process of searching a travel route for the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the memory <b>140</b> stores map data required for operating the vehicle <b>20</b> based on the navigation message received from the GPS satellite. The map data may include maps expressed with graphs and topographical information, and various geographical data road junctions such as an intersection with a different road or an exit to the different road, a road section connecting respective junctions, and a section distance.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, when the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> does not store the map data in an electronic map format due to a limited memory capacity, the above-described various geographical data in the form of text, excluding the map shown in graphs, may be stored in the memory <b>140</b>. Further, the road section includes one or more unit links that are passed to reach the destination, and hereinafter, a road section between two adjacent junctions on the road is defined as a unit link.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other words, the road section between a start point and the destination may include a set of one or more unit links. The single unit link is the road section between the adjacent junctions, that is, once the vehicle <b>20</b> enters the unit link, it cannot go into a different unit link until the next junction appears.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, each road section of the map data is identified by a link identifier. For example, the link identifier may include the latitude or the longitude of a start point and an end point of a section, or characters including the title of the section, a number, or a mixture thereof. In addition, the controller <b>150</b> may be implemented as a processing device such as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) that processes various data input to the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b>, and generally controls the overall operation of the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In particular, the controller <b>150</b> searches the map data including various locations such as a current location of the vehicle, and the start point and destination from the memory <b>140</b> based on the navigation message received by the GPS receiver <b>110</b>, searches every possible route to the destination, selects an optimum route using the traffic information extracted by the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b>, processes the selected route into a video signal, and outputs the video signal to the display <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, the display <b>160</b> displays the current location of the vehicle, the traffic information and a travel route of the vehicle on the map data read from the memory <b>140</b> according to the navigation message received by the GPS receiver <b>110</b> under the control of the controller <b>150</b>. Also, the display <b>160</b> may be a liquid crystal display (LCD). The display <b>160</b> may also include a touch screen to display various functions of the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b> in a menu structure and also simultaneously performs an input function for executing a menu selected according to a user's touch using a stylus or finger, for example. The touch screen also is used to display information to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The input unit <b>170</b> receives various operation commands from the user and applies the input commands to the controller <b>150</b>. The input unit <b>170</b> may be implemented as at least one of a key input unit including at least one number key or function key, a touch pad for inputting information according to a user's touch, and a remote processing device that may be installed on a steering wheel within the vehicle for conveniently operating the traffic information reception terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the voice output unit <b>180</b> generates an audio or voice signal to guide the user along a selected route, amplifies the signal to a certain level selected through the input unit <b>170</b>, and outputs the amplified signal through one or more speakers (not shown) under the control of the controller <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an overview illustrating a format for providing wirelessly transmitted congestion traffic information. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the traffic information providing format wirelessly transmitted by the traffic information providing server <b>10</b> includes a sequence of message segments (hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;TPEG messages&#x2019;).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Also, a single message segment of the sequence of the message segments, namely, a TPEG message <b>300</b><i>a </i>may indicate a TPEG-Congestion and Travel-Time information application (TPEG-CTT), and a TPEG message <b>300</b><i>b </i>may indicate a TPEG-Road Traffic Message Application or TPEG-Public Transport Information Application that includes accident and unexpected situation information.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, a specific identification number called an application identification (AID) is allocated to each TPEG application. The AID is used to decode a received TPEG message using the most suitable application decoder. The TPEG-CTT is allocated an AID 0010 (hex). In addition, the TPEG-CTT provides information mainly to road users (road drivers), and the provided information makes an influence on the use of roads such as flow information in a road network, a delay level, and a travel (passage) time, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition, the TPEG message <b>300</b><i>a </i>including the Congestion and Travel-Time information Message has a message management container <b>310</b>, a CTT-status container (application status container) <b>320</b>, and a TPEG-Location Container <b>330</b>. In the present embodiment, the CTT-status container <b>320</b> of the TPEG message <b>300</b><i>a </i>refers to a TPEG-CTT container. The content of the CTT-status container <b>320</b> varies depending on a type of the TPEG message application.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, the TPEG message <b>300</b><i>b </i>for transferring traffic information may be included in the sequence of the TPEG messages, so two or more application can be included in a single TPEG message stream. Also, the message management container <b>310</b> includes a message identifier (MID) and a version number (VER). In addition, the message management container <b>310</b> may include date and time elements and a message generation time.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, the elements of the message management container <b>310</b> are used to manage information received from the TPEG decoder. However, with respect to the date and time elements among the elements of the message management container <b>310</b>, the TPEG-CTT does not transmit a start time, an end time, a message erase time, and schedule information, unlike other applications of the TPEG (the accident and unexpected situation information application and the public transport information application). This is because the transmission of a current flow status with respect to each point is important for the congestion and travel time information, unlike the unexpected situation information that needs to manage a message according to an unexpected or planned situation whose status changes at any moment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, the application status container <b>320</b> (i.e., the TPEG-CTT container <b>320</b>) includes current traffic flow status information and predicted traffic flow status information, etc., of each link (road section) as generated. In addition, the description of the status information in the application status container <b>320</b> has a hierarchical structure in order to guarantee terminal compatibility according to expansion of standards and addition of a component.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, Table 1 shows a class of the TPEG-CTT container <b>320</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of selecting a travel route according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> will also be referred to in this description.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the user requests searching for a travel route to a specific destination (Yes in S<b>610</b>), the controller <b>150</b> reads the map data stored in the memory <b>140</b> and searches every route that leads to the destination from a current location of the vehicle <b>20</b> using the navigation message received by the GPS receiver <b>110</b> (S<b>630</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The controller <b>150</b> then selects an optimum route from the searched routes using the congestion traffic information extracted from the TPEG CTT message by the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> (S<b>650</b>), and executes a navigation travel guidance. The process of selecting the optimum route in step S<b>650</b> is illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in order to calculate travel prediction information of each searched route, the controller <b>150</b> checks congestion traffic information of each unit road section using map data of each route (S<b>651</b>). The congestion traffic information checked by the controller <b>150</b> includes the current traffic flow status information, namely, the information regarding an average link speed, a travel time, a link delay and a congestion type, etc., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>, and predicted traffic flow status information, namely, a prediction average link speed, a prediction travel time, a congestion tendency, and additional information, etc., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The broadcast signal receiver <b>120</b> tunes to a signal band providing the congestion traffic information, demodulates the tuned signal, and transfers the to the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b>. Accordingly, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> decodes the inputted demodulated signal into a TPEG message sequence, interprets the TPEG-CTT of the TPEG message of the sequence, extracts the congestion traffic information as stated above, and transfers the congestion traffic information to the controller <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The processing procedure regarding the congestion traffic information, namely, the current traffic flow status information and the predicted traffic flow status information extracted by the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref> and <b>10</b> to <b>13</b> will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">That is, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> recognizes whether the corresponding TPEG message corresponds to the TPEG congestion traffic information application according to the AID information, and when the TPEG message corresponds to the TPEG congestion traffic information application, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> decodes the TPEG message.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> extracts the date/time, a message generation time of the message management container of each TPEG message, and recognizes whether a subsequent container is an application status container, namely, the TPEG-CTT container, from information of the message element.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the subsequent container is the TPEG-CTT container, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> obtains location information corresponding to the congestion traffic information currently transmitted from the subsequent TPET-CTT location container. Further, the location information can be identified by the link identifier as described above, e.g., the link identifier including the location coordinates, namely, the longitude and the latitude, of a start point and an end point of a link, or characters including the title of a link, a number, or a mixture thereof according to the type information of the TPEG-CTT location container.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Thus, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> can selectively extract congestion traffic information corresponding to a link of which link prediction information is desired to be calculated according to embodiments of the present invention with reference to a link identifier of the link. Further, the controller <b>150</b> checks the congestion traffic information transferred from the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b>, checks a weight value according to congestion traffic information of each link by searching a look-up table stored in the memory <b>140</b>, and checks the distance of each link using the map data (S<b>653</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is an overview illustrating one example of a look-up table with respect to weight values according to the congestion traffic information stored in the memory <b>140</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, weight values are applied according to the congestion tendency. In more detail, the congestion tendency virtually corresponds to traffic information of a current situation, and because a change in the current traffic situation can be predicted according to the congestion tendency, the congestion tendency can be utilized as prediction information.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, the weight values are applied to calculate travel prediction information according to the congestion tendency, but the weight values may also be applied using different congestion traffic information. For example, weight values may be applied according to a link travel time prediction among the predicted traffic flow status information.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to the look-up table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a weight value of &#x2212;10 sec/km is applied when the congestion tendency of a corresponding link is reduced, 0 sec/km is applied when the congestion tendency of the corresponding link is constant, and 10 sec/km is applied when the congestion tendency of the corresponding link is increased. Other units such as miles per hour may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, because the congestion tendency may be discriminated into a case where an average link speed is maintained, a case in which the average link speed is increased, and a case in which the average link speed is decreased, the traffic status according to the congestion tendency is discriminated by three stages. However, without being limited thereto, each stage of the congestion tendency can be discriminated in more detail, and various different weight values may be applied to each discriminated stage.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Subsequently, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the controller <b>150</b> calculates travel prediction information by applying the above-mentioned weight values to congestion traffic information of the respective links constituting a corresponding travel route (S<b>655</b>). For example, the travel prediction information may be calculated as a prediction link travel time such that a link distance is multiplied to a weight value of a corresponding link, to which a link travel time is added, and then the resultant values of each link are added.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The method of calculating the travel prediction information according to the above example can be expressed by equation (1) shown below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>=&#x3a3;(<i>T+a*L</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x2018;P&#x2019; is the travel prediction information, &#x2018;T&#x2019; is the link travel time, &#x2018;a&#x2019; is the weight value, and the &#x2018;L&#x2019; indicates the link distance.
</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, the controller <b>150</b> calculates the travel prediction information for all links of each corresponding route searched as described above, and selects a route in which the travel prediction information has a maximum value or a minimum value as an optimum route (S<b>657</b>) (in this example, a route in which the travel prediction information has the minimum value).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is an overview illustrating an example of a map of available road sections to reach the destination from the current location of the vehicle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the road sections from the current location <b>710</b> of the vehicle to the destination on the map are divided into unit links, and each link reflects the corresponding congestion traffic information as described above so as to be discriminated.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Further, as described above, the controller <b>150</b> searches every possible route to the destination, calculates the travel prediction information by applying the congestion traffic information to the searched routes, and selects an optimum route. In more detail, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, as for two routes &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019;, without applying the weight values, the link travel time of the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; is 40 minutes and that of the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; is 43 minutes. Thus, in this instance, the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; would be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">If, however, travel prediction information is calculated by applying the weight value according to the embodiment of the present invention, for the route &#x2018;A&#x2019;, the congestion tendency is constant in the first link, among all links, while it is increased in the other remaining links of 20 km. Thus, the weight value 10 sec/km is multiplied to the link distance 20 km, obtaining 200 seconds. When 200 seconds is added to the entire link travel time of the route &#x2018;A&#x2019;, the travel prediction information is obtained as 40 minutes+200 seconds, namely, 43 minutes and 20 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In addition, for the route &#x2018;B&#x2019;, because the congestion tendency is reduced in the third and fourth links, the weight value &#x2212;10 sec/km is multiplied to the total distance 10 km of the two links. Also, because the congestion tendency is increased in the fifth link, the weight value 10 sec/km is multiplied to the link distance 5 km. And then the two values are added (10*(&#x2212;10)+5*10) to obtain &#x2212;50 sec. When &#x2212;50 sec is added to the entire link travel time, the travel prediction information is obtained as 43 minutes-50 seconds', namely, as 42 minutes and 10 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Accordingly, before the weight values are applied, the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; is selected, but according to the travel prediction information obtained by applying the weight values according to the embodiment of the present invention, the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; is selected as the optimum route.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Further, when there are several routes whose travel prediction information has the minimum value, a route that has links whose congestion tendency is reduced and are relatively long may be selected. For example, on the assumption that the travel prediction information of the routes &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> are the same, for the route &#x2018;B&#x2019;, the congestion tendency of the third and fourth links is reduced, so the total distance of the links in which the congestion tendency is reduced is relatively long, compared with the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; that does not have a link with a reduced congestion tendency.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Accordingly, the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; can be selected. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and a method in which a route that has links that have the reduced congestion tendency and are closer to the current location of the vehicle than the destination and is longer may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">When the optimum route is selected, the controller <b>150</b> executes a travel guidance with the selected optimum route. Further, the controller <b>150</b> may check the additional information component as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to display the supplementary information or auxiliary information related to the CTT information in the form of text on the map.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the controller <b>150</b> starts the travel guidance according to the selected optimum route, and when an event requiring re-searching of the travel route occurs (Yes in S<b>670</b>), the controller <b>150</b> checks whether the road section of the current travel corresponds to a final link of the travel route (S<b>690</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In more detail, an event for requesting re-searching of the travel route includes an instance when the vehicle <b>20</b> enters a new road section while on the move, or when a new TPEG traffic information message is received so traffic information is updated. Thus, whenever the event for requesting re-searching of the travel route occurs as the vehicle <b>20</b> enters a new road section or as the TPEG traffic information is updated, a travel route that may be optimum at a time point when the event occurs is again calculated and the travel route is changed accordingly, whereby a changing traffic situation such as a change in the road situation can be suitably reflected to thus provide an effective travel guidance.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, when a road section to which the vehicle <b>20</b> newly enters is a final link of the travel route, the controller <b>150</b> may not re-search the travel route until the vehicle <b>20</b> reaches the destination after the travel guidance is finished. This is because re-searching of the travel route may be unnecessary when the road section to which the vehicle <b>20</b> newly enters is the final road section of the route to the destination.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">If, however, a road section to which the vehicle <b>20</b> enters is not the final road section of the travel route to the destination (No in S<b>690</b>), this means that the road section in which the vehicle <b>20</b> is currently located has been changed, so a travel route re-search event occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In this instance, the controller <b>150</b> repeatedly performs the steps S<b>630</b> and S<b>650</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, namely, the steps S<b>651</b> to S<b>657</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, with respect to the remaining road sections. That is, all the possible routes up to the destination from the current location of the vehicle are searched, an optimum route of the searched routes is selected, and a navigation travel guidance is executed through the selected optimum route.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition, the selecting of the optimum route from the searched routes is the same as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. That is, the controller <b>150</b> checks traffic information for each road section up to the destination from the location to which the vehicle <b>20</b> has been moved, and adds values obtained by multiplying weight values of respective corresponding links to the corresponding link distances with respect to the entire links. Then, the controller <b>150</b> selects a route in which the calculated total value is the minimum as an optimum route.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the vehicle <b>20</b> passes through a current junction <b>710</b> and then passes through a current road section, and when a new road section appears, namely, when the next junction <b>720</b> appears, the controller <b>150</b> determines that the event for requesting re-searching of the travel route has occurred. In addition, when the currently traveling road section is not a final link, the controller <b>150</b> repeatedly performs the steps S<b>630</b> and S<b>651</b> to S<b>657</b> to calculate the optimum route with respect to the remaining road sections, changes the route according to the calculated route, and performs the navigation guidance.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a view illustrating another example of a look-up table of weight values according to congestion traffic information stored in the memory. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, weight values are applied according to congestion tendency. For example, when congestion tendency of a corresponding link is reduced, a weight value &#x2018;+2 km/h&#x2019; may be applied, when the congestion tendency of the corresponding link is constant, &#x2018;0 km/h&#x2019; may be applied, and when the congestion tendency of the corresponding link is increased, &#x2018;&#x2212;2 km/h&#x2019; may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Herein, the weight values are divided into three stages according to the congestion tendency, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The controller <b>150</b> checks current traffic congestion information and predicted traffic congestion information of each unit road section of possible routes searched in step S<b>630</b> up to a destination using the map data and received congestion traffic information, checks the look-up table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, and applies respective weight values to calculate travel prediction information of each link (S<b>655</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">For example, the travel prediction information according to the present exemplary embodiment may be calculated such that a weight value of a corresponding link and a link distance are multiplied, to which an average link speed is added, and the resultant value is divided by the link distance.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The calculation of the travel prediction information in this example can be expressed by equation (2) shown below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>=&#x3a3;(<i>V+a*L</i>)/<i>L</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">where &#x2018;P&#x2019; is the travel prediction information, &#x2018;V&#x2019; is the average link speed, &#x2018;a&#x2019; is a weight value, and &#x2018;L&#x2019; indicates the link distance.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is an overview showing an example of a map of available road sections to reach the destination from the current location of the vehicle according to another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the road sections from the current location <b>710</b> of the vehicle to the destination on the map are divided into unit links, and each link reflects the corresponding congestion traffic information as described above so as to be discriminated.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In addition, as discussed above, the controller <b>150</b> searches every possible route to the destination, calculates the travel prediction information by applying the congestion traffic information to the searched routes, and selects a route of which the travel prediction information has a maximum value as an optimum route or a minimum value (in this example, a route of which the travel prediction information has the maximum value).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, as for two routes &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019;, without applying the weight values, the travel prediction information of the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; is calculated such that 60/10+60/5+45/4+60/5+60/5=51 and that of the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; is calculated such that 60/10+60/5+30/5+45/5+60/5=45. Thus, in this instance, the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; would be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">However, when the weight values according to this embodiment of the present invention are applied, the travel prediction information of the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; is calculated such that 60/10+(60&#x2212;2*5)/5+(45&#x2212;2*5)/5+(60&#x2212;2*5)/5+(60&#x2212;2*5)/5=43. That is, the travel prediction information is 43. Also, when the weight values are applied, the travel prediction information of the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; is calculated such that 60/10+60/5+(30+2*5)/5+(45+2*5)/5+(60&#x2212;2*5)/5=47. That is, the travel prediction information of the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; is 47. Thus, unlike the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; that is selected in the related art, in the present embodiment, the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; is selected as an optimum route.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for selecting an optimum route in step S<b>650</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> according to another embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> will also be referred to in this description. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, in order to calculate travel prediction information of each searched route, the controller <b>150</b> checks congestion traffic information of each unit road section using map data of each route (S<b>652</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Further, the congestion traffic information checked by the controller <b>150</b> includes the current traffic flow status information, namely, the information regarding an average link speed, a travel time, a link delay and a congestion type, etc., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>, and predicted traffic flow status information, namely, a prediction average link speed, a prediction travel time, a congestion tendency, and additional information, etc., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In addition, the broadcast signal receiver <b>120</b> tunes to a signal band providing the congestion traffic information, demodulates the tuned signal, and transfers the signal to the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b>. Then, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> decodes the inputted demodulated signal into a TPEG message sequence, interprets the TPEG-CTT of the TPEG message of the sequence, extracts the congestion traffic information as stated above, and transfers the congestion traffic information to the controller <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The processing procedure regarding the congestion traffic information, namely, the current traffic flow status information and the predicted traffic flow status information extracted by the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref> and <b>10</b> to <b>13</b> will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">That is, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> recognizes whether the corresponding TPEG message corresponds to the TPEG congestion traffic information application according to the AID information, and when the message corresponds to the TPEG congestion traffic information application, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> decodes the TPEG message.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> then extracts the date/time, a message generation time of the message management container of each TPEG message, and recognizes whether a subsequent container is an application status container, namely, the TPEG-CTT container from information of a message element. When the subsequent container is the TPEG-CTT container, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> obtains location information corresponding to the congestion traffic information currently transmitted from the subsequent TPET-CTT location container.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, the location information can be identified by a link identifier as described above, e.g., the link identifier including the location coordinates, namely, the longitude and the latitude, of a start point and an end point of a link, or characters including the title of a link, a number, or a mixture thereof according to the type information of the TPEG-CTT location container. Thus, the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b> can selectively extract congestion traffic information corresponding to a link of which link prediction information is desired to be calculated according to the embodiment of the present invention with reference to a link identifier of the link.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, the controller <b>150</b> checks the congestion traffic information transferred from the traffic information extracting unit <b>130</b>, checks a weight value according to congestion traffic information of each link by searching a look-up table stored in the memory <b>140</b>, and checks the distance of each link using the map data (S<b>654</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is an overview illustrating one example of a look-up table. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, weight values are applied according to the congestion tendency. That is, the congestion tendency virtually corresponds to traffic information of a current situation, and because a change in the current traffic situation can be predicted according to the congestion tendency, the congestion tendency can be utilized as prediction information.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Further, the weight values are applied to calculate travel prediction information according to the congestion tendency, but the weight values may also be applied by using different congestion traffic information. For example, weight values may be applied according to the link delay and the congestion tendency among the current traffic flow status information.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Therefore, according to the look-up table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, when a congestion type, e.g., a traffic flow of a corresponding link is smooth and its congestion tendency is reduced (i.e., when a current traffic flow is smooth and congestion is reduced), a weight value 1 is applied. When the congestion type is smooth and its congestion tendency is increased (i.e., when a current traffic flow is smooth but congestion is increased), a weight value 3 is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, in this embodiment, the congestion type may be discriminated by four stages of, e.g., &#x2018;smooth&#x2019;, &#x2018;slow speed&#x2019;, &#x2018;delay&#x2019;, and &#x2018;congestion&#x2019;, and the congestion tendency may be discriminated by a case where an average link speed is maintained, a case in which the average link speed is increased, and a case in which the average link speed is reduced. Accordingly, the traffic status can be discriminated by 12 stages in consideration of the congestion type and congestion tendency, and each different weight value may be applied to each stage.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Subsequently, the controller <b>150</b> calculates travel prediction information by adding values obtained by multiplying a weight value according to a traffic status and a link distance of the entire links constituting a corresponding travel route (S<b>656</b>). In this manner, the controller <b>150</b> obtains each addition value (i.e., travel prediction information) with respect to all links of respective searched corresponding routes, and selects a route whose obtained travel prediction information is the minimum as an optimum route (S<b>658</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is an overview showing an example of a map of available road sections to reach the destination from the current location of the vehicle according to another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the road sections from the current location <b>710</b> of the vehicle to the destination on the map are divided into unit links, and each link is shown to be discriminated with a mark indicating one of the 12 stages by reflecting the traffic information as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Further, the controller <b>150</b> searches every possible route to the destination, and selects a route from the searched routes using the traffic information. In this example, the two routes of &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019; show the same travel prediction information. Namely, for the route &#x2018;A&#x2019;, the travel prediction information is obtained such that a weight value of each link and each link distance are multiplied and the respective resultant values are added. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the travel prediction information of the route &#x2018;A&#x2019; is 2*10+3*5+6*5+6*5+3*5=100, and that of the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; is 2*10+2*5+7*5+4*5+3*5=100.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In addition, when there are several routes whose travel prediction information has the minimum value, the route &#x2018;B&#x2019; that has links whose congestion tendency is reduced, namely, in which the distance of the third and fourth links is relatively long, may be selected. However, a method in which a route, which has links that have the reduced congestion tendency and are closer to the current location of the vehicle than the destination, is longer may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">When the optimum route is selected, the controller <b>150</b> executes a travel guidance with the selected optimum route. Further, the controller <b>150</b> may check the additional information component as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to display the supplementary information or auxiliary information related to the CTT information in the form of text on the map.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In addition, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the controller <b>150</b> starts the travel guidance according to the selected optimum route, and when an event requiring re-searching of the travel route occurs (Yes in S<b>670</b>), the controller <b>150</b> checks whether the road section of the current travel corresponds to a final link of the travel route (S<b>690</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">That is, the event for requesting re-searching of the travel route includes when the vehicle <b>20</b> passes through a current road section to enter a new road section while on the move, or when a new TPEG traffic information message is received such that the traffic information is updated.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Thus, whenever the event for requesting re-searching of the travel route occurs as the vehicle <b>20</b> enters a new road section or as the TPEG traffic information is updated, a travel route that may be optimum at a time point when the event occurs is again calculated and the travel route is changed, whereby a changing traffic situation such as a change in the road situation can be suitably reflected to thus provide an effective travel guidance.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In addition, when a road section to which the vehicle <b>20</b> newly enters is a final link of the travel route, the controller <b>150</b> may not re-search the travel route until the vehicle <b>20</b> reaches the destination after the travel guidance is finished. This is because re-searching of the travel route may be unnecessary when the road section to which the vehicle <b>20</b> newly enters is the final road section of the route to the destination.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">If, however, a road section to which the vehicle <b>20</b> enters is not the final road section of the travel route to the destination (No in S<b>690</b>) means that the road section in which the vehicle <b>20</b> is currently located has been changed so a travel route re-search event occurs. Thus, the controller <b>150</b> repeatedly performs the steps S<b>630</b> and S<b>650</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, namely, the steps S<b>651</b> to S<b>657</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, with respect to the remaining road sections.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">That is, all possible routes up to the destination from the current location of the vehicle are searched, an optimum route of the searched routes is selected, and a navigation travel guidance is executed through the selected optimum route.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The selecting of the optimum route from the searched routes is the same as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. That is, the controller <b>150</b> checks traffic information of each road section up to the destination from the location to which the vehicle <b>20</b> has been moved, and adds values obtained by multiplying weight values of respective corresponding links to the corresponding link distances with respect to all links. Then, the controller <b>150</b> selects a route in which the calculated total value is the minimum as an optimum route.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the vehicle <b>20</b> passes through a current road section, and when a new road section appears, namely, when the next junction <b>720</b> appears, the controller <b>150</b> determines that the event for requesting researching of the travel route has occurred. In this instance, when the currently traveling road section is not a final link, the controller <b>150</b> repeatedly performs the steps S<b>630</b> and S<b>651</b> to S<b>657</b> to calculate the optimum route with respect to the remaining road sections, changes the route according to the calculated route, and performs the navigation guidance.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be practical exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
