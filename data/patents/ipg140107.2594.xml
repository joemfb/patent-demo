<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a silicon device including a silicon substrate and a silicon device manufacturing method of manufacturing the silicon device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Silicon devices manufactured by processing a silicon substrate have been known. Since a silicon device can be manufactured through the use of the same process as a semiconductor device manufacturing process, minute patterns can be precisely formed. Such a silicon device has a minute structure, but there is a need for an increase in minuteness and a decrease in size.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By using a method of forming plural silicon devices on a silicon wafer and dividing the silicon wafer into individual silicon device chips when manufacturing a silicon device, small-sized silicon devices can be efficiently manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">JP-A-2005-349592 discloses a nozzle plate manufacturing method which can achieve a decrease in thickness of a nozzle plate formed of silicon while preventing the nozzle plate from cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, silicon devices divided into individual chips are often treated in a chip state. The silicon devices often come to the market in the chip state. On the other hand, in a silicon device having such a size as to be treated as a simple body, the decrease in size accompanies a decrease in strength, which is a phenomenon that it is difficult to avoid in material mechanics. Particularly, the corners of the external shape of a silicon device are parts which can easily break or crack. That is, there is a problem in that the possibility of damaging a silicon device increases due to the breaking or cracking by treating the silicon device in a chip state.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to solve at least a part of the problems described above, and the invention can be embodied as the following forms or application examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Application Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This application example of the invention is directed to a silicon device having a flat panel shape which is a polygon in a plan view, wherein at least one corner of the polygon includes two sides adjacent to each other out of plural of sides of the polygon and a corner curve portion connected to the two sides so as to connect the two sides.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the silicon device according to this application example, each corner includes two adjacent sides and the corner curve portion connected to the two sides. That is, the corner is rounded. In general, an angular corner can easily break or crack when it collides with another member or the like. By rounding the angular part of the corner, it is possible to suppress breaking or cracking of the corner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Application Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This application example of the invention is directed to a silicon device having a flat panel shape which is a polygon in a plan view, wherein at least one corner of the polygon includes two sides adjacent to each other out of a plurality of sides of the polygon and a connecting line portion connected to the two sides, and the angle of the silicon device at a connection point between one side and the corresponding connecting line portion is obtuse.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the silicon device according to this application example, each corner includes two adjacent sides and the connecting line portion connected to the two sides and the angle of the silicon device at the connection point between the side and the connecting line portion is obtuse. That is, the corner is, for example, chamfered. In general, an angular corner can easily break or crack when it collides with another member or the like. By chamfering the angular part of the corner, it is possible to suppress breaking or cracking of the corner.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Application Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the silicon device according to the above application example, it is preferred that at least one side includes a side-center portion and a side-end portion, the side-end portion is a depressed portion in which the silicon device is depressed with respect to the side-center portion in a plan view, and the side-end portion of the side is connected to the corner curve portion or the connecting line portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the silicon device according to this application example, the side-end portion is a depressed portion in which the silicon device is depressed with respect to the side-center portion in a plan view and the side-end portion is connected to the corner curve portion or the connecting line portion. By employing this shape, it is possible to suppress collision of the corner with another member.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the silicon devices are arranged, a gap corresponding to the step difference between the side-center portion and the side-end portion in a plan view is present between the corner and another silicon device. When processing the shape of the silicon devices partitioned and formed in the substrate, it is possible to suppress an influence of the corner on the corner of a silicon device adjacent to the silicon device in process due to the gap.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Application Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the silicon device according to the above application example, it is preferred that at least one side includes a central depressed portion, and the central depressed portion is a depressed portion which is formed at a position separated from the corner curve portion or the connecting line portion and in which the silicon device is depressed with respect to the other portion of the side in a plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the silicon device according to this application example, the central depressed portion in which the silicon device is depressed with respect to the other portion of the side in a plan view is formed at a position separated from the corner. When the silicon devices are arranged, a gap corresponding to the step difference between the central depressed portion and the other portion of the side in a plan view is present between the central depressed portion and a silicon device adjacent to the side. When processing the shape of the silicon devices partitioned and formed in the substrate, it is possible to suppress an influence of the corner on the central depressed portion of a silicon device adjacent to the silicon device in process due to the gap. By forming the central depressed portion in a part, which faces the corner of one silicon device out of two adjacent silicon devices, of the other silicon device, it is possible to suppress an influence on the other silicon device when processing the corner of one silicon device.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Application Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This application example of the invention is directed to a silicon device manufacturing method of manufacturing a silicon device having a flat panel shape which is a polygon in a plan view, including: forming corners of the polygon by forming through-holes in a device mother substrate in which a plurality of silicon devices are partitioned and formed; and dividing the device mother substrate into the silicon devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the silicon device manufacturing method according to this application example, the shape of the corner of the silicon device is formed by forming a through-hole in the device mother substrate in the forming of the corners. Since the corners are formed as the result of formation of linear sides when processing the shape of the silicon devices partitioned and formed in the device mother substrate, the shape of the corners is often angular. By forming the corners by forming through-holes, the planar shape of the corners can be set to any shape. For example, the corners may be rounded or chamfered.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Application Example 6</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the silicon device manufacturing method according to the above application example, it is preferred that at least one corner of the polygon of the respective silicon devices includes two sides adjacent to each other out of a plurality of sides of the polygon and a corner curve portion connected to the two sides so as to connect the two sides, and the corner curve portion is formed in the forming of the corners.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the silicon device manufacturing method according to this application example, each corner of the silicon device includes two adjacent sides and the corner curve portion connected to the two sides. That is, the corner is rounded. In general, an angular corner can easily break or crack when it collides with another member or the like. By rounding the angular part of the corner, it is possible to suppress breaking or cracking of the corner. In the forming of the corners of forming the corners by forming the through-holes, the planar shape of the corners can be set to any shape by forming the corners by forming through-holes.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The head mechanism unit <b>2</b> includes a head unit <b>21</b> having the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> and a head carriage <b>22</b> supporting the head unit <b>21</b>. By causing the head carriage <b>22</b> to move in the Y axis direction, the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> can be made to freely move in the Y axis direction. The liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> can be kept at the moved position.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> is made to move to an ejection position in the Y axis direction and is stopped at that position and a liquid is ejected as liquid droplets in synchronization with the movement of the work W in the X axis direction.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> includes a nozzle plate <b>25</b>. Two nozzle lines <b>24</b>A in which plural ejection nozzles <b>24</b> are arranged substantially linearly are formed in the nozzle plate <b>25</b>. By ejecting the functional liquid as liquid droplets from the ejection nozzles <b>24</b> and landing the liquid droplets to a drawing object located to face the ejection nozzles, the functional liquid is arranged at the corresponding positions.

Therefore, the liquid droplets of the functional liquid can be arranged at the semi nozzle pitch in the Y axis direction by the use of the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b>. In the state where the nozzle plate <b>25</b> is mounted on the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b>, the surface serving as the outer surface of the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> is referred to as a nozzle-formation surface <b>25</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref>, in the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b>, a pressure chamber plate <b>51</b> is stacked on the nozzle plate <b>25</b> and a vibration plate <b>52</b> is stacked on the pressure chamber plate <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A liquid reservoir <b>55</b> always filled with the functional liquid to be supplied to the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> is formed in the pressure chamber plate <b>51</b>. The liquid reservoir <b>55</b> is a space surrounded with the vibration plate <b>52</b>, the nozzle plate <b>25</b>, and the wall of the pressure chamber plate <b>51</b>. The functional liquid is supplied to the liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> from the functional liquid supply unit <b>4</b> and is supplied to the liquid reservoir <b>55</b> via the liquid supply hole <b>53</b> of the vibration plate <b>52</b>. A pressure chamber <b>58</b> partitioned by plural head partition walls <b>57</b> is formed in the pressure chamber plate <b>51</b>. The space surrounded with the vibration plate <b>52</b>, the nozzle plate <b>25</b>, and two head partition walls <b>57</b> is the pressure chamber <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The pressure chamber <b>58</b> is disposed to correspond to each ejection nozzle <b>24</b> and the number of pressure chambers <b>58</b> is equal to the number of ejection nozzles <b>24</b>.

The sets of the head partition wall <b>57</b>, the pressure chamber <b>58</b>, and the supply hole <b>56</b> corresponding to the nozzle line <b>24</b>A are arranged in a line.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An end of each piezoelectric element <b>59</b> is fixed to a part of the vibration plate <b>52</b> constituting the pressure chamber <b>58</b>. The other end of the piezoelectric element <b>59</b> is fixed to a base (not shown) supporting the overall liquid droplet ejecting head <b>20</b> with a fixing plate (not shown) interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The piezoelectric element <b>59</b> includes an active portion in which an electrode layer and a piezoelectric material are stacked. By applying a driving voltage to the electrode layer of the piezoelectric element <b>59</b>, the length of the active portion is reduced in the length direction (in the thickness direction of the vibration plate <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> or <b>2</b>C). By stopping the application of the driving voltage to the electrode layer, the active portion is returned to the original length.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">By applying the driving voltage to the electrode layer to reduce the length of the active portion of the piezoelectric element <b>59</b>, an attractive force directed to the opposite side of the pressure chamber <b>58</b> acts on the vibration plate <b>52</b> to which an end of the piezoelectric element <b>59</b> is fixed. Since the vibration plate <b>52</b> is attracted to the opposite side of the pressure chamber <b>58</b>, the vibration plate <b>52</b> is bent to the opposite side of the pressure chamber <b>58</b>. Accordingly, since the volume of the pressure chamber <b>58</b> increases, the functional liquid is supplied to the pressure chamber <b>58</b> from the liquid reservoir <b>55</b> via the supply hole <b>56</b>. When the application of the driving voltage to the electrode layer is stopped, the active portion is returned to the original length and thus the piezoelectric element <b>59</b> presses the vibration plate <b>52</b>. The vibration plate <b>52</b> is returned toward the pressure chamber <b>58</b> by the pressing. Accordingly, the volume of the pressure chamber <b>58</b> is rapidly returned to the original state. That is, since the increasing volume decreases, the functional liquid filled in the pressure chamber <b>58</b> is pressurized and the functional liquid is thus ejected as liquid droplets from the ejection nozzle <b>24</b> communicating with the corresponding pressure chamber <b>58</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In step S<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a modified layer is formed in the parts of the division line <b>38</b> and the division line <b>47</b>. A division modified layer is formed in the marginal portion <b>125</b>A and the like other than the nozzle plates <b>25</b> in the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The modified layer is formed by continuously forming modified areas by multi-photon absorption. The multi-photon absorption is caused by irradiating a processing object with a laser beam by the use of a laser processing machine and concentrating the laser beam on the part to be modified. By only applying a slight force, the processing object having the modified areas formed therein can be divided with the modified areas as start points.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In step S<b>10</b>, the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A is divided into chips of the individual nozzle plates <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The dividing step includes a tape carrier attaching step, an expansion step, and a separation step. The tape carrier attaching step is a step of attaching the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A having the modified layer formed therein to a flexible tape carrier. The expansion step is a step of dividing the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A attached to the tape carrier into the chips of the individual nozzle plates <b>25</b> by applying a two-dimensional tensile force to the tape carrier to two-dimensionally stretch the tape carrier. Since the flexible tape carrier can be stretched but the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A cannot be stretched, the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A is divided at the parts of the division line <b>38</b> and the division line <b>47</b> in which the modified layer is formed. The separation step is a step of separating the chips of the nozzle plate <b>25</b> from the tape carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The process of step S<b>10</b> is performed and then the process of manufacturing the nozzle plate <b>25</b> is ended.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Advantages of the exemplary embodiment will be described below. According to this exemplary embodiment, the following advantages can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">(1) Three corners of the long sides <b>27</b> and the short sides <b>28</b> of the nozzle plate <b>25</b> include the arc portion <b>29</b>. Since the corners have a circular arc shape, it is possible to suppress breaking or cracking of the corners when the corners collide with a hard body, compared with the case where the corners are angular.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">(2) One corner of the long side <b>27</b> and the short side <b>28</b> of the nozzle plate <b>25</b> includes the chamfered portion <b>31</b>. Since the corner has a chamfered portion <b>31</b>, the angle of the corner formed by the chamfered portion <b>31</b> and the long side <b>27</b> (the long-side end portion <b>274</b>) or the short side <b>28</b> (the short-side end portion <b>283</b>) is obtuse. Accordingly, compared with the case where the corner has an angle of 90, it is possible to suppress the breaking or cracking of the corners when the corners collide with a hard body.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">(3) In the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A, the positions of the nozzle plates <b>25</b> in the V axis direction in the line in which six nozzle plates are arranged in the V axis direction and the positions of the nozzle plates <b>25</b> in the line in the V axis direction in which five nozzle plates are arranged are different from each other substantially by a half of the length of each nozzle plate <b>25</b> in the V axis direction. When the positions of the nozzle plates <b>25</b> in the V axis direction are equal to each other, only four nozzle plates <b>25</b> can be arranged in the line of the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A in which five nozzle plates are arranged in the V axis direction. By setting the positions of the nozzle plates <b>25</b> in the V axis direction to be different from each other, it is possible to obtain the larger number of nozzle plates <b>25</b> from a single plate having the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">(4) The long-side end portion <b>273</b> and the long-side end portion <b>274</b> are depressed with respect to the long-side main portion <b>271</b>, and the short-side end portion <b>283</b> and the short-side end portion <b>284</b> are depressed with respect to the short-side main portion <b>281</b>. The planar shape of the corner through-hole <b>86</b> is a shape including the depression. Since the sectional area of the corner through-hole <b>86</b> increases in comparison with the case where the depression is not formed, it is possible to easily form the corner through-hole <b>86</b>. When the processing is performed, for example, up to the end of the nozzle plate <b>25</b> divided by the division line <b>475</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> in processing the positions of the division line <b>47</b> or the division line <b>38</b>, at least a gap corresponding to the step difference between the short-side end portion <b>283</b> and the short-side end portion <b>284</b> and the short-side main portion <b>281</b> is present with respect to the nozzle plate <b>25</b> divided by the division line <b>476</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the influence on the neighboring nozzle plates <b>25</b> when processing the division line <b>47</b> or the division line <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">(5) The corner through-hole <b>86</b> is first formed to divide the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A into the individual nozzle plates <b>25</b>. The sectional shape of the corner through-hole <b>86</b> can be easily set to any shape depending on the shape of the opening formed in the resist film. Accordingly, it is possible to easily form the arc portion <b>29</b> or the chamfered portion <b>31</b> of the corners.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">(6) The long side <b>27</b> includes the long-side depressed portion <b>275</b> which is depressed with respect to the long-side main portion <b>271</b>. Even when the processing of the division line <b>38</b> is performed, for example, up to the end of the nozzle plate <b>25</b> divided by the division line <b>387</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, at least a gap corresponding to the step difference between the long-side depressed portion <b>275</b> and the long-side main portion <b>271</b> is present with respect to the long side <b>27</b> of the neighboring nozzle plate <b>25</b> facing the division line <b>387</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the influence on the neighboring nozzle plates <b>25</b> deviated in position in the V axis direction when processing the division line <b>38</b> of the nozzle plate <b>25</b> deviated in position in the V axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">(7) The corner through-hole <b>86</b> is formed by forming the corner-hole penetrated portion <b>82</b> after the thinning step. The surface ground in the thinning step is the opposite surface of the surface in which the corner-hole depressed portion <b>72</b> is formed. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent particles from entering the corner-hole depressed portion <b>72</b> (the corner through-hole <b>86</b>) in the thinning step.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">(8) The corner through-hole <b>86</b> is formed along with the ejection nozzles <b>24</b> in the step of forming the ejection nozzle <b>24</b>. Accordingly, it is not necessary to separately perform the step of forming the corner through-hole <b>86</b> and thus to suppress the increase in the process time of forming the corner through-hole <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Since the corner through-hole <b>86</b> and the ejection nozzle <b>24</b> can be formed by the use of the common resist film <b>71</b>, it is possible to enhance the relative positional precision between the corner through-hole <b>86</b> and the ejection nozzle <b>24</b>, compared with the case where individual resist films are used to form the corner through-hole <b>86</b> and the ejection nozzle <b>24</b>. That is, it is possible to enhance the relative positional precision of the corner to the ejection nozzle <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">(9) Out of four corners of the nozzle plate <b>25</b>, three corners are formed by the arc portion <b>29</b> and one corner is formed by the chamfered portion <b>31</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to identify the posture of the nozzle plate <b>25</b> depending on the shapes of the corners.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">(10) The mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A is divided using the division line <b>38</b> and the division line <b>47</b> by forming the modified layer in the division line <b>38</b> and the division line <b>47</b> and performing the expansion step. By forming the modified layer using a laser processing machine, it is possible to start the processing at any position in the in-plane direction of the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A and to easily stop the processing at any position or to easily change the processing direction. Accordingly, even when the nozzle plates <b>25</b> in the mother nozzle plate <b>25</b>A are arranged without matching the ends of the nozzle plates <b>25</b> with each other, it is possible to easily form the modified layer in the division line <b>38</b> and the division line <b>47</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the above-mentioned exemplary embodiment, the long side <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the short side <b>28</b><i>b </i>are formed via the chamfered portion <b>31</b> by connecting the long-side end portion <b>274</b> of the long side <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the short-side end portion <b>283</b> of the short side <b>28</b><i>b </i>with the chamfered portion <b>31</b> corresponding to the connecting line portion.
