<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While sandbags of the type currently available in the art have many advantages, they also suffer from a number of infirmities. In particular, many sandbags are basically sacks which are open on one end, and which are tied or folded shut after they are filled. This may be accomplished, for example, by forming a knot in the fabric of the sandbag, by tying the bag shut with twine, or by simply folding the open end of the sand bag underneath the bag after it has been filled.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, it is challenging to create a secure closure for such sand bags in a time efficient manner using the aforementioned approaches. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that sand readily absorbs moisture during use and can thus exert considerable pressure on the closure. Consequently, it is common for sandbags to leak sand or to rupture along a seam, or for the closure to become undone during use. This is particularly problematic if the sandbags are intended for use as exercise devices.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It has now been found that the aforementioned problems may be overcome through the provision of a sandbag or other weighted article which comprises a fillable body having an interior volume, and having a collapsible or flexible inlet which is invertible and which can be extended into the interior of the body after a fill material has been added to the internal volume. Preferably, the inlet is repositionable from a first position in which it protrudes from the body, to a second position in which it extends into the interior of the body. This may be accomplished, for example, by inverting the inlet (that is, by turning the inlet inside out).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The interior volume of the weighted article is preferably filled with sand or another desired fill material while the inlet is in the first position (possibly with the use of a funnel), after which the inlet is moved to the second position. When the inlet is in the second position (and assuming that a sufficient amount of fill material has been added to the interior volume of the body), the weight of the fill material collapses the inlet and effectively seals it off, thereby securely sealing the fill material within the weighted article without the need for knots, twine, or other such accoutrements.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If it is desired at any time to remove some or all of the fill material from the weighted article, a funnel or a rigid tube of suitable diameter may be used to maintain the collapsible inlet in an open position while the desired amount of fill material is removed. Preferably, this procedure is conducted while the inlet is in the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The devices and methodologies disclosed herein may be further understood with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, which illustrate a first particular, non-limiting embodiment of a weighted article in accordance with the teachings herein. The weighted article in this particular embodiment is a sandbag having a generally ellipsoidal shape, although it will be appreciated that a wide variety of other weighted articles of various other shapes and dimensions, and which are filled with various other fill materials, may be produced in accordance with the teachings herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The weighted device <b>101</b> depicted comprises a body <b>103</b> which encloses an interior volume <b>113</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The interior volume <b>113</b> of the device is accessible by way of a collapsible inlet <b>105</b>. Preferably, as noted above, the inlet <b>105</b> is repositionable or movable from a first position in which it protrudes from the body <b>103</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) to a second position in which it extends into the interior of the body <b>103</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 14</figref>). The body <b>103</b> is preferably filled with sand or another desired fill material while the inlet <b>105</b> is in the first position. A funnel <b>121</b> may be used for this purpose, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. After the device is filled to the desired extent, the inlet <b>105</b> is moved to the second position, where the weight of the fill collapses the inlet <b>105</b>. This effectively seals off the interior volume <b>113</b> of the body <b>103</b>, thereby securely containing the fill material therein without the need for knots, twine, or other such accoutrements. If it is desired to remove some or all of the fill material from the body <b>103</b>, a funnel or a rigid tube of suitable diameter may be used to maintain the collapsible inlet <b>105</b> in an open position while the fill material is being removed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The collapsible inlet <b>105</b> may comprise various materials including, for example, nylon, rubber, various fabrics, or other suitable materials which are sufficiently deformable such that the pressure exerted by the fill material will effectively seal the inlet <b>105</b> off when the interior volume <b>113</b> is at least partially filled.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In use, a funnel, tube or other suitable device is inserted into the inlet <b>105</b>, preferably when the inlet <b>105</b> is in the first position (see above), and is utilized to introduce the fill material. After the interior space <b>113</b> has been filled to a suitable extent, the funnel is removed, and the inlet <b>105</b> is pushed into the interior of the body <b>103</b> (that is, the inlet <b>105</b> is moved to the second position). This may be accomplished, for example, through the use of a rod, a tube, the end of the funnel used to fill the device, or a finger. Preferably, the inlet is fully extended within the body when it is in the second position, though in some embodiments it may be preferable for the inlet to be only partially extended within the body or to be folded or otherwise placed in a convoluted orientation when it is in the second position. In the second position, the inlet <b>105</b> collapses under the weight of the fill material, thereby effectively sealing the interior space <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref> illustrate some of the many possible ways in which the devices disclosed herein may be utilized in an exercise regimen. As seen in these figures, the weighted articles <b>101</b> disclosed herein are particularly well suited for use in a variety of floor exercises aimed at strengthening the arms, legs, torso, and hands, while also improving balance and agility.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Because the devices described herein may be constructed in various sizes and weights, they may be used in many of the same exercises that conventional dumbbells, barbells and other such devices are commonly utilized in, in addition to a variety of exercises for which the foregoing devices are not suitable. In such applications, the deformability of these devices offers unique advantages. For example, because these devices can be made to conform to the user's hands, they provide a firm grip to the user while also fully engaging the muscles of the hands and fingers of the user during a workout. The degree of conformity may be adjusted within a certain range by adjusting the extent to which the device is filled, through selection of appropriate materials for the body of the device, and/or through the appropriate selection of fill materials. Typically, reducing the amount of fill will increase the conformity of the device within a certain range.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, because the exterior surface of these devices may comprise neoprene or other soft, elastomeric materials, incidental contact with these surfaces during a workout are unlikely to harm the user. This feature makes these devices especially suitable for use by children and the elderly. Moreover, this feature, in combination with the durable structures these devices may be fabricated in, enables a variety of exercises in which the devices may be thrown or caught. Such a use, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is typically not feasible with conventional weights or dumbbells.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>13</b>-<b>16</b> illustrate the details of a preferred embodiment of the stitching scheme which may be utilized in the weighted article <b>101</b>. As seen therein, in the particular embodiment depicted, the weighted article <b>101</b> comprises opposing walls of material which enclose an internal volume to which a desired fill material may be added. The opposing walls of material are preferably double-stitched together along a seam <b>117</b>. Preferably, the seam <b>117</b> is constructed so that it faces outward from the device, since this is found to improve the impact resistance of the device and minimizes the likelihood that the fabric will tear along the seam <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref>, a portion of capping material <b>131</b> is then sewn over the exposed seam <b>117</b>, preferably with cross-stitching. The capping material <b>131</b> is preferably rolled under along one edge as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to impart a rounded edge to the seam. The capping material <b>131</b> may be the same as, or different from, the material of the body of the device, and provides a smooth, more aesthetically pleasing edge to the device, while also imparting additional mechanical integrity to the seam <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the capping material <b>131</b> may be color-coded to indicate the weight of the device. TABLE 1 below provides one specific, non-limiting example of a possible color-coding scheme which may be used to indicate the weight of the device, although it will be appreciated that various other color schemes or patterns may be used to a similar end.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-15</figref> illustrate further features of the inlet <b>105</b> of the weighted device <b>101</b> and the preferred stitching which is used in conjunction with the inlet <b>105</b>. Various possible geometries for the inlet <b>105</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-26</figref>, along with some possible stitching schemes that may be employed in conjunction with these geometries. The geometries depicted show the inlet <b>105</b> as it appears in the second position (when it extends into the internal volume of the device <b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably, the inlets <b>105</b> utilized in the devices <b>101</b> described herein are formed from two identically or complementary shaped portions <b>141</b> of material which are stitched, glued or laminated together along first <b>143</b> and second <b>145</b> opposing edges, although one skilled in the art will appreciate that unitary constructions may also be employed for the inlet. More preferably, the two portions <b>141</b> of material are double stitched together along their adjoining edges <b>143</b>, <b>145</b>. It is preferred that the seam <b>147</b> formed in this manner is facing outward so that, when the inlet <b>105</b> is in the second position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), the opposing surfaces of the inlet <b>105</b> will tend to lie flush together, thus preventing the egress of fill material through the inlet <b>105</b>. By contrast, when the inlet <b>105</b> is inverted (as when it is in the first position in which it extends from the body <b>103</b> of the device <b>101</b>; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), the inverted seam <b>147</b> will cause the inlet <b>105</b> to pucker open slightly, thus facilitating the addition of fill to the device <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the proximal portion of each opposing wall of the inlet <b>105</b> is preferably double-stitched to the adjacent portion of the body material. This double stitching is preferably a continuation of the stitching used to adhere the opposing walls of the body <b>103</b> together, since such a construction minimizes the stress applied to the inlet <b>105</b> along the region of attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Preferably, the proximal portion of the inlet <b>105</b> is rounded to match the curvature of the seam <b>117</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-21</figref> and <b>23</b>-<b>26</b>, though in some embodiments, such as the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the proximal portion of the inlet <b>105</b> may be flat instead. Of course, it will be appreciated that the preferred geometry of the inlet <b>105</b> will be determined in part by the geometry of the body <b>103</b>. For example, if the body <b>103</b> is polyhedral in shape, then an inlet <b>105</b> having a flattened edge, such as the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, may be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is also preferred that the proximal portion of the inlet <b>105</b> is tapered or flared as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-21</figref> and <b>23</b>-<b>26</b>. This increases the surface area available for stitching, thus improving the integrity of the seam between the inlet and the body <b>103</b>. On the other hand, the narrower neck of such an inlet hinders the escape of fill from the interior volume of the body. In some embodiments, the distal portion of the inlet <b>105</b> may also be tapered or flared. Such an embodiment may be advantageous in some applications in that it facilitates the insertion of a tube or funnel into the inlet <b>105</b> when it is in the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-26</figref>, in some embodiments, the proximal portion of the inlet may be provided with an extra portion <b>151</b> of material which may be folded over prior to stitching the proximal portion of the inlet <b>105</b> to the adjacent portion of the body <b>103</b>. In some applications, such an approach may improve the durability of the portion of the seam <b>117</b> extending across the inlet <b>105</b>. Though not preferred, in some embodiments, this portion of the inlet <b>105</b> may be folded over the adjacent portion of the exterior of the body <b>103</b> prior to being sewn or otherwise attached in place.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the foregoing examples illustrate the production of one particular, non-limiting embodiment of a weighted article made in accordance with the teachings herein, it will be appreciated that various other types of weighted articles of various other geometric shapes and sizes may be made in accordance with the teachings herein. For example, in addition to being ellipsoidal, the weighted article may be essentially polyhedral (including, without limitation, tetrahedral, pentahedral or hexahedral), prismatic, torroidal, spherical, or irregular in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Similarly, while the foregoing example illustrates the production of a sandbag, it will be appreciated that various other weighted articles may be formed in accordance with the teachings herein. These include, for example, various types of anchors, exercise weights, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Moreover, while sand is a preferred fill material, it will be appreciated that various other fill materials may also be utilized in the devices described herein depending, in part, on the intended use of the device. For example, metals (including, but not limited to, iron and lead), metal shot, metal shavings, various viscous materials (including silica gel), water, pebbles, beans, seeds, gravel, charcoal, and various other liquids and granular materials (or combinations thereof) may be used as fill materials. In some embodiments, expandable foams may also be utilized. In certain embodiments, various gasses may even be used as fill materials. In other embodiments, various viscous or gelatinous materials may be used as fill materials including, but not limited to, silica gel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, while the devices and methodologies disclosed herein have been specifically illustrated and described with reference to the production of a weighted article (and in particular, a sandbag), it will be appreciated that the methodologies and devices described herein may be used more generally to create a self-sealing container of virtually any type. As specific, non-limiting examples, this approach may be used to create self-sealing sacks, packages or containers of grain, fertilizer, chemicals, ice, and various other commodities and products. As another specific example, this approach may be utilized in food packaging applications.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Various materials may be utilized in the construction of the devices described herein. These include, without limitation, various types of fabrics such as nylon and canvas, rubber, and various types of metals and fibers. Preferably, the body of the device is constructed from a resilient or elastomeric material, and more preferably, from a neoprene/nylon laminate. Most preferably, the body of the device comprises a thick layer of neoprene with a thinner layer of nylon laminated to each side. The use of such materials in combination with a proper fill allow the device to be gripped, which is an important aspect of strength training in many applications. In some embodiments, various materials may be incorporated into the devices described herein to impart anti-soiling, anti-staining or decorative properties, or to render the devices moisture-proof, water-proof, moisture resistant, or water-resistant.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments of the methodologies and devices described herein, after the article is filled with a suitable material, it may be permanently sealed. This may be accomplished, for example, by fusing the inlet under heat or pressure, by gluing the inlet closed, or by other suitable means known to the art.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The dimensions of the inlet may vary from one embodiment to another, and may depend in part on the overall size of the weighted article and the intended end use. Preferably, however, the inlet has sufficient dimensions such that the collapse of the inlet, as induced by the fill material, will effectively seal the fill material within the weighted article.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, the term &#x201c;panel&#x201d; may be interchangeable with the term &#x201c;wall&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;sheets of material&#x201d; may be interchangeable with the term &#x201c;shaped portions.&#x201d; It will be appreciated that this is in no way limiting but merely serves to broaden the base of descriptive terms used to illustrate the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The above description of the present invention is illustrative, and is not intended to be limiting. It will thus be appreciated that various additions, substitutions and modifications may be made to the above described embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be construed in reference to the appended claims.</p>
