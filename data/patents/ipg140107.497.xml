<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priorities from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-223338, filed on Sep. 28, 2009, the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-073258, filed on Mar. 26, 2010 and the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-073259, filed on Mar. 26, 2010; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a sanitary washing device, and more particularly to a sanitary washing device for washing with water the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and other parts of a user seated on a sit-down toilet stool.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a washing nozzle for private parts washing squirts wash water at the private parts, at least part of the washing nozzle is exposed (advanced) outside from the casing installed with prescribed functional components including the washing nozzle and a hot water tank. Hence, dirt and dirty water may be attached to the washing nozzle. In this context, there is a sanitary washing device which cleans away dirt and dirty water attached to the washing nozzle before and/or after private parts washing. This keeps the washing nozzle clean.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in a humid environment such as a toilet room, even after dirt and dirty water attached to the washing nozzle are cleaned away, bacteria may grow on the washing nozzle over time. More specifically, bacteria such as methylobacteria, called pink slime, and black mold grow on the bowl surface of the toilet stool. Such bacteria may be attached to the washing nozzle and multiplied thereon. Multiplication of bacteria results in an aggregation of bacteria and their secretion (slime, black stain), called biofilm. The biofilm is difficult to remove by the normal nozzle cleaning as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this context, Japanese Patent No. 3487447 proposes a sanitary washing device. In this sanitary washing device, an electrolytic cell is connected to the flow channel for supplying wash water. The electrolytic cell produces water containing hypochlorous acid. This water is regularly supplied to sterilize the washing nozzle so as to avoid biofilm formation. On the other hand, International Publication Pamphlet WO 95/32922 proposes an electrolyzing device and electrolyzing method for producing water containing hypochlorous acid. In the electrolyzing device and electrolyzing method described in WO 95/32922, running water containing chlorine ions flows into an electrolytic cell, and is electrolyzed after being heated. Hence, the generation efficiency of free chlorine can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, bacteria attached to the washing nozzle and bacteria in the flow channel to the washing nozzle are sterilized, and formation of biofilm is suppressed. However, for instance, some mold is not sterilized by the sterilization process of several seconds and may partly survive in the flow channel. Furthermore, after performing the sterilization process, if the user does not use the sanitary washing device for some time, such mold may multiply.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some devices, the sterilization process for sterilizing the washing nozzle with sterilizing water containing hypochlorous acid or silver ions is performed during a sequence of operations. For instance, in the case of no use for a long time during travels and the like, bacteria are intensively multiplied and may cause clogging in the drain pipe with a small diameter. In view of this situation, JP-A-2001-279745 discloses a human body washing device equipped with a silver ion electrolytic device. In this device, silver ion electrolytic water is passed and filled throughout the water channel on the downstream side of the silver ion electrolytic device. When the non-use state continues for a long time, the power of silver ion electrolytic water for suppressing multiplication of bacteria may be weakened. To prevent this, the human body washing device equipped with a silver ion electrolytic device described in JP-A-2001-279745 renews silver ion electrolytic water at regular intervals for passing water.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, Japanese Patent No. 3487447 discloses a private parts washing device. In this device, the private parts washing water is clean water or gray water. The nozzle cleaning water exhibits stronger disinfectant or sterilizing property than the private parts washing water. The nozzle cleaning device includes a nozzle cleaning water producing unit for changing the property of clean water or gray water to produce the nozzle cleaning water. In the private parts washing device described in Japanese Patent No. 3487447, liquid chemical is used to clean the nozzle device. Hence, as compared with the conventional cleaning by showering only the wash water, dirt can be effectively removed. Furthermore, the effect of sterilizing and removing bacteria is highly expected.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in the human body washing device equipped with a silver ion electrolytic device described in JP-A-2001-279745, the extent of the weakening of the power of silver ion electrolytic water for suppressing multiplication of bacteria due to prolonged non-use state generally depends on the amount of remaining bacteria and the like. In the device described in JP-A-2001-279745, when the human body sensing device senses a user, the silver ion electrolytic water is drained. Subsequently, with the power feed to the silver ion electrolytic device stopped, heated water is discharged from the water discharge port for human body washing. Then, the sterilizing power may decrease, and bacteria may multiply. Thus, the hot wash water may be contaminated with bacteria.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to a first aspect of the invention, a sanitary washing device includes: a nozzle including a water discharge port and configured to squirt water from the water discharge port to wash user's human private parts; a flow channel configured to supply the water to the water discharge port; a water supply device configured to supply the water; a sterilizing water producing device provided midway along the flow channel and being operable to produce sterilizing water; and a controller configured to perform control for retaining the sterilizing water produced by the sterilizing water producing device for a prescribed time in the flow channel, and then draining the sterilizing water out of the flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this sanitary washing device, the controller can cause the sterilizing water producing device to supply sterilizing water into the flow channel and can retain the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel. Furthermore, after retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel, the controller can drain the sterilizing water out of the flow channel. Thus, the sanitary washing device of this invention retains the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be reliably sterilized. Furthermore, the sanitary washing device of this invention drains the sterilizing water out of the flow channel after retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to a second aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the first aspect further includes a human body sensing device configured to sense utilization by the user, wherein the controller performs control for filling the flow channel on downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with the sterilizing water after the human body sensing device senses utilization by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this sanitary washing device, after the human body sensing device senses utilization by a user, the controller performs control for filling the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with sterilizing water. Thus, the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device is filled and sterilized with the sterilizing water. That is, when there is a possibility that a user utilizes the sanitary washing device, the controller can earlier supply the sterilizing water to the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device. Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized at an earlier stage after sensing the possibility of utilization of the sanitary washing device.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, in the sanitary washing device of this invention, the sterilizing water can be filled and retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel. Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized more reliably so that hygienic water can be squirted from the water discharge port of the nozzle. Furthermore, even when a male user urinates in the standing position, urine can be prevented from entering the flow channel from the water discharge port because the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device is filled with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to a third aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the second aspect further includes a heating device provided on upstream side of the sterilizing water producing device and being operable to heat water supplied to the sterilizing water producing device, wherein the controller performs hot water preparation for operating the water supply device and the heating device to drain the water from the water discharge port when the human body sensing device senses the user, and the controller controls a timing to activate the sterilizing water producing device after starting the hot water preparation based on a time period required to fill the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this sanitary washing device, when the human body sensing device senses a user, the controller performs hot water preparation for draining water from the water discharge port by controlling the operation of the water supply device and the heating device. At this time, the sterilizing water produced in the sterilizing water producing device can be supplied to the flow channel and retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel. Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized more reliably so that hygienic water can be squirted from the water discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, based on the time period required to fill the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with sterilizing water, the controller controls the timing to activate the sterilizing water producing device after starting the hot water preparation. Thus, the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device can be filled with a smaller amount of sterilizing water. Hence, wasteful drainage of the sterilizing water can be suppressed. Furthermore, for instance, in the case where the sterilizing water producing device includes electrodes, the energization time of the electrodes can be made shorter. Thus, the lifetime of the electrodes can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to a fourth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the third aspect, the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device during or after completing the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this sanitary washing device, the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device during or after completing the hot water preparation. Thus, there is no need to take into consideration the influence of variation in the temperature of water. This facilitates controlling the sterilizing water producing device and the heating device.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to a fifth aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the third aspect further includes a first temperature sensing device configured to sense temperature of the water heated by the heating device, wherein the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device when the temperature sensed by the first temperature sensing device reaches a preset temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this sanitary washing device, after the temperature sensed by the first temperature sensing device reaches a preset temperature, the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device. Thus, while the temperature sensed by the first temperature sensing device is stable, the controller activates the sterilizing water producing device. This determines the time period of the operation performed after the temperature sensed by the first temperature sensing device reaches the preset temperature. Furthermore, the timing to stop activating the sterilizing water producing device is determined. This can suppress wasteful production of sterilizing water in the sterilizing water producing device, wasteful passage of sterilizing water in the flow channel, and wasteful drainage of sterilizing water from the water discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to a sixth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the third aspect, the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device after lapse of a fixed time from the start of the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this sanitary washing device, after the lapse of a fixed time from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device. Thus, there is no need to take into consideration the influence of variation in the temperature sensed by the first temperature sensing device. This facilitates controlling the sterilizing water producing device and the heating device.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to a seventh aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the third aspect further includes a second temperature sensing device configured to sense temperature of water supplied to the heating device, wherein the controller sets a suitable temperature continuation time required to fill the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with the water heated by the heating device based on the temperature sensed by the second temperature sensing device, and starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device based on the suitable temperature continuation time so that a timing to stop activating the sterilizing water producing device coincides with or precedes a timing to complete the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this sanitary washing device, based on the temperature sensed by the second temperature sensing device, the controller sets a suitable temperature continuation time required to fill the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with the water heated by the heating device. Then, the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device based on the suitable temperature continuation time so that the timing to stop activating the sterilizing water producing device coincides with or precedes the timing to complete the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">There may be variation in the temperature sensed by the second temperature sensing device, or variation in the timing at which the temperature sensed by the first temperature sensing device reaches the preset temperature. Despite such variations, the controller can start to activate the sterilizing water producing device so that the timing to stop activating the sterilizing water producing device coincides with the timing to complete the hot water preparation, while ensuring the water passage time of the sterilizing water. Thus, even if the temperature sensed by the second temperature sensing device varies, it is possible to suppress wasteful production of sterilizing water in the sterilizing water producing device, wasteful passage of sterilizing water in the flow channel, and wasteful drainage of sterilizing water from the water discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to a eighth aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the third aspect further includes a second temperature sensing device configured to sense temperature of water supplied to the heating device, wherein the controller includes a memory device configured to store a suitable temperature continuation time required to fill the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with the water heated by the heating device based on the temperature sensed by the second temperature sensing device, and starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device by referring to a past one of the suitable temperature continuation time stored in the memory device so that a timing to stop activating the sterilizing water producing device coincides with or precedes a timing to complete the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this sanitary washing device, by referring to the past suitable temperature continuation time stored in the memory device, the controller starts to activate the sterilizing water producing device so that the timing to stop activating the sterilizing water producing device coincides with or precedes the timing to complete the hot water preparation. Thus, the controller can refer to the past suitable temperature continuation time. This can further suppress wasteful production of sterilizing water in the sterilizing water producing device, wasteful passage of sterilizing water in the flow channel, and wasteful drainage of sterilizing water from the water discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to a ninth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the second aspect, the human body sensing device is a room entry sensor operable to sense entry of a user into a toilet room.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this sanitary washing device, the human body sensing device is a room entry sensor operable to sense entry of a user into a toilet room. Thus, after the room entry sensor senses a user just entering the toilet room, the controller can supply sterilizing water to the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device. Hence, the sterilizing water can be retained for a longer time inside the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, even in the case where the controller performs hot water preparation after the user is seated on the toilet seat, the hot water preparation is not started yet before the user is seated on the toilet seat. Thus, before the user is seated on the toilet seat, the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device is filled with sterilizing water at lower temperature. The reproductive power of bacteria is weaker in the environment at lower temperature than in the environment at higher temperature. Hence, before the user is seated on the toilet seat, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to a tenth aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the second aspect further includes a toilet lid, wherein the human body sensing device is a toilet lid opening/closing sensing device operable to sense an opening motion of the toilet lid.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this sanitary washing device, a toilet lid opening/closing sensing device operable to sense the opening motion of the toilet lid is provided. The toilet lid opening/closing sensing device can sense utilization by a user. Thus, even without a room entry sensor operable to sense entry of a user into the toilet room, the controller can perform control for filling the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device with the sterilizing water after the toilet lid opening/closing sensing device senses the opening motion of the toilet lid. Hence, the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device is filled and sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to a eleventh aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the first aspect, the controller performs a cleaning step configured to clean the nozzle, and performs the control for retaining continuously subsequent to the cleaning step.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this sanitary washing device, the controller performs a cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle, and retains the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel continuously subsequent to the cleaning step. Thus, after performing the cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle, the inside of the flow channel can be elaborately sterilized. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to a twelfth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the first aspect, the controller performs the control for retaining after the user ceases to be sensed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this sanitary washing device, the controller performs the control for retaining after the user ceases to be sensed. Thus, the inside of the flow channel can be sterilized after the user performs bottom washing.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to a thirteenth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the twelfth aspect, the controller senses leaving of the user from a toilet seat.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this sanitary washing device, the controller performs the control for retaining after the user leaves the toilet seat. Thus, the sterilizing water can be retained for a longer time inside the flow channel. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to a fourteenth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the first aspect, the controller regularly performs the control for retaining and the control for draining.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this sanitary washing device, the controller regularly performs the control for retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel and the control for draining the sterilizing water out of the flow channel. Thus, the inside of the flow channel can be regularly sterilized. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized more reliably, and multiplication of bacteria inside the flow channel can be suppressed more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to a fifteenth aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the first aspect further includes a human body sensing device operable to sense the user, wherein the controller performs the control for retaining when the human body sensing device senses the user, and the controller performs the control for draining in response to receipt of a signal directing to perform washing of the human private parts.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this sanitary washing device, the controller performs the control for retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel when the human body sensing device senses a user. Furthermore, the controller performs the control for draining the sterilizing water out of the flow channel in response to receipt of a signal for washing the human private parts. Thus, the inside of the flow channel can be sterilized before the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Here, the time period for retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel is the time from when the controller retains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel until the controller receives the signal for washing the human private parts. That is, in this invention, the time period for retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel varies with the time period for e.g. the user's act of using the toilet. When the controller receives the signal for washing the human private parts, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel is replaced by newly supplied water and drained. Thus, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to a sixteenth aspect of the invention, the sanitary washing device of the first aspect further includes a nozzle cleaning device including a water discharge portion and configured to clean a surface of the nozzle with water discharged from the water discharge portion, wherein the controller discharges the sterilizing water from the water discharge portion, and then completes the hot water preparation by discharging the sterilizing water from only the water discharge port of the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this sanitary washing device, the controller discharges the sterilizing water from the water discharge portion, and then completes the hot water preparation by discharging the sterilizing water from only the water discharge port. Thus, the drainage water flowing out in cleaning the body of the nozzle does not enter the flow channel from the water discharge port. Furthermore, the flow channel on the downstream side of the sterilizing water producing device can be filled with the sterilizing water down to the water discharge port located at the end of the flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to a seventeenth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the first aspect, the sterilizing water producing device is an electrolytic cell.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this sanitary washing device, a solution containing hypochlorous acid superior in sterilizing power can be produced in the electrolytic cell. The sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell is not limited thereto. A solution containing metal ions such as silver ions or copper ions can be produced in the electrolytic cell. Alternatively, a solution containing electrolytic chlorine or ozone, and acid water or alkaline water can be produced. Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel can be sterilized more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to a eighteenth aspect of the invention, in the sanitary washing device of the seventeenth aspect, flow rate of water supplied to the electrolytic cell in producing the sterilizing water is lower than maximum flow rate of water flowing in the electrolytic cell.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this sanitary washing device, when the sterilizing water is produced in the electrolytic cell, the controller sets the flow rate of water supplied to the electrolytic cell to a flow rate lower than the maximum flow rate. This further increases the efficiency of producing the sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell. Hence, the concentration of the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel can be made higher.</p>

The solenoid valve <b>431</b> is an openable/closable solenoid valve, and regulates water supply based on commands from a controller <b>405</b> provided inside the casing <b>400</b>. Here, the flow channel <b>20</b> refers to the downstream side or secondary side of the solenoid valve <b>431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A hot water heater <b>441</b> is provided downstream of the solenoid valve <b>431</b>. The hot water heater <b>441</b> heats supplied water to hot water at a prescribed temperature. The temperature of the hot water can be configured by e.g. the user manipulating the manipulator <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">An electrolytic cell unit (sterilizing water producing device) <b>450</b> operable to produce sterilizing water is provided downstream of the hot water heater <b>441</b>. This electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A pressure modulator <b>460</b> is provided downstream of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. This pressure modulator <b>460</b> provides pulsation to the flow of water in the flow channel <b>20</b>. Thus, the pressure modulator <b>460</b> can provide pulsation to the water discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b> of the nozzle <b>473</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> for adjusting the water force (flow rate), and a flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> for opening/closing and switching water supply to the nozzle <b>473</b> and the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> are provided downstream of the pressure modulator <b>460</b>. Here, as in the example described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> may be provided as a single unit. Furthermore, a nozzle <b>473</b> is provided downstream of the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The nozzle <b>473</b> can be advanced into or retracted from the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b> under a driving force from a nozzle motor <b>476</b>. That is, the nozzle motor <b>476</b> can advance/retract the nozzle <b>473</b> based on commands from the controller <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> is supplied with electrical power from a power supply circuit <b>401</b>. The controller <b>405</b> can receive signals from a human body sensor (human body sensing device) <b>403</b>, a seating sensor <b>404</b>, and a manipulator <b>500</b>. Based on these signals, the controller <b>405</b> can control the operation of the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, hot water heater <b>441</b>, electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, pressure modulator <b>460</b>, flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, and nozzle motor <b>476</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the human body sensor <b>403</b> is embedded in a recess <b>409</b> formed in the upper surface of the casing <b>400</b>. The human body sensor <b>403</b> can sense a user (human body) approaching the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Furthermore, a transmissive window <b>310</b> is provided at the rear of the toilet lid <b>300</b>. Hence, in the closed state of the toilet lid <b>300</b>, the human body sensor <b>403</b> can sense the presence of a user through the transmissive window <b>310</b>. For instance, when the human body sensor <b>403</b> senses a user, the controller <b>405</b> can automatically open the toilet lid <b>300</b> based on the sensing result of the human body sensor <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The casing <b>400</b> may further include various mechanisms as appropriate, such as a &#x201c;warm air drying function&#x201d; for blowing warm air at and drying the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and other parts of the user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, a &#x201c;deodorizing unit&#x201d;, and a &#x201c;room heating unit&#x201d;. In this case, an exhaust port <b>407</b> for the deodorizing unit and a vent <b>408</b> for the room heating unit are provided as appropriate on the side surface of the casing <b>400</b>. However, in this invention, the sanitary washing functional part and other added functional parts are not necessarily needed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of the relevant configuration of the water channel system of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional schematic view illustrating an example of the electrolytic cell unit of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective schematic view illustrating an example of the nozzle unit of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, water supplied from the water supply source <b>10</b> is first guided to a metal branch <b>410</b>. The water guided to the metal branch <b>410</b> is distributed to a coupling hose <b>420</b>, and to a valve unit for flushing the toilet bowl, not shown. However, the toilet device equipped with the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment is not limited to the so-called &#x201c;water tap direct pressure type&#x201d;, but may be of the so-called &#x201c;low tank type&#x201d;. Hence, in the case where the toilet device is of the &#x201c;low tank type&#x201d;, the water guided to the metal branch <b>410</b> is guided to a low tank, not shown, instead of the valve unit for flushing the toilet bowl.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, the water supplied to the coupling hose <b>420</b> is guided to a valve unit (water supply device) <b>430</b>. The valve unit <b>430</b> includes a solenoid valve <b>431</b>, a pressure regulator valve <b>432</b>, an incoming water thermistor <b>433</b>, a safety valve <b>434</b>, and a drain plug <b>435</b>. The pressure regulator valve <b>432</b> serves to regulate the water supply pressure to within a prescribed pressure range when the water supply pressure is high. The incoming water thermistor <b>433</b> senses the temperature of water guided to a heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> and outputs the information of the water temperature to the controller <b>405</b>. The safety valve <b>434</b> is opened to drain water to the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b> when the pressure of the flow channel <b>20</b> is increased. Thus, for instance, even if failure in the pressure regulator valve <b>432</b> results in increasing the pressure of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the secondary (downstream) side thereof, the safety valve <b>434</b> can prevent water leakage inside the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>. The drain plug <b>435</b> is used when, for instance, the water in the flow channel <b>20</b> may be frozen. The drain plug <b>435</b> can drain the water in the flow channel <b>20</b>. The solenoid valve <b>431</b> is as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, the water supplied to the valve unit <b>430</b> is guided to a heat exchanger unit <b>440</b>. The heat exchanger unit (heating device) <b>440</b> includes a hot water heater <b>441</b> and a vacuum breaker <b>442</b>. The vacuum breaker <b>442</b> prevents backflow of dirty water from the nozzle <b>473</b> when, for instance, negative pressure occurs in the valve unit <b>430</b>. Furthermore, when the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained, the vacuum breaker <b>442</b> takes in air from outside to facilitate draining the flow channel <b>20</b> between the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> and the nozzle unit <b>470</b>. The water from the vacuum breaker <b>442</b> is drained to the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Next, the water supplied to the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> and heated to a prescribed temperature is guided to the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can produce sterilizing water. Here, the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> of this embodiment is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> includes therein an anode plate <b>451</b> and a cathode plate <b>452</b>. Under energization controlled by the controller <b>405</b>, the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can electrolyze tap water flowing therein. Here, the tap water contains chlorine ions. Such chlorine ions are contained as salt (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) in water sources (e.g., groundwater and water in dams and rivers). Thus, hypochlorous acid is produced by electrolysis of the chlorine ions. Consequently, the water electrolyzed in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> turns into a liquid containing hypochlorous acid.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Hypochlorous acid functions as a sterilizing ingredient. A solution containing hypochlorous acid, i.e., sterilizing water, can efficiently remove or decompose and sterilize dirt such as resulting from ammonia. Here, the term &#x201c;sterilizing water&#x201d; used herein refers to a solution containing a sterilizing ingredient such as hypochlorous acid more than tap water (also simply referred to as &#x201c;water&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Thus, the tap water supplied from the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> is electrolyzed in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and turns into a solution containing hypochlorous acid. The solution is guided to the nozzle unit <b>470</b> through the pressure modulator <b>460</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the nozzle unit <b>470</b> includes a flow rate switching valve <b>471</b>, a flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, and a nozzle <b>473</b>. By the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, sterilizing water supplied from the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> through the pressure modulator <b>460</b> can be guided to the water discharge port <b>474</b> of the nozzle <b>473</b> or to the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>). Here, the nozzle unit <b>470</b> is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the nozzle unit <b>470</b> of this embodiment includes a mounting stage <b>475</b> as a base stage, a nozzle <b>473</b> supported on the mounting stage <b>475</b>, and a nozzle motor <b>476</b> for moving the nozzle <b>473</b>. The nozzle <b>473</b> is provided so as to be slidable with respect to the mounting stage <b>475</b>, as indicated by arrow A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, by the driving force transmitted from the nozzle motor <b>476</b> through a transmission member <b>477</b> such as a belt. That is, the nozzle <b>473</b> can linearly move in its own axial direction (advancing/retracting direction). The nozzle <b>473</b> can reciprocably move from the casing <b>400</b> and the mounting stage <b>475</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Furthermore, the nozzle unit <b>470</b> of this embodiment includes a nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. The nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> is fixed to the mounting stage <b>475</b>. The nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> can sterilize or clean the outer peripheral surface (body) of the nozzle <b>473</b> by squirting sterilizing water or water from a water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided inside the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Specifically, when the controller <b>405</b> energizes the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is sterilized with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>. On the other hand, when the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is physically cleaned with water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">More specifically, when the nozzle <b>473</b> is housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region of the nozzle <b>473</b> is substantially housed in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Hence, the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> can sterilize or clean the water discharge port <b>474</b> region of the nozzle <b>473</b> in the housed state by squirting sterilizing water or water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided inside the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Furthermore, the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> can sterilize or clean not only the water discharge port <b>474</b> region but also the outer peripheral surface of the other region by squirting water or sterilizing water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> when the nozzle <b>473</b> is advanced/retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Furthermore, when the nozzle <b>473</b> is housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the nozzle <b>473</b> of this embodiment can sterilize or clean the water discharge port <b>474</b> region by squirting sterilizing water or water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> of the nozzle <b>473</b> itself. Furthermore, when the nozzle <b>473</b> is housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region of the nozzle <b>473</b> is substantially housed in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Hence, the sterilizing water or water discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b> of the nozzle <b>473</b> is reflected by the inner wall of the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> and splashed on the water discharge port <b>474</b> region. Thus, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region of the nozzle <b>473</b> is sterilized or cleaned also with the sterilizing water or water reflected by the inner wall of the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, the outer peripheral surface and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region of the nozzle <b>473</b> are sterilized with the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. However, for instance, some mold is not sterilized by the sterilization process of several seconds and may partly survive inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Furthermore, after performing the sterilization process, if the user does not use the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> for some time, such mold may multiply.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In contrast, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment can supply the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to the flow channel <b>20</b> and retain the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (sterilizing water retaining step). In this step, the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> can be closed to facilitate retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. In particular, because the flow channel extending to the water discharge port <b>474</b> of the nozzle <b>473</b> is prone to pollution, this embodiment is effective. Furthermore, when the sterilizing water is retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, injection of the sterilizing water into the flow channel <b>20</b> is preferably performed after completely replacing the water remaining inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Furthermore, after retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment can drain the sterilizing water out of the flow channel <b>20</b> (draining step).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, the sterilizing water is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably. This is one of the effective means in the case where the flow channel <b>20</b> is formed from an antibacterial metal with weaker sterilizing power. Furthermore, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, after retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water is drained out of the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed. In the following, these operations are described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a conceptual schematic diagram generally showing the operation and the state of the flow channel of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">First, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> to perform &#x201c;water discard&#x201d;. Thus, cold water in the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained for hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Next, the controller <b>405</b> energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water. Then, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging the sterilizing water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> to perform &#x201c;pre-cleaning&#x201d; of the water discharge port <b>474</b> region (timing t<b>101</b>-t<b>102</b>). At this time, because the sterilizing water is discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Here, the time period for performing the pre-cleaning with the sterilizing water is e.g. approximately 6-15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b>. Until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> is pressed by the user, the controller <b>405</b> waits on standby and keeps the temperature of water to be discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>102</b>-t<b>103</b>). At this time, because the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (sterilizing water retaining step). Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized before the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">This prescribed time refers to the time for which the sterilizing water is retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, i.e., the time from when the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d; is pressed by the user. Thus, this prescribed time varies with the time period for e.g. the user's act of using the toilet.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>103</b>), the controller <b>405</b> receives a signal for performing private parts washing. Then, the controller <b>405</b> first performs &#x201c;pre-cleaning&#x201d; with water (timing t<b>103</b>-t<b>104</b>). More specifically, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> to clean these water discharge ports <b>474</b>. At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the region around the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> is physically cleaned with water (including water reflected by the inner wall of the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>) discharged by the water discharge ports <b>474</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In other words, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b> by the newly supplied water. That is, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied water and drained (draining step). Here, the time period for performing the pre-cleaning with water is e.g. approximately 2-7 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Next, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> advances the nozzle <b>473</b> into the bowl <b>801</b>. Thus, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> (timing t<b>104</b>-t<b>105</b>). At this time again, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is physically cleaned with water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">At this time again, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> connected to the water discharge portion <b>479</b> is replaced by the newly supplied water and drained (draining step). Here, the time period for performing the body cleaning with water is e.g. approximately 2 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Next, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; to wash the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of the user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b> (timing t<b>105</b>-t<b>106</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Furthermore, the sterilizing water which was retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied water and drained at timing t<b>103</b>-t<b>105</b>. Hence, there is no case where the sterilizing water is squirted at the user's private parts.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;stop switch&#x201d;, not shown, on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>106</b>), the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting sterilizing water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> houses the nozzle <b>473</b> in the casing <b>400</b> (timing t<b>106</b>-t<b>107</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water, and performs &#x201c;body cleaning&#x201d; of the nozzle <b>473</b> with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> (timing t<b>106</b>-t<b>107</b>). Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the nozzle <b>473</b> are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Here, the time period for performing the body cleaning with the sterilizing water is e.g. approximately 2 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Next, with the nozzle <b>473</b> housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging sterilizing water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> to perform &#x201c;post-cleaning&#x201d; of these water discharge ports <b>474</b> (timing t<b>107</b>-t<b>108</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water, and performs the post-cleaning of the water discharge port <b>474</b> region with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>107</b>-t<b>108</b>). Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Here, the time period for performing the post-cleaning with the sterilizing water is e.g. approximately 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, and then closes the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, so that the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>108</b>-t<b>109</b>, sterilizing water retaining step). Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized. This prescribed time is e.g. approximately 60 minutes. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the sterilizing water is retained for a longer time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, after the lapse of the prescribed time, the controller <b>405</b> performs &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; (timing t<b>109</b>-t<b>110</b>, draining step). That is, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. The time period for performing this &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; is e.g. approximately 60 seconds. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, after the sterilizing water is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained, and the flow channel <b>20</b> is emptied. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The controller <b>405</b> of this embodiment performs the cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle <b>473</b>, and retains sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> continuously subsequent to the cleaning step. Here, the term &#x201c;cleaning step&#x201d; for cleaning the nozzle used herein refers to at least one of the pre-cleaning with the sterilizing water, the body cleaning with the sterilizing water, and the post-cleaning with the sterilizing water. Thus, after performing the cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle <b>473</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be elaborately sterilized. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably.</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0140">First, the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b> (timing t<b>1</b>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC (self-cleaning)&#x201d; to enable water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d;. The flow rate (volume of water) at this time is e.g. approximately 450 cc/min.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Next, when the switching of the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> is completed (timing t<b>2</b>), the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;water discard mode&#x201d;. Thus, cold water in the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained for preparation of hot water. Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d;, thereby completing the hot water preparation. Then, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water (timing t<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The flow rate (volume of water) at this time is e.g. approximately 280 cc/min. That is, the flow rate at this time is lower than the flow rate during the hot water preparation (e.g., approximately 450 cc/min) and the flow rate during the pre-cleaning, body cleaning, and post-cleaning with water (e.g., approximately 450 cc/min). In other words, the controller <b>405</b> can produce sterilizing water at a preset flow rate independent of the flow rate in performing private parts washing. In this example, the flow rate during the hot water preparation and the flow rate during the pre-cleaning, body cleaning, and post-cleaning with water are set to the maximum flow rate. Thus, the controller <b>405</b> makes the flow rate of water supplied to the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> lower than the maximum flow rate. Hence, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be made higher.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Furthermore, at this time, the controller <b>405</b> changes the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b> from the &#x201c;water discard mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>3</b>). The temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> at this time, i.e., the preset temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> in the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d;, is equal to or higher than the maximum temperature of the preset temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> in performing private parts washing, i.e., the preset temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> in the &#x201c;pre-cleaning mode, main washing mode, post-cleaning mode&#x201d;. In other words, the controller <b>405</b> can produce sterilizing water at a preset temperature independent of the temperature in performing private parts washing.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Thus, the controller <b>405</b> sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; so that the temperature is set equal to or higher than the maximum temperature of water supplied from the hot water heater <b>441</b> in performing private parts washing. Hence, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be made higher. Furthermore, because the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water can be made higher by setting the temperature equal to or higher than the maximum temperature in performing private parts washing, the controller <b>405</b> can suppress the decrease of the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water, and the sterilizing effect of the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be maintained for a longer time. Thus, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">At this time, the controller <b>405</b> has switched the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d;. Hence, as in the case of &#x201c;SC&#x201d;, water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d; is enabled. Furthermore, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. Hence, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Next, the controller <b>405</b> changes the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b> from the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;keep-warm control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>4</b>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, and stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>5</b>). Here, it is because of the so-called &#x201c;after-boiling prevention&#x201d; that the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> after changing the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b>. That is, this is because the hot water heater <b>441</b> generates residual heat even after its setting is changed from the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;keep-warm control mode&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;closed&#x201d; (timing t<b>6</b>). Then, until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> is pressed by the user, the controller <b>405</b> waits on standby and keeps the temperature of water to be discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>6</b>-t<b>7</b>). At this time, because the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (sterilizing water retaining step). Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized before the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>7</b>), the controller <b>405</b> receives a signal for performing private parts washing. Then, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;closed&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC&#x201d;. Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;pre-cleaning mode, main washing mode, post-cleaning mode&#x201d;. At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region is cleaned with water discharged by the water discharge ports <b>474</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In other words, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b> by the newly supplied water. That is, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied water and drained (draining step).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;bypass <b>2</b>&#x201d; so that water can be squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> (timing t<b>8</b>). Next, the controller <b>405</b> advances the nozzle <b>473</b> housed in the casing <b>400</b> to the position of &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; (timing t<b>9</b>-t<b>10</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>. Furthermore, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> connected to the water discharge portion <b>479</b> is replaced by the newly supplied water and drained (draining step).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bypass <b>2</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;bottom water force <b>5</b>&#x201d; (timing t<b>10</b>-t<b>11</b>) and performs main washing (bottom washing) (timing t<b>11</b>-t<b>12</b>). Here, for instance, if the user changes the setting of the water force in &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; from &#x201c;water force <b>5</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; by the manipulator <b>500</b>, then the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bottom water force <b>5</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;bottom water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; (timing t<b>12</b>-t<b>13</b>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> continues main washing at &#x201c;water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; (timing t<b>13</b>-t<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In this main washing, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Furthermore, the sterilizing water which was retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied water and drained at timing t<b>7</b>-t<b>10</b>. Hence, there is no case where the sterilizing water is squirted at the user's private parts.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Next, when the user pushes a &#x201c;stop switch&#x201d;, not shown, on the manipulator <b>500</b>, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bottom water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;bypass <b>2</b>&#x201d; so that water can be squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> (timing t<b>14</b>). Next, the controller <b>405</b> houses the nozzle <b>473</b> advanced to the position of &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; in the casing <b>400</b> (timing t<b>15</b>-t<b>16</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Next, with the nozzle <b>473</b> housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bypass <b>2</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;Sc&#x201d;. Thus, post-cleaning is performed by discharging water from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d; (timing t<b>16</b>-t<b>17</b>). At this time again, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, and does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Hence, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with water discharged by the water discharge ports <b>474</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;origin&#x201d; (timing t<b>18</b>). Next, the user performs &#x201c;bottom drying&#x201d; as appropriate and leaves the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Then, after the lapse of a prescribed time (here, e.g., approximately 5 seconds), the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d; to enable water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d; (timing t<b>19</b>). Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;pre-cleaning mode, main washing mode, post-cleaning mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>19</b>). Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and starts to produce sterilizing water (timing t<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Thus, the post-cleaning of the nozzle <b>473</b> is performed with the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. That is, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. Hence, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The flow rate (volume of water) at this time is e.g. approximately 280 cc/min. Thus, as described above, by decreasing the flow rate of water supplied to the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, the controller <b>405</b> can increase the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Next, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;antifreeze control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>21</b>). Subsequently, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, so that the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>22</b>-t<b>25</b>, sterilizing water retaining step). Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The time period for performing this sterilizing water retaining step is e.g. approximately 60 minutes. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the sterilizing water is retained for a longer time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably. Here, the controller <b>405</b> may energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply sterilizing water (timing t<b>23</b>-t<b>24</b>) while retaining sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>22</b>-t<b>25</b>). Thus, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the controller <b>405</b> can control the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply new sterilizing water, thereby suppressing the decrease of sterilizing power.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Next, after the lapse of the prescribed time (e.g., approximately 60 minutes), the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;closed&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d;, and moves the nozzle <b>473</b> to the position of &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; (timing t<b>25</b>). Thus, the &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; of the flow channel <b>20</b> is performed (timing t<b>25</b>-t<b>28</b>, draining step). That is, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, after the sterilizing water is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained, and the flow channel <b>20</b> is emptied. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Here, while performing drainage of the flow channel <b>20</b>, the controller <b>405</b> can accelerate the drainage by activating the pressure modulator <b>460</b> (timing t<b>26</b>-t<b>27</b>). More specifically, depending on the installation position of the flow channel <b>20</b>, the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b>, and the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> may not be completely drained simply by the height difference between their installation positions. In addition, depending on the internal structure of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and the distance between the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> provided inside the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> may not be completely drained due to the resistance and surface tension of water inside the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. If sterilizing water is not drained from the flow channel <b>20</b> but remains therein, the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, and the sterilizing water may act as a nutrient source for bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In contrast, while performing drainage of the flow channel <b>20</b>, the controller <b>405</b> can actively drain the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> by activating the pressure modulator <b>460</b>. This can suppress residual presence of sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, and more reliably prevent the sterilizing water from acting as a nutrient source for bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Here, the pressure modulator <b>460</b> of this embodiment is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional schematic view schematically showing the internal structure of the pressure modulator of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The pressure modulator <b>460</b> can provide pulsation to the flow of water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Here, the term &#x201c;pulsation&#x201d; used herein refers to pressure variation caused by the pressure modulator <b>460</b>. Thus, the pressure modulator <b>460</b> is a device for varying the pressure of water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the pressure modulator <b>460</b> includes a cylinder <b>461</b> connected to the flow channel <b>20</b>, a plunger <b>462</b> reciprocably provided inside the cylinder <b>461</b>, a check valve <b>463</b> provided inside the plunger <b>462</b>, and a pulsation generating coil <b>464</b> for reciprocating the plunger <b>462</b> under a controlled excitation voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The check valve is disposed so that the pressure of water on the downstream side of the pressure modulator <b>460</b> increases when the position of the plunger <b>462</b> is changed to the nozzle <b>473</b> side (downstream side), and that the pressure of water on the downstream side of the pressure modulator <b>460</b> decreases when the position of the plunger <b>462</b> is changed to the side opposite to the nozzle <b>473</b> (upstream side). In other words, the pressure of water on the upstream side of the pressure modulator <b>460</b> decreases when the position of the plunger <b>462</b> is changed to the nozzle <b>473</b> side (downstream side). The pressure of water on the upstream side of the pressure modulator <b>460</b> increases when the position of the plunger <b>462</b> is changed to the side opposite to the nozzle (upstream side).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The plunger <b>462</b> is moved to the upstream or downstream side by controlling the excitation of the pulsation generating coil <b>464</b>. That is, to add pulsation to the water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (to vary the pressure of the water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>), the plunger <b>462</b> is reciprocated in the axial direction (upstream/downstream direction) of the cylinder <b>461</b> by controlling the excitation voltage applied to the pulsation generating coil <b>464</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Here, by excitation of the pulsation generating coil <b>464</b>, the plunger <b>462</b> moves from the original position (plunger original position) as shown to the downstream side <b>465</b>. Then, when the excitation of the coil is extinguished, the plunger <b>462</b> returns to the original position by the biasing force of a return spring <b>466</b>. Here, a buffer spring <b>467</b> buffers the return motion of the plunger <b>462</b>. The plunger <b>462</b> includes therein a duckbill check valve <b>463</b> to prevent backflow to the upstream side.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Hence, when the plunger <b>462</b> moves from the plunger original position to the downstream side, the plunger <b>462</b> can pressurize water in the cylinder <b>461</b> to drive the water to the downstream flow channel <b>20</b>. In other words, when the plunger <b>462</b> moves from the plunger original position to the downstream side, the plunger <b>462</b> can decompress water in the upstream flow channel <b>20</b> to suck the water into the cylinder <b>461</b>. Here, because the plunger original position and the position after the motion to the downstream side are always the same, the amount of wash water fed to the downstream flow channel <b>20</b> in response to the motion of the plunger <b>462</b> is constant.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Subsequently, at the time of return to the original position, wash water flows into the cylinder <b>461</b> through the check valve <b>463</b>. Thus, at the next time when the plunger <b>462</b> moves to the downstream side, a constant amount of wash water is newly fed to the downstream flow channel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Thus, when the plunger <b>462</b> moves from the plunger original position to the downstream side, the plunger <b>462</b> can decompress water in the upstream flow channel <b>20</b> to suck the water into the cylinder <b>461</b>. Hence, the pressure modulator <b>460</b> can suck the water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the upstream side of the pressure modulator <b>460</b> while providing pulsation to the flow of water in the flow channel <b>20</b>. Consequently, by controlling the pressure modulator <b>460</b>, the controller <b>405</b> can actively drain the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> not only on the downstream side of the pressure modulator <b>460</b> but also on the upstream side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Next, returning to the description of the timing chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after the controller <b>405</b> performs drainage of the flow channel <b>20</b>, the controller <b>405</b> enters the standby state (timing t<b>28</b>-t<b>29</b>). Subsequently, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d; to enable water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d; (timing t<b>29</b>). Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>29</b>). Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and starts to produce sterilizing water (timing t<b>29</b>). That is, here, as described above with reference to timing t<b>19</b>-t<b>22</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water (timing t<b>29</b>-t<b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Next, as in the operation described above with reference to timing t<b>22</b>-t<b>25</b>, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, so that the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>30</b>-t<b>31</b>, sterilizing water retaining step). Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be regularly sterilized. Then, as in the operation described above with reference to timing t<b>25</b>-t<b>28</b>, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>31</b>-t<b>32</b>, draining step). Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably, and multiplication of bacteria inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be suppressed more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Here, with regard to the triggers for performing regular sterilization and drainage of the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>29</b>-t<b>32</b>), for instance, the controller <b>405</b> can perform regular sterilization and drainage at times appropriately set by a timer. The times of the timer may be preset during manufacturing or before shipment of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, or may be configured by the user as desired. Alternatively, the controller <b>405</b> can perform regular sterilization and drainage during night hours when the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Alternatively, the controller <b>405</b> may store the frequency of usage of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> by the user, and learn the hours having low usage frequency. Thus, the controller <b>405</b> can perform regular sterilization and drainage during the hours having low frequency of usage by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Next, the sterilizing effect for various bacteria is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> are a graph and a data table illustrating an example experimental result on the sterilizing effect for <i>Escherichia coli. </i></p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> are a graph and a data table illustrating an example experimental result on the sterilizing effect for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </i></p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> are a graph and a data table illustrating an example experimental result on the sterilizing effect for <i>Staphylococcus aureus. </i></p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> are a graph and a data table illustrating an example experimental result on the sterilizing effect for <i>Methylobacterium extorquens. </i></p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Using electrolytic water with relatively low concentration, the inventors conducted experiments for studying the sterilizing effect for bacteria detected at relatively high frequency in the damp environment such as kitchens and bathrooms.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">First, the condition for producing the electrolytic water is described. The inventors first appropriately eliminated free residual chlorine from clean water. Then, the inventors passed the clean water in an electrolytic cell, and appropriately adjusted the electrolytic voltage to produce electrolytic water with the concentration of free residual chlorine being 0.3-1.0 mg/L. Here, the electrode used in this electrolysis is an iridium-based electrode (Pt/IrO<sub>2</sub>) suitable for electrolysis of domestic water and superior in durability.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Furthermore, as microorganisms isolated at relatively high frequency from the damp environment, the inventors selected <i>Escherichia coli </i>(NBRC 3972), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>(IFO 13736), <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(NBRC 12732), and <i>Methylobacterium extorquens </i>(IFO 15687).</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Next, the method for the sterilization test is described. First, the inventors added the test bacterial suspension (approximately 10<sup>7 </sup>CFU (colony forming units)/mL) to 100 mL of the electrolytic water produced under the aforementioned producing condition, and left it to stand for approximately one hour. Here, the inventors separated 1 mL of the electrolytic water after the lapse of 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes, and 1 hour each from the addition of the test bacterial suspension to the electrolytic water. Then, the inventors added the separated electrolytic water (1 mL) to 1% sodium thiosulfate-containing saline solution (9 mL), thereby deactivating the sterilizing efficacy of the electrolytic water.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Next, the inventors used the agar plate dilution method to measure the number of bacteria surviving in the electrolytic water with the sterilizing efficacy deactivated. Here, with regard to <i>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, bacteria were cultured for 24 hours on the standard agar culture medium under the environment of 35&#xb0; C. On the other hand, with regard to <i>Methylobacterium extorquens</i>, bacteria were cultured for seven days on the R2A culture medium under the environment of 27&#xb0; C. The measurement results are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 12B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In the graphs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>10</b>A, <b>11</b>A, and <b>12</b>A, the horizontal axis represents the elapsed time (seconds) from the addition of the test bacterial suspension to the electrolytic water, and the vertical axis represents the number of surviving bacteria (CFU/mL). In the data tables shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B</figref>, <b>10</b>B, <b>11</b>B, and <b>12</b>B, examples of actual measurement values are illustrated for the number of surviving bacteria (CFU/mL) corresponding to the concentration (mg/L) of free residual chlorine and the elapsed time (seconds) from the addition of the test bacterial suspension to the electrolytic water.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">From these results, with regard to <i>Escherichia coli</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, at a concentration of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 5 seconds. At a concentration of 0.3 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">With regard to <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, at a concentration of 1.0 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 5 seconds. At a concentration of 0.5 and 0.3 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">With regard to <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, at a concentration of 1.0 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 30 seconds. At a concentration of 0.5 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 1 minute. At a concentration of 0.3 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">With regard to <i>Methylobacterium extorquens</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, at a concentration of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 30 seconds. At a concentration of 0.3 mg/L, bacteria of 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL were not detected after 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Hence, it is found that for microorganisms detected at relatively high frequency from the damp environment, a sterilizing effect in a shorter time is achieved in electrolytic water with relatively low concentration (the concentration of free residual chlorine is 0.3-1.0 mg/L). Thus, even if bacteria survive inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably by retaining the sterilizing water for e.g. approximately 60 minutes inside the flow channel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">As described above, according to this embodiment, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can supply the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to the flow channel <b>20</b> and retain the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (sterilizing water retaining step). Furthermore, after retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can drain the sterilizing water out of the flow channel <b>20</b> (draining step). Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, the sterilizing water is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably. Furthermore, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, after retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water is drained out of the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Next, another embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a block diagram showing the relevant configuration of a sanitary washing device according to another embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the relevant configuration of the water channel system and the electrical system is shown together. The toilet device equipped with the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment is similar to the toilet device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment includes a flow channel <b>20</b> for guiding water supplied from a water supply source <b>10</b> such as a water tap or a flush tank to the water discharge port <b>474</b> of the nozzle <b>473</b>. A solenoid valve <b>431</b> is provided on the upstream side of the flow channel <b>20</b>. The solenoid valve <b>431</b> is an openable/closable solenoid valve, and regulates water supply based on commands from a controller <b>405</b> provided inside the casing <b>400</b>. The controller <b>405</b> includes a memory (storage device) <b>405</b><i>a</i>. The memory <b>405</b><i>a </i>is described later in detail. Here, the flow channel <b>20</b> refers to the downstream side or secondary side of the solenoid valve <b>431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">A hot water heater <b>441</b> is provided downstream of the solenoid valve <b>431</b>. The hot water heater <b>441</b> heats supplied water to hot water at a prescribed temperature. On the upstream side of the hot water heater <b>441</b>, an incoming water thermistor (second temperature sensing device) <b>433</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) is provided. On the downstream side of the hot water heater <b>441</b>, a hot water thermistor (first temperature sensing device) <b>443</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) is provided. The temperature of the hot water can be configured by e.g. the user manipulating the manipulator <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">An electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> operable to produce sterilizing water is provided downstream of the hot water heater <b>441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">A flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> for adjusting the water force (flow rate), and a flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> for opening/closing and switching water supply to the nozzle <b>473</b> and the nozzle cleaning chamber (nozzle cleaning device) <b>478</b> are provided downstream of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Here, as in the example described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> may be provided as a single unit. Furthermore, a nozzle <b>473</b> is provided downstream of the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>. The rest of the relevant configuration of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment is similar to the relevant configuration of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of the relevant configuration of the water channel system of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The example of the electrolytic cell unit and the nozzle unit of this embodiment is similar to the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the nozzle unit <b>470</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The relevant configuration from the metal branch <b>410</b> to the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> is similar to the relevant configuration from the metal branch <b>410</b> to the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Next, the water supplied to the valve unit <b>430</b> is guided to the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b>. The heat exchanger unit (heating device) <b>440</b> includes a hot water heater <b>441</b>, a vacuum breaker <b>442</b>, and a hot water thermistor <b>443</b>. The vacuum breaker <b>442</b> prevents backflow of dirty water from the nozzle <b>473</b> when, for instance, negative pressure occurs in the valve unit <b>430</b>. Furthermore, when the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained, the vacuum breaker <b>442</b> takes in air from outside to facilitate draining the flow channel <b>20</b> between the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> and the nozzle unit <b>470</b>. The water from the vacuum breaker <b>442</b> is drained to the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The hot water thermistor <b>443</b> senses the temperature of water heated by the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and outputs the information of the water temperature to the controller <b>405</b>. The hot water thermistor <b>443</b> can be e.g. a sheath heater or a ceramic heater. Here, the water supplied to the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> is heated to a prescribed temperature by the hot water heater <b>441</b> under the energization control of the controller <b>405</b>. The temperature of the incoming water to the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> is sensed by the incoming water thermistor <b>433</b>. The temperature of the heated hot water is sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b>. The controller <b>405</b> retrieves the information of these temperatures, and performs the energization control for the hot water heater <b>441</b> by combination of feedforward control and feedback control based on this information.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Next, the water supplied to the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> and heated to a prescribed temperature is guided to the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can produce sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, after the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> performs hot water preparation for opening the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, activating the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and draining water from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. Furthermore, based on the time period required to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with sterilizing water, the controller <b>405</b> controls the timing to activate the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, i.e., the timing to energize the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b>, after starting the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be filled with a smaller amount of sterilizing water. Hence, wasteful drainage of the sterilizing water can be suppressed. Furthermore, because the energization time of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be made shorter, the lifetime of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be increased. Furthermore, because the energization time of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be made shorter, generation of carbonates such as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, called scale, can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">This is described in more detail. Electrolysis of tap water generates calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. The generated calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide turn to carbonates, called scale, by reaction with carbon dioxide in the water. Then, the generated scale is attached to the surface of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Thus, passivation of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> may occur partly or entirely. This may decrease the production efficiency of hypochlorous acid.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In contrast, in this embodiment, the energization time of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be made shorter. Thus, generation of scale is suppressed. This can suppress passivation of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b>, and the decrease of the production efficiency of hypochlorous acid. In the following, these operations are described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15C</figref> are conceptual schematic diagrams illustrating operations of the hot water preparation of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">First, the operation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">When the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> starts hot water preparation for opening the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, activating the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and draining water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>211</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Hence, clean water flows in the flow channel <b>20</b> and is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. The operation of the hot water preparation is the operation of draining the water in the flow channel <b>20</b> from the water discharge port <b>474</b> and replacing the water in the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> by the water heated in the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b>. Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> can be warmed. Hence, in washing the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and other parts of a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, cold water can be prevented from being squirted at the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and other parts of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> senses the temperature of water heated by the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and outputs the information of the water temperature to the controller <b>405</b>. Furthermore, the user can set the hot water temperature by manipulating the manipulator <b>500</b>. Then, the controller <b>405</b> can sense (sense suitable temperature) that the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> has reached a preset temperature (suitable temperature) (timing t<b>212</b>). That is, from when the controller <b>405</b> starts the hot water preparation until the controller <b>405</b> senses the suitable temperature, the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> increases (timing t<b>211</b>-t<b>212</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Next, after sensing the suitable temperature, based on the time period required to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with sterilizing water, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>213</b>). This timing is at e.g. approximately 9 seconds after starting the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Next, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to complete the hot water preparation (timing t<b>214</b>). The timing at which the controller <b>405</b> completes the hot water preparation is e.g. the timing when a prescribed time has elapsed after the controller <b>405</b> senses the suitable temperature. Alternatively, this timing is set by calculating the time period of the temperature increase to the suitable temperature based on at least one of the temperature sensed by the incoming water thermistor <b>433</b>, the output of the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and the flow rate in the flow channel <b>20</b>. This timing is e.g. approximately 12 seconds after starting the hot water preparation. Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled with the sterilizing water produced by the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. The timing at which the controller <b>405</b> completes the hot water preparation is described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">In the operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the controller <b>405</b> energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> after sensing the suitable temperature, i.e., while the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> is stable. Thus, the time period of the operation after the controller <b>405</b> sensing the suitable temperature is determined. Furthermore, the timing to stop energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is determined. This can suppress wasteful production of sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, wasteful passage of sterilizing water into the flow channel <b>20</b>, and wasteful drainage of sterilizing water from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Next, the operation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The operation at timing t<b>221</b>-t<b>222</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is similar to the operation at timing t<b>211</b>-t<b>212</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. Next, the controller <b>405</b> completes the hot water preparation (timing t<b>223</b>). The timing at which the controller <b>405</b> completes the hot water preparation is similar to the timing described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Next, after completing the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>223</b>). In the operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> at 12 seconds after starting the hot water preparation. However, the embodiment is not limited thereto. For instance, if the controller <b>405</b> has completed the hot water preparation at 11 seconds after starting the hot water preparation, then the controller <b>405</b> may start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> at that timing. Next, based on the time period required to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with sterilizing water, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>224</b>). Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled with the sterilizing water produced by the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In the operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the controller <b>405</b> energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> after completing the hot water preparation. Thus, there is no need to take into consideration the influence of variation in the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b>. This facilitates controlling the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the hot water heater <b>441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Next, the operation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> is described.</p>

Next, after the lapse of a fixed time (7 seconds in the operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>) from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> forcibly starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>233</b>). Next, the controller <b>405</b> completes the hot water preparation (timing t<b>234</b>). Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled with the sterilizing water produced by the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. The timing at which the controller <b>405</b> completes the hot water preparation is similar to the timing described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0225" num="0224"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a conceptual schematic diagram illustrating an alternative operation of the hot water preparation of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The operation at timing t<b>241</b>-t<b>242</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is similar to the operation at timing t<b>211</b>-t<b>212</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. Next, after sensing the suitable temperature, based on the time period required to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with sterilizing water, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>243</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Next, if the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> is lower than the preset temperature, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>244</b>).

Next, similar operations are repeated when the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> is lower than the preset temperature and reaches the preset temperature (timings t<b>246</b>, t<b>247</b>, t<b>248</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Next, if the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> reaches the preset temperature, then based on the time period required to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with sterilizing water, the controller <b>405</b> restarts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>249</b>). Next, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to complete the hot water preparation (timing t<b>250</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Thus, even if the so-called &#x201c;hunting&#x201d; occurs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the controller <b>405</b> can ensure the time period required to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with sterilizing water. That is, the controller <b>405</b> ensures a cumulative energization time (e.g., a time longer than 3 seconds) longer than the cumulative energization time (e.g., 3 seconds) of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> in the case of no hunting. Thus, even if hunting occurs, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled with the sterilizing water produced by the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a conceptual schematic diagram generally showing the operation and the state of the flow channel of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The state of the flow channel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the state inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">In the following description, it is illustratively assumed that the nozzle <b>473</b> includes a plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">First, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> starts hot water preparation for opening the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, activating the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and draining water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>261</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Hence, clean water flows in the flow channel <b>20</b> and is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Next, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>262</b>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging the sterilizing water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b>. At this time, because the sterilizing water is discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Next, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to complete the hot water preparation (timing t<b>263</b>). An example of this hot water preparation is described later in detail. Here, the time period for performing the hot water preparation is e.g. approximately 10-15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Next, with the solenoid valve <b>431</b> closed, the controller <b>405</b> waits on standby until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> is pressed by the user (timing t<b>263</b>-t<b>264</b>). At this time, because the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be sterilized before the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">This prescribed time refers to the time for which the sterilizing water is retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, i.e., the time from when the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d; is pressed by the user. Thus, this prescribed time varies with the time period for e.g. the user's act of using the toilet.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>264</b>), the controller <b>405</b> receives a signal for performing private parts washing. Then, the controller <b>405</b> first performs &#x201c;pre-cleaning&#x201d; with clean water (timing t<b>264</b>-t<b>265</b>). More specifically, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging clean water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> to clean these water discharge ports <b>474</b>. At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the region around the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> is physically cleaned with clean water (including clean water reflected by the inner wall of the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>) discharged by the water discharge ports <b>474</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">In other words, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b> by the newly supplied clean water. That is, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained. Here, the time period for performing the pre-cleaning with clean water is e.g. approximately 2-4 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Next, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting clean water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> advances the nozzle <b>473</b> into the bowl <b>801</b>. Thus, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with clean water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> (timing t<b>265</b>-t<b>266</b>). At this time again, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is physically cleaned with clean water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">At this time again, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> connected to the water discharge portion <b>479</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained. Here, the time period for performing the body cleaning with clean water is e.g. approximately 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Next, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting clean water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; to wash the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of the user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b> (timing t<b>266</b>-t<b>267</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Furthermore, the sterilizing water which was retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained at timing t<b>264</b>-t<b>266</b>. Hence, there is no case where the sterilizing water is squirted at the user's private parts.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Furthermore, during the hot water preparation and standby before performing &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is sterilized with sterilizing water (timing t<b>262</b>-t<b>264</b>). Hence, hygienic water is squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;stop switch&#x201d;, not shown, on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>267</b>), the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting sterilizing water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> houses the nozzle <b>473</b> in the casing <b>400</b> (timing t<b>267</b>-t<b>268</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water, and performs &#x201c;body cleaning&#x201d; of the nozzle <b>473</b> with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> (timing t<b>267</b>-t<b>268</b>). Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the nozzle <b>473</b> are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Here, the time period for performing the body cleaning with the sterilizing water is e.g. approximately 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Next, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting sterilizing water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> advances the nozzle <b>473</b> into the bowl <b>801</b> (timing t<b>268</b>-t<b>269</b>), and then houses the nozzle <b>473</b> in the casing <b>400</b> (timing t<b>269</b>-t<b>270</b>). Hence, the tip portion of the nozzle <b>473</b> provided with the water discharge port <b>474</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the nozzle <b>473</b> are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Thus, while squirting sterilizing water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>, the controller <b>405</b> advances and retracts the nozzle <b>473</b> again so that the tip portion and body of the nozzle <b>473</b> can be sterilized more reliably. Here, the time period for advancing and retracting the nozzle <b>473</b> is e.g. approximately 1 second, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Next, with the nozzle <b>473</b> housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging sterilizing water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> to perform &#x201c;post-cleaning&#x201d; of these water discharge ports <b>474</b> (timing t<b>270</b>-t<b>271</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water, and performs the post-cleaning of the water discharge port <b>474</b> region with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>270</b>-t<b>271</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Furthermore, after the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is sterilized and cleaned with the sterilizing water (timing t<b>267</b>-t<b>270</b>), the sterilizing water is discharged only from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>270</b>-t<b>271</b>). Hence, the drainage water flowing out in sterilizing and cleaning the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> does not enter the flow channel <b>20</b> from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. Furthermore, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be filled with the sterilizing water down to the water discharge port <b>474</b> located at the end of the flow channel <b>20</b>. Here, the time period for performing the post-cleaning with the sterilizing water is e.g. approximately 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, and then closes the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>. The controller <b>405</b> waits on standby until the lapse of 5 seconds after the seating sensor <b>404</b> ceases to sense the human body (timing t<b>271</b>-t<b>272</b>). At this time, because the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">This prescribed time is the time period for which the sterilizing water is retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, i.e., the time period from when the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> until 5 seconds after the user leaves the seat. Here, &#x201c;until 5 seconds after the user leaves the seat&#x201d; means until 5 seconds has elapsed after the seating sensor <b>404</b> ceases to sense the human body. Thus, this prescribed time varies with e.g. the time period of the user's wiping and standing action.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Next, when 5 seconds has elapsed after the seating sensor <b>404</b> ceases to sense the human body, the controller <b>405</b> performs &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; (timing t<b>272</b>-t<b>273</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. The time period for performing this &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; is e.g. approximately 30 seconds. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, after the sterilizing water is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained, and the flow channel <b>20</b> is emptied. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The controller <b>405</b> of this embodiment performs the cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle <b>473</b>, and retains sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> continuously subsequent to the cleaning step. Here, the term &#x201c;cleaning step&#x201d; for cleaning the nozzle used herein refers to at least one of the pre-cleaning with the sterilizing water, the body cleaning with the sterilizing water, and the post-cleaning with the sterilizing water. Thus, after performing the cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle <b>473</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be elaborately sterilized. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably, and hygienic water can be squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Next, examples of the hot water preparation of this embodiment are described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref> are conceptual schematic diagrams illustrating examples of the hot water preparation of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a correspondence table showing the correspondence between the incoming water temperature and the suitable temperature continuation time in the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">As in the conceptual schematic diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref> show the state inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">In the description of these examples, it is illustratively assumed that the operation time of the hot water preparation is set to 10-15 seconds. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, it is illustratively assumed that the water passage time of the sterilizing water, i.e., the energization time of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, is set to 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">First, the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> starts hot water preparation for opening the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, activating the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and draining water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>301</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Hence, clean water flows in the flow channel <b>20</b> and is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. The temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> increases (timing t<b>301</b>-t<b>302</b>, increase temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Next, when the controller <b>405</b> senses (sense suitable temperature) that the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> has reached a preset temperature (suitable temperature), the controller <b>405</b> appropriately controls the hot water heater <b>441</b> to maintain the suitable temperature (timing t<b>302</b>-t<b>303</b>, continue suitable temperature). That is, even if the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> has reached the preset temperature, the controller <b>405</b> does not necessarily stop activating the hot water heater <b>441</b>. This is because even if the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> has reached the preset temperature, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is not necessarily filled with hot water. That is, to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with hot water, the controller <b>405</b> continues to activate the hot water heater <b>441</b> without stopping even after the temperature sensed by the hot water thermistor <b>443</b> reaches the preset temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Here, the time of continuing the suitable temperature (suitable temperature continuation time) is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">When the controller <b>405</b> starts hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> sets the suitable temperature continuation time based on the temperature sensed by the incoming water thermistor <b>433</b> (incoming water temperature). More specifically, when the incoming water temperature is 5&#xb0; C. or less, the controller <b>405</b> sets the suitable temperature continuation time to 6 seconds. Then, the controller <b>405</b> allocates 3 seconds of the 6 seconds to the water passage time of clean water, and the remaining 3 seconds of the 6 seconds to the water passage time of sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">When the incoming water temperature is higher than 5&#xb0; C. and 10&#xb0; C. or less, the controller <b>405</b> sets the suitable temperature continuation time to 5 seconds. Then, the controller <b>405</b> allocates 2 seconds of the 5 seconds to the water passage time of clean water, and the remaining 3 seconds of the 5 seconds to the water passage time of sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">When the incoming water temperature is higher than 10&#xb0; C. and 15&#xb0; C. or less, the controller <b>405</b> sets the suitable temperature continuation time to 4 seconds. Then, the controller <b>405</b> allocates 1 second of the 4 seconds to the water passage time of clean water, and the remaining 3 seconds of the 4 seconds to the water passage time of sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">When the incoming water temperature is higher than 15&#xb0; C., the controller <b>405</b> sets the suitable temperature continuation time to 3 seconds. Then, the controller <b>405</b> allocates the 3 seconds entirely to the water passage time of sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">That is, in this example, the controller <b>405</b> configures a shorter suitable temperature continuation time with the increase in the level of the incoming water temperature. The controller <b>405</b> allocates 3 seconds of the configured suitable temperature continuation time to the water passage time of sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the controller <b>405</b> senses the suitable temperature at less than 7 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation (timing t<b>302</b>). In this case, the controller <b>405</b> does not set the suitable temperature continuation time. At less than 7 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> does not produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. That is, the controller <b>405</b> passes clean water in the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Then, after the lapse of 7 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>303</b>). That is, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the controller <b>405</b> suppresses energization of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> until the lapse of 7 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation. Next, after the lapse of 10 seconds, which is the minimum operation time of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to complete the hot water preparation (timing t<b>304</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, even in the case where the controller <b>405</b> senses the suitable temperature at less than 7 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> can ensure the water passage time of sterilizing water. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> can start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> so that the timing to stop energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> coincides with the timing to complete the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Next, the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> starts hot water preparation (timing t<b>311</b>), and senses the suitable temperature at 7 seconds or more and less than 12 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation (timing t<b>312</b>). In this case, the controller <b>405</b> sets the suitable temperature continuation time based on the incoming water temperature (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">When the controller <b>405</b> senses the suitable temperature (timing t<b>312</b>), the controller <b>405</b> performs suitable temperature continuation with the suitable temperature continuation time configured based on the incoming water temperature (timing t<b>312</b>-t<b>314</b>). More specifically, the controller <b>405</b> passes clean water for the water passage time of clean water configured based on the incoming water temperature (timing t<b>312</b>-t<b>313</b>). Subsequently, the controller <b>405</b> produces sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and passes it for the configured water passage time (3 seconds) of sterilizing water (timing t<b>313</b>-t<b>314</b>). Next, after the lapse of the suitable temperature continuation time configured based on the incoming water temperature, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to complete the hot water preparation (timing t<b>314</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, even in the case where the controller <b>405</b> senses the suitable temperature at 7 seconds or more and less than 12 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> can ensure the water passage time of sterilizing water. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> can start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> so that the timing to stop energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> coincides with the timing to complete the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Next, the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> starts hot water preparation (timing t<b>321</b>), and senses the suitable temperature at 12 seconds or more from the start of the hot water preparation (timing t<b>323</b>). In this case, the controller <b>405</b> does not set the suitable temperature continuation time. After the lapse of 12 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>322</b>). That is, if the controller <b>405</b> does not sense the suitable temperature after the lapse of 12 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> forcibly starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Next, after the lapse of 15 seconds, which is the maximum operation time of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to complete the hot water preparation (timing t<b>324</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, even in the case where the controller <b>405</b> does not sense the suitable temperature after the lapse of 12 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> can ensure the water passage time of sterilizing water. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> can start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> so that the timing to stop energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> coincides with the timing to complete the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">As described above, in these examples (the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref>), irrespective of variations in the incoming water temperature and the timing of sensing the suitable temperature, the controller <b>405</b> can ensure the water passage time of sterilizing water. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> can start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> so that the timing to stop energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> coincides with the timing to complete the hot water preparation. This can suppress wasteful production of sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, wasteful passage of sterilizing water in the flow channel <b>20</b>, and wasteful drainage of sterilizing water from the water discharge port <b>474</b>, even if the incoming water temperature is varied. Furthermore, because the energization time of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be made shorter, the lifetime of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be increased. Furthermore, because the energization time of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be made shorter, generation of scale can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Furthermore, in these examples, the controller <b>405</b> may store the past suitable temperature continuation time in the memory <b>405</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> can refer to the past suitable temperature continuation time stored in the memory <b>405</b><i>a </i>and start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> so that the timing to stop energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> coincides with the timing to complete the hot water preparation. Here, the &#x201c;past suitable temperature continuation time&#x201d; includes e.g. the several suitable temperature continuation times immediately before usage of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, and the suitable temperature continuation times in the same hours on the past several days. Thus, the controller <b>405</b> can refer to the past suitable temperature continuation time. This can further suppress wasteful production of sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, wasteful passage of sterilizing water in the flow channel <b>20</b>, and wasteful drainage of sterilizing water from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0285" num="0284">First, the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Then, the controller <b>405</b> starts hot water preparation (timing t<b>351</b>). More specifically, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC (self-cleaning)&#x201d; to enable water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Next, when the switching of the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> is completed, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;water discard mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>352</b>). Next, after the lapse of 7 seconds from the start of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>353</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">At this time, the controller <b>405</b> has switched the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> to &#x201c;SC&#x201d;. Hence, water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d; is enabled. Furthermore, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. Hence, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Next, after the lapse of 3 seconds from the start of energization of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>354</b>).

<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> (timing t<b>355</b>).

That is, this is because the hot water heater <b>441</b> generates residual heat even after its setting is changed from the &#x201c;water discard mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;keep-warm control mode&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Next, until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> is pressed by the user, the controller <b>405</b> waits on standby and keeps the temperature of water to be discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>356</b>-t<b>357</b>). At this time, because the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be sterilized before the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>357</b>), the controller <b>405</b> receives a signal for performing private parts washing. Then, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC&#x201d;. Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;pre-cleaning mode, main washing mode, post-cleaning mode&#x201d;. At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region is cleaned with clean water discharged by the water discharge ports <b>474</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">In other words, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b> by the newly supplied clean water. That is, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; so that water can be squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> (timing t<b>358</b>). Next, the controller <b>405</b> advances the nozzle <b>473</b> housed in the casing <b>400</b> to the position of &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; (timing t<b>359</b>-t<b>360</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with clean water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>. Furthermore, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> connected to the water discharge portion <b>479</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; to &#x201c;bottom water force <b>5</b>&#x201d; (timing t<b>360</b>-t<b>361</b>) and performs main washing (bottom washing) (timing t<b>361</b>-t<b>362</b>). Here, for instance, if the user changes the setting of the water force in &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; from &#x201c;water force <b>5</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; by the manipulator <b>500</b>, then the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bottom water force <b>5</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;bottom water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; (timing t<b>362</b>-t<b>363</b>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> continues main washing at &#x201c;water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; (timing t<b>363</b>-t<b>364</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">In this main washing, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Furthermore, the sterilizing water which was retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained at timing t<b>357</b>-t<b>360</b>. Hence, there is no case where the sterilizing water is squirted at the user's private parts. Furthermore, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is sterilized at timing t<b>353</b>-t<b>357</b>. Hence, hygienic water is squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Next, when the user pushes a &#x201c;stop switch&#x201d;, not shown, on the manipulator <b>500</b>, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bottom water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; so that water can be squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> (timing t<b>364</b>). Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>364</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Next, the controller <b>405</b> houses the nozzle <b>473</b> advanced to the position of &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; in the casing <b>400</b> (timing t<b>365</b>-t<b>366</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, and energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water. Hence, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Next, the controller <b>405</b> advances the nozzle <b>473</b> to the position of &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; (timing t<b>366</b>-t<b>367</b>), and then houses the nozzle <b>473</b> in the casing <b>400</b> (timing t<b>367</b>-t<b>368</b>). Hence, the tip portion of the nozzle <b>473</b> provided with the water discharge port <b>474</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the nozzle <b>473</b> are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Thus, while squirting sterilizing water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>, the controller <b>405</b> advances and retracts the nozzle <b>473</b> again so that the tip portion and body of the nozzle <b>473</b> can be sterilized more reliably. At this time, the nozzle <b>473</b> can be sterilized by being advanced to the position of &#x201c;drainage&#x201d;, which has a smaller amount of advancement than the position of &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, so as not to bring discomfort to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC&#x201d;. Thus, post-cleaning is performed by discharging the sterilizing water from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d; (timing t<b>368</b>-t<b>369</b>). At this time again, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Hence, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with the sterilizing water discharged by the water discharge ports <b>474</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Next, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;origin&#x201d;, and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;keep-warm control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>369</b>). Subsequently, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> (timing t<b>370</b>). Here, as described above, it is because of the so-called &#x201c;after-boiling prevention&#x201d; that the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> after changing the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Next, when a prescribed time (e.g., approximately 5 minutes) has elapsed after the seating sensor <b>404</b> ceases to sense the human body, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC&#x201d; (timing t<b>371</b>), and moves the nozzle <b>473</b> to the position of &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; (timing t<b>372</b>). Thus, the &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; of the flow channel <b>20</b> is performed (timing t<b>371</b>-t<b>373</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. Here, the time period for performing the &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; is e.g. approximately 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">As described above, according to this embodiment, after the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> performs hot water preparation for opening the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, activating the hot water heater <b>441</b>, and draining water from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. Furthermore, based on the time period required to fill the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> with sterilizing water, the controller <b>405</b> controls the timing to activate the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> after starting the hot water preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be filled with a smaller amount of sterilizing water. Hence, wasteful drainage of the sterilizing water can be suppressed. Furthermore, because the energization time of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be made shorter, the lifetime of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be increased. Furthermore, because the energization time of the anode plate <b>451</b> and the cathode plate <b>452</b> can be made shorter, generation of scale can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">Next, still another embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0308" num="0307">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the relevant configuration of the water channel system and the electrical system is shown together.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The nozzle <b>473</b> can be advanced into or retracted from the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b> under a driving force from a nozzle motor <b>476</b>. That is, the nozzle motor <b>476</b> can advance/retract the nozzle <b>473</b> based on commands from the controller <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> is supplied with electrical power from a power supply circuit <b>401</b>. The controller <b>405</b> can receive signals from a room entry sensor (human body sensing device) <b>402</b> for sensing entry of a user into a toilet room, a human body sensor <b>403</b> for sensing a user present in front of the toilet seat <b>200</b>, a seating sensor <b>404</b> for sensing seating of a user on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, and a manipulator <b>500</b>. Based on these signals, the controller <b>405</b> can control the operation of the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, hot water heater <b>441</b>, electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, and nozzle motor <b>476</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">The seating sensor <b>404</b> can sense a human body present above the toilet seat <b>200</b> immediately before the user is seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Furthermore, the seating sensor <b>404</b> can sense a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>. That is, the seating sensor <b>404</b> can sense not only a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, but also a user present above the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Such a seating sensor <b>404</b> can be e.g. an infrared transmit/receive range sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">The human body sensor <b>403</b> can sense a user present in front of the toilet stool <b>800</b>, i.e., a user present at a position spaced in front of the toilet seat <b>200</b>. That is, the human body sensor <b>403</b> can sense a user entering the toilet room and approaching the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Such a human body sensor <b>403</b> can be e.g. an infrared transmit/receive range sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The room entry sensor <b>402</b> can sense a user who has just opened the door of the toilet room and entered the toilet room. Furthermore, the room entry sensor <b>402</b> can sense a user about to enter the toilet room and present in front of the door. That is, the room entry sensor <b>402</b> can sense not only a user who has entered the toilet room, but also a user who is yet to enter the toilet room, i.e., a user present in front of the door outside the toilet room. Such a room entry sensor <b>402</b> can be e.g. a pyroelectric sensor, or a microwave sensor such as Doppler sensor. The microwave sensor can be based on the microwave Doppler effect, or can transmit a microwave and detect an object based on the amplitude (intensity) of the reflected microwave. In the case of using such a sensor, the presence of a user can be sensed through the door of the toilet room. That is, such a sensor can sense a user before entering the toilet room.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">In the toilet device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a recess <b>409</b> is formed in the upper surface of the casing <b>400</b>. The room entry sensor <b>402</b> is partly embedded in this recess <b>409</b>. In the closed state of the toilet lid <b>300</b>, the room entry sensor <b>402</b> senses entry of a user through a transmissive window <b>310</b> provided near the base of the toilet lid <b>300</b>. For instance, when the room entry sensor <b>402</b> senses a user, the controller <b>405</b> can automatically open the toilet lid <b>300</b> based on the sensing result of the room entry sensor <b>402</b>. Furthermore, the seating sensor <b>404</b> and the human body sensor <b>403</b> are provided at the front center of the casing <b>400</b>. However, the installation configuration of the seating sensor <b>404</b>, the human body sensor <b>403</b>, and the room entry sensor <b>402</b> is not limited thereto, but can be suitably modified.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The casing <b>400</b> includes therein a rotation decelerator (toilet lid opening/closing sensing device) <b>600</b> for damping the closing speed of the toilet seat <b>200</b> and the toilet lid <b>300</b>. The rotation decelerator <b>600</b> can apply resistance to the rotation of the toilet seat <b>200</b> and the toilet lid <b>300</b> in one direction (closing direction), sense the rotational angle of the toilet seat <b>200</b> and the toilet lid <b>300</b>, and sense the presence or absence of rotation of the toilet seat <b>200</b> and the toilet lid <b>300</b>. This rotation decelerator <b>600</b> is described later in detail. The rest of the structure of the toilet device equipped with the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment is similar to that of the toilet device described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Furthermore, the rest of the relevant configuration of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment is similar to the relevant configuration of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">According to this embodiment, after the human body sensing device senses a human body, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can supply the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to the flow channel <b>20</b>, fill the flow channel <b>20</b> with the sterilizing water, and retain the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. In this step, the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> can be closed to facilitate retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. In particular, because the flow channel extending to the water discharge port <b>474</b> of the nozzle <b>473</b> is prone to pollution, this embodiment is effective. Furthermore, when the sterilizing water is filled and retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, injection of the sterilizing water into the flow channel <b>20</b> is preferably performed after completely replacing the water remaining inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Furthermore, after filling and retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment can drain the sterilizing water out of the flow channel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, the sterilizing water is filled and retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably, and hygienic water can be squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. This is one of the effective means in the case where the flow channel <b>20</b> is formed from an antibacterial metal with weaker sterilizing power. Furthermore, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, after filling and retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water is drained out of the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed. In the following, these operations are described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a conceptual schematic diagram generally showing the operation of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">According to this embodiment, after the human body sensing device senses a human body, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>411</b>). Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled and sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Here, the human body sensing device is illustratively a room entry sensor <b>402</b> or a human body sensor <b>403</b>. However, the human body sensing device is not limited thereto. The human body sensing device may be a device for sensing &#x201c;turn-on&#x201d; of the lamp switch of the toilet room, a device for sensing the opening motion of the door of the toilet room, or a device for sensing the opening motion of the toilet lid. For instance, a toilet lid opening/closing device (toilet lid opening/closing sensing device), not shown, for opening/closing the toilet lid <b>300</b> may be provided inside the casing <b>400</b>. In this case, the controller <b>405</b> can automatically open the toilet lid <b>300</b> based on the sensing result of the room entry sensor <b>402</b>. In this case, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> based on the opening motion of the toilet lid <b>300</b> by the toilet lid opening/closing device.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Alternatively, the human body sensing device may be a rotation decelerator <b>600</b>. The rotation decelerator <b>600</b> can sense the rotational angle of the toilet seat <b>200</b> and the toilet lid <b>300</b>. Hence, the rotation decelerator <b>600</b> can sense the opening motion of the toilet lid <b>300</b>. Thus, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> based on the opening motion of the toilet lid <b>300</b> by the rotation decelerator <b>600</b>. This rotation decelerator <b>600</b> is described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Thus, the term &#x201c;human body sensing device&#x201d; used herein encompasses not only devices for performing &#x201c;human body sensing&#x201d; such as the room entry sensor <b>402</b>, but also devices for performing &#x201c;utilization sensing&#x201d;, i.e., for sensing the possibility of utilization of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> such as a device for sensing &#x201c;turn-on&#x201d; of the lamp switch of the toilet room.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">Accordingly, when there is a possibility that a user utilizes the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can earlier supply the sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. That is, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can supply the sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, for instance, after the room entry sensor <b>402</b> senses a user who has just entered the toilet room and before the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized at an earlier stage after sensing the possibility of utilization of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">Next, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and supplies clean water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>412</b>). Thus, the sterilizing water in the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is drained to the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">At this time, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> activates the hot water heater <b>441</b>. That is, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> starts hot water preparation for activating the hot water heater <b>441</b> and draining water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>412</b>). The operation of the hot water preparation is the operation of draining the water in the flow channel <b>20</b> from the water discharge port <b>474</b> and replacing the water in the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> by the water heated in the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b>. Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the heat exchanger unit <b>440</b> can be warmed. Hence, in washing the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and other parts of a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, cold water can be prevented from being squirted at the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and other parts of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Next, when the operation of the hot water preparation is completed, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> restarts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>413</b>). Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is refilled with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b>, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and supplies clean water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>414</b>). Thus, the sterilizing water in the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is drained to the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b> (timing t<b>414</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">Then, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> squirts water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; to wash the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of the user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>. At this time, because the sterilizing water in the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained by the operation at timing t<b>414</b>, there is no case where the sterilizing water is squirted at the user's private parts. Furthermore, as described above, after the human body sensing device senses the human body and after the hot water preparation is completed, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is sterilized with sterilizing water. Hence, hygienic water is squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">According to this embodiment, after the human body sensing device senses a human body, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. In the case where the human body sensing device is a room entry sensor <b>402</b>, after the room entry sensor <b>402</b> senses a user just entering the toilet room, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> can supply sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Hence, the sterilizing water can be retained for a longer time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">Before the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b> (before timing t<b>412</b>), the hot water preparation has not been started yet. Thus, before the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled with sterilizing water at lower temperature. The reproductive power of bacteria is weaker in the environment at lower temperature than in the environment at higher temperature. Hence, before the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more efficiently.</p>

<p id="p-0334" num="0333">First, when the human body sensing device senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>421</b>). Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and supplies the sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>421</b>). Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled and sterilized with the sterilizing water. Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging the sterilizing water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b>. Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">Next, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and supplies clean water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>422</b>). Thus, the sterilizing water in the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is drained to the bowl <b>801</b> of the toilet stool <b>800</b>. At this time, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> activates the hot water heater <b>441</b>. That is, the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> starts hot water preparation for activating the hot water heater <b>441</b> and draining water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>422</b>). Here, the time period for performing the hot water preparation is e.g. approximately 10-15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">Next, upon completion of the operation of the hot water preparation, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>423</b>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging the sterilizing water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b>. At this time, because the sterilizing water is discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water. This sterilizing water has been warmed so that the flow channel warmed in the hot water preparation is not cooled down.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">Next, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> (timing t<b>424</b>). With the solenoid valve <b>431</b> closed, the controller <b>405</b> waits on standby until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> is pressed by the user (timing t<b>424</b>-t<b>425</b>). At this time, because the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be sterilized before the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">This prescribed time refers to the time for which the sterilizing water is retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, i.e., the time from when the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d; is pressed by the user. Thus, this prescribed time varies with the time period for e.g. the user's act of using the toilet.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>425</b>), the controller <b>405</b> receives a signal for performing private parts washing. Then, the controller <b>405</b> first performs &#x201c;pre-cleaning&#x201d; with clean water (timing t<b>425</b>-t<b>426</b>). More specifically, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging clean water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> to clean these water discharge ports <b>474</b>. At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the region around the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> is physically cleaned with clean water (including clean water reflected by the inner wall of the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>) discharged by the water discharge ports <b>474</b> themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">In other words, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b> by the newly supplied clean water. That is, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained. Here, the time period for performing the pre-cleaning with clean water is e.g. approximately 2-4 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Next, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting clean water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> advances the nozzle <b>473</b> into the bowl <b>801</b>. Thus, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is cleaned with clean water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> (timing t<b>426</b>-t<b>427</b>). At this time again, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Hence, the body of the nozzle <b>473</b> is physically cleaned with clean water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">At this time again, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> connected to the water discharge portion <b>479</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained. Here, the time period for performing the body cleaning with clean water is e.g. approximately 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Next, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting clean water from the water discharge port <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; to wash the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of the user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b> (timing t<b>427</b>-t<b>428</b>). At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water. Furthermore, the sterilizing water which was retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is replaced by the newly supplied clean water and drained at timing t<b>425</b>-t<b>427</b>. Hence, there is no case where the sterilizing water is squirted at the user's private parts.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Furthermore, during the hot water preparation and standby before performing &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is sterilized with sterilizing water (timing t<b>421</b>-t<b>422</b>, t<b>423</b>-t<b>425</b>). Hence, hygienic water is squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;stop switch&#x201d;, not shown, on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>428</b>), the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby squirting sterilizing water from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b>. Simultaneously, the controller <b>405</b> houses the nozzle <b>473</b> in the casing <b>400</b> (timing t<b>428</b>-t<b>429</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water, and performs &#x201c;body cleaning&#x201d; of the nozzle <b>473</b> with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> (timing t<b>428</b>-t<b>429</b>). Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the nozzle <b>473</b> are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Here, the time period for performing the body cleaning with the sterilizing water is e.g. approximately 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">Next, with the nozzle <b>473</b> housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the controller <b>405</b> controls the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, thereby discharging sterilizing water from all the plurality of water discharge ports <b>474</b> to perform &#x201c;post-cleaning&#x201d; of these water discharge ports <b>474</b> (timing t<b>429</b>-t<b>430</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> energizes the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water, and performs the post-cleaning of the water discharge port <b>474</b> region with the sterilizing water squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>429</b>-t<b>430</b>). Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Here, the time period for performing the post-cleaning with the sterilizing water is e.g. approximately 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, and then closes the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, so that the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>430</b>-t<b>431</b>). Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized. This prescribed time is e.g. approximately 60 minutes. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the sterilizing water is retained for a longer time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Next, after the lapse of the prescribed time, the controller <b>405</b> performs &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; (timing t<b>431</b>-t<b>432</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. The time period for performing this &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; is e.g. approximately 30 seconds. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, after the sterilizing water is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained, and the flow channel <b>20</b> is emptied. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">The controller <b>405</b> of this embodiment performs the cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle <b>473</b>, and retains sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> continuously subsequent to the cleaning step. Here, the term &#x201c;cleaning step&#x201d; for cleaning the nozzle used herein refers to at least one of the pre-cleaning with the sterilizing water, the body cleaning with the sterilizing water, and the post-cleaning with the sterilizing water. Thus, after performing the cleaning step for cleaning the nozzle <b>473</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be elaborately sterilized. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably.</p>

<p id="p-0363" num="0362">First, the human body sensing device senses a human body (timing t<b>501</b>). Then, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC (self-cleaning)&#x201d; to enable water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d;. The flow rate (volume of water) at this time is e.g. approximately 450 cc/min.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">Next, when the switching of the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> is completed (timing t<b>502</b>), the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d;. Thus, cold water in the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained for hot water preparation. Thus, the hot water preparation is performed before the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Hence, the user can perform &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; even immediately after seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Next, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>503</b>). At this time, because the solenoid valve <b>431</b> is opened, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled and sterilized with the sterilizing water. Furthermore, because the controller <b>405</b> has switched the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d;, the water discharge port <b>474</b> region is sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">The flow rate (volume of water) at this time is e.g. approximately 280 cc/min. That is, the flow rate at this time is lower than the flow rate during the hot water preparation (e.g., approximately 450 cc/min) and the flow rate during the pre-cleaning, body cleaning, and post-cleaning with water (e.g., approximately 450 cc/min). In other words, the controller <b>405</b> can produce sterilizing water at a preset flow rate independent of the flow rate in performing private parts washing. In this example, the flow rate during the hot water preparation and the flow rate during the pre-cleaning, body cleaning, and post-cleaning with water are set to the maximum flow rate. Thus, the controller <b>405</b> makes the flow rate of water supplied to the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> lower than the maximum flow rate. Hence, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be made higher.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">Furthermore, at this time, the controller <b>405</b> changes the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b> from the &#x201c;antifreeze control mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>502</b>). The temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> at this time, i.e., the preset temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> in the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d;, is equal to or higher than the maximum temperature of the preset temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> in performing private parts washing, i.e., the preset temperature of the hot water heater <b>441</b> in the &#x201c;pre-cleaning mode, main washing mode, post-cleaning mode&#x201d;. In other words, the controller <b>405</b> can produce sterilizing water at a preset temperature independent of the temperature in performing private parts washing.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">Thus, the controller <b>405</b> sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; so that the temperature is set equal to or higher than the maximum temperature of water supplied from the hot water heater <b>441</b> in performing private parts washing. Hence, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be made higher. Furthermore, because the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water can be made higher by setting the temperature equal to or higher than the maximum temperature in performing private parts washing, the controller <b>405</b> can suppress the decrease of the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water, and the sterilizing effect of the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be maintained for a longer time. Thus, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">Next, the controller <b>405</b> changes the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b> from the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;keep-warm control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>504</b>). Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;origin&#x201d;, and stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>505</b>). Next, the controller <b>405</b> changes the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b> from the &#x201c;keep-warm control mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;antifreeze control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>506</b>). Here, it is because of the so-called &#x201c;after-boiling prevention&#x201d; that the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> after changing the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b>. That is, this is because the hot water heater <b>441</b> generates residual heat even after its setting is changed from the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; to the &#x201c;keep-warm control mode&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">Next, until the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b>, the controller <b>405</b> waits on standby while retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>506</b>-t<b>507</b>). Then, when the seating sensor <b>404</b> senses a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b> (timing t<b>507</b>), the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to enable water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d;. The flow rate (volume of water) at this time is e.g. approximately 450 cc/min.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">Next, when the switching of the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> is completed (timing t<b>508</b>), the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;water discard mode&#x201d;. Thus, cold water in the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained for hot water preparation again. Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d;, thereby completing the hot water preparation. Then, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to produce sterilizing water (timing t<b>509</b>). Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>509</b>).

Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b>, switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;origin&#x201d;, and stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> (timing t<b>511</b>). Here, as described above, it is because of the so-called &#x201c;after-boiling prevention&#x201d; that the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> after changing the setting of the hot water heater <b>441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">Next, until the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> is pressed by the user, the controller <b>405</b> waits on standby while retaining the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, and keeps the temperature of water to be discharged from the water discharge port <b>474</b> (timing t<b>512</b>-t<b>513</b>). At this time, because the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Thus, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized before the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">Next, when the user presses the &#x201c;bottom washing switch&#x201d;, not shown, provided on the manipulator <b>500</b> (timing t<b>513</b>), the controller <b>405</b> receives a signal for performing private parts washing. Then, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC&#x201d;. Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;pre-cleaning mode, main washing mode, post-cleaning mode&#x201d;. At this time, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water.

<p id="p-0375" num="0374">In other words, the sterilizing water retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained from the water discharge port <b>474</b> by the newly supplied water.

<p id="p-0376" num="0375">Next, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;bypass <b>2</b>&#x201d; so that water can be squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> (timing t<b>515</b>).

<p id="p-0378" num="0377">In this main washing, the controller <b>405</b> does not energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and does not produce sterilizing water.

<p id="p-0379" num="0378">Next, when the user pushes a &#x201c;stop switch&#x201d;, not shown, on the manipulator <b>500</b>, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bottom water force <b>3</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;bypass <b>2</b>&#x201d; so that water can be squirted from the water discharge portion <b>479</b> provided in the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> (timing t<b>521</b>).

<p id="p-0380" num="0379">Next, with the nozzle <b>473</b> housed in the casing <b>400</b>, the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;bypass <b>2</b>&#x201d; to &#x201c;Sc&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0381" num="0380">Next, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;SC&#x201d; to &#x201c;origin&#x201d; (timing t<b>525</b>). Next, the user performs &#x201c;bottom drying&#x201d; as appropriate and leaves the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Then, after the lapse of a prescribed time (here, e.g., approximately 5 seconds), the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d; to enable water discharge from all the water discharge ports <b>474</b> for &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; and &#x201c;bidet washing&#x201d; (timing t<b>526</b>).

Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and starts to produce sterilizing water (timing t<b>527</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">Thus, the post-cleaning of the nozzle <b>473</b> is performed with the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.

Hence, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water. Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">The flow rate (volume of water) at this time is e.g. approximately 280 cc/min. Thus, as described above, by decreasing the flow rate of water supplied to the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, the controller <b>405</b> can increase the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">Next, the controller <b>405</b> stops energizing the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;antifreeze control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>528</b>). Subsequently, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, so that the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>529</b>-t<b>532</b>). Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">The time period for performing this sterilizing water retaining step is e.g. approximately 60 minutes. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the sterilizing water is retained for a longer time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably. Here, the controller <b>405</b> may energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply sterilizing water (timing t<b>530</b>-t<b>531</b>) while retaining sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>529</b>-t<b>532</b>). Thus, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the controller <b>405</b> can control the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply new sterilizing water, thereby suppressing the decrease of sterilizing power.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Next, after the lapse of the prescribed time (e.g., approximately 60 minutes), the controller <b>405</b> switches the flow rate switching valve <b>471</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> from &#x201c;origin&#x201d; to &#x201c;SC<b>2</b>&#x201d;, and moves the nozzle <b>473</b> to the position of &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; (timing t<b>532</b>). Thus, the &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; of the flow channel <b>20</b> is performed (timing t<b>532</b>-t<b>533</b>). That is, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. Thus, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, after the sterilizing water is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> is drained, and the flow channel <b>20</b> is emptied. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">After the controller <b>405</b> performs drainage of the flow channel <b>20</b>, the controller <b>405</b> enters the standby state (timing t<b>533</b>-t<b>534</b>).

Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and sets the hot water heater <b>441</b> to the &#x201c;sterilization control mode&#x201d; (timing t<b>534</b>). Furthermore, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>, and starts to produce sterilizing water (timing t<b>534</b>). That is, here, as described above with reference to timing t<b>526</b>-t<b>529</b>, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> and the water discharge port <b>474</b> region are sterilized with the sterilizing water (timing t<b>533</b>-t<b>534</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Next, as in the operation described above with reference to timing t<b>529</b>-t<b>532</b>, the controller <b>405</b> closes the solenoid valve <b>431</b> and the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b>, so that the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>535</b>-t<b>536</b>). Thus, after the user performs &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d;, the inside of the flow channel <b>20</b> can be regularly sterilized. Then, as in the operation described above with reference to timing t<b>532</b>-t<b>533</b>, the controller <b>405</b> drains the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>536</b>-t<b>537</b>). Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably, and multiplication of bacteria inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be suppressed more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">Here, with regard to the triggers for performing regular sterilization and drainage of the flow channel <b>20</b> (timing t<b>534</b>-t<b>537</b>), for instance, the controller <b>405</b> can perform regular sterilization and drainage at times appropriately set by a timer. The times of the timer may be preset during manufacturing or before shipment of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, or may be configured by the user as desired. Alternatively, the controller <b>405</b> can perform regular sterilization and drainage during night hours when the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">Alternatively, the controller <b>405</b> may store the frequency of usage of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> by the user, and learn the hours having low usage frequency. Thus, the controller <b>405</b> can perform regular sterilization and drainage during the hours having low frequency of usage by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A to 26C</figref> are conceptual schematic diagrams showing variations of the operation of the sanitary washing device according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The operation described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 to 25</figref> relates to the case where &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; is performed after the human body sensing device senses a human body. However, there may be cases where &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; is not performed after the human body sensing device senses a human body. For instance, this occurs in the case where a male user urinates in the standing position.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">Also in this case, the controller <b>405</b> can perform &#x201c;drainage&#x201d; of the flow channel <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0394" num="0393">For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, after the lapse of a prescribed time since the human body sensing device ceased to sense a human body, the controller <b>405</b> can drain the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>, after the lapse of a prescribed time since the human body sensing device sensed a human body, the controller <b>405</b> can forcibly drain the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26C</figref>, after the human body sensing device senses a human body, if the seating sensor <b>404</b> does not sense a user seated on the toilet seat <b>200</b> even after the lapse of a prescribed time, then the controller <b>405</b> can drain the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b> simultaneously with the operation for flushing the toilet bowl, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">Thus, even in the case where &#x201c;bottom washing&#x201d; is not performed after the human body sensing device senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> can drain the sterilizing water inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, thereby emptying the flow channel <b>20</b>, after retaining the sterilizing water for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Hence, even if the sterilizing power of the sterilizing water is decreased over time, the action of the sterilizing water as a nutrient source for bacteria can be suppressed.</p>

Furthermore, the other end of the rotary shaft <b>622</b> protrudes from an opening <b>625</b><i>a </i>provided in the other lid <b>625</b>, and is engaged with a speed-up gear train <b>633</b> inside the opening/closing sensor <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">The rotary shaft <b>622</b> may be configured as a single shaft from the pin insertion hole <b>622</b><i>c </i>to the portion engaged with the speed-up gear train <b>633</b>. However, in this embodiment, the rotary shaft <b>622</b> is divided into two members, i.e., a first rotary shaft <b>622</b><i>a </i>and a second rotary shaft <b>622</b><i>b</i>. Of course, although divided, the ends of the first rotary shaft <b>622</b><i>a </i>and the second rotary shaft <b>622</b><i>b </i>are unrotatably engaged with each other. Hence, the rotation of the first rotary shaft <b>622</b><i>a </i>is directly transmitted to the rotation of the second rotary shaft <b>622</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">The opening/closing sensor <b>630</b> serves to sense the opening/closing state of the toilet seat <b>200</b> or the toilet lid <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the opening/closing sensor <b>630</b> includes a case <b>631</b>, an input shaft <b>632</b> housed inside the case <b>631</b>, a speed-up gear train <b>633</b> for speeding up and transmitting the rotation of the input shaft <b>632</b>, a magnet <b>634</b><i>a </i>fixed to the input shaft <b>632</b>, a magnet <b>635</b><i>a </i>fixed to the last-stage gear (third gear <b>633</b><i>c</i>) of the speed-up gear train <b>633</b>, and a Hall IC substrate <b>636</b> including Hall ICs <b>634</b><i>b</i>, <b>635</b><i>b </i>for sensing the magnetic force of the respective magnets <b>634</b><i>a</i>, <b>635</b><i>a</i>. The magnet <b>634</b><i>a </i>is shaped like an arc with the N pole and S pole separated circumferentially around the input shaft <b>632</b>. The magnet <b>635</b><i>a </i>is shaped like a disc with a plurality of N poles and S poles located circumferentially on the third gear <b>633</b><i>c</i>, which has the largest speed-up ratio with respect to the rotary shaft <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">To the Hall IC substrate <b>636</b>, a lead <b>637</b> for exchanging signals with the controller <b>405</b> is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">An opening <b>631</b><i>a </i>is formed in the side surface of the case <b>631</b>. The other end of the aforementioned rotary shaft <b>622</b> (second rotary shaft <b>622</b><i>b</i>) is inserted through this opening <b>631</b><i>a </i>into the case <b>631</b> and engaged with the input shaft <b>632</b>. That is, the rotation of the rotary shaft <b>622</b> is directly transmitted to the input shaft <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">The speed-up gear train <b>633</b> includes a first gear <b>633</b><i>a</i>, a second gear <b>633</b><i>b</i>, and a third gear <b>633</b><i>c</i>. The first gear <b>633</b><i>a </i>speeds up the rotation of the input shaft <b>632</b> and transmits it to the second gear <b>633</b><i>b</i>. The second gear <b>633</b><i>b </i>speeds up the rotation of the first gear <b>633</b><i>a </i>and transmits it to the third gear <b>633</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">An angle detecting device for sensing the rotational angle of the input shaft <b>632</b> includes the magnet <b>634</b><i>a </i>fixed to the input shaft <b>632</b> and the Hall IC <b>634</b><i>b</i>. The rotational angle of the input shaft <b>632</b> is equal to the rotational angle of the rotary shaft <b>622</b>. Hence, this angle detecting device can sense the rotational angle of the toilet seat <b>200</b>, i.e., the position of the toilet seat <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">A rotation detecting device for sensing the presence or absence of rotation of the third gear <b>633</b><i>c </i>includes the magnet <b>635</b><i>a </i>fixed to the third gear <b>633</b><i>c </i>and the Hall IC <b>635</b><i>b</i>. The third gear <b>633</b><i>c </i>is rotated by the rotary shaft <b>622</b> through the second gear <b>633</b><i>b</i>, the first gear <b>633</b><i>a</i>, and the input shaft <b>632</b>. Hence, the presence or absence of rotation of the third gear agrees with the presence or absence of rotation of the rotary shaft <b>622</b>. That is, this rotation detecting device can sense the presence or absence of rotation of the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Furthermore, instead of directly detecting the rotation of the rotary shaft <b>622</b>, the rotation detecting device detects the rotation sped up by the speed-up gear train <b>633</b>. Hence, even if the toilet seat <b>200</b> is closed at a slow speed, the presence or absence of its rotation can be readily detected. Furthermore, in the speed-up gear train <b>633</b>, the third gear <b>633</b><i>c </i>has the largest speed-up ratio with respect to the rotary shaft <b>622</b>. Hence, the presence or absence of rotation can be detected more accurately than in the case where the magnets are located on the first gear <b>633</b><i>a </i>or the second gear <b>633</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">The result of detection by the angle detecting device and the rotation detecting device is extracted by the lead <b>637</b> out of the rotation decelerator <b>600</b> and outputted to the controller <b>405</b>. Furthermore, electrical power is supplied from the controller <b>405</b> through the lead <b>637</b> to the angle detecting device and the rotation detecting device so that the Hall ICs <b>634</b><i>b</i>, <b>635</b><i>b </i>can sense the position of the magnets <b>634</b><i>a</i>, <b>635</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">Thus, the rotation decelerator <b>600</b> of this embodiment can sense the rotational angle and the presence or absence of rotation of the toilet seat <b>200</b>. Hence, the controller <b>405</b> can start to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> after the rotation decelerator <b>600</b> senses the opening motion of the toilet lid <b>300</b>. Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled and sterilized with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">Furthermore, in the case where hot water preparation is performed in response to the opening motion of the toilet lid <b>300</b>, the opening motion of the toilet seat <b>200</b> may be sensed simultaneously or immediately after the opening motion of the toilet lid <b>300</b>. In this situation, preferably, the hot water preparation is not performed, or is stopped in response to the opening motion of the toilet seat <b>200</b>, so as to avoid wasteful operation of the hot water heater.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">As described above, according to this embodiment, after the human body sensing device senses a human body, the controller <b>405</b> starts to energize the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> to supply sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Thus, the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled and sterilized with the sterilizing water. That is, when there is a possibility that a user utilizes the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>, the controller <b>405</b> can earlier supply the sterilizing water to the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b>. Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized at an earlier stage after sensing the possibility of utilization of the sanitary washing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">Furthermore, in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the sterilizing water can be filled and retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>. Thus, bacteria surviving inside the flow channel <b>20</b> can be sterilized more reliably so that hygienic water can be squirted from the water discharge port <b>474</b>. Furthermore, even when a male user urinates in the standing position, urine can be prevented from entering the flow channel <b>20</b> from the water discharge port <b>474</b> because the flow channel <b>20</b> on the downstream side of the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> is filled with the sterilizing water.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">In the foregoing, the embodiments of the invention have been described. However, the invention is not limited to the above description. Those skilled in the art can suitably modify the above embodiments, and such modifications are also encompassed within the scope of the invention as long as they include the features of the invention. For instance, the shape, dimension, material, and layout of various components in the sanitary washing device <b>100</b> and the pressure modulator <b>460</b>, and the installation configuration of the nozzle <b>473</b> and the nozzle cleaning chamber <b>478</b> are not limited to those illustrated, but can be suitably modified.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">The sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> may be a solution containing metal ions such as silver ions or copper ions. Alternatively, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> may be a solution containing electrolytic chlorine or ozone. Alternatively, the sterilizing water produced in the electrolytic cell unit <b>450</b> may be acid water or alkaline water. Furthermore, the sterilizing water producing device is not limited to an electrolytic cell. That is, the sterilizing water may be sterilizing water produced by dissolving a bactericide and a sterilizing liquid in water. Furthermore, the trigger for performing regular sterilization and drainage of the flow channel <b>20</b> (the operation at timing t<b>29</b>-t<b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is not limited to the trigger described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, but can be suitably configured.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">In the above embodiments, when the sterilizing water is retained inside the flow channel <b>20</b>, the flow channel switching valve <b>472</b> is illustratively set to &#x201c;closed&#x201d;, but the invention is not limited thereto. It can be suitably configured as long as the sterilizing water can be retained for a prescribed time inside the flow channel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">Furthermore, various components in the above embodiments can be combined with each other as long as technically feasible. Such combinations are also encompassed within the scope of the invention as long as they include the features of the invention.</p>
