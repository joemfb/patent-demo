<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to encode and decode devices, networks, and networked communications of digital compressed video in encoding and decoding systems and methods, and more particularly relates to systems and methods for 4:2:0 color space video encoders and decoders to render 4:4:4 color space video.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most video encoding and decoding systems operate on data representing video using a 4:2:0 color space. The 4:2:0 color space is useful when employed for display of movies and TV shows, however, greater definition and detail is possible with a 4:4:4 color space, such as may be desirable for computer graphic information type video. Such 4:4:4 color space for video encoding/decoding, however, has not been possible with many systems because often the encoder and decoder hardware and software operates only on video in the 4:2:0 color space. The systems and methods of this invention provide for rendering 4:4:4 color space video, using encoders and decoders that only support the 4:2:0 color space.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As will be understood, video and/or display graphics, such as that communicated from one point (or node or computer or device) to another point (or node or computer or device) on a network, is encoded by the sender and then decoded by the recipient. This can reduce the quantity of data that must be communicated and thereby reduces the bandwidth required for the communication. Typical video encoding and decoding technical standards include MPEG1, MPEG2, H.263, VC-1 and H.264. These encoding and decoding standards are similarly processed by encoders and decoders of devices, e.g., processed manipulation, copying and handling of files and frames of files are similar in encode and decode processing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditionally, the encoders and decoders, and their respective processes, have been employed for communicating movie and TV type video over networks. Because of the nature of this type of video, the data representing the video has employed the 4:2:0 color space for purpose of encoding and decoding. Other color space types such as 4:4:4 color space, however, can provide more desirable results for certain communications, for example, for communications of computer graphics type information video such as frame buffer output from a spreadsheet or browser program to a remote display.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional video encode and decode process for input and output in the 4:4:4 color space converts from 4:4:4 color space to 4:2:0 color space, encodes, decodes and then converts back to 4:4:4 color space. In particular, a 4:4:4 frame buffer is translated to a 4:2:0 frame by a converter. The 4:2:0 frame is then encoded to obtain an encoded video bit stream. The encoded video bit stream is passed, such as via network communication, to a video decoder. The video decoder creates a 4:2:0 frame. This 4:2:0 frame is converted back into a 4:4:4 frame by a next converter, and the frame is saved into a 4:4:4 frame buffer. This results in an averaging of pixels for the resulting 4:4:4 color space of the 4:4:4 frame buffer. This averaging of pixels in the convention version between 4:4:4 and 4:2:0 color spaces results in lessened definition and detail in rendered 4:4:4 color space displays at the decoder, in comparison to that of the original graphic displayed at the encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A better video and display solution which would be desirable for many applications in the 4:4:4 color space, which does not rely on averaging of pixels. It would be advantageous to avoid averaging operations, particularly, where the pixel data represent computer graphics type video and displays, such as with spreadsheets, other types of computer generated graphics, computer game graphics, or other exacting detail and color is desirable. Although certain video encoder/decoder systems have dedicated elements for operating with 4:4:4 color space video, these are uncommon and, in any event, are not widely employed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would therefore be desirable, and a significant improvement in the art and technology, to provide encoders and decoders for converting video from one color space format to another, with new and improved color and graphical display.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to certain embodiments of the invention, systems and methods for encoders and decoders to convert video, such as graphics, media, computer games, or other files, from one color space format, in particular, 4:4:4 color space, to another color space format, in particular, 4:2:0 color space, provide improved displays of video of 4:4:4 color space frames of original format input to the encoders.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An embodiment of the invention is a sender device for encoding a 4:4:4 color space frame of video as a plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames. The plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space encoded frames is convertibly decodable, identically, as the 4:4:4 color space frame. The sender device includes a memory for containing the 4:4:4 color space frame, a sender frame buffer of the memory, a sender converter communicatively connected to the sender frame buffer, for transmuting the 4:4:4 color space frame to a plurality of 4:2:0 color space frames, successively, of the sender frame buffer, and an encoder communicatively connected to the sender frame buffer, for respectively encoding, substantially immediately in real-time, each of the plurality of 4:2:0 color space frames, successively, of the sender frame buffer as the plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment of the invention is a recipient device for convertibly decoding a plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames received from an encode device, as a 4:4:4 color space frame of video. The encode device encodes a 4:4:4 color space frame to the plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames. The recipient device includes a recipient frame buffer for successively receiving the plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames, a decoder communicatively connected to the recipient frame buffer, for decoding each of the plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frame, in succession, to a plurality of 4:2:0 color space frames, in succession, contained in the recipient frame buffer, in succession, and a recipient converter communicatively connected to the recipient frame buffer, for transmuting the plurality of 4:2:0 color space frames in the recipient frame buffer to the 4:4:4 color space frame, identically, of the video.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another embodiment of the invention is a method of coding a 4:4:4 color space frame of video as a plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames. The plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space encoded frames is convertibly decodable, identically, as the 4:4:4 color space frame. The method includes storing the 4:4:4 color space frame in a frame buffer of memory. converting the 4:4:4 color space frame to a plurality of 4:2:0 color space frames in the frame buffer, in succession, wherein a first one of the 4:2:0 color space frames includes data representing respective intensities of a first pixel and three surrounding pixels and data representing color of the first pixel of four pixels, a second one of the 4:2:0 color space frames includes data representing null intensity and respective color of one of the surrounding pixels, a third one of the 4:2:0 color space frames includes data representing null intensity and respective color of another of the surrounding pixels, and a fourth one of the 4:2:0 color space frames includes data representing null intensity and respective color of the other of the surrounding pixels, and encoding, in succession, each of the plurality of 4:2:0 color space frames in the frame buffer, to respective ones of the plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames in the frame buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another embodiment of the invention is a method of constructing a 4:4:4 color space frame from a plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames received from an encoder. The plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames are a first encoded 4:2:0 color space frame including data representing respective intensities of a first pixel and three surrounding pixels and data representing color of the first pixel of four pixels, a second one of the 4:2:0 color space frames including data representing null intensity and respective color of one of the surrounding pixels, a third one of the 4:2:0 color space frames including data representing null intensity and respective color of another of the surrounding pixels, and a fourth one of the 4:2:0 color space frames including data representing null intensity and respective color of the other of the surrounding pixels.

The method includes receiving successive ones of the 4:4:4 color space frame in a frame buffer of an encoder device, encoding each one of the 4:4:4 color space frame, in succession, by the encoder device, without averaging of pixels, as a plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames in a frame buffer, communicating the plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color frames to a frame buffer of a decoder device, and decoding the plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color frames in respect of each one of the 4:4:4 color space frames, as a plurality of 4:4:4 color space frames in the frame buffer of the decoder device, the last of the plurality of the 4:4:4 color space frames is identical to the 4:4:4 color space frame, respectively, in the frame buffer of the encoder device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment of the invention is a system for communicating video. The video includes 4:4:4 color space frames.

The 4:2:0 video encoder, without conversion by the 4:4:4 to 4:2:0 color space frame converter, communicates the video as a plurality of encoded 4:2:0 color space frames to the decoder. The 4:2:0 video decoder, without conversion by the 4:2:0 to 4:4:4 color space frame converter, saves the video as a plurality of 4:4:4 color space frames in memory. Each of the plurality of 4:4:4 color space frames in memory of the decoder device is identical to a plurality of 4:4:4 color space frames, respectively, in the frame buffer of the encoder device for the step of encoding.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a color space coding depiction <b>10</b> illustrates comparison of a 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b> and a 4:4:4 color space <b>104</b>. For purposes of this disclosure, the term &#x201c;color space&#x201d; means both the data stored in memory representing a pixel display of particular color and intensity and also the pixel, itself, of a monitor, screen or other display device of a digital processor device and consequent color and intensity of such pixel. In the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b>, four pixels are coded with four Y <b>101</b> values and a single set of each of U <b>102</b> and V <b>103</b> values. The Y <b>101</b> values dictate intensity and the U <b>102</b> and V <b>103</b> values dictate color of the color space. Therefore in the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b>, a group of four pixels can have four different intensities but all have the same single color (e.g., Blue, Yellow, etc.). In the 4:4:4 color space <b>104</b>, on the other hand, four pixels are coded with four Y <b>105</b> values, four U <b>106</b> values and four V <b>107</b> values. As with Y values <b>102</b> of the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b>, the four Y <b>105</b> values of the 4:4:4 color space <b>104</b> dictate intensity of the color space. The four U <b>105</b> and four V <b>107</b> values of the 4:4:4 color space <b>104</b>, however, dictate color of different hue (i.e., of varied, or more than one, color) of the color space depending on the U <b>105</b> and V <b>107</b> actual values. Therefore with 4:4:4 coding, each pixel is represented by an individual intensity and an individual color via the four U <b>105</b> and four V <b>107</b> values and each pixel has color dictated by such values. In the case of each of the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b> and the 4:4:4 color space, the Y values represent data stored in memory dictating intensity of a pixel of a display device and the U and V values represent data stored in memory dictating color of the pixel of the display and the Y <b>101</b> or <b>105</b>, U <b>102</b> or <b>105</b>, and V <b>103</b> or <b>106</b> values also are the pixel, itself, of the display device at particular instant for the particular values.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a display system <b>70</b> (shown in phantom) includes a processor <b>702</b>, memory <b>704</b> communicatively connected to the processor, and a first display <b>706</b> and a second display <b>708</b> each communicatively connected to the processor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is intended primarily as an example for purposes of further explanation and comparison of the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b> (in phantom) and the 4:4:4 color space <b>104</b> (in phantom). Although in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> a single processor <b>702</b> and memory <b>704</b> is shared for the first display <b>706</b> and second display <b>708</b>, typically, the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b> is an intermediate form of a video, graphic, video or graphic frame, or other file or data stored or storable in non-transitory media (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), communicated from one device for display by another device. The terms &#x201c;video&#x201d;, &#x201c;file&#x201d;, &#x201c;graphic&#x201d; and the like, are intended herein to refer to data or data sets representing video, file, or graphic display items, including, for example, real-time video, spreadsheet, game and other visual displays and/or output of processing, in conjunction with memory and a display device, the video, file, graphic or other data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Conventional encoders (not shown) encode video and other file (via frames of the files) in 4:4:4 color space <b>104</b> for the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b>, for communication of the encoded video or file; and conventional decoders (not shown) decode the encoded video or file of the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b> and must convert, by averaging pixels as described above, the video or file (via frames of the file) for the 4:4:4 color space <b>104</b> for display. For purposes of comparison and example, the first display <b>706</b> and the second display <b>708</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for side-by-side comparison of respective pixels <b>100</b> (i.e., 4:2:0 color space), <b>104</b> (i.e., 4:4:4 color space) of the displays <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the first display <b>706</b>, four Y <b>101</b> pixels have particular intensity (i.e., from among four possible intensities) and a single set of each of U <b>102</b> and V <b>103</b> pixels have particular single color (i.e., only one color is possible for the 4:2:0 color space <b>100</b> pixel of the first display <b>706</b> as dictated by the U <b>102</b> and V <b>103</b> pixels). For the first display <b>706</b>, pixel 0 color/intensity is Y0UV, pixel 1 color/intensity is Y1UV, pixel 2 color/intensity is Y2UV and pixel 3 color/intensity is Y3UV. In the second display <b>708</b>, four Y <b>105</b> pixels have particular intensity (i.e., from among four possible intensities) and sets of four U <b>106</b> pixels and four Y <b>107</b> pixels. For the second display <b>708</b>, pixel 0 intensity/color is Y0U0V0, pixel 1 intensity/color is Y1U1V1, pixel 2 intensity/color is Y2U2V2 and pixel 3 intensity/color is Y3U3V3. As will be described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, how similar or how different the display <b>706</b> and the display <b>708</b> may appear in viewing (to a human or other viewer) depends on both the particular value for the Y, U and V pixel, respectively, of each display <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> in respective same location/orientation, and the Y, U and V pixels, respectively, surrounding the particular pixel (in respective same location/orientation) of each display <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in conjunction, other color space coding depictions <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> each illustrate one possible (from among other possibilities) four-by-six pixel areas for comparison of a 4:2:0 color space <b>201</b>, <b>301</b> and a 4:4:4 color space <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the 4:4:4 color space includes pixels of colors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. Pixels of color C<b>1</b> are located around the edges and a two-by-four pixel block of color C<b>2</b> is located in the center. The 4:2:0 color space <b>201</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (i.e., representing the same pixels of the 4:4:4 color space <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), instead, includes pixels of colors C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, C<b>5</b> and C<b>5</b>, which are averages of C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. The 4:4:4 color space <b>200</b> pixels display correct (i.e., accurate) colors. The 4:2:0 color space <b>201</b> pixels, however, show the result of the 4:2:0 UV color averaging. The 4:2:0 color space <b>201</b> coding changes the color of C<b>1</b> pixels to C<b>3</b> and C<b>5</b>, and changes the color of C<b>2</b> pixels to C<b>4</b> and C<b>6</b>, in the example. None of the pixels in the 4:2:0 color space <b>201</b> are the correct color. The incorrect pixel colors result because colors in a four-by-four pixel block are represented by a single color which is the average of the four pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the four-by-six pixel area of the 4:4:4 color space <b>300</b> includes pixels of colors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. A two-by-four pixel block of color C<b>1</b> is located in the upper left hand corner and all other pixels are of color C<b>2</b>. The two-by-four pixel block is shifted up one pixel and to the right one pixel as compared to the representation of the 4:4:4 color space <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The four-by-six pixel area of the 4:2:0 color space <b>301</b> (i.e., representing the same pixels of the 4:4:4 color space <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) also includes pixels of colors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. In fact, the 4:4:4 color space <b>300</b> and the 4:2:0 color space <b>301</b> are exactly the same. Because the two-by-four pixel block is centered on a four pixel boundary, the 4:2:0 color space <b>301</b> displays the same correct colors as the 4:4:4 color space <b>300</b>. Thus, by moving an area one pixel, the pixel's color is changed in 4:2:0 color space <b>301</b>. This explains why a TV or movie encoded in 4:2:0 color space tends to be generally acceptable for viewing, however, computer graphics (and other color intensive content display, for example, a spreadsheet, computer game, or other file) encoded in 4:2:0 color space can be visually inadequate or undesirable. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when displaying pixels of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the display <b>506</b> and the display <b>508</b> appear in viewing (to a human or other viewer) to be different; whereas, on the other hand, displaying pixels of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the display <b>506</b> and the display <b>508</b> would appear in viewing (to a human or other viewer) to be same.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a system <b>40</b> or <b>50</b> of a first computer system <b>41</b> (in phantom) includes or communicatively controls an encoding system <b>42</b> and a second computer system <b>43</b> (in phantom) includes or communicatively controls a decoding system <b>44</b>, the first computer system <b>41</b> and the second computer system <b>43</b> being communicatively connected by a wired, wireless, optical, switched, Internet, LAN, WAN or other communication network, a wire or wireless (e.g., WiFi, cellular, satellite, infrared, Bluetooth&#x2122;), or other communication link or links, or combinations of these or any other communication network or networks (collectively, communication link <b>403</b>). In certain embodiments, a unitary computer system (not shown) is both the first computer system <b>41</b> and the second computer system <b>43</b>, or parts or portions thereof are commonly shared. Hereinafter, the general term &#x201c;computer system&#x201d; is used to refer to a computer system of an encoder, decoder, or both, as applicable in the context. Further, hereinafter the term &#x201c;encode side&#x201d; is used to refer to the computer system of an applicable encoder and the term &#x201c;decode side&#x201d; is used to refer to the computer system of an applicable decoder.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The system <b>40</b>, via the encoder <b>42</b> and the decoder <b>44</b>, translates 4:2:0 color space graphics to 4:4:4 color space graphics, as follows. A 4:4:4 color space frame buffer <b>400</b> on the encode side (i.e., computer system <b>41</b>) is communicated over a communications link <b>403</b> and is reconstructed as a 4:4:4 color space frame buffer <b>406</b> on the decode side. On the encode side, a 4:4:4 color space graphics data set is in a 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>400</b>. A converter <b>401</b> of the encode side (i.e., modified in comparison to an encoder converter which converts 4:4:4 color space to 4:2:0 color space) transfers, without conversion, the UV values of the 4:4:4 color space data set to a video encoder <b>402</b> as four separate value set frames <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b>, in a sequential frame-by-frame manner. The four separate value set frames <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> are created and then each encoded by a 4:2:0 video encoder <b>402</b>. The encoded video of the value set frames <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> passes <b>403</b> from the encoder <b>402</b> for example, via communication by the encode side over a communication link <b>403</b> to a decode side, as in four sequential transfers <b>504</b>, <b>505</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>507</b>, (i.e., one for each frame) to a 4:2:0 video decoder <b>404</b> of the decode side.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the decode side, the video decoder <b>404</b> receives the sequential transfers <b>504</b>, <b>505</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>507</b> decodes the communicated encoded video of each of the value set frames <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b>, and passes the decoded data of the value set frames <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> to a converter <b>405</b> of the decode side. The converter <b>405</b> (i.e., modified in comparison to a decoder converter which converts 4:2:0 color space to 4:4:4 color space) transfers, without conversion, the same UV values, per the four value set frames <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> for the 4:4:4 color space data set (i.e., same UV values of the four frames <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> on the encode side) and stores the UV values in a 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>406</b> in four buffer segments <b>509</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>512</b> each overlaying the values from the previous buffer segment. The UV values are stored in the 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>406</b> in particular location of the 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>406</b>, consistent with the locations for the original 4:4:4 color space data set of the 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>400</b>, creating sequentially four buffer segments <b>509</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>512</b> of the frame buffer <b>406</b>. Thus. after decoding the last frame <b>503</b> of the buffer set and saving it into the frame buffer <b>406</b>, the 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>406</b> contains the buffer segment <b>512</b> having same Y, U, V values of pixels as the original values of pixels in the frame buffer <b>400</b>. The contents of the buffer segment <b>512</b> output from decoding are the same 4:4:4 color space frame as the 4:4:4 color space frame originally input for encoding.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, on the encode side, the 4:4:4 data of the frame buffer <b>400</b> is passed to the 4:4:4 to 4:2:0 converter <b>401</b>, and, without conversion from 4:4:4 to 4:2:0 color space, the converter <b>401</b> delivers the first value set frame <b>500</b> to the encoder <b>402</b>. The encoder <b>402</b> encodes the first frame <b>500</b> and delivers <b>504</b>, such as via network or other communication, the first frame <b>500</b> to the decoder side. The decoder <b>404</b> receives the first frame <b>504</b>. The decoder <b>404</b> decodes the first frame <b>504</b> and passes the decoded first frame to the 4:2:0 to 4:4:4 converter <b>405</b>. Rather than converting from 4:2:0 to 4:4:4 color space, the converter <b>405</b> instead writes, per same location as with the frame buffer <b>400</b>, the Y values (Y0/Y1/Y2/Y3) and U0/V0 values of the buffer segment <b>509</b> in the 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>406</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as buffer segment <b>500</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The same is repeated for the second value set frame <b>501</b>; however, the second frame <b>501</b> from the encode side is reconstructed by the decode side to contain U1/V1 values of the buffer segment <b>510</b>, as illustrated. As the Y values from the first frame <b>500</b> are not changed for the second frame <b>501</b> of the 4:4:4 color space, the encoder <b>402</b> simply skips coding and sending the Y values again as part of the second frame <b>501</b>. The second frame <b>501</b> is sent <b>505</b> from the encode side and, at the decoder side, received and decoded by the video decoder <b>404</b> of the decode side. After decoding by the video decoder <b>404</b>, the decoded second frame is passed to the 4:2:0 to 4:4:4 converter <b>405</b>, and without conversion, the U1/V1 values of the buffer segment <b>510</b> are saved, to same location of the 4:4:4 frame buffer <b>406</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as frame buffer segment <b>510</b>) as with frame buffer <b>400</b> for the 4:4:4 color space.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The same is repeated (as with the second frame <b>501</b>) for the third value set frame <b>502</b> and the fourth value set frame <b>503</b>. In particular, the third frame <b>502</b> includes the U3/V3 values and the fourth frame <b>503</b> includes the U2/V2 values. Each of these frames is sent <b>506</b>, <b>507</b> to the decode side, where decoded by the video decoder <b>404</b>, passed to the converter <b>405</b>, and written to the frame buffer <b>406</b> per same location for the 4:4:4 color space (shown as buffer segment <b>511</b> and buffer <b>512</b> segment, sequentially).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The frame buffer <b>406</b> now contains the complete 4:4:4 values from the encoder side, with Y/U/V values in same location of frame buffer <b>406</b> as originally of frame buffer <b>400</b>. As described above, the U/V values are sent (from encode to decode side) in a clockwise manner U0V0, U1V1, U3V3 and then U2V2; adjacent U/V pairs are always sequentially sent and written. These sequential pairs have a good chance of being identical, therefore reducing encoding/decoding processing requirements. Additionally, because Y values are sent only once, bandwidth requirements for communicating the 4:4:4 color space data set for pixels is greatly reduced in quantity of data for the resulting bit stream.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another embodiment of an encoder system <b>60</b> reduces bandwidth requirements for communicating the 4:4:4 color space data set. In the embodiment, usage of both 4:2:0 and 4:4:4 color spaces is combined when there is variation in the amount of changed data activity in the video stream. When data sets communicated change frequently between respective sets, displaying 4:4:4 pixels may have minimal visual impact, thus, no visual quality is lost by only sending 4:2:0 pixels during these times. In the embodiment, where only large changes between communicated frames occur, only the Y+U0V0 (i.e., approximately 4:2:0 color space, but no averaging of the 4 pixels) frames are sent. Further, at times when frame change is low or none, the three additional U1V1, U3V3, U2V2 value sets are sent.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for respective frames where large changes occur only Y&#x2212;U0V0 value sets are sent. First frame <b>1</b> <b>600</b> is sent <b>601</b> as a Y+U0V0 value set. As more frame change occurs frames <b>2</b> <b>602</b>, frame <b>3</b> <b>604</b> and frame <b>4</b> <b>606</b> are also sent as Y+U0V0 value sets <b>602</b>, <b>603</b> and <b>605</b> respectively. Frame <b>606</b> is the last frame that changes, so after the Y&#x2212;Y0V0 value set portion of Frame <b>606</b> is sent <b>607</b>, frame <b>4</b> value set Y&#x2212;U1V1 <b>608</b> is sent, frame <b>4</b> value set Y&#x2212;U3V3 <b>609</b> is sent and finally frame <b>4</b> value set Y&#x2212;U2V2 <b>610</b> is sent. Now the decoder side has the complete 4:4:4 frame. Rather than sending 4 frames each made up of 4 value sets for a total of 16 frames, only 7 total frames have been sent.</p>
