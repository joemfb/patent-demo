<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to membranes, and more particularly to methods of making membrane assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, membrane filters are employed in biological applications involving separation of molecules in biological fluids. Most of the membrane filters employ polymer membranes or ceramic membranes. For example, polyester, polyvinylidene fluoride, zirconium oxide, silicon carbide, alumina, are some of the materials used to make membranes. Disadvantageously, most of the existing membranes have broad pore size distribution. In other words, the size of the pores on a given membrane, or from membrane to membrane, are inconsistent and vary greatly over a large range. Due to large pore size distribution, the separation process suffers. For example, species that are intended to be retained by the filter, may pass through the filter due to large pore size distribution. Further, in case of ceramic membranes, an additional disadvantage is that these membranes are quite thick and, as a result, have relatively low throughput, thereby adversely affecting the efficiency of the filtration process. These membranes also lack the robustness desired for protein and other biomolecule processing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a membrane that has uniform pore size distribution and enhanced robustness for use in virus filtration or clearance, protein fractionation, protein purification, protein desalting, and the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Described herein are membrane assemblies and methods of making the same. In one or more embodiments, a membrane assembly may include a filtering membrane, which is an inorganic membrane. The filtering membrane may be coupled to an anodized substrate. The anodized substrate comprises a plurality of macropores. As used herein, the term &#x201c;anodized substrate&#x201d; refers to a substrate that comprises pores formed by anodization of the substrate. The pores formed by anodization may be of different shapes and sizes, such as circular pores or columnar pores. In addition, the anodized substrate may also include pores formed by etching. As used herein, the term &#x201c;macropores&#x201d; refers to pores in the substrate that may include pore columns and/or branched pores formed by anodization, or pores formed by standard lithography followed by etching, such as but not limited to plasma etch or wet chemical etch. The macropores may have a diameter in a range from about 1 micron to about 500 microns. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pore columns&#x201d; refers to pores that are columnar in shape and are formed during the anodization process. The pore columns may be formed due to selective removal of the material of the anodized substrate from determined places during processing of the membrane assembly, thereby forming a plurality of empty spaces or pore columns. The pore columns are typically arranged alternately with the columns of the material of the anodized substrate. As used herein, the term &#x201c;branched pores&#x201d; refers to pores that are formed in the columns of the material of the anodized substrate. The branched pores connect the pore columns to provide a continuous network of pores in the anodized substrate. In certain embodiments, the membrane assembly may have a diameter of upto about 12 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Proteins and other molecules with different molecular weight may be differentiated using different pore sizes. In addition, functionalization of the pore surfaces of the filtering membrane may further adjust the effective pore size in the filtering membrane and enable the filtering membrane to differentiate molecules with similar molecular weight but different charges. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the membrane may be functionalized with a chemical, a biomolecule, an antibody, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a membrane assembly <b>10</b> comprising a filtering membrane <b>12</b> having a plurality of pores <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the filtering membrane <b>12</b> has a diameter of about 12 inches. In one embodiment, the size of the pores <b>14</b> may be in a range from about 5 nanometers to about 500 nanometers. In one embodiment, the size of the pores <b>14</b> may be in a range from about 10 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. The thickness <b>15</b> of the filtering membrane <b>12</b> may be in a range from about 10 nanometers to about 50 nanometers, from about 50 nanometers to about 100 nanometers, from about 100 nanometers to about 500 nanometers, from about 500 nanometers to about 5000 nanometers, or less than about 15 nanometers. A thin membrane <b>12</b> reduces filtration or transport resistance of the fluid through the membrane and enables high flux rate during filtration. A combination of high flux rate with narrow pore size distribution is suitable for differentiating biomolecules with similar sizes, in applications such as virus filtration or clearance from protein products, protein fractionation, protein purification, protein desalting, and the like. Accordingly, it is desirable to have a lower thickness of the filtering membrane to facilitate high flux rate. In one example, the filtering membrane <b>12</b> may be a silicon membrane having a thickness of about 40 nanometers. In another example, the filtering membrane <b>12</b> may be a silicon nitride membrane having a thickness of about 30 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the filtering membrane <b>12</b> may be made of an inorganic material, such as silicon, or silicon nitride. The silicon nitride membrane may be amorphous in nature. The defect density in the silicon nitride membrane may be less than about 1 defect per centimeter square. In embodiments where the filtering membrane <b>12</b> is made of silicon, the membrane <b>12</b> may be formed of single crystal silicon, poly-crystalline silicon or amorphous silicon. The membrane <b>12</b> formed of Single crystal silicon may exhibit enhanced mechanical strength. Trans membrane pressure acceptable in case of single-crystal silicon membranes may be about 6.9 atmospheres for a 90 nanometers thick single crystal silicon membrane having a size of 100 microns by 100 microns. As used herein, the term &#x201c;trans membrane pressure&#x201d; refers to maximum pressure differential across the membrane before the membrane ruptures due to pressure experience by the membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the filtering membrane <b>12</b> may be coupled to an anodized substrate <b>16</b> comprising a plurality of macropores that include pore columns <b>20</b> and branched pores <b>18</b>. The pore columns or membrane windows <b>20</b> enable at least a portion of the filtering membrane <b>12</b> to be exposed to the sample on both top and bottom surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively, thereby acting as a bidirectional filter. The branched pores <b>18</b> connect the vertical pores or pore columns <b>20</b> to one another. The branched pores <b>18</b> connect the pore columns <b>20</b> to form a continuous network of pores in the anodized substrate <b>16</b>. The pore column diameter <b>32</b> may be varied depending on the type of application of the membrane assembly <b>10</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pore column diameter&#x201d; refers to the size of the columnar pores. In one embodiment, the pore column diameter may be in a range from about 0.5 microns to about 5 microns. The decrease in the pore column diameter increases the robustness of the filtering membrane <b>12</b>. Although not illustrated, in one embodiment, the macropores of the anodized substrate <b>16</b> may only comprise pore columns <b>20</b>. In another embodiment, the macropores may be used to pre-filter large molecules, such as cells, etc. The branched pores <b>18</b> are typically smaller in size than the pore columns <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, the diameter of the branched pores <b>18</b> may be in a range from about 0.2 microns to about 1 micron. Both the pore columns <b>20</b> and the branched pores <b>18</b> may be formed by anodization of the substrate <b>16</b>. The pore network in the anodized substrate <b>16</b> increases porosity of the filtering membrane <b>12</b>. The pores <b>14</b> of the filtering membrane <b>12</b> may be smaller in size than the branched pores <b>18</b> of the anodized substrate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one example, the thickness <b>30</b> of the anodized substrate <b>16</b> is in a range from about 50 micrometers to 1000 micrometers, or from about 300 micrometers to about 500 micrometers. The porosity of the anodized substrate is in a range from about 30 percent to about 90 percent, from about 40 percent to about 60 percent, or from about 50 percent to about 70 percent. In one embodiment, the porosity of the anodized substrate <b>16</b> may be equal to or greater than about 70 percent. In the illustrated embodiment, the macropores, that is the pore columns <b>20</b> and the branched pores <b>18</b> of the anodized substrate <b>16</b> may be present throughout the thickness <b>30</b> of the anodized substrate <b>16</b>. The pore networks formed from the pore columns <b>20</b> and branched pores <b>18</b> increase the porosity of the anodized substrate <b>16</b> and enhance the throughput of the membrane assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The membrane assembly <b>10</b> may further include an intermediate layer <b>26</b> disposed between the filtering membrane <b>12</b> and the anodized substrate <b>16</b>. The intermediate layer <b>26</b> may include channels <b>28</b> that are continuation of the pore columns <b>20</b> of the anodized substrate <b>16</b>. The intermediate layer may be made of silicon dioxide or silicon nitride, if the filtering membrane <b>12</b> is made of silicon. However, the intermediate layer may be optional if the filtering membrane <b>12</b> is silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an alternate embodiment of the membrane assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the membrane assembly <b>40</b> includes a filtering membrane <b>42</b> and an anodized substrate <b>44</b>. The filtering membrane <b>42</b> has a top surface <b>46</b> and a bottom surface <b>48</b>. The bottom surface <b>48</b> is attached to an intermediate layer <b>50</b> having pore columns <b>52</b>. The intermediate layer <b>50</b> may be made of silicon oxide or silicon nitride. The intermediate layer <b>50</b> may be optional if the filtering membrane <b>42</b> is made of silicon nitride. The intermediate layer <b>50</b> works as an etch stop layer during fabrication of the membrane assembly <b>40</b>. The anodized substrate <b>44</b> may be primarily divided into two portions, namely a first portion <b>54</b> and a second portion <b>56</b>. For filtering applications requiring anodized substrate <b>44</b> with greater thickness (for example to provide high mechanical strength), the increase in the porosity of the anodized substrate <b>44</b> serves to compensate at least partially for any loss in flux rate of the membrane assembly <b>10</b> caused by the greater thickness <b>30</b> of the anodized substrate <b>16</b>. The diameter <b>64</b> of the pores <b>62</b> may be less than about 100 micrometers. In one embodiment, the pore diameter <b>64</b> may be reduced to less than about 100 microns. Decreasing the pore column diameter may increase the robustness of the filtering membrane. To simplify the fabrication, the bottom portion of the anodized support may be patterned with pores greater than about 5 microns by standard lithography followed by an etching step. The etching may be performed by plasma etch or wet chemicals. The first portion <b>54</b> contains a network of interconnected pores that include branched pores <b>58</b> and pore columns <b>60</b>. The second portion <b>56</b> includes pores <b>62</b> having dimension <b>64</b> that is greater than the width of the pore columns <b>60</b> of the first portion <b>54</b>. The large pores <b>62</b> in the second portion <b>56</b> may guide the anodization in the first portion <b>54</b> to achieve more uniform anodization. The pores <b>62</b> can also decrease overall filtration resistance in the membrane assembly <b>40</b>, and may compensate for higher thickness <b>56</b> of the anodized substrate <b>44</b>. The thickness <b>56</b> of the anodized substrate <b>44</b> may be kept higher to provide mechanical strength, or to suit the structural requirements of the device employing the membrane assembly <b>40</b>. The distance between the pores of the anodized substrate is in a range from about 10 microns to about 100 microns, and the pore size of the pores <b>62</b> of the anodized substrate can be from 1 micron to about 1000 microns, or from about 10 microns to 100 microns. The pores <b>62</b> in the second portion can be formed by standard lithography followed by plasma etch or wet chemical etch.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one example, the thickness of the filtering membrane is increased from about 40 nanometers to a size in a range from about 80 nanometers to about 90 nanometers to enhance the robustness of the membrane assembly. The diameter of the pore columns or the membrane window is reduced from 200 millimeters to a size in a range from about 50 millimeters to about 100 millimeters. The flux rate of such an assembly with 100 nanometers thick filtering membrane is more than 50 times higher than the flux rate of the commercially available filter membranes having the same pressure differentials, where the membrane assembly, that is the inorganic membrane has a porosity of about 25 percent and the anodized substrate has a porosity of about 50 percent. The increase in the number of membrane windows or pore columns may result in the increased total filtering area of the membrane assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In certain embodiments, a method for making the membrane assembly is provided. The method may include forming an inorganic membrane layer disposed on a substrate. The inorganic layer contains a plurality of pores that may have a pore size in a range from about 5 nanometers to about 500 nanometers, or from about 10 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. The pores may be fabricated by methods such as but not limited to, self-assembly of block copolymers, or nano-imprint. Typically, block copolymers are two different polymer chains covalently bonded together on one end and molecular connectivity may force phase separation to occur on molecular-length scales. As a result, periodically ordered structures, such as cylinders, may be formed. The cylinders may be of nanometer size. The sizes and periods of the cylinders may be governed by the chain dimensions of the block copolymers. Further, the sizes and periods of the cylinders may be of the order of about 10 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. Although, structures smaller than about 10 nanometers may also be obtainable if appropriate blocks are chosen. For example, blocks of the copolymer with a high Flory-Huggins interaction parameter and decreased block lengths may be used to obtain structures smaller than about 10 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In certain embodiments, a method of making the membrane assembly is provided. The method includes forming an inorganic membrane layer disposed on a substrate, and forming a plurality of pores in the substrate at least in part using anodization. In these embodiments, the substrate may be single-crystal silicon. In one embodiment, a conducting layer is disposed on the substrate prior to forming the plurality of pores in the substrate. This may be achieved by ion implantation followed by thermal activation. Further, an etch stop layer may be disposed on the conducting layer. This etch stop layer may be optional if the filtering membrane is made of silicon nitride. In one embodiment, a plurality of openings may be formed in the porous membrane so that the openings extend through the membrane to the underlying substrate surface. One or more of the openings may be at least partially filled with an electrically conductive material to establish one electrode for the subsequent anodization. A plurality of pores in the substrate may be formed at least in part by anodization. The process of anodization may include applying a voltage or current between the established electrode and the electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates steps involved in a method of making a membrane assembly. In one embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer <b>70</b> may be used to form the membrane assembly. The SOI wafer <b>70</b> includes a silicon substrate <b>72</b>, a silica insulator layer <b>74</b>, and a silicon layer <b>76</b> disposed on the silica insulator layer <b>74</b>. The insulator <b>74</b> may act as the etch stop layer during subsequent processing. The SOI wafer <b>70</b> may be acquired from commercial sources. In one example, the SOI wafer <b>70</b> may be made by wafer bonding technique such as Smart Cut&#xae;. Alternatively, the SOI wafer may also be fabricated by SIMOX process (Separation by IMplantation of Oxygen). The silicon layer <b>76</b> of the SOI wafer <b>70</b> may be made as thin as about 20 nanometers. The diameter of the SOI wafer <b>70</b> may be up to 12-inches. In another embodiment, a silicon nitride-on-silicon wafer may be used to form the membrane assembly. The silicon nitride-on-silicon wafer includes a silicon substrate, an optional silica insulator layer, and a silicon nitride layer disposed on the silicon substrate or the silica insulator layer. The insulator may act as the etch stop layer during subsequent processing. The silicon nitride may have a stress of less than about 250 MPa, or less than about 100 MPa, or even less than about 50 MPa. The silicon nitride layer may be made as thin as about 10 nanometers. The diameter of the silicon nitride-on-silicon wafer may be upto about 12-inches. A thin silica layer <b>78</b> is then formed on the top silicon layer <b>76</b>. The silica layer <b>78</b> may be formed by deposition techniques, such as but not limited to, thermal oxidation (steam oxidation or dry oxidation) in a furnace at a temperature in a range from about 900&#xb0; C. to about 1200&#xb0; C., sputtering, e-beam evaporation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The silica layer <b>78</b> may be in the form of a thin film having a thickness in a range from about 10 nanometers to about 30 nanometers. After the deposition of the silica layer <b>78</b>, the SOI wafer <b>70</b> is implanted with a dopant. The dopant may be a p-type dopant or a n-type dopant. For example, the dopant may include boron (p-type dopant), phosphorus (n-type dopant), or other dopants to create a highly doped layer <b>80</b>. The layer <b>80</b> may be activated by a thermal treatment to create an electrically conducting layer. In one embodiment, the electrically conducting layer may have opposite carrier than the substrate <b>72</b> such that a p-n junction may be formed. Later in the process, the electrically conducting layer provides a conductive path for anodization process and enables uniform anodization across the silicon substrate <b>72</b>. In one embodiment, the existence of the p-n junction may create a depletion region in the silicon substrate <b>72</b> and add resistance to the electrical loop for anodization. This may enable more uniform anodization in the silicon substrate <b>72</b>. In another embodiment, the anodization process may be self-terminated. In this embodiment, the electrical loop is disconnected inside the where the electrical conducting layer is removed by anodization macropores. This enables uniform anodization across the silicon substrate <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Next, one or more block copolymers are deposited on the silica layer <b>78</b> in the form of a coating <b>82</b>, for example. The thickness of the block copolymer coating <b>82</b> may be in a range from about 20 nanometers to about 100 nanometers. In one example, a thickness of the block copolymer coating <b>82</b> is in a range from about 20 nanometers to about 25 nanometers. In one example, polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) block copolymers may be deposited on the silica layer <b>78</b>. In one example, polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) copolymers are employed. The size of the pores of the filtering membrane may be varied by varying the molecular weight of the block copolymers. In one embodiment, the size of the pores of the filtering membrane is in a range from about 10 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. In one example, the pore size of the filtering membrane, when using PS-b-PMMA copolymers, is about 15 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain embodiments, the block copolymer coating may be annealed. The annealing may be done above the glass transition temperature of the block copolymers. The annealing above the glass transition temperature may facilitate formation of well-ordered cylinders in the block copolymer coating. In one example, the annealing may be done in vacuum at a temperature of about 130&#xb0; C. Subsequent to annealing, a portion <b>84</b> of the block copolymer coating may be dissolved and the remaining portion <b>86</b> may be used for formation of pores in the underlying silica layer <b>78</b>. For example, when employing polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) block copolymers, the PMMA phase may be selectively dissolved (for example in glacial acetic acid) and the remaining PS phase may be used in the formation of the pores in the underlying silica layer <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, the selectively dissolved copolymer coating <b>82</b> may be anisotropically etched to remove portions of the underlying silica layer <b>78</b> to form pores in the silica layer <b>78</b>. In one example, trifluoromethane (CHF<sub>3</sub>) may be used to selectively remove silica and form pores <b>90</b> in the silica layer <b>78</b>. Selective etching may be done in a Reactive Ion Etch (RIE) chamber. Subsequently, another etching treatment may be carried out to form pores <b>90</b> in the silicon layer <b>76</b> to form the filtering membrane <b>91</b>. In one example, the filtering membrane <b>91</b> is formed so that the porous surface area of the membrane has a diameter up to 12-inches. In one example, the second etching may be carried out by plasma comprising a combination of hydrogen bromide, chlorine and oxygen with the silica layer <b>78</b> acting as etch mask. This step may be performed in a reactive ion etch (RIE) chamber, an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etcher, or an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma etcher, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">After the formation of the pores <b>90</b> an optional protection layer <b>92</b> is deposited on the pores <b>90</b> to protect the pores <b>90</b> during anodization of the substrate <b>72</b> to form the plurality of macropores and pore columns. In one example, the protection layer <b>92</b> may be made of polymer if HF-based electrolytes are used for anodization. The thickness of the protection layer <b>92</b> is in a range from about 1 micrometer to about 50 micrometers. The protection layer <b>92</b> may be formed by spin coating followed thermal hardening.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a photoresist mask <b>94</b> may be disposed and patterned by standard lithographic techniques on the protection layer <b>92</b>. The photoresist mask <b>94</b> is used to form openings <b>96</b> for electrical connections required for anodization. In the illustrated embodiment, the electrical connections may be made on the silicon substrate <b>72</b> by patterning openings <b>96</b> through the filtering membrane <b>91</b>, the insulator layer <b>74</b>, and stop on the electrically conducting layer <b>80</b>. The openings <b>96</b> may be formed on the protection layer <b>92</b> by using standard lithography process, removal of the insulating layer <b>74</b> and filtering membrane <b>91</b> may be done either by plasma etch, or wet chemical etch. The openings <b>96</b> may be at least partially filled with an electrically conductive material <b>97</b>. In one embodiment, where metal is filled in the openings <b>96</b>, the metal may be deposited using deposition processes, such as but not limited to, e-beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, or sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to form pore columns <b>98</b> and branched pores <b>100</b> throughout the silicon substrate <b>72</b>, the wafer may be anodized in hydrofluoric acid (HF) based solutions. Non-limiting examples of HF based solutions may include aqueous solution of HF with ethanol, an organic solution of HF with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), an organic solution of HF with dimethyl formamide (DMF), hydrofluoric acid with an inorganic solution (such as Buffered Oxide Etch), or combinations thereof. The concentration and the applied current in the electrolytic cell during etching may be varied and optimized with respect to etching rate and suitability of the resulting structure. In one embodiment, the existence of the p-n junction between the electrically conducting layer and the silicon substrate may create a depletion region in the silicon substrate <b>72</b> and add resistance to the electrical loop for anodization. This may enable uniform anodization in the silicon substrate <b>72</b>. In another embodiment, the anodization process may be self-terminated. During anodization, as the etching progresses, at least a portion of the insulator silica layer <b>74</b> may also get etched. However, since there is no potential across the filtering membrane <b>91</b>, the filtering membrane <b>91</b> is protected from anodization. After the formation of the openings <b>96</b>, the protective layer <b>94</b> may be subsequently removed by organic solvents or oxygen plasma etch.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, patterns for macropores <b>102</b> are initially formed in a portion <b>104</b> of the substrate <b>72</b>. The macropores <b>102</b> may be formed by standard lithographic techniques followed by partial etch. Non-limiting examples of partial etch may include plasma etch or wet chemicals (KOH, or TMAH). Subsequently, the remaining portion <b>106</b> of the silicon substrate <b>72</b> may be subjected to anodization to form pore network <b>108</b>. The diameter of the macropores may be greater than about 1 micron, or greater than about 10 microns. Pre-patterned pores <b>102</b> assist in the anodization process and simplify anodization of the substrate <b>72</b> when the silicon substrate is thick. Anodization occurs where the electrolytes and the electrodes have smallest resistance, therefore only the portion <b>106</b> is anodized. Next, the protective silica layer <b>94</b> is removed by buffered oxide etch or diluted hydrogen fluoride.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, during fabrication of the membrane assembly, guiding patterns may be formed on the bottom surface of the substrate <b>107</b> to guide the anodization process and to achieve uniform anodization in the substrate <b>107</b>. That is, the guiding pattern may be formed on the surface of the substrate <b>107</b> that is opposite to the surface, which is closest to the filtering membrane. In one example, a silicon nitride layer may be deposited on the bottom surface of the substrate to form the guiding pattern in the substrate. The pattern may be formed, for example, by employing standard lithography. Subsequent to the formation of the pattern, the silicon nitride layer may be removed, for example, by plasma etch. The patterns may be designed in such a way that the patterns <b>112</b> closer to the center of the substrate <b>107</b> are larger so as to provide lower electrical resistance during anodization. Similarly, patterns <b>110</b> closer to the edge of the substrate <b>107</b> may be made smaller to provide for higher electrical resistance during anodization. This kind of distribution of the size of the pattern enables uniform current distribution during anodization so that macropores are formed throughout the volume of the substrate <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The filtering membrane with pores needs to be robust and strong for large-area application such as virus filtration for pilot and/or production scale. The strength of the exposed filtering membrane windows is a function of the width/diameter of the pore column or membrane window size. Typically, the membrane is stronger for smaller membrane windows. The maximum trans-membrane pressure differential can be calculated by the following equation:</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a comparative study of the maximum allowable trans-membrane pressure (ordinate <b>120</b>) with respect to size of the macropores (abscissa <b>122</b>) in the anodized substrate for membrane assemblies employing silicon and silicon nitride filtering membranes with different thickness values. The pore size represented by the arrow <b>121</b> represents the range of pore sizes of the macropores formed during anodization. The pore size represented by the arrow <b>123</b> represents the range of pore sizes of the pores or patterns formed by patterning (such as etching and/or lithography) the substrate prior to anodization. Curves <b>126</b> and <b>129</b> represent membrane assemblies with silicon filtering membranes having thickness values of 100 nanometers and 200 nanometers, respectively.

Whereas, the size of the pores in the filtering membranes of membrane assemblies <b>128</b> and <b>129</b> is about 200 nanometers.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The membrane assembly may be employed to remove viruses during the manufacture of bio-therapeutic drug products such as biopharmaceuticals and plasma derivatives, or commercial production of therapeutic products. In one example, separation of biomolecules may include clearance of viruses from protein products. The thin but robust filtering membrane enabled by small macropores in the anodized substrate reduces the filtration resistance and increases the flux-rate of the protein products. The very narrow pore size distribution in the filtering membrane enables efficient separation of viruses from the protein products while maintaining high flux-rate of the protein products. For example, the membrane assembly having a filtering membrane with a thickness of about 100 nanometers and pore size of about 20 nanometers may provide greater than 50 to 100 times flux-rate of the protein products compared with some polymer-based virus filtering membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another example, separation of biomolecules may include protein desalting or protein fractionation and purification. As will be appreciated, efficient protein desalting is a required preparation step for many biological samples. The desalted samples may then be used for a variety of downstream proteomics applications including but not limited to mass-spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), electrophoresis (on-line), process analytical technologies (PAT), enzymatic assay separation, and nanowire based protein sensing. In one example, the membrane assembly may be coupled to down-stream detection technologies for in-line or on-chip desalting prior to the protein detection. The filtering membranes may provide properties that facilitate in-situ protein analysis. For example, properties such as narrow pore distribution, fast desalting rate, fast filtration rate, and minimized sample loss are some of the properties that are provided by the low thickness membranes. Conventional polymer or ceramic-based membranes suffer from slow filtration rate due to high thickness (typically greater than about 100 microns), broad pore size distribution and filtration loss within the membrane. Further, it is difficult to integrate conventional membranes for in-line or on-chip applications. The filtering membrane may be fabricated from single-crystal silicon and may be made with low thickness while having the mechanical integrity provided by the anodized substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Protein purification may either involve separating one or more proteins from biological fluids or sample. Alternatively, protein purification may also refer to separating a particular type of protein from a biological fluid, such as serum. As will be appreciated, protein purification is vital for the characterization of the function, structure, and interactions of the protein of interest. The starting material is usually a biological tissue or a microbial culture. The various steps in the purification process may free the protein from a matrix that confines it, separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties and binding affinity. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the membrane may be functionalized to increase the affinity of the membrane for a particular type of protein, for example. Small pore size distribution of the membrane facilitates purification or desalting without losing many of the small molecular weight proteins. The membrane of the present technique is also suitable for protein fractionation. As will be appreciated, &#x201c;protein fractionation&#x201d; refers to division of the total biological fluid into different component parts. For example, protein fractionation may include separation of two or more types of proteins based on their molecular weight and size.</p>
