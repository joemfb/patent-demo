</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">US Publication 20070265442 describes a process for the preparation of fosaprepitant dimeglumine using monobenzyl ester fosaprepitant as an intermediate; but it neither discloses nor characterizes the polymorph obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,336 describes morpholine compounds including fosaprepitant and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The U.S. '336 patent exemplifies the process for the preparation of fosaprepitant dimeglumine as amorphous powder by lyophilization of an aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Fosaprepitant in solid state, isolated form has not been reported in the literature as of date. Also polymorphs of fosaprepitant neutral form have not been reported in the literature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The difference in the physical properties of different solid state forms results from the orientation and intermolecular interactions of adjacent molecules or complexes in the bulk solid. Accordingly, polymorphs are distinct solids sharing the same molecular formula, while having distinct physical properties, which may be advantageous relative to other solid state forms of the same compound or complex.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The discovery of fosaprepitant in solid state provides a new opportunity to improve the performance of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), fosaprepitant dimeglumine or other salts, by producing solid forms of pure fosaprepitant having improved characteristics, such as stability, flowability, and solubility. The solid state form of a compound may also affect its behavior on compaction and its storage stability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, there is a need in the art to provide fosaprepitant in solid state and possible polymorphic forms of fosaprepitant. The availability of neutral fosaprepitant in solid form would be an added advantage in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of fosaprepitant such as fosaprepitant dimeglumine useful in the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations, particularly parental dosage forms for the treatment of emesis, nausea, cancer therapy toxicity.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The obtained neutral fosaprepitant can be dried under conditions, which avoid degradation of the product, can be from about 25&#xb0; C. to about 35&#xb0; C., preferably at 25&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C. and at reduced pressure of about 5 mbar to about 20 mbar, preferably at about 10 mbar, for about 1 hour to 48 hours, preferably for about 24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The present invention provides that the neutral form, which is in the solid state form, of fosaprepitant, obtained by the process described herein, may optionally be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of fosaprepitant by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. A preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salt is the fosaprepitant dimeglumine. The dimeglumine salt may be prepared by a method including, but not limited to, reacting the neutral form of fosaprepitant with N-methyl-D-glucamine. Typically, the fosaprepitant is dissolved in an organic solvent and combined with a solution of acid or base used to obtain the desired salt of fosaprepitant.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Fosaprepitant in solid state, in its isolated form has not been reported in the literature as of date. Moreover, the polymorphs of fosaprepitant neutral form have not been reported in the literature.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The difference in the physical properties of different solid state forms results from the orientation and intermolecular interactions of adjacent molecules or complexes in the bulk solid. Accordingly, polymorphs are distinct solids sharing the same molecular formula yet having distinct advantageous physical properties compared to other solid state forms of the same compound or complex.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The solid state form of a compound may affect its behavior on compaction and its storage stability. Fosaprepitant in solid state provides an opportunity to improve the performance of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) formulation, fosaprepitant dimeglumine or other salts relative to stability, flowability, and solubility.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Fosaprepitant in solid state would be an added advantage in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of fosaprepitant such as fosaprepitant dimeglumine, which is useful in the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations particularly parental dosage forms for the treatment of emesis, nausea, cancer-induced vomiting and nausea.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The process of present invention is simple, efficient, cost effective, ecofriendly, robust, reproducible, commercially viable, industrially feasible to produce the desired amorphous form or crystalline form of fosaprepitant.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Fosaprepitant dimeglumine, by nature, is a hygroscopic and heat sensitive compound, which leads to instability problems. The amorphous fosaprepitant dimeglumine obtained by lyophilization of an aqueous solution as disclosed in the '336 patent suffers from instability. The amorphous fosaprepitant dimeglumine loses its stability upon exposure to normal room temperature, as well as at about 2&#xb0; C.-8&#xb0; C. The amorphous fosaprepitant dimeglumine loses its amorphous nature and transforms into crystalline form. Thus, additional stabilizers or carriers are required to make the amorphous fosaprepitant dimeglumine stable immediately upon isolation from the aqueous solution. This, then, would lend difficulty in handling and make it unsuitable for desired pharmaceutical formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">It is desirable, when in the amorphous form, that an active pharmaceutical product, retain its form from the time of manufacture to the time it is formulated and consumed by the patient in need thereof. Hence it is essential to provide a stable amorphous form of fosaprepitant dimeglumine.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As discussed above, the present invention provides a stable amorphous fosaprepitant dimeglumine, having stability at temperatures of about 2&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity below at least 60%; and a process for the preparation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Fosaprepitant dimeglumine, by nature, is a heat and moisture sensitive compound and suffers from instability problems, where it rapidly degrades at normal room temperature, losing its morph.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Polymorphism is the occurrence of different crystalline forms of a single compound and it is a property of some compounds and complexes. Thus, polymorphs are distinct solids sharing the same molecular formula, yet each polymorph may have distinct physical properties. Therefore, a single compound may give rise to a variety of polymorphic forms where each form has different and distinct physical properties, such as different solubility profiles, different melting point temperatures and/or different x-ray diffraction peaks. Since the solubility of each polymorph may vary, identifying the existence of pharmaceutical polymorphs is essential for providing pharmaceuticals with predicable solubility profiles. It is desirable to investigate all solid state forms of a drug, including all polymorphic forms, and to determine the stability, dissolution and flow properties of each polymorphic form. Polymorphic forms of a compound can be distinguished in a laboratory by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and by other methods such as, infrared spectrometry.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Additionally, polymorphic forms of the same drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient, can be administered by itself or formulated as a drug product (also known as the final or finished dosage form), and are well known in the pharmaceutical art to affect, for example, the solubility, stability, flowability, tractability and compressibility of drug substances and the safety and efficacy of drug products.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Towards this end, it has been the endeavor of pharmaceutical scientists to provide amorphous forms of crystalline drug substances, more specifically, thermodynamically stable forms of drug substances, which would have the strengths of the crystalline forms, viz. thermodynamic stability, and those of the amorphous form, viz. enhanced solubility, rapid onset of action and an enhanced bioavailability.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Accordingly, there remains a need to provide amorphous form of fosaprepitant dimeglumine in substantially stable form for use in a pharmaceutical preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The availability of a substantially stable amorphous form of fosaprepitant dimeglumine, having a stability at temperatures of about 2&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity below at least 60%; would add a powerful tool in the treatment of emesis, nausea, cancer-induced nausea and vomiting.</p>

The sample was placed then into a Mettler Toledo DSC822<sup>e </sup>equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooling unit and allowed to equilibrate at 30&#xb0; C. until stable heat flow response was seen. A dry nitrogen purge gas at a flow rate of 50 ml/min was used to produce the inert atmosphere and prevent oxidation of the sample during heating.
