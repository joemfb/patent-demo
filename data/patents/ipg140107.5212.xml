<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to medical devices and, more particularly, to systems for interfacing with implantable medical devices, amongst other things.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Implantable medical devices are commonly used to treat patients with various conditions. By way of example, conditions of the heart such as tachycardia, bradycardia, and heart failure, amongst others, are now routinely treated using implantable cardiac rhythm management (CRM) devices. In addition, various conditions such as epilepsy, chronic pain, Parkinson's Disease, and depression can now be treated using implantable neurostimulation devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patients with such implantable devices may periodically visit clinicians for follow-up appointments. During these follow-up appointments, clinicians may perform tasks such as adjusting the therapy settings of the implanted device in addition to accessing and reviewing data gathered by the device. In order to perform these tasks, the clinician will typically use an external device, such as a programmer-recorder-monitor (PRM) device in order to interrogate the implanted medical device and reprogram it if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When programming and data acquisition activities are complete, the interrogation session between the implanted device and the PRM device can be terminated. Session termination generally requires some affirmative action on the part of the operator of the PRM device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention are related to systems for interfacing with implantable medical devices, amongst other things.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example and drawings, and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When programming and data acquisition activities of an interrogation session are complete, the interrogation session between the implanted device and the PRM device can be terminated. Session termination generally requires some affirmative action on the part of the operator of the PRM device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, in some circumstances, the operator may forget to take the required affirmative action to terminate the programming session. When this happens, confusion may develop. For example, when the next patient is seated for device interrogation the PRM device may still be communicating with the implanted medical device in the last patient seen. As such, the operator may believe the data shown on the PRM device reflects the patient seated in front of them, while the data actually reflects the previous patient.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, implanted medical devices generally have a finite amount of battery-stored energy. When the battery-stored energy is used up, the device must generally be replaced through a costly surgical procedure. As such, conservation of energy stored by the device is a high priority.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this regard, it should be noted that some of the communication features that are active during interrogation sessions can use up significant amounts of the implanted device's energy. For example, many implanted devices include a feature that allows them to transmit real-time data to an external medical device such as a programmer-recorder-monitor (PRM) device or an advanced patient management (APM) device. Transmission of this data in real-time can be useful for a clinician because they can observe many aspects of the patient's condition. However, transmission of this data in real-time can also use up a significant amount of energy. Another communication feature that is frequently active during device interrogation is radio-frequency (RF) communication. RF communication with an implanted device can offer advantages over more traditional inductive-based communication schemes including an enhanced range of data transmission. However, keeping RF communication turned on can also use up a substantial amount of the implanted device's energy.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the invention can help avoid these issues by appropriately querying the system user and disabling features in a phased approach in response to a lack of user activity. As such, embodiments of the invention can help to reduce operator confusion and conserve the energy of the implanted device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of an example implementation, consistent with at least one embodiment of the invention. An implantable medical device <b>114</b> is disposed within a patient <b>112</b>. Exemplary implantable medical devices can include, but are not limited to, implantable cardiac rhythm management devices (including pacemakers, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices, remodeling control therapy (RCT) device, cardioverter/defibrillators, or pacemaker-cardioverter/defibrillators, and the like), neurological stimulators, implantable sensors, and the like. One example of a cardiac rhythm management device is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,562,841, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference. The implantable medical device <b>114</b> can be in communication with one or more stimulation leads <b>122</b> that are positioned within proximity of the patient's heart <b>126</b>. The implantable medical device <b>114</b> can be in communication with an external medical system <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the implantable medical device <b>114</b> can be in wireless communication with the external medical system <b>116</b>. The external medical system <b>116</b> can include a telemetry circuit (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to facilitate communication with the implanted medical device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various types of wireless technologies can be used in order to facilitate communication between the external medical system <b>116</b> and the implantable medical device <b>114</b>. By way of example, communication can be carried out through induction, radiofrequency (RF) transmission, acoustically, or the like. In contrast to induction, RF transmission generally allows for a greater range of transmission and does not required the use of a wand device to be placed directly over the site of the patient where the implanted device is located. However, RF communication consumes a significant amount of energy. As described below, RF communication between the implantable medical device <b>114</b> and the external medial system <b>116</b> can be deactivated in accordance with various embodiments herein in order to conserve the energy of the implantable medical device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The implantable medical device <b>114</b> can be configured to gather data and transmit data to the external medical system <b>116</b>. For example, the implantable medical device <b>114</b> can include sensors and gather data such as heart rate data, electrogram data, pressure data, volume data, flow rate data, temperature data, chemical analyte data, activity data, and accelerometer data. The implantable medical device <b>114</b> can transmit real-time data to the external medical system <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the external medical system <b>116</b> can display the real-time data through a video output <b>118</b>. As described below, real-time transmission of data from the implantable medical device <b>114</b> to the external medical system <b>116</b> can be deactivated in order to conserve the energy of the implantable medical device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The external medical system <b>116</b> can also transmit commands to the implantable medical device <b>114</b> in order to control its functioning. By way of example, the external medical system <b>116</b> can send commands to the implantable medical device in order to program its pacing mode, stimulation amplitude, stimulation timing, sensing parameters, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The external medical device <b>116</b> can be any type of device or combination of devices capable of interrogating the implantable medical device <b>114</b>. In many embodiments, the external medical system <b>116</b> is a PRM device. Exemplary programmer/recorder/monitor devices include the Model 3120 Programmer available from Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, Mass. However, it will be appreciated that the external medical system <b>116</b> can also take on other forms such as an in-home monitoring system or advanced patient management system. An exemplary in-home monitoring system is the LATITUDE&#xae; advanced patient management system, available from Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, Mass. Aspects of exemplary in-home monitoring systems are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,978,182, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The external medical device <b>116</b> can be configured to detect indicators of system use. Indicators of system use can include, but are not limited to, user input such as through a keyboard, mouse, stylus, or trackball, distance of the implanted medical device relative to the external medical device, presence of a patient in a specific area, such as in a seat adjacent to the external medical device. Distance and position can be determined in various ways such as through the use of GPS functionality, signal strength indicators, and the like. In some embodiments, the external medical device <b>116</b> can include a clock circuit in order to track the passage of time. The external medical device <b>116</b> can be configured to keep track of the amount of time that has passed since the last indicator of system use was detected.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The external medical device <b>116</b> can be configured to take various actions if the amount of time that has passed since the last indicator of system use was detected exceeds a threshold value. For example, the external medical device <b>116</b> can be configured to take actions to confirm the identity of the patient and/or take action to conserve the energy of the implanted device. Specifically, the external medical device <b>116</b> can be configured to query a system user and/or deactivate one or more transmission features of the implanted medical device <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the external medical device <b>116</b> can deactivate transmission of real-time data from the implanted medical device <b>114</b>, deactivate long-range telemetry functionality (such as RF transmission) of the implanted medical device <b>114</b>, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, multiple actions to conserve energy can be taken simultaneously. In other embodiments, actions to conserve energy can be taken at different times in a tiered or phased approach.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram in accordance with at least one embodiment of the technology disclosed herein. In this embodiment, the implantable medical device starts in a fully functional operational state <b>210</b>. For example, the implantable medical device would be in a fully functional operational state <b>210</b> at the beginning of an interrogation session. In a fully functional operational state <b>210</b>, the external medical device interrogates the implanted medical device to collect stored data and/or real-time data in addition to sending instructions to the implantable medical device. In the fully functional operational state <b>210</b>, the RF telemetry functionality of the implanted medical device can be enabled and data can be sent to the external medical device in real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another operation, the system determines whether a first period of time has elapsed without system use <b>220</b>. By way of example, the system can determine when the last indicator of system use was registered and whether or not a threshold amount of time has passed since that point in time. Indicators of system use can include any sort of system user input, for example, such as moving a mouse, entering data via a keyboard, or touching the screen on a touch screen device. In another example, indicators of system use can include the distance between the implantable medical device and the telemetry circuit. If the distance is less than some threshold amount, then this can be taken as an indicator of system use. In some embodiments the distance between the implantable medical device and the telemetry circuit, when beyond a threshold amount, serves as a constructive indicator that a period of time has elapsed without system use. In another example, indicators of system use can include a tether-type switch that, when triggered, constructively signifies to the system that a period of time has elapsed without system use <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first period of time or threshold amount of time can be any period of time that would be useful to a medical treatment provider, clinician, or patient. In certain embodiments, the first period of time can range from about 30 seconds to about 30 minutes. In some embodiments, the first period of time can range from about 30 seconds to about 15 minutes. In another embodiment, the first period of time is about 2 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the first period of time can be configurable by a system user. In some embodiments, the first period of time can vary depending on the particular data being gathered. Other circumstances can also impact the length of the first time period. For example, if the device interrogation is taking place in conjunction with an implant procedure the first period of time may be longer than if the device interrogation is simply taking place as part of a routine follow-up visit.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the system can use a self-adjusting timer that starts in response to an indicator of system use, and restarts upon another indicator of system use. In another example, the timer can be ongoing, and the system can be configured to subtract the current time from the time at which there was an indicator of system use in order to determine whether a first period of time has elapsed without system use.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If a first period of time has not elapsed without system use, then the system can return to a fully functional operational state <b>210</b>. However, if a first period of time has elapsed without system use, the system user is queried <b>230</b> in this embodiment. The system can be configured to query a system user regarding whether the session is still pending or the identity of the patient, for example. The system user query can be, for example, a pop-up window requesting confirmation of the patient by the user. In another example, the system can request that the system user enter the name or identifying information of the patient whose implantable medical device is currently being interrogated. In another example, the system can request the user end the current session, continue the current session, start a new session, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another operation, the system can determine whether or not user acknowledgement has been received <b>235</b>. If user acknowledgement is received, then the system can return to the fully functional operational state <b>210</b>. However, if a user acknowledgement has not been received, then the system can proceed to determine whether or not an additional period of time, after the first period of time, has elapsed without system use <b>240</b>. If not, then the system can return to determining whether or not user acknowledgement has been received <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The additional period of time can range from about 2 minutes to about 60 minutes beyond the end of the first period of time. In an embodiment, the additional period of time is 13 minutes. The additional period of time can be configurable by the system user, and also can vary depending on the particular data being gathered. Other factors can also determine the length of the additional time period, such as whether the implanted medical device is currently being implanted at the time of interrogation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the additional period of time can be configurable by the system user. In some embodiments, the additional period of time can vary depending on the particular data being gathered. Other circumstances can also determine the length of the additional time period. For example, if the medical device is currently being implanted, the additional period of time may be longer than if a routine follow-up visit is taking place.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If an indicator of system use is not recognized or user acknowledgement not received within an additional period of time, the system can deactivate device features <b>250</b>. The device features can be data transmission features, but are not limited to such. In one embodiment, the system is configured to deactivate real-time data transmission from the implanted medical device after a additional period of time in which one or more indicators of system use are not detected. In another embodiment, the system is configured to deactivate RF transmission of data from the implanted medical device. The system can further be configured to query a system user and/or provide notification to the user of feature deactivation <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the system can be configured to deactivate features after periods of user inactivity in a phased or tiered manner. By way of example, certain features can be deactivated after a certain period of time while other features can be deactivated after a different period of time. In some embodiments, features that are most energy intensive are deactivated first while other features are deactivated later. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram in accordance with at least one embodiment of the technology disclosed herein. From a fully functional operation state <b>310</b>, the system determines whether a first period of time has elapsed without system use <b>320</b>. If so, the system queries the system user <b>330</b>. If not, the system can return to a fully functional operational state <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After querying the system user <b>330</b>, the system can evaluate whether or not user acknowledgement has been received <b>335</b>. If user acknowledgement has been received, then the system can return to a fully functional operational state <b>310</b>. However, if user acknowledgement has not been received, then the system can proceed to evaluate whether a second period of time has elapsed without system use <b>340</b>. If so, the system deactivates real-time data transmission <b>350</b>. If not, then the system can return to evaluating whether or not user acknowledgement has been received <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In cases where user acknowledgment has not been received, the system can also determine whether a third period of time has elapsed without system use <b>360</b>. The third period of time can begin after the second period of time has elapsed in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the third period of time can overlap with the second period of time. In other embodiments the third period of time can at least partially overlap with the second period of time, but extend beyond the duration of the second period of time. In at least some embodiments, the third period of time ranges from about 10 minutes to about 2 hours beyond the second period of time. In an embodiment, the third period of time is about 45 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the third period of time can be configurable by the system user. In some embodiments, the third period of time can vary depending on the particular data being gathered. Other circumstances can also determine the length of the third period of time. For example, if the medical device is currently being implanted, the third period of time may be longer than if a routine follow-up visit is taking place.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">If a third period of time has elapsed without system use and/or user acknowledgement, the system can deactivate long-range telemetry functions of the implanted medical device, such as radio frequency (RF) telemetry <b>370</b>. In some embodiments long range telemetry functions can be deactivated, and inductive telemetry can be activated. The system can further be configured to query the system user and provide notification to the user of feature deactivation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a scenario in which real-time transmission of data is deactivated after a second period of inactivity and RF telemetry is deactivated after a third period of inactivity. However, it will be appreciated that in some embodiments, these deactivations can be reversed in order. In other words, in some embodiments, RF telemetry is deactivated after a second period of inactivity and real-time transmission of data is deactivated after a third period of inactivity. In addition, deactivations of system functionality can include deactivation of features other than RF telemetry and deactivation of real-time transmission of data. In fact, in some embodiments deactivations can extend to all functions of the implanted medical device that are used in conjunction with an interrogation session but that are not used in the ordinary course of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a two-phase sequence of operations taken in response to user inactivity. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a three-phase sequence of operations taken in response to user inactivity. It will be appreciated that in various embodiments the number of phases of operations taken in response to user inactivity can be a few as one phase and can be as many as ten phases.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As mentioned above, when the system determines that a first period of time has elapsed without system use, in some embodiments the system can be configured to query the system user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exemplary display screen <b>400</b> illustrating an implementation of an exemplary query. In this view, a pop-up window <b>410</b> is shown on the display screen <b>400</b> having a first button <b>420</b> and a second button <b>430</b>. The pop-up window <b>410</b> can serve to query the system user regarding the identity of the patient (John Smith). The first button <b>420</b> requests confirmation by the system user of the identity of the patient and the second button <b>430</b> provides the system user with the option of ending the session. As an example, the system user could end the session in the event that the patient whose implanted medical device is being interrogated is not John Smith. In another example, a system user could end the session in the event that the interrogation of John Smith's implanted medical device is complete. In some embodiments additional buttons can be provided such as a &#x201c;new patient&#x201d; button that can begin a new session for a new patient.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The display screen <b>400</b> can include various features such as data <b>450</b> from the implanted device. In some embodiments, the data <b>450</b> can represent real-time electrogram data. In some embodiments, the data <b>450</b> can include graphical data, textual data, or both. The display screen <b>400</b> can also include navigational features such as a set of tabs <b>460</b> to quickly move between different screens.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In various embodiments herein, when the system determines that a second or additional period of time has elapsed without system use, the system can deactivate one or more device features with or without also querying the system user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exemplary display screen consistent with at least one embodiment of the technology disclosed herein, wherein the system has determined that a second period of time has elapsed without system use. In this example, real-time electrogram data has been deactivated, and so graphical data <b>550</b> is no longer displayed on the screen. The pop-up window <b>510</b> notifies system user that the electrogram data has been deactivated. The pop-up window <b>510</b> also queries the system user regarding the identity of the patient, providing a first button <b>520</b> and a second button <b>530</b> to either confirm the patient identity, or end the session, respectively. Additional buttons can also be included.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the system can determine whether or not a third period of time has elapsed without system use. The system response to such a scenario is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is an exemplary display screen consistent with at least one embodiment of the technology disclosed herein. In this display screen <b>600</b>, graphical data <b>650</b> and RF telemetry are both deactivated. The pop-up window <b>610</b> provides notice of RF telemetry deactivation to the system user. Additionally, the pop-up window <b>610</b> notifies the system user that the real-time data transmission has been deactivated. The pop-up window <b>610</b> also queries the system user regarding the identity of the patient, providing a first button <b>620</b> and a second button <b>630</b> to either confirm the patient identity or end the session. Additional buttons can also be included.</p>
