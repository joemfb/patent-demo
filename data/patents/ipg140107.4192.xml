<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of Singapore Patent Application No. 201004955-9, filed on Jul. 8, 2010; entitled &#x201c;Interlocking System for Connecting a Programmable Logic Controller and a Power Supply&#x201d;, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to industrial automation and control systems, such as those used in industrial and commercial settings. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to techniques for interlocking modules of such systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Industrial automation and control systems are known and are in use for controlling factory automation and the like. Such systems include various components such as programmable logic controllers, semiconductor power electronic circuits, power supplies, motor starters, relays etc. that are utilized to monitor and control a process/system. Typically, the programmable logic controller examines a series of inputs reflecting the status of a controlled process and changes outputs affecting control of the controlled process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In traditional automation and control systems, various components, such as controllers and power supplies, of the system are interconnected together as modules. These modules are often assembled by mounting the components to panels housed in large electrical enclosures. Certain components cooperate with other components to expand functionality. For example, industrial controllers may provide for connection of additional I/O modules to add input and output functionality to the controller. Indeed, adding an I/O module may allow the industrial controller to interface with a specific type of control equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In traditional automation and control systems, the components/modules are connected using interlocking systems that utilize numerous mechanical parts for locking the modules together. It is now recognized that the mechanical parts of such interlocking systems can be cumbersome, delicate, and expensive. Furthermore, the complex nature of such systems typically requires significant manipulation by a user to activate. For example, a typical interlocking system for components of a control system may require at least three actions for the assembly of the components such as sliding the components and activating various different locking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is now recognized that it is desirable to develop an interlocking system for securing modules that provides a rigid connection between the modules while facilitating the alignment of such modules.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment of the present invention, an interlocking system for connecting a programmable logic controller and a power supply of an industrial control and automation system is provided. The interlocking system includes a plurality of vertical slots and a latch disposed on a side surface of the power supply. The latch includes a first attachment feature disposed along a flexible tongue cantilevered proximate an opening in a housing of the power supply such that the tongue can flex into the opening. The interlocking system also includes a plurality of hooks and a second attachment feature formed on a side surface of the programmable logic controller. The plurality of hooks are configured to slide along and engage with the plurality of vertical slots such that the programmable logic controller and the power supply are held together horizontally and the second attachment feature is configured to couple with the first attachment feature to resist disengagement of the plurality of hooks and the plurality of vertical slots.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect, an industrial automation and control system is provided. The industrial automation and control system includes an enclosure and a plurality of monitoring and/or control modules disposed within the enclosure. The modules are configured to perform a monitoring and/or control function for a process. The adjacent monitoring and/or control modules are connected using a plurality of hooks and corresponding vertical slots on mating surfaces of the adjacent modules. Further, the adjacent modules are secured using a latch and a receiving slot of the mating surfaces of the modules.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect, a method for connecting a power supply to a programmable logic controller is provided. The method includes aligning a mating surface of the programmable logic controller and a mating surface of the power supply and slidably engaging a plurality of hooks extending from one of the mating surfaces with corresponding vertical slots formed in the other of the mating surfaces. The method also includes engaging a latch cantilevered from the one of the mating surfaces with an attachment feature of the other mating surface such that the plurality of hooks and vertical slots are substantially prevented from slidably disengaging.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As discussed in detail below, embodiments of the present technique function to provide an interlocking system for connecting modules such as a programmable logic controller and a power supply of an industrial control and automation system. In particular, the present technique provides features with slide and auto-locking mechanism that facilitate assembly of such modules in a single assembly action.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">References in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an exemplary embodiment&#x201d;, indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning now to the drawings and referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> an exemplary industrial automation and control system <b>10</b> is illustrated. The system <b>10</b> includes an enclosure <b>12</b>, such as an electrical cabinet, in which electrical components such as monitoring and/or control components are housed. Example components in the unit may include relays, motor starters, and programmable logic controllers (PLC), among others.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The enclosure <b>12</b> may be suitable, for example, for assembly of a motor control center or use with industrial, commercial, marine, or other electrical systems. The enclosure <b>12</b> may be made of any suitable material, such as heavy gage sheet metal, reinforced plastics, and so forth. In certain embodiments, the enclosure <b>12</b> includes individual compartments or other structures that support the electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the illustrated embodiment, the system <b>10</b> includes a monitoring/control module <b>14</b> assembled in accordance with present techniques and adapted to interface with components of a machine system/process <b>16</b>. It should be noted that such an interface in accordance with embodiments of the present techniques may be facilitated by the use of certain network strategies. Indeed, an industry standard network may be employed, such as DeviceNet, to enable data transfer. Such networks permit the exchange of data in accordance with a predefined protocol, and may provide power for operation of networked elements.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The process/system <b>16</b> may take many forms and include devices for accomplishing many different and varied purposes. For example, the process/system <b>16</b> may comprise a compressor station, an oil refinery, a batch operation for making food items, a mechanized assembly line, and so forth. Accordingly, the process/system <b>16</b> may comprise a variety of operational components generally represented by reference numeral <b>18</b>, such as electric motors, valves, actuators, temperature elements, pressure sensors, or a myriad of manufacturing, processing, material handling and other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the process/system <b>16</b> may comprise control and monitoring equipment for regulating process variables through automation and/or observation. For example, the illustrated process/system <b>16</b> comprises sensors <b>20</b> and actuators <b>22</b>. The sensors <b>20</b> may comprise any number of devices adapted to provide information regarding process conditions. The actuators <b>22</b> may include any number of devices adapted to perform a mechanical action in response to an input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated, these sensors <b>20</b> and actuators <b>22</b> are in communication with the monitoring/control module <b>16</b> (e.g., a programmable logic controller). In one embodiment, the sensors <b>20</b> and actuators <b>22</b> may communicate with the monitoring/control module <b>14</b> via one or more I/O modules <b>24</b> coupled to the monitoring/control module <b>14</b>. The I/O modules <b>24</b> may transfer input and output signals between the monitoring/control module <b>14</b> and the controlled process/system <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments, these devices (sensors <b>20</b> and actuators <b>22</b>) may be utilized to operate process equipment. Indeed, they may be utilized within process loops that are monitored and controlled by the process/system <b>16</b>. Such a process loop may be activated based on process inputs (e.g., input from a sensor <b>20</b>) or direct operator input received through a user interface device <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The I/O modules <b>24</b> may be integrated with the control/monitoring device <b>14</b>, or may be added or removed via expansion slots, bays or other suitable mechanism. For example, to add functionality to the control/monitoring device <b>14</b>, additional I/O modules <b>24</b> may be added, such as if new sensors <b>20</b> or actuators <b>22</b> are added to control the process/system <b>16</b>. These I/O modules serve as an electrical interface to the controller and may be located proximate or remote from the controller including remote network interfaces to associated systems.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The I/O modules <b>24</b> may include input modules that receive signals from input devices such as photo-sensors and proximity switches, output modules that use output signals to energize relays or to start motors, and bidirectional I/O modules, such as motion control modules which can direct motion devices and receive position or speed feedback. In some embodiments, the I/O modules <b>24</b> may convert between AC and DC analog signals used by devices on a controlled machine or process and +5-volt DC logic signals used by the controller. Additionally, some of the I/O modules <b>24</b> may provide digital signals to digital I/O devices and received digital signals from digital I/O devices. Further, in some embodiments, the I/O modules <b>24</b> that are used to control motion devices or process control devices may include local microcomputing capability on the I/O module.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the I/O modules <b>24</b> may be located in close proximity to a portion of the control equipment, and away from the remainder of the controller. Data is communicated with remote modules over a common communication link, or network, wherein modules on the network communicate via a standard communications protocol. Many industrial controllers can communicate via network technologies such as Ethernet (e.g., IEEE802.3, TCP/IP, UDP, EtherNet/IP, and so forth), ControlNet, DeviceNet. or other network protocols (Foundation Fieldbus (H1 and Fast Ethernet) Modbus TCP, Profibus) and also communicate to higher level computing systems</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the illustrated embodiment, the system <b>10</b> also includes a display <b>28</b> such as an LCD or other display configured to display output parameters such as operating parameters of the process/system <b>10</b>, temperature and pressures sensed by the sensors <b>20</b>, position information of the actuators <b>22</b> and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated embodiment, adjacent modules of the system <b>10</b>, such as components of the monitoring/control module <b>14</b>, are connected using an interlocking system in accordance with present techniques. The interlocking system includes features on mating surfaces of the modules for securing the modules together as will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of an assembly <b>30</b> having two modules <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> coupled together using an interlocking system <b>36</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the module <b>32</b> includes a programmable logic controller and the module <b>34</b> includes a power supply. Specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, the power supply <b>34</b> is a 24 volts AC power supply configured to power the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>. As illustrated, the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> each include a variety of components and features that facilitate assembly and/or operation of the logic controller <b>32</b> and power supply <b>34</b>. For example, the assembly <b>30</b> may include any number of slots, vents, plugs, connectors, or other interface structures. Such structures may facilitate operation of the assembly <b>30</b>, coupling between assembly components, coupling with other features (e.g., a DIN rail), and/or operation of the assembly <b>30</b>. Certain features of the assembly <b>30</b> may be coupled (e.g., via plug-in connections) to a backplane that provides for distribution of power and data signals. Such backplanes are currently in use throughout industrial applications to provide data and control signals to and from programmable logic controllers, computer components and peripherals, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this exemplary embodiment, the interlocking system <b>36</b> includes coupling features such as hooks, slots, and other structures for securing the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> together. It should be noted that when the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> are coupled together, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, certain aspects of these attachment features are hidden from view. Accordingly, these attachment features are described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, wherein the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> are illustrated separate from one another. However, certain attachment features can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> includes hooks <b>42</b> that are engaged with slots (not shown) on the power supply <b>34</b>. The engagement between the hooks <b>42</b> and the slots may be achieved by sliding the hooks <b>42</b> and slots together and then holding them in place relative to one another with another attachment feature.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the power supply <b>34</b> includes a flexible tongue or tab <b>44</b> that is configured to engage a corresponding feature of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> to resist or prevent sliding of the hooks <b>42</b> along the slots. In other words, when the tab <b>44</b> is engaged, it may prevent the hooks <b>42</b> and slots from becoming disengaged by preventing them from sliding relative to one another. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tab <b>44</b> is easily accessible to a user. Indeed, a user can simply press the tab <b>44</b> such that it flexes away from engagement, allowing the user to slidably disengage the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the assembly <b>30</b> also includes features configured to facilitate attachment of the assembly <b>30</b> to a support (e.g., a wall of an electrical cabinet). Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes attachment features such as indicated by reference numerals <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> disposed on the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> respectively. Such attachment features are configured to facilitate coupling of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> with a panel or a rail (not shown). For example, in certain embodiments, the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> may be secured to an electrical cabinet using fasteners that pass through the attachment features <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> into a back panel of the electrical cabinet. In other embodiments, other attachment features such as represented by reference numerals <b>39</b> and <b>41</b> are configured to couple these components with DIN rails.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With regard to attachment of the assembly <b>30</b> to a support, the interlocking system <b>36</b> facilitates coupling of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> separate from the support and then subsequent attachment of the assembly <b>30</b> to the support as a unit. For example, a user can couple the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> together with the power supply <b>34</b> outside of a cabinet and then install them together within the cabinet as a single assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> may include expansion and communication features. For example, the assembly <b>30</b> may include interface slots, communication ports, and receptacles configured to receive one or more screws or other fasteners to secure them to the panel. Specifically, for example, in the illustrated embodiment, the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> includes ports to receive programmable modules such as represented by reference numerals <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. These programmable modules <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are adapted to manage aspects of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of such modules may be coupled to the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> for performing the control/monitoring function of a specified process and/or a machine system.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary configuration <b>60</b> of the power supply <b>34</b> of the assembly <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the power supply <b>34</b> includes a plurality of vertical slots such as represented by reference numerals <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. Furthermore, a tab or latch <b>66</b> is disposed on a side surface <b>68</b> (mating surface) of the power supply <b>34</b>. The vertical slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> and the latch <b>66</b> facilitate assembly of the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> while providing a rigid connection between the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>. It should be noted that while, in this exemplary embodiment, the power supply <b>34</b> includes two vertical slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> formed adjacent to edges of the side surface <b>68</b> of the power supply <b>34</b>, in other embodiments, the number and size of the vertical slots may be configured based upon the size of the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>. Such slots may be formed using any suitable machining or molding techniques and may be formed in the power supply <b>34</b> to conserve space in the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>. However, in some embodiments, such slots may be formed in the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> with corresponding hooks on the power supply <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The latch <b>66</b> includes a first attachment feature <b>70</b> disposed along a flexible tongue <b>72</b> that is cantilevered proximate an opening <b>74</b> in a housing <b>76</b> of the power supply <b>34</b> such that the tongue <b>72</b> can flex into the opening <b>74</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the first attachment feature <b>70</b> includes a detent. However, in other embodiments the first attachment feature <b>70</b> may include a receptacle, a pin, a snap, or the like. Again, the size of the first attachment feature <b>70</b> may be determined based upon the size of each of the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the material of the latch <b>66</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the latch <b>66</b> is formed of a plastic material. However, other suitable materials may be employed for the latch <b>66</b> as well. It should be noted that, in the illustrated embodiment, the latch <b>66</b> is an extension of the housing <b>76</b> of the power supply <b>60</b>. However, the latch <b>66</b> may be individually fabricated and coupled to the side surface <b>68</b> of the housing <b>76</b> using a suitable adhesive, or through a bolted coupling. Additionally, the latch <b>66</b> can be disposed on the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> in some embodiments. However, including the latch <b>66</b> as a component of the power supply <b>34</b> conserves space in the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary configuration <b>90</b> of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> of the assembly <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As illustrated, the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> includes a plurality of hooks such as represented by reference numerals <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> and a second attachment feature <b>96</b> disposed on a side surface <b>98</b> of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>. As with the vertical slots of the power supply <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the number and size of the hooks is configurable based upon the size of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this exemplary embodiment, the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> are configured to slide along and engage with corresponding vertical slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> of the power supply <b>34</b> such that the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> are held together horizontally. Moreover, the second attachment feature <b>96</b> is configured to couple with the first attachment feature <b>70</b> of the power supply <b>34</b> to resist disengagement of the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> and the vertical slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. In other words, once the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are engaged with the slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, the engagement of the first attachment feature <b>70</b> with the second attachment feature prevents vertical movement, and, thus, prevents decoupling of the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> from the slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the second attachment feature <b>96</b> includes a lug configured to receive the detent <b>70</b> of the power supply <b>34</b>. However, in other embodiments, the second attachment feature <b>96</b> may include different physical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The exemplary configurations <b>60</b> and <b>90</b> of the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> illustrate single first and second attachment features <b>70</b> and <b>96</b> disposed at pre-determined locations on the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> respectively. However, a plurality of such attachment features may be employed in certain other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are cross-sectional views <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> of the assembly <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> secured using the coupling or attachment features described above. As illustrated, in configuration <b>110</b> the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> are engaged with the slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> of the power supply <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In operation, the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are configured to slide along and engage with the slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> respectively during the assembly operation. Moreover, the first attachment feature <b>70</b> of the latch <b>66</b> of the power supply <b>34</b> slidably engages with the second attachment structure <b>96</b> of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> in response to the same sliding movement of the power supply <b>34</b> relative to the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> that facilitates engagement of the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> with the slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described before, the first attachment feature <b>70</b> is disposed along a flexible tongue that flexes to facilitate engagement of the first attachment feature <b>70</b> with the second attachment feature <b>96</b> of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, a sound is generated by engagement of the latch <b>66</b> with the second attachment structure <b>96</b>, which alerts a user to such an engagement. Further, it should be noted that the latch <b>66</b>, the second attachment feature <b>96</b>, the vertical slots <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> and the hooks <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> facilitate alignment and securing together of the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> and the power supply <b>34</b> in a single assembly action thereby eliminating the need of multiple assembly operations for alignment and locking functions. Advantageously, the assembly using the single action described above eliminates separate locking mechanism thereby resulting in added efficiency relative to traditional techniques and cost savings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>120</b> for connecting two modules together such as the power supply <b>34</b> and the programmable logic controller <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. At block <b>122</b>, a mating surface of the programmable logic controller is aligned with a mating surface of the power supply. In one exemplary embodiment, an operator performing the assembly of these modules determines the mating surfaces of the programmable logic controller and the power supply by observing the attachment features and then aligns them such that one mating surface abuts the other mating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, hooks extending from one of the mating surfaces are slidably engaged with corresponding vertical slots formed in the other of the mating surfaces, as represented by block <b>124</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the hooks extend from the mating surface of the programmable logic controller. At block <b>126</b>, a latch cantilevered from the one of the mating surfaces is engaged with an attachment feature of the other mating surface such that the hooks and the vertical slots are substantially prevented from slidably disengaging and such that an audible snap is generated by engagement. Moreover, the assembled controller and the power supply are mounted on a support (e.g., an electrical panel) using suitable coupling techniques, as represented by block <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The various aspects of the structures described hereinabove may be used for connecting adjacent monitoring/control modules, such as those typically found in industrial automation and control systems. As described above, the technique utilizes features on mating surfaces of the adjacent modules that facilitate alignment and securing of modules in a single assembly action.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Advantageously, the modules can be easily assembled before mounting them within an enclosure or racks of industrial systems. Further, the technique also facilitates independent removal of such modules from the enclosure in a single action without disturbing the adjacent modules. For example, if maintenance or replacement of a module is required, the module can be independently removed from the enclosure by selectively disengaging the latch from the receiving slot and vertically sliding each module.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the above described implementations may be appropriately scaled and/or reinforced based upon the size of the modules. The techniques described above provides a simple assembly process for connecting modules while providing substantial cost savings achieved by reduced number of mechanical parts required for the locking mechanism.</p>
