<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention generally relates to a system and technique to suppress the acquisition of torque noise on a multi-component streamer.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Seismic exploration involves surveying subterranean geological formations for hydrocarbon deposits. A survey typically involves deploying seismic source(s) and seismic sensors at predetermined locations. The sources generate seismic waves, which propagate into the geological formations creating pressure changes and vibrations along their way. Changes in elastic properties of the geological formation scatter the seismic waves, changing their direction of propagation and other properties. Part of the energy emitted by the sources reaches the seismic sensors. Some seismic sensors are sensitive to pressure changes (hydrophones), others to particle motion (e.g., geophones), and industrial surveys may deploy only one type of sensors or both. In response to the detected seismic events, the sensors generate electrical signals to produce seismic data. Analysis of the seismic data can then indicate the presence or absence of probable locations of hydrocarbon deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some surveys are known as &#x201c;marine&#x201d; surveys because they are conducted in marine environments. However, &#x201c;marine&#x201d; surveys may be conducted not only in saltwater environments, but also in fresh and brackish waters. In one type of marine survey, called a &#x201c;towed-array&#x201d; survey, an array of seismic sensor-containing streamers and sources is towed behind a survey vessel.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an embodiment <b>10</b> of a marine-based seismic data acquisition system in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. In the system <b>10</b>, a survey vessel <b>20</b> tows one or more seismic streamers <b>30</b> (one exemplary streamer <b>30</b> being depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) behind the vessel <b>20</b>. In one non-limiting example, the streamers <b>30</b> may be arranged in a spread in which multiple streamers <b>30</b> are towed in approximately the same plane at the same depth. As another non-limiting example, the streamers may be towed at multiple depths, such as in an over/under spread, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The seismic streamers <b>30</b> may be several thousand meters long and may contain various support cables (not shown), as well as wiring and/or circuitry (not shown) that may be used to support communication along the streamers <b>30</b>. In general, each streamer <b>30</b> includes a primary cable into which is mounted seismic sensors that record seismic signals. The streamers <b>30</b> contain seismic sensor units <b>58</b>, which include, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, multi-component sensors. Each multi-component sensor is capable of detecting a pressure wavefield and at least one component of a particle motion that is associated with acoustic signals that are proximate to the sensor. Examples of particle motions include one or more components of a particle displacement, one or more components (inline (x), crossline (y) and vertical (z) components (see axes <b>59</b>, for example)) of a particle velocity and one or more components of a particle acceleration.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Depending on the particular embodiment of the invention, the multi-component seismic sensor may include one or more hydrophones, geophones, particle displacement sensors, particle velocity sensors, accelerometers, pressure gradient sensors, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention, a particular seismic sensor unit <b>58</b> may include at least one particle motion sensor <b>70</b> for purposes of measuring a component of particle motion along a particular sensitive axis <b>59</b> (the x, y or z axis, for example). As a more specific example, the seismic sensor unit <b>58</b> may include a particle velocity sensor that is oriented to acquire a measurement of a particle velocity along the depth, or z, axis; a particle velocity sensor to sense a particle velocity along the crossline, or y, axis; a particle velocity sensor to sense a velocity along the inline, or x, axis; multiple particle velocity sensors to sense particle velocities along all three (x, y and z) axes; etc. Alternatively, in other embodiments of the invention, the particle motion sensor(s) of each seismic sensor unit <b>58</b> may sense a particle motion other than velocity (an acceleration, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to the seismic sensor units <b>58</b>, the marine seismic data acquisition system <b>10</b> also includes one or more seismic sources <b>40</b> (two exemplary seismic sources <b>40</b> being depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), such as air guns and the like. In some embodiments of the invention, the seismic source(s) <b>40</b> may be coupled to, or towed by, the survey vessel <b>20</b>. Alternatively, in other embodiments of the invention, the seismic source(s) <b>40</b> may operate independently of the survey vessel <b>20</b>, in that the source(s) <b>40</b> may be coupled to other vessels or buoys, as just a few examples.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As the seismic streamers <b>30</b> are towed behind the survey vessel <b>20</b>, acoustic signals <b>42</b> (an exemplary acoustic signal <b>42</b> being depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), often referred to as &#x201c;shots,&#x201d; are produced by the seismic source(s) <b>40</b> and are directed down through a water column <b>44</b> into strata <b>62</b> and <b>68</b> beneath a water bottom surface <b>24</b>. The acoustic signals <b>42</b> are reflected from the various subterranean geological formations, such as an exemplary formation <b>65</b> that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The incident acoustic signals <b>42</b> that are created by the source(s) <b>40</b> produce corresponding reflected acoustic signals, or pressure waves <b>60</b>, which are sensed by the seismic sensors of the seismic sensor unit <b>58</b>. It is noted that the pressure waves that are received and sensed by the seismic sensors include &#x201c;up going&#x201d; pressure waves that propagate to the sensors without reflection, as well as &#x201c;down going&#x201d; pressure waves that are produced by reflections of the pressure waves <b>60</b> from an air-water boundary, or free surface <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The seismic sensors of the seismic sensor units <b>58</b> generate signals (digital signals, for example), called &#x201c;traces,&#x201d; which indicate the acquired measurements of the pressure wavefield and particle motion.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For particularly the case in which the streamer <b>30</b> has a solid core, the particle motion sensors <b>70</b> may acquire a significant degree of noise in addition to the desired particle motion signal. The noise is attributable to several types of noise sources and may include vibration noise, flow noise, acoustic noise, incoherent noise, etc. The noise acquired by the particle motions sensors <b>70</b> may also be a function of torque noise, which is introduced due to the eccentric positions of the particle motion sensors <b>70</b> with respect to the inline axis of the streamer <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">More specifically, as depicted in an exemplary cross-section of the streamer <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a particle motion sensor <b>70</b> may be mounted in the streamer <b>30</b> such that the sensor <b>70</b> is positioned eccentrically with respect to a central axis <b>80</b> of the streamer cable.

Due to this eccentric positioning, the particle motion sensor <b>70</b> is subject to rotation about the axis <b>80</b> as the streamer <b>30</b> is being towed, and as a result, the measurement acquired by the particle motion sensor <b>70</b> contains torque noise that is attributable to this rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the particle motion sensor <b>70</b> has three primary axes for purposes of sensing particle motion: a vertical, or z, axis <b>72</b>; a crossline, or y, axis <b>74</b>; and an inline, or x, axis <b>76</b>, which is directed out of the page and indicated by the &#x201c;dot&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Because the torque noise is related to the rotation of the streamer <b>30</b> about the inline, or x, axis <b>80</b>, the effect of the torque noise on the measured local crossline, or y, and vertical, or z, components are different, as described below:

</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The &#x3c4;<sub>y</sub>(t,x) torque noise is usually significant for moderate values of eccentricity e and is referred to as the &#x201c;torque noise&#x201d; in the following discussion. It is noted that as set forth in Eq. 2, the cross component of the noise, N<sub>z</sub>(t,x), also contains a torque noise component, e{dot over (&#x3b8;)}<sup>2</sup>(t,x). However, because the torque induced noise on the local z, or vertical, component is proportional to the square of the angular velocity, the amplitude of this term is relatively small and is considered to be negligible in the following discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, the propagation of the torque noise on the y component is slower than the seismic signal and faster than the transversal vibration noise. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a frequency-wavenumber (f-k) plot <b>100</b> of a synthetically-generated noise record acquired by particle motion sensors. This noise record includes transversal vibration noise <b>106</b> and torque noise <b>108</b>. Also depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a signal cone <b>104</b>, which defines the boundaries in f-k space for the expected seismic signal. As can be seen in this particular example, the torque noise <b>108</b> contaminates mostly the lowest frequencies of the useful seismic frequency band, as the torque noise <b>108</b> intersects the lower frequency portion of the signal cone <b>104</b>. In general, it is difficult through signal processing to discriminate the torque noise inside the signal cone <b>104</b> from the desired particle motion signal.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for purposes of suppressing the degree of torque noise that is present in the signal cone <b>104</b>, two multi-component sensors may be disposed at each inline sensor position. In this regard, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (which depicts a transverse cross-section) a streamer <b>150</b>, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, may contain two multi-component particle motion sensors (i.e., an upper sensor <b>70</b><i>a </i>and a lower sensor <b>70</b><i>b</i>, where each sensor <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>has the same design <b>70</b>) at each inline sensor location. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the upper <b>70</b><i>a </i>and lower <b>70</b><i>b </i>sensors are located at different positions in the same y-z plane, and more particularly, each sensor <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b </i>has a different phasing, or angle, about the inline axis <b>80</b>. In this manner, the upper sensor <b>70</b><i>a </i>is disposed at an angle <b>162</b> of 90&#xb0; (measuring in the clockwise direction) with respect to a crossline axis <b>81</b> of the streamer; and the lower sensor <b>70</b><i>b </i>is disposed at an angle <b>164</b> of 270&#xb0; with respect to the crossline axis <b>81</b>. In other words, the upper <b>70</b><i>a </i>and lower <b>70</b><i>b </i>sensors are spaced apart by 180&#xb0; about the inline axis <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Both sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>are disposed by the distance e from the inline streamer axis <b>80</b>; and inline (x) <b>76</b> (denoted by a &#x201c;dot&#x201d; to show the axis <b>76</b> pointing out of the page), crossline (y) <b>74</b> and depth (z) <b>72</b> axes of the sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>are oriented in the same directions such that the inline axes <b>76</b> of the sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>are parallel, the crossline axes <b>74</b> of the sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>are parallel and the depth axes <b>72</b> of the sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>are parallel. The corresponding lengthwise cross-section of the streamer <b>150</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in which each &#x201c;dot&#x201d; in the sensor <b>70</b> represents the crossline axis <b>74</b> pointing out of the page.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The different phasings of the particle motion sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>induce torque noise with opposite polarities on the measurements that are acquired by the sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b</i>, as described below:

<br/>
where &#x201c;N<sub>y</sub><sub><sub2>1 </sub2></sub>(t,x)&#x201d; represents the crossline, or y, component of the total noise acquired by the particle motion sensors <b>70</b><i>a</i>; and &#x201c;N<sub>y</sub><sub><sub2>2 </sub2></sub>(t,x)&#x201d; represents the crossline, or y, component of the total noise acquired by the particle motion sensors <b>70</b><i>b</i>. As can be seen from Eqs. 4 and 5, the measurements acquired by the particle motion sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>may be added together to significantly suppress, or even eliminate, the sensed torque noise, as the sum of the measurements from particle motion sensors does not have a torque noise component because the opposite polarity components cancel each other out. However, the number of particle motion sensors for the streamer <b>150</b> is doubled, as compared to conventional arrangements. Additionally, the extra x and z components of the particle motion sensors are subject to similar noise modes and allow for only negligible additional noise attenuation.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in accordance with other embodiments of the invention, a seismic streamer <b>200</b> (a lengthwise cross-section of which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be used. For the streamer <b>200</b>, a single multi-component particle motion sensor <b>70</b> is disposed at each inline sensor position along the length of the streamer <b>200</b>, and each particle motion sensor <b>200</b> is disposed the same distance e away from the inline axis <b>80</b> of the streamer <b>200</b>. Unlike conventional arrangements, however, the phasing of the particle motion sensors <b>70</b> about the inline streamer axis <b>80</b> vary along the length of the streamer <b>200</b>. The variation in phasing can be seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is an illustration <b>220</b> of crossline cross-sections of the streamer <b>200</b> (i.e., y-z plane cross-sections) at adjacent sensor locations. As can be seen, the multi-component axes of the sensors <b>70</b> are aligned, and the sensor locations in the y-z plane vary by 180&#xb0; from one adjacent sensor <b>70</b> to the next.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">More specifically, beginning with the leftmost cross-section that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sensor <b>70</b><i>a </i>is located at the 90&#xb0; angle <b>162</b> about the inline axis <b>80</b>; the next adjacent sensor <b>70</b><i>b </i>(to the left) is located at the 270&#xb0; angle <b>164</b> about the inline axis <b>80</b>; the next adjacent sensor <b>70</b><i>a </i>(to the left) is located at the 90&#xb0; angle <b>162</b> about the inline axis <b>80</b>; etc. In other words, a 180&#xb0; phasing scheme is used such that (excluding the first and last sensors <b>70</b> on the streamer <b>200</b>), each sensor <b>70</b> is disposed at an angle about the inline axis <b>80</b> that is 180&#xb0; apart from the angles at which the immediately adjacent sensors (one on each side) are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Due to the above-described phasing, the measured torque noise is wavenumber modulated, as described below for the crossline component of the total noise:

where &#x201c;n&#x201d; refers to the index of the corresponding sensor. In other words, the odd-indexed sensors <b>70</b> perceive the torque noise with an opposite phase than the even-indexed sensors <b>70</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the particle motion sensors <b>70</b> may be arranged in two groups (a first group of sensors <b>70</b><i>a </i>and a separate second group of sensors <b>70</b><i>b</i>, for example) which form two separate sensor networks (one for each group) that may each independently transfer the acquired data to an onboard acquisition system. In other words, a dual sensor network may be used instead of a single sensor network. This type of implementation may increase the reliability of the data acquisition system. In this regard, if a failure occurs at one of the sensor networks, the other network is available to transfer the acquired data, although the sensor spacing is increased by a factor of two due to the failure. Other variations are contemplated and are within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A phasing scheme other than the above-described alternating 180&#xb0; phasing scheme may be employed in accordance with other embodiments of the invention. As a specific example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an illustration <b>300</b> of crossline cross-sections of a streamer <b>320</b> at inline sensor locations in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. For this embodiment, each inline sensor location has a single multi-component sensor <b>70</b>, similar to the streamer <b>200</b>. However, unlike the streamer <b>200</b>, the streamer <b>320</b> employs a 90&#xb0; phasing scheme in that the sensor locations are rotated by 90&#xb0; about the inline streamer axis <b>80</b> from one adjacent sensor <b>70</b> to the next. Thus, each sensor <b>70</b> has either a 90&#xb0; angle (as shown by an exemplary sensor <b>70</b><i>a </i>being disposed at a 90&#xb0; angle <b>302</b> about the inline axis <b>80</b> with respect to the crossline axis <b>81</b>); a 0&#xb0; angle (as shown by an exemplary sensor <b>70</b><i>c </i>being disposed at a 0&#xb0; angle about the inline axis <b>80</b> with respect to the crossline axis <b>81</b>); a 270&#xb0; angle (as shown by an exemplary sensor <b>70</b><i>b </i>being disposed at a 270&#xb0; angle <b>306</b> about the inline axis <b>80</b> with respect to the crossline axis <b>81</b>); or an 180&#xb0; angle (as shown by an exemplary sensor <b>70</b><i>d </i>being disposed at an 180&#xb0; angle <b>308</b> about the inline axis <b>80</b> with respect to the crossline axis <b>81</b>). As with the other embodiments, the respective crossline, inline and depth axes of the sensors <b>70</b> remain aligned, regardless of their angles about the inline streamer axis.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Comparing the streamers <b>200</b> and <b>320</b>, the streamer <b>200</b> pushes the torque noise further away from the desired seismic signal in the frequency-wavenumber domain than the streamer <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Irregularities, such as sensor misalignment, manufacturing or mounting irregularities (as non-limiting examples) may generate a component of the torque noise, which is not wavenumber modulated out of the signal cone, as described above. Instead, this component interferes with the seismic signal inside the signal cone. More specifically, one or more of the above-described irregularities may impart two components to the torque noise: a first component that is suppressed or eliminated due to the wavenumber modulation as described above; and due to one or more irregularities, a second component that interferes with the seismic signal inside the signal cone. Although the second component may be considerably smaller than the first component in magnitude, the second component may still be relatively strong relative to the amplitude of the seismic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In accordance with embodiments of the invention disclosed herein, techniques may be applied for purposes of removing the second component of the torque noise from the signal cone. The techniques and systems that are disclosed herein may thus, be applied to remove or enhance the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the particle motion measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The ability to remove the second component of the torque noise stems from the differences between the first component and the seismic signal; and the similarities between the first and second components. More specifically, the first component of the torque noise has significantly different apparent velocities than the seismic signal. Therefore, the first component of the torque noise may be estimated and removed by using a selective frequency-wavenumber filter, without altering the seismic signal. This first component of the torque noise corresponds to an estimate of the term e{umlaut over (&#x3b8;)}(t,x)(&#x2212;1)<sup>n(x) </sup>in Eq. 6 above and is also indicative of the angular acceleration {umlaut over (&#x3b8;)}(t,x).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The angular acceleration of the cable of the streamer about the central cable axis (i.e., about the inline, or x, axis) is the source of both components of the torque noise. Therefore, the estimate of the angular acceleration {umlaut over (&#x3b8;)}(t,x), provided by the first component, is highly correlated to the second component of the torque noise.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described herein, the estimated first component of the torque noise, which may be derived using a selective frequency wavenumber filter, may then be used to derive an estimate of the second component of the torque noise. With this estimate of the second component of the torque noise, the second component may then be subtracted from the content of the signal cone to effectively attenuate the second component of the torque noise from the desired seismic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention, a technique <b>400</b> includes providing (block <b>402</b>) particle motion sensors to acquire particle motion data indicative of a seismic signal and torque noise while in tow on one or more streamers and orienting (block <b>406</b>) the particle motion sensors on the streamer(s) to modulate a wavenumber of a first component of the torque noise away from a signal cone, which is associated with the seismic signal. The technique includes receiving (block <b>408</b>) the particle motion data acquired by the particle motion sensors, estimating (block <b>410</b>) the first component of the torque noise and based at least in part on the estimated first component, estimating (block <b>414</b>) a second component of the torque noise inside the signal cone. The technique <b>400</b> includes suppressing (block <b>418</b>) the second component of the torque based at least in part on the estimated second component.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, a technique <b>450</b> that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be used for purposes of estimating the second component of the torque noise based on the estimated first component of the torque noise. Pursuant to the technique <b>450</b>, a transfer function is first determined (block <b>454</b>), which relates the first and second components. The transfer function is applied to the first component to derive the second component of the torque noise, pursuant to block <b>458</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the transfer function is unknown or significantly complicated to be useful in practice, an adaptive interference cancellation approach may be used in lieu of the transfer function, in accordance with other embodiments of the invention. In this regard, according to a technique <b>480</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the estimated first component of the torque noise may be used as a noise reference in the adaptive interference cancellation approach, pursuant to block <b>482</b>. Thus, the estimated angular acceleration is used as a noise reference to estimate the second component of the torque noise in the adaptive interference calculation, pursuant to block <b>484</b>. Depending on the particular embodiment of the invention, the adaptive algorithms may be such algorithms as a least mean square (LMS) algorithm, a recursive least square (RLS) or a QR decomposition-based recursive least squares (QR-RLS) algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As a more specific example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a system <b>500</b> for performing the adaptive interference cancellation according to an embodiment of the invention. The system <b>500</b> includes an adaptive filter <b>517</b> that receives an estimate <b>512</b> of the first component of the torque noise and produces an estimate <b>515</b> of the second component of the torque noise. This estimate <b>515</b> is subtracted (via adder <b>510</b>) from the combined seismic signal and second component <b>505</b> to produce a corresponding estimate <b>520</b> of the seismic signal. This estimate <b>520</b> is then used to refine operation of the adaptive filter <b>514</b>. More specifically, a cross-correlation between the estimates <b>512</b> and <b>520</b> is calculated to adjust the filter <b>514</b> such that when the filtering properties are appropriately adjusted, the cross correlation is minimized. Other systems and techniques may be used, in accordance with other embodiments of the invention.</p>
