<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Restaurants have long offered the convenience of allowing patrons to place food orders prior to entering the restaurant for dine-in, carry-out, and delivery orders. Traditionally, such orders were placed over the telephone. In this traditional method, a single individual seeking to place an order for a group of individuals determines what each individual wants from a menu, places the combined order via the telephone, and pays for the order. This conventional method has a number of disadvantages. For example, a single individual is required to determine what each participant in the order wants to eat, to manually combine the order, and to place the combined order. In addition, the order creator is required to pay for the order and either seek payment from order participants in advance of the order or after the order has been placed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the proliferation of the Internet, online ordering systems have been developed. For example, individual restaurants have allowed patrons to place orders online. An individual typically goes to a restaurant's website, places the order and either picks up the order or has the order delivered. While online ordering eliminates the need to use the telephone, the order must still be manually combined, placed, and paid for by the order initiator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">E-commerce systems aimed at facilitating group orders likewise require manual intervention by the order initiator to complete the group order. For example, one system requires the order initiator to review and submit individual orders that are placed as part of a group order. Such a system is unsuitable for food orders where the order creator may be unavailable at the cut-off time of the group order but may wish the order to be completed in his or her absence.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem with conventional e-commerce systems is that they lack payment flexibility. For example, conventional e-commerce systems require payment for individual transactions to be made at the time the transactions occur, whether for individual or group orders. There is no capability of optionally allowing the creator or the individuals to pay for a group order.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there exists a long felt need for methods, systems, and computer program products for automatic online group ordering of food from a restaurant.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer program products for automatic online group ordering of food from a restaurant. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary process for automatic online group ordering of food from a restaurant according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in step <b>100</b>, input for creating a group online food order from a restaurant is received. The input defines a group of individuals to invite to participate in the group order. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a system <b>200</b> for automatic online group ordering of food from a restaurant includes a group ordering server <b>202</b> that receives input from an individual terminal <b>204</b> defining a group of individuals to participate in a food order. As will be described in more detail below, the group of individuals may be any group of individuals specified by the order creator. For example, the group may be a group of employees in a single office or distributed across multiple offices or geographic locations. A group manager <b>206</b> receives the order definition. The order definition specifies the individuals and the restaurant to which the order should be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in step <b>102</b>, in response to the input, invitations are automatically and electronically sent to the individuals, inviting the individuals to participate in the group order. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, group manager <b>206</b> communicates the details of the group to an invitation manager <b>208</b>. Invitation manager <b>208</b> sends invitations to individual terminals <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> inviting the individuals to participate in the group order. In one implementation, the invitation is sent via email. The email may include a link that allows the invitee to connect to order manager <b>214</b> and place the group order. The link may include a group order identifier usable by order manager <b>214</b> to identify individual orders associated with a group order. An example email will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in step <b>106</b>, the individual orders are combined into a group order. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an order manager <b>214</b> may combine the individual orders into a group order. In one implementation, when the user of individual terminal <b>204</b> defines the group order, the user specifies a cut-off time and a ready time for the order. Identified individuals who respond by the cut-off time will be allowed to participate in the order. Individuals that respond outside of this time frame may be prevented from participating in the order.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in step <b>108</b>, the group order is automatically communicated to the restaurant. Automatically communicating the group order to the restaurant means that the group order is communicated to the restaurant without requiring intervention from the order creator. For example, at cut-off time, the individual orders that have been received as of the cut-off time may be combined and sent to the restaurant. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, order manager <b>214</b> sends the group order to a restaurant point of sale system <b>216</b> or to another electronic device at the restaurant, such as a fax machine or an email account of the restaurant. Automatically communicating the group order to the restaurant in response to a predefined event, such as expiration of a time interval, allows the order to continue, even if some of the individuals, the order creator, or both are unavailable at the time the order is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one aspect of the subject matter described herein, system <b>200</b> optionally allows the order creator to pay for the group order or to allow individual participants to pay for their respective portions. For example, group manager <b>206</b> may present the order creator with the option of paying for the group order or allowing the individuals to pay for their respective portions of the group order. Allowing the individuals to pay for their own orders reduces the need for one individual to collect payment from each individual participating in the order. Optionally allowing the order to be paid for by the creator or by the individuals increases flexibility over e-commerce systems that require the order to be paid for by the creator or by individual participants.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the creator is paying for the group order, order manager <b>214</b> may allow the creator to review the order prior to completion. However, if individuals are paying for their respective portions of the order, order manager <b>214</b> may finalize the order automatically in response to expiration of the order time period, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, if the creator is paying for the group order, order manager may allow the creator to specify spending limits for individual orders. Group manager <b>208</b> may prompt the creator for spending limits if the creator selects the option to pay for the entire order. Order manager <b>214</b> may enforce the spending limits for individual orders at the time of placement of the orders. For example, order manager <b>214</b> may send notification to an individual that a proposed order exceeds the spending limit for an order and prompt the individual to select another menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process that may be performed via an order entry screen for placing an online group order according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in step <b>300</b> the entry screen is displayed. If the user is an individual that is placing an individual online order that is not part of a group order, control proceeds to step <b>302</b> where the user selects the start time and ready time for the order. In step <b>304</b>, it is determined whether a menu is available. If a menu is not available, control returns to step <b>302</b> for the user to enter a new date and time.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the menu is available during the specified start time, control proceeds to step <b>306</b> where available menus are displayed. In step <b>308</b>, the user selects the menu containing the items that the user desires to include in the order. In step <b>310</b>, the user selects items or options from the menu. In step <b>312</b>, a check out process is initiated for the individual.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Returning to step <b>300</b>, if the user desires to start a new group order or join an existing group order, control proceeds to step <b>314</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process for starting a new group order or joining an existing group order according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, in step <b>400</b>, the group order process starts. In step <b>402</b>, it is determined whether the user is starting a new group order or joining an existing group order. If the user is starting a new group order, control proceeds to step <b>404</b> where the user logs in. In step <b>406</b>, the user is presented with group order data entry screens. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are examples of group order data entry screens that may be presented to a user. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the user selects start times and end times for a group order. In addition, the user selects whether each individual or whether the creator will pay for the group order. The user can also select the individual names to be included in the group order. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the user can define new members to be included in the group order.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in step <b>408</b>, it is determined whether the creator will pay for the entire order or not. If the creator does not pay, control proceeds to step <b>410</b> where an invite email is sent to each recipient with a request to pay. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary email message that includes an invite with a request for the individual to pay for the group order. In the email message, it is indicated that the individual is required to pay for the order when the order is placed. The email message also includes a link to a website through which the individual can place the group order. The link includes a group order identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Returning to step <b>408</b>, if the creator pays for the order, control proceeds to step <b>412</b> where an email is sent to each individual in the group inviting the individual to place an order, but indicating that the order has already been paid for by the creator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an example of such an email. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the email message includes an indicator that the order has been paid for and also includes a link to a website through which the individual can place the group order. The link includes a group order identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>414</b>, the creator can check the status of the group order, i.e., if the invitees have placed their orders. In step <b>416</b>, the creator can check out. In step <b>418</b>, the system processes and updates group orders as events change.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Returning to step <b>402</b>, if the user is joining an existing group order, control proceeds to step <b>420</b> where the user enters his or her email address. In step <b>422</b>, it is determined whether a group order is available for the individual who entered the email address. If a group order is not available, control proceeds to step <b>424</b> where a message is displayed indicating that a group order is not available. Control then returns to step <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>422</b>, if a group order is available for the individual who entered his or her email address in step <b>420</b>, control proceeds to step <b>426</b> where available group orders are displayed. In step <b>428</b>, the individual selects one of the available group orders. In step <b>430</b>, menus are displayed to the individual. The individual may also enter step <b>430</b> via step <b>432</b> when the individual receives an email with a URL inviting the individual to participate in the group order. In step <b>434</b>, the individual selects menu items.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>436</b>, it is determined whether the order is a prepaid or a postpaid order. If the order is a prepaid order, control proceeds to step <b>418</b> where the individual order is added to the group and processed. If the order is not a prepaid order, control proceeds to step <b>438</b> where the individual is required to go through the check out process.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps of the check out process according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in step <b>900</b>, the check out process is initiated. In step <b>902</b>, it is determined whether the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, control proceeds to step <b>904</b> to determine whether the user is a registered user. If the user is not a registered user, control proceeds to step <b>906</b> where the user enters the registration process and logs in. In step <b>904</b>, if the user is registered but not logged in, control proceeds to step <b>908</b> where the user logs in.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once the user is logged in, control proceeds to step <b>910</b> where it is determined whether the individual is a regular customer or a credit customer. If the customer is a credit customer, control proceeds to step <b>912</b> where the purchase order entry box is displayed. If the customer is a regular customer, control proceeds to step <b>914</b> where the user selects pay now or pay at pickup or delivery. If the user selects pay now, control proceeds to step <b>416</b> where it is determined whether the purchase order number has been entered. If the purchase order number has been entered, control proceeds to step <b>918</b> where the order is processed. If the purchase order number has not been entered, control proceeds to step <b>920</b> where the individual enters his or her credit card. In step <b>922</b>, the system determines whether the credit card has been approved. If the credit card has been approved, control proceeds to step <b>918</b> where the order is processed. Returning to step <b>914</b>, if the user selects pay at pick up or delivery, control proceeds to step <b>918</b> where the order is processed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step <b>922</b>, if the user's credit card is not approved, control proceeds to step <b>924</b> where the user is prompted to retry the credit card information. Then, control returns to step <b>320</b> where the new credit card information is processed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a drawing of an exemplary computer user interface screen where the user can create a user profile for online group ordering. The user profile allows the user to define his or her contact information, a password, and menu preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The following scenarios illustrate exemplary operation of the subject matter described herein. The scenarios described below may be implemented by system <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or by any suitable computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Scenario 1:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An office manager initiates a group order from his favorite restaurant. He selects the order pickup time, the cut-off time, and chooses to pay for the entire order. He selects five previously invited individuals from his stored list in the system. He also enters two new email addresses for the two new employees that started today. Upon clicking &#x201c;Start Group Order,&#x201d; the invitees are sent the invitation email. Four individuals join the order, and three choose not to as they had other plans. The initiator finalizes the order at cut-off time and pays for it using his credit card. The order is sent to the restaurant and prepared. The office manager asks one of the employees to pick up the food since it's already paid for.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Scenario 2:</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An employee starts a group order from a restaurant and invites his two co-workers. He selects delivery time, cut-off time and chooses to only pay for his portion of the order. The two invitees click on the links in the invitation emails that they received, place their respective portions of the order, and pay for their portions with their own credit cards. The order is finalized and sent to the restaurant. The restaurant delivers the food to the location.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Scenario 3:</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A car parts salesman wants to buy lunch for his contacts at three dealerships and drop the food off to them. He starts a group order and invites the three contacts. He chooses to pay for the entire order. The individuals place their respective portions of the order. The car parts salesman finalizes the order, pays for it via credit card, picks it up at the restaurant, and delivers the food to the three dealerships.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Scenario 4:</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An office manager initiates a group order, chooses to pay only for his portion and invites six individuals. Five of the individuals place their respective portions of the order by clicking on the email link that they received and paying for their own food. The sixth individual is out of the office at a customer site and did not see his email. The office manager calls him and tells him about the group order. The individual goes to the restaurant website, logs in, joins the group order, and pays for his food. His food is at the office when he gets back.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Scenario 5:</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An office manager needs to go out and run errands all morning. She would like to order lunch and pick it up on her way back to the office. She initiates a group order and invites five co-workers. She selects the option to force invitees to pay for their own food. She starts the order at 8:00 a.m., sets the pick up time for 12:00 p.m., and sets the cut-off time for 11:30 a.m. She pays for her portion of the order and heads out for her errands. Three of her co-workers join the order and pay for their food between 8:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Another co-worker clicks on the link in his invitation email at 11:45 to join the group order. He is informed by the system that this group order is now finalized and further additions are not allowed. The fifth co-worker decides not to join the order and just ignores the invitation. At 11:30 a.m., the order is finalized automatically by the system and sent to the restaurant. The office manager stops by at 12:05 p.m. after her errands and picks up the food.</p>
