<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a flexible display device, and more particularly, to a fabricating method of a flexible display device to prevent a substrate from being peeled apart during a fabricating process of the flexible display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The display device market rapidly changed recently, and now a central place in the market has been taken by flat panel display (FPD) devices. The FPD devices are easily made large-sized, thin, and light. The FPD devices include liquid crystal displays (LCDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), organic electro luminescence displays (OLEDs), etc. However, the existing liquid crystal displays, plasma display panels, organic electro luminescence displays, etc. are made of a glass substrate, thereby limiting application and usage because there is no flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a flexible display device capable of bending has been fabricated using a substrate of a material having flexibility, such as plastic or foil, has been rapidly rising as a next generation display device in place of the existing glass substrate with no flexibility. The flexible display device is often called a &#x201c;bendable display&#x201d; or &#x201c;rollable display.&#x201d; A method of realizing the flexible display device can be classified into two methods: using the existing display device and using an e-paper.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method of using the existing display device is a method of making the material of a thin film transistor liquid crystal display device, an organic electro luminescence display device, etc. flexible. In contrast, with the method of using the e-paper, a display device has been developed using a cholesterol liquid crystal, and an electrophoresis display device using a micro capsule, an electrophoresis and a half globular twist ball charged with static charge. There is a disadvantage with the e-paper in that full color realization is difficult and there is a limit in realizing motion picture due to a slow operating speed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a study for realizing a flexible display device using the existing display device has been the recent focus of much research. To this end, a subject of study is that a display part and a switching part in core parts of the existing display device&#x2014;including the display part, a driving part and the switching part&#x2014;are made with flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Specially, to give flexibility to the display part of the flexible display device, a flexible substrate should be used. However, an electrode formation should be precisely performed in the fabricating process of the display device, thus a substrate should act to support sufficiently. To this end, a rigid substrate should be adhered thereto. When adhering the rigid substrate, an adhesive is used with which adhesion and detachment are possible. There is a problem when the rigid substrate and the flexible substrate are adhered to each other because the adhesive can come apart during the fabricating process of the flexible display device.</p>

In the accompanying drawings, the thickness of a specific area is enlarged to be shown for helping understand the present invention. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 11</figref>, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, a fabricating process of a flexible liquid crystal display device according to the present invention can be mainly divided into a substrate adhering process (S<b>1</b>), an upper array substrate fabricating process (S<b>2</b>), a lower array substrate fabricating process (S<b>3</b>), a liquid crystal process (S<b>4</b>), a peeling process (S<b>5</b>) and a module process (S<b>6</b>). The substrate adhering process S<b>1</b> is a process for adhering a flexible substrate <b>45</b> to a rigid substrate <b>47</b>, wherein the flexible substrate <b>45</b> provides flexibility to a display device and the rigid substrate <b>47</b> provides to support so that an electrode formation is precisely performed. Herein, the rigid substrate <b>47</b> is formed from a glass substrate and the flexible substrate <b>45</b> is formed from a plastic substrate with high heat resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A detailed explanation of the substrate adhering process (S<b>1</b>) will be made with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) are processes for forming R, G, B pixels, primary electrodes, etc. A detailed explanation of the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) will be made in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4D</figref>. The liquid crystal process (S<b>4</b>) is a process of bonding two substrates which are made in the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) into one, and injecting a liquid crystal into a liquid crystal layer <b>49</b> space thereinside. The peeling process (S<b>5</b>) is a process of peeling the flexible substrate <b>45</b> and the rigid substrate <b>47</b> of the upper/lower parts which went through the liquid crystal process (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">To describe the peeling process (S<b>5</b>) in detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the flexible substrate <b>45</b> adhered to an adhesive surface with low adhesive strength is peeled off. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the rigid substrate <b>47</b> adhered to an adhesive surface with high adhesive strength is peeled off. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, the electrode and color filter formed on the flexible substrate <b>45</b> after the upper/lower array substrate processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) are not shown. The module process (S<b>6</b>) is a process of completing a module by performing a process of adhering a polarizer to and mounting a drive circuit on a panel which is completed through S<b>1</b> to S<b>5</b> processes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>, the substrate adhering process S<b>1</b> is discussed in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The rigid substrate <b>47</b>, which will provide support so that the electrode formation is precisely performed, and the flexible substrate <b>45</b>, which will provide flexibility to the display device, are adhered to an adhesive layer <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The adhesive layer <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, includes a support film <b>1</b><i>b </i>and adhesive materials <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>c </i>adhered to a first surface and a second surface of the support film <b>1</b><i>b</i>. The support film <b>1</b><i>b </i>is located in the middle of the adhesive layer <b>1</b> and acts to support the adhesive materials <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>c</i>. The support film <b>1</b><i>b </i>is a polymer material with excellent heat resistance, which is mainly made of polyimide PI.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The adhesive materials <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>c </i>are located opposite each other with the support film <b>1</b><i>b </i>therebetween. The adhesive materials <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>c </i>are formed of a material with excellent heat resistance and mainly made of acrylic resin or silicon group.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The adhesive strength of the first adhesive material <b>1</b><i>a </i>to which the rigid substrate <b>47</b> is adhered and the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>to which the flexible substrate <b>45</b> is adhered can be formed to be strong or weak in accordance with a composition of the adhesive materials <b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>1</b><i>c</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>has its adhesive strength lower than that of the first adhesive material <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The adhesive layer <b>1</b> is covered by first and second passivation films <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, which shut off contact with the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in the substrate adhering process (S<b>1</b>), the first passivation film <b>11</b><i>a </i>is peeled off and the rigid substrate <b>47</b> is adhered to the first adhesive material <b>1</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, in the substrate adhering process (S<b>1</b>), after peeling off the second passivation film <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the adhesive layer <b>1</b>, the flexible substrate <b>45</b> is adhered onto the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c</i>. (S<b>1</b>) The adhesive layer <b>1</b> is formed with dual adhesive strengths of the first adhesive material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the second adhesive strength <b>1</b><i>c </i>is so that the flexible substrate <b>45</b> and the rigid substrate <b>47</b> can be peeled off step by step when performing the peeling process (S<b>5</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) are processes of forming basic electrodes. The lower array substrate includes a plurality of signal lines, a thin film transistor and an alignment film spread thereover for aligning the liquid crystal. The upper array substrate includes a color filter for realizing color, a black matrix for preventing light leakage and an alignment film spread thereover for aligning the liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref> represent the upper array substrate fabricating process (S<b>2</b>) step by step.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">First, after an opaque material, such as opaque metal or opaque resin, is deposited on a first flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>a </i>following the foregoing substrate adhering process (S<b>1</b>), an organic material is patterned by a photolithography process and an etching process, thereby forming the black matrix <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The opaque metal is generally chrome Cr, and the opaque resin is an organic material. After a red resin is deposited on the first flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>a </i>where the black matrix <b>3</b> is formed, the red resin is patterned by the photolithography process and the etching process, thereby forming a red color filter R, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. After a green resin is deposited on the first flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>a </i>where the red color filter R is formed, the green resin is patterned by the photolithography process and the etching process, thereby forming a green color filter G, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. After a blue resin is deposited on the first flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>a </i>where the green color filter G is formed, the blue resin is patterned by the photolithography process and the etching process, thereby forming a blue color filter B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. After a transparent conductive material is deposited on the first flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>a </i>where the red, green and blue color filters are formed, the transparent conductive material is patterned by the photolithography process and the etching process, thereby forming a common electrode <b>35</b>, as shown by the upper array substrate fabricating process (S<b>2</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref>, the lower array substrate fabricating method (S<b>3</b>) using four mask processes is taken as an example as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, a first conductive pattern group including a gate line <b>2</b>, a gate electrode <b>8</b> and a gate pad lower electrode <b>26</b> is formed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, on the second flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>b </i>which went through the substrate adhering process (S<b>1</b>) using the first mask process. To describe a process of forming the first conductive pattern group in detail, a gate metal layer is formed on the second flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>b </i>by a deposition method, such as sputtering. Subsequently, the gate metal layer is patterned by the photolithography process and the etching process using the first mask, thereby forming the first conductive pattern group including the gate line <b>2</b>, the gate electrode <b>8</b> and the gate pad lower electrode <b>26</b>. Herein, the gate metal layer is made of aluminum group metal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a gate insulating film <b>46</b> is spread over the second flexible substrate <b>45</b><i>b </i>where the first conductive pattern group is formed. A semiconductor pattern including an active layer <b>48</b> and an ohmic contact layer <b>50</b>; and second conductive pattern group including a data line, a source electrode <b>10</b>, a data electrode <b>12</b>, a data pad lower electrode <b>32</b>, and a storage electrode <b>22</b> are formed on the gate insulating film <b>46</b> using a second mask process.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A process of forming the second conductive pattern group will now be described in detail. The gate insulating film <b>46</b>, an amorphous silicon layer, an n+ amorphous silicon layer and a source/drain metal layer are sequentially formed on the lower substrate <b>45</b> where the first conductive pattern group is formed by a deposition method, such as PECVD or sputtering. Herein, the gate insulating film <b>46</b> is formed of an inorganic insulating material, such as silicon oxide SiOx or silicon nitride SiNx. Molybdenum Mo, titanium Ti, tantalum Ta or a molybdenum Mo alloy is used as the source/drain metal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Subsequently, a photo-resist pattern is formed on the source/drain metal layer by the photolithography process using the second mask. In this case, a diffractive exposure mask having a diffractive exposure part in a channel part of the thin film transistor is used as the second mask. Thus, the photo-resist pattern of the channel part is made with a lower height than the other source/drain pattern parts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the source/drain metal layer is patterned by a wet etching process using the photo-resist pattern, thereby forming the second conductive pattern group including the data line <b>4</b>, the source electrode <b>10</b>, the drain electrode integrated with the source electrode <b>10</b>, and the storage electrode <b>22</b>. Then, the n+ amorphous silicon layer and the amorphous silicon layer are simultaneously patterned by a dry etching process using the same photo-resist pattern, thereby forming the ohmic contact layer <b>50</b> and the active layer <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After removing the photo-resist pattern, which has a relatively low height in the channel part, by an ashing process, the source/drain metal pattern and ohmic contact layer <b>50</b> of the channel part is etched by the dry etching process. Accordingly, the active layer <b>48</b> of the channel part is exposed to separate the source electrode <b>10</b> from the drain electrode <b>12</b>. Subsequently, the photo-resist pattern remaining on the second conductive pattern group is removed by a stripping process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a passivation film <b>52</b> including first to fourth contact holes <b>13</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>33</b> is formed on the gate insulating film <b>46</b> where the second conductive pattern group is formed, by a third mask process. In detail, the passivation film <b>52</b> is formed on the gate insulating film <b>46</b> where the second conductive pattern group is formed, by the deposition method such as PECVD. Subsequently, the passivation film <b>52</b> is patterned by the photolithography process and the etching process using a third mask, thereby forming the first to fourth contact holes <b>13</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>33</b>. The first contact hole <b>13</b> penetrates the passivation film <b>52</b> to expose the drain electrode <b>12</b>, and the second contact hole <b>21</b> penetrates the passivation film <b>52</b> to expose the storage electrode <b>22</b>. The third contact hole <b>27</b> penetrates the passivation film <b>52</b> and the gate insulating film <b>46</b> to expose the gate pad lower electrode <b>26</b>, and the fourth contact hole <b>33</b> penetrates the passivation film <b>52</b> to expose the data pad lower electrode <b>32</b>. Herein, when using a metal with high etching ratio like molybdenum Mo as the source/drain metal, the first, second and fourth contact holes <b>12</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>33</b> respectively penetrate as far as the drain electrode <b>12</b>, the storage electrode <b>22</b> and the data pad lower electrode <b>32</b> to expose the side surface thereof. The passivation film <b>52</b> is made of an inorganic insulating material, such as the gate insulating film <b>46</b> or an organic insulating material like PFCB, BCB or an acrylic organic compound with a low dielectric constant.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, a third conductive pattern group including the pixel electrode, the gate pad upper electrode <b>28</b> and the data pad upper electrode <b>34</b> is formed on the passivation film <b>52</b> by a fourth mask process. Specifically, a transparent conductive film is spread on the passivation film <b>52</b> by a deposition method, such as sputtering. Subsequently, the transparent conductive film is patterned by the photolithography process and the etching process using a fourth mask, thereby forming the third conductive pattern group including the pixel electrode <b>14</b>, the gate pad upper electrode <b>28</b> and the data pad upper electrode <b>34</b>. The pixel electrode <b>14</b> is electrically connected to the drain electrode through the first contact hole <b>13</b> and is electrically connected to the storage electrode <b>22</b> through the second contact hole <b>21</b>. The gate pad upper electrode is electrically connected to the gate pad lower electrode <b>26</b> through the third contact hole <b>37</b>. The data pad upper electrode <b>34</b> is electrically connected to the data pad lower electrode <b>32</b> through the fourth contact hole <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Herein, the transparent conductive film is made of any one of indium thin oxide ITO, tin oxide TO, indium tin zinc oxide ITZO, and indium zinc oxide IZO. (S<b>3</b>). The deposition method for forming each electrode as described in the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) includes a PECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) method, a sputtering method, etc. When applying these methods, conditions such as a vacuum state, a designated substrate temperature, a reactive gas, and a reactive pressure are required.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the other hand, small bubbles may be generated in the surface of the flexible substrate <b>45</b> adhered to the second adhesive material <b>1</b>C and the surface of the rigid substrate <b>47</b> adhered to the first adhesive material <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Such small bubbles can be united to make bigger bubbles when forming the vacuum state in the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>). The phenomenon that the bubbles get united into bigger sized bubbles is generated in the adhered surface of the flexible substrate <b>45</b> and the second adhesive material <b>1</b>C because the adhesive strength of the surface of the flexible substrate <b>45</b> adhered to the second adhesive material <b>1</b>C is relatively lower than the adhesive strength of the surface of the rigid substrate <b>47</b> adhered to the first adhesive material <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the flexible substrate <b>45</b> can be peeled from the adhesive material <b>1</b> during the fabricating process because of the bubbles that get bigger.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) is performed on the flexible substrate <b>45</b>, which is relatively weaker than the glass substrate of the existing liquid crystal display device. Thus, the flexible substrate <b>45</b> is stressed by conditions such as temperature and pressure, which are generated when performing deposition, thereby making it possible that the flexible substrate <b>45</b> adhered to the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>is shrunk. Further, the surface of the flexible substrate <b>45</b> adhered to the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>can be peeled from the adhesive layer <b>1</b> because of the low adhesive strength of the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>in the wet etching or cleaning process that takes place when performing the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>).</p>

The second adhesive material <b>5</b><i>c </i>is formed to have a relatively lower adhesive strength than the first adhesive material <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and the third adhesive material <b>55</b> is formed to have a relatively higher adhesive strength than the second adhesive material <b>5</b><i>c</i>. The adhesive strength of the third adhesive material <b>55</b> can be formed to be the same as the adhesive strength of the first adhesive material <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The support film <b>5</b><i>b </i>provides a support force to the first to third adhesive materials <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>c</i>, <b>55</b>. There is generated a peeling phenomenon during the fabricating process of the flexible display device due to the low adhesive strength of the related art second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>layer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. To prevent this, the third adhesive material <b>55</b> is formed with a proper width in the edge of the second adhesive material <b>5</b><i>c </i>layer in the first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a plane view showing the third adhesive material <b>55</b> formed in the edge of the second adhesive material <b>5</b><i>c </i>layer.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The substrate adhering process (S<b>1</b>) according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention is the same as the above description as far as the step of peeling the first passivation film <b>11</b><i>a </i>from the adhesive layer <b>1</b> and adhering it to the rigid substrate <b>47</b>, and the step of peeling the second passivation film <b>11</b><i>b </i>form the adhesive layer <b>1</b> to which the rigid substrate <b>47</b> is adhered, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. Then, the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention further includes the step of printing a third adhesive material <b>77</b> with a proper width at the upper edge of the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>from which the second passivation film <b>11</b><i>b </i>is peeled. In the method of forming the third adhesive material <b>77</b>, there is a method of forming it in the same manner as treating a sealant except a portion of the printing method. There is performed a step of adhering the flexible substrate <b>45</b> to the second adhesive material <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the printed third adhesive material <b>77</b> after forming the third adhesive material <b>77</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref> show an adhering process (S<b>1</b>) of a flexible display device according to a fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>, there is provided a jig substrate <b>100</b> including a first groove <b>113</b> and a second groove <b>111</b> through an etching process as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. Next, an adhesive <b>101</b> is spread over the second <b>111</b> of the jig substrate <b>100</b>, and then a flexible substrate <b>103</b> is adhered to the first groove <b>113</b> of the upper part of the jig substrate <b>100</b> and the adhesive <b>101</b> spread over the second groove <b>111</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The jig substrate <b>100</b> includes the first groove <b>113</b> where the flexible substrate <b>101</b> is to be placed, and a second groove <b>111</b> into which the adhesive <b>101</b> is to be filled. The first groove <b>113</b> and the second groove <b>111</b> are formed by performing the etching process on the glass substrate, which is the rigid substrate. Using the glass substrate as the rigid substrate like this is because the jig substrate <b>100</b> fabrication becomes complicated when using a metal substrate since a separate coating treatment is required to prevent chemical damage.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The width and thickness of the first groove is formed to be the same as the width and thickness of the flexible substrate <b>103</b> so as to make the flexible substrate <b>103</b> fixed. The first groove <b>113</b> fixes the flexible substrate <b>103</b> in the fabricating process of the flexible display device, thereby enabling the flexible substrate <b>103</b> to be supported during the fabricating process of the flexible display device. Also, the second groove <b>111</b> is formed in the lower part of the edge of the first groove <b>113</b> to provide a space over which the adhesive <b>101</b> can be spread. The width (x) of the second groove is 5 mm&#x2dc;100 mm. If the width (x) of the second groove is less than 5 mm, the adhesive force is not sufficiently provided, thus the flexible substrate is peeled during the fabricating process of the flexible display device, and therefore not less than 5 mm is desired. Further, if the width (x) of the second groove exceeds 100 mm, it becomes difficult to perform the peeling process later on, therefore not more than 100 mm is desired. And, the thickness (y) of the second groove is formed to be the same as that of the adhesive <b>101</b>. The thickness (y) of the second groove formed as much as the thickness of the adhesive <b>101</b> enables to improve a stepped difference which is generated between the flexible substrate <b>45</b> and the rigid substrate <b>47</b> when being adhered to the adhesive materials <b>66</b>, <b>77</b> with the stepped difference as in the second and third exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B are diagrams briefly illustrating processes after performing the adhering process (S<b>1</b>) of the flexible display device according to the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> are diagrams for explaining the peeling process (S<b>5</b>) of the flexible display device according to the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and there are not shown electrodes and color filters which are formed after the upper/lower array substrate process. The adhering process (S<b>1</b>) of the flexible substrate <b>103</b> and the jig substrate <b>100</b> are respectively performed in a first jig substrate <b>100</b>A and a first flexible substrate <b>103</b><i>a </i>that will go through the upper array substrate fabricating process (S<b>2</b>), and in a second jig substrate <b>100</b><i>b </i>and a second flexible substrate <b>103</b><i>b </i>that will go through the lower array substrate fabricating process (S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) are performed in the upper part of the flexible substrate stuck to the jig substrate. A detailed explanation for the upper/lower array substrate fabricating processes (S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>) will be omitted since it was described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, the two substrates, which are fabricated in the upper array substrate fabricating process (S<b>2</b>) and the lower array substrate fabricating process (S<b>3</b>), are bonded together, and the liquid crystal process (S<b>4</b>) of injecting a liquid crystal <b>149</b> into space therein is performed. A peeling process (S<b>5</b>) of peeling the upper/lower array substrates from the adhesive for the upper/lower array substrates that went through the liquid crystal process (S<b>4</b>) is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To describe the peeling process (S<b>5</b>) in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the peeling process (S<b>5</b>) is different in accordance with a kind of the adhesive (<b>101</b>) spread over the second groove <b>111</b>. An ultraviolet ray UV type and a thermal type of adhesive and a polyimide PI adhesive tape with high heat resistance can be used as the adhesive <b>101</b> spread over the second groove.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When using the ultraviolet ray type adhesive, if ultraviolet rays are irradiated onto the adhesive <b>101</b> when performing the peeling process (S<b>5</b>), the adhesive <b>101</b> loses the adhesive force. Thus, the first and second flexible substrates <b>103</b><i>a</i>, <b>103</b><i>b </i>are peeled from the first and second jig substrates <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An adhesive that loses the adhesive force at a temperature below the normal temperature and an adhesive that loses the adhesive force at a temperature of 20&#xb0; C.&#x2dc;200&#xb0; C. can be used as the thermal type adhesive. When using the adhesive that loses the adhesive force at the temperature below the normal temperature, the peeling process (S<b>5</b>) is performed by a cool-off method of applying a temperature below the normal temperature to the adhesive <b>101</b> for the adhesive <b>101</b> to lose the adhesive force. When using the adhesive that loses the adhesive force at the temperature of 20&#xb0; C.&#x2dc;200&#xb0; C., the peeling process (S<b>5</b>) is performed by a warm-off method of applying a temperature of 20&#xb0; C.&#x2dc;200&#xb0; C. to the adhesive <b>101</b> for the adhesive <b>101</b> to lose the adhesive force. When using the polyimide adhesive tape during the peeling process (S<b>5</b>), the edge of the first and second flexible substrates <b>103</b><i>a</i>, <b>103</b><i>b </i>to which the polyimide adhesive tape is adhered is cut by a laser for peeling.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this way, the fabricating method of the flexible display device can be easily applied to the liquid crystal display panel of ECB (electrical controlled bi-refingence), VA (vertical alignment) mode, as well as to the liquid crystal display panel of IPS mode and TN mode. Furthermore, it can also be used in a fabricating method of an organic electro luminescence display device.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is briefly described a cross-sectional structure of an organic electro luminescence display device that is fabricated by applying the exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The brief structure of the flexible electro luminescence display device includes an anode electrode <b>84</b>, a cathode electrode <b>86</b> on an upper part of a flexible substrate <b>82</b>, and an organic light emitting layer <b>80</b> formed at each crossing part of the anode electrode <b>84</b> and the cathode electrode <b>86</b>. If a driving signal is applied to the anode electrode <b>84</b> and the cathode electrode <b>86</b> of the organic electro luminescence display device with such a structure, an electron and a hole are emitted, and the electron and the hole emitted from the anode electrode <b>84</b> and the cathode electrode <b>86</b> are re-combined within an organic light emitting layer <b>80</b> to generate a visible ray. At this moment, the generated visible ray exits to the outside through the anode electrode <b>84</b>, thereby displaying a designated picture or image.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As described above, the fabricating method of the present invention includes the third adhesive material in the edge of the upper part of the second adhesive material and the edge of the second adhesive material of the adhesive layer used in the substrate adhering process, or the step of printing the third adhesive material in the edge of the upper part of the second adhesive material in the adhering process. Accordingly, the risk of the peeling generated by the low adhesive force of the second adhesive material during the fabricating process of the flexible display device can be reduced. Further, the first adhesive material protects the side surface, which is a weak point of the flexible substrate to which the second adhesive material is adhered, thereby preventing the shrinkage of the flexible substrate that is caused by the stress of the deposited film that is generated upon each process. As a result, the stability of the fabricating process of the flexible display device and improved productivity improvement are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, by forming the jig substrate having the groove to which the flexible substrate is to be fixed and the groove over which the adhesive is to be spread, the fabricating process of the flexible display device can be performed more stably. The jig can be made easily, thereby simplifying the process, enabling productivity improvement and increasing process stability.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the fabricating method of a flexible display of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
