<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/240,001 filed Sep. 4, 2009, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an actuator apparatus using a piezo or smart material and being adapted to operate at resonant frequencies. Methods of adjusting the resonant frequency of such an actuator and operating such an actuator at resonance are also disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrically-driven actuators are known in the art. When supplied with an alternating current, such actuators will react at a frequency that is a function of the frequency of the source current. According to the materials, mounting, and physical characteristics of their structures, such actuators will also have a frequency at which they begin to resonate when operated in such a fashion. Because operating in a resonant condition is typically seen as detrimental, in part due to the physical stress it imposes on the structure of the actuator, resonant frequencies are avoided, thereby imposing limitations on the allowable operating frequencies. The present invention addresses these shortcomings by providing an actuator apparatus that may be run effectively at resonant frequencies, a method of adjusting the resonant frequencies of such an actuator, and a method of maintaining operation of such an actuator in a resonant condition.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An actuator apparatus using a piezo or smart material and having mountable arms that enable customization of the apparatus for different applications is particularly suitable for resonant operation in part because of the fast reaction times of the piezo or smart material stack, and in part because of the ability to mount different arms allows for a degree of tuning of resonant frequencies, thereby enabling customization of the actuator for different applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed herein, therefore, is smart material actuator adapted for resonant operation, thereby allowing for increased operational efficiency through the exploitation of the actuator's resonant characteristics. Smart material actuators suitable for use with the present invention comprise a mechanical amplifier having a fixed supporting surface and mechanical webs having a movable mounting surface. A piezoelectric stack is mounted between the first and second surfaces such that, substantially upon application of an electrical potential to the piezoelectric stack, it expands, thereby urging the second surface away from the first. The mechanical webs comprise compliant members attached to actuating arms. As the second mounting surface moves, the compliant members flex, thereby moving the actuating arm. A sensor is incorporated to indicate the degree of movement of the actuating arm or arms. A controller connected to the sensor supplies a power signal to the piezoelectric stack, causing it to activate and deactivate at a rapid rate. The controller may increase and decrease the frequency, and in some embodiments the voltage, of the power signal in response to the signal generated by the sensor. In this way, the controller can achieve and maintain operation of the actuator in a resonant condition.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods of maintaining and avoiding resonant operation are also disclosed. By monitoring the phase angle between the power signal and the sensor signal in some embodiments, a desired phase angle range may be used by the controller to determine what changes are needed in the power signal frequency or voltage. By adjusting the frequency of the power signal in response to changes in the phase angle, resonant operation may be maintained in changing conditions. In other embodiments, the displacement information from the sensor provides sufficient information on its own to allow the controller to maintain, or avoid, resonant operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Finally, methods of adjusting the resonant frequency of smart material actuators are disclosed. Such methods include adjusting mass, mounting location and the stiffness of compliant members in order to alter resonant frequencies. Embodiments of mechanical amplifiers with discrete and replaceable parts facilitate such adjustments by allowing for easy exchange of parts including, in particular, mountable actuating arms.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are herein described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-18</figref> in which distinct elements are referred to with element numbers, with similar elements in different embodiments generally having the same last two digits. By way of example therefore, while element fixed supporting member <b>20</b> is the same element used in multiple embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, sensors <b>154</b>, <b>254</b>, <b>354</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>654</b>, <b>754</b>, and <b>854</b> illustrated in the same figures are each separate embodiments of a sensor suitable for use with different embodiments of the present invention. For convenience, therefore, when reference is made herein to a range of element numbers, that reference is a shorthand reference being made to similar elements with element numbers having the same last two digits, but different first digits. By way of example, a reference to sensors <b>154</b>-<b>854</b> is thus a reference to all of the embodiments of sensors <b>154</b>, <b>254</b>, <b>354</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>654</b>, <b>754</b>, and <b>854</b>. In contrast, a reference to a specific element number alone (for example a reference to sensor <b>154</b>), is a reference to a specific embodiment of such element as shown in the figures, but is not necessarily a reference to other embodiments shown elsewhere in the figures (for example sensors <b>254</b>, <b>354</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>654</b>, <b>754</b>, and <b>854</b>) unless otherwise is clear from the context. Other commonalities and differences between embodiments of similar components will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the figures and the text of this detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the figures and the following description describe preferred embodiments of this invention, it is to be understood that the figures and description are to be considered only as illustrative of the principles of the invention and not to be limitative thereof. Numerous other variations, all within the scope of the invention as claimed, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The term &#x201c;adapted&#x201d; as used herein shall mean sized, shaped, configured, dimensioned, oriented and arranged as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Where specific examples of materials, parts, frequencies, voltages, ranges, and the like are used herein, such examples are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The following references are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety so as to provide additional disclosure that may be found helpful in further understanding the present invention: PCT Application No. PCT/US2010/41461 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,717,332; 6,548,938; 6,737,788; 6,836,056; 6,879,087; 6,759,790; 7,132,781; 7,126,259; 6,870,305; 6,975,061; 7,368,856; 7,564,171 and 6,924,586.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment of a mechanical amplifier <b>10</b> suitable for use with a smart material actuator the present invention adapted to operate at resonance. As will be readily recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, the components of the apparatus of the present invention may be manufactured in a variety of sizes and materials adapted to the needs of differing applications.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Mechanical amplifier <b>10</b> comprises discrete components including a fixed supporting member <b>20</b> having a first mounting surface <b>24</b>. Fixed supporting member <b>20</b> may be manufactured in a variety of sizes suitable for use with piezoelectric stacks <b>100</b> of different sizes. Mechanical webs <b>30</b> have compliant members <b>32</b> attached to a movable supporting member having a second mounting surface <b>34</b>. Piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> is mounted between first mounting surface <b>24</b> and second mounting surface <b>34</b> such that substantially upon application of an electrical potential to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> expands substantially without angular movement and substantially without movement of fixed supporting member <b>20</b> such that movable supporting member having second mounting surface <b>34</b> moves away from first mounting surface <b>24</b>. As a result, compliant members <b>32</b> flex, thereby moving actuator arm(s) <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Many varieties of piezoelectric materials (materials that expand when an electric potential is applied or generate an electric charge when mechanical force is applied) are known in the art and may be adapted for use in piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, which may be, for example, a stack formed of alternating layers of ceramic piezoelectric material fired together (a so-called co-fired multilayer ceramic piezoelectric stack such as those available from suppliers including NEC) or a stack formed of layers of material cut from single crystal piezoelectric materials. As discussed herein, the term &#x201c;piezoelectric stack&#x201d; includes stacks of traditional piezoelectric materials and also so-called &#x201c;smart materials,&#x201d; sometimes created by doping known piezoelectric materials to change their electrical or mechanical properties and sometimes created with formulations other than traditional PZT. Thus a smart material actuator is an actuator as described herein using a piezoelectric stack, with the term piezoelectric stack referring to both stacks made of traditional piezoelectric materials and so-called smart materials.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Mechanical webs <b>30</b> further comprise upper web sensor mounting point <b>38</b> and lower web sensor mounting point <b>39</b>, discussed further below, and adapted to allow for attachment of a sensor (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), thereby allowing such sensor to sense the activation of piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> and generate a signal proportional to the movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. Herein, the term &#x201c;proportional&#x201d; is used to describe a given mathematical relationship, but not necessarily limited to one that is defined by a straight line. Additionally, those of skill in the art will recognize that signals, while traditionally analog, may also be digital when appropriate conversion and similar circuitry is used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An alternative sensor mounting location is provided by upper supporting member sensor mounting point <b>28</b> and lower fixed supporting member mounting point <b>29</b>. As actuating arm <b>41</b> moves relative to fixed supporting member <b>20</b>, a sensor between upper supporting member sensor mounting point <b>28</b> and lower fixed supporting member mounting point <b>29</b> may measure the movement of actuating arm <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A further alternative sensor mounting location is provided by upper arm sensor mounting point <b>48</b> and lower arm sensor mounting point <b>49</b>. As actuating arms <b>41</b> move relative to each other, a sensor between upper arm sensor mounting point <b>48</b> and lower arm sensor mounting point <b>49</b> may measure the movement of actuating arms <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a smart material actuator <b>1</b> adapted for resonant operation according to the present invention. In addition to mechanical amplifier <b>10</b> and piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, actuator <b>1</b> comprises sensor assembly <b>150</b> electrically connected to controller <b>70</b>. Controller <b>70</b> is further electrically connected to electrode <b>102</b> of piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, which passes through second mounting surface <b>34</b> of mechanical webs <b>30</b>, with insulation (not illustrated) adapted to prevent an electrical connection between electrode <b>102</b> and the remainder of mechanical amplifier <b>10</b>. Controller <b>70</b> is further electrically connected to, or comprises internally, a power supply (not illustrated), thereby enabling controller <b>70</b> to activate and deactivate piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, and thereby actuator <b>1</b>, by applying a power signal to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>. As is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the power signal will be an alternating current having a frequency and a voltage. By increasing and decreasing the frequency of the power signal, controller <b>70</b> may increase and decrease the frequency of operation of actuator <b>1</b>. As is discussed further below, sensor assembly <b>150</b> is adapted to generate an electric signal proportional to the degree of movement of mechanical webs <b>30</b>, and thereby actuating arms <b>41</b>, to controller <b>70</b>, thereby enabling controller <b>70</b> to monitor the degree of movement actually generated by the application of the power signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A wide variety of sensor embodiments may be used to generate a signal proportional to the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. One such embodiment is illustrated as sensor assembly <b>150</b>, in which a sensor <b>154</b> having terminals <b>156</b> is mounted to a compliant backing material <b>152</b>. Compliant backing material <b>152</b> may be formed from any material with sufficient resilience to avoid yielding under repeated activations of piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, such as, without limitation, a thin sheet of stainless steel or spring steel. Sensor <b>154</b> is adapted to measure the flexing of compliant backing material <b>152</b>. The greater the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>, the greater the resulting flex of compliant backing material <b>152</b>. Sensor <b>154</b> may be any of a variety of sensors capable of detecting strain or flex that are known in the art including, without limitation, foil-type strain gauges mounted on a metal backing, piezo sensors (such as, without limitation, the DigiKey MSP1007-ND and MSP6915-ND), capacitive strain gauges (such as those available from Analog Devices including without limitation the AD7745 capacitance to digital converter), optical sensors (such as the Vishay TCRT1000 reflective optical sensor), Hall effect sensors (such as the Melexis MLX90242 CMOS linear hall effect sensor IC), a piezo variable voltage sensor, or an accelerometer. It will be understood by those in the art that different types of sensors may require different mounting locations and mounting means, as well as different control circuitry to convert their sensor signals into reliable indications of the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated, compliant backing <b>152</b> is inserted between upper web sensor mounting point <b>38</b> and lower web sensor mounting point <b>39</b>. Where compliant backing material <b>152</b> is a pre-flexed sheet of compliant material such as a thin sheet of spring steel, upper web sensor mounting point <b>38</b> and lower web sensor mounting point <b>39</b> may conveniently be formed as opposing angled notches proximal to compliant members <b>32</b> as shown. As will be easily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of other means may also be utilized to attach compliant backing material <b>152</b> including, without limitation, mechanical fasteners such as bolts, adhesives, and welding. Additionally, if sensor <b>154</b> is adapted to detect compression as opposing to flex, compliant backing <b>152</b> may be replaced by complaint posts (not illustrated) aligned substantially perpendicular to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> such that sensor <b>154</b> is released and compressed substantially upon activation and deactivation of actuator assembly <b>1</b>. A single layer piezoelectric stack would be a suitable sensor in such a configuration. As the electric signal generated by sensor <b>154</b> is proportional to the movement of mechanical webs <b>30</b>, and thereby actuation arm(s) <b>41</b>, sensor assembly <b>150</b> is adapted to indicate the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate alternative embodiments of sensors <b>354</b>, <b>454</b> suitable for use with the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, sensor assembly <b>350</b> is made up of sensor <b>354</b> on compliant backing material <b>352</b> with terminals <b>356</b>. Compliant backing material <b>356</b> is mounted between upper arm mounting point <b>48</b> and lower arm mounting point <b>49</b> as illustrated. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that other means of attachment, including without limitation mechanical fasteners, may be used as mounting points for compliant backing material <b>352</b> in addition to the angled notch mounting means illustrated. As actuating arms <b>41</b> move toward and away from one another during operation, compliant backing material <b>352</b> flexes and releases, thereby allowing sensor <b>354</b> to determine the strain or flex in compliant backing material <b>352</b> and, hence, the degree of motion of actuating arms <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Alternatively, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, sensor assembly <b>450</b> may be mounted between fixed supporting member <b>20</b> at supporting member lower mounting point <b>29</b> and actuating arm <b>41</b> at supporting member upper mounting point <b>28</b>. Like sensor assemblies <b>150</b>, <b>350</b>, sensor assembly <b>450</b> comprises a compliant backing material <b>452</b> on which sensor <b>454</b> is mounted, with electrodes <b>456</b> extending therefrom. During operation, actuating arm <b>41</b> moves downward, flexing compliant backing material <b>452</b> and upward, allowing compliant backing material <b>452</b> to relax, but not to the point of being entirely slack. As with the previously described embodiments, the strain in compliant backing material <b>452</b> is indicated by sensor <b>454</b>, thereby generating a signal proportional to the degree of movement of actuating arm <b>41</b>. The materials, including sensors <b>354</b>, <b>454</b>, that may conveniently be used with sensor assemblies <b>350</b> and <b>450</b> are the same as those described in connection with sensor assembly <b>150</b> above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a further sensor embodiment may be described. As noted above, during operation, compliant members <b>32</b> of mechanical web <b>30</b> flex, thereby moving actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. Just as a sensors <b>154</b>, <b>354</b>, <b>454</b> may be mounted on, and indicate the strain of, compliant backing materials <b>152</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>452</b> as they are flexed and relaxed as actuating arm(s) <b>41</b> move, sensor <b>254</b> may be mounted directly on compliant member <b>32</b> and indicate its strain during operation. This also will provide a signal proportionate to the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. The same types of sensors may be used for sensor <b>254</b> as are appropriate for use with sensors <b>154</b>, <b>354</b>, <b>454</b>. The primary difference being that, whereas sensors <b>154</b>, <b>354</b>, <b>454</b> sense the strain of backing materials <b>152</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>452</b>, sensor <b>254</b> senses the strain of compliant members <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate further configurations and embodiments of sensors <b>554</b> and <b>654</b> appropriate for use with the present invention. Sensor <b>554</b> with terminals <b>556</b> is fixedly attached to the back end of actuating arm <b>41</b> proximal to its connection with mechanical web <b>30</b>. Sensor <b>554</b> extends, however, into space, thereby allowing it to flex as actuating arm <b>41</b> moves. By indicating the degree of flex, sensor <b>554</b> thereby indicates the degree of movement of actuating arm <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, sensor <b>654</b> with terminals <b>656</b> is attached between piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> and second mounting surface <b>654</b> with one end also extending into space. As piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> expands and contracts, sensor <b>654</b> indicates the degree of flexing and, therefore, the degree of movement of piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, which will be proportionate to the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be readily understood by those of skill in the art that actuator <b>1</b> may be activated and deactivated in rapid succession by adapting controller <b>70</b> to apply a power signal of appropriate voltage and frequency to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>. When operated in such a manner, actuator <b>1</b> will achieve natural resonance at frequencies determined by its mass, materials, and other properties. When the actuator achieves resonance, the displacement (or stroke) of its operation will increase even as the energy applied to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> is maintained at a substantially constant level. Accordingly, the energy required to achieve a particular displacement when actuator <b>1</b> is operated in a resonant condition will be less than the energy required to achieve the same displacement when it is operated in a non-resonant condition.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the relationship between displacement and frequency can be understood by plotting the displacement of an actuator arm <b>41</b> against the frequency of activation, while voltage is maintained at a substantially constant level. Plot <b>402</b> illustrates a representative relationship between frequency and displacement when a smart material actuator <b>1</b> adopted for use with the current invention is operated with a minimal or no load, meaning that the actuator arm(s) <b>41</b> are either not attached to any external load, or are attached to a minimal load such as a pump not operating at pressure due to a flow restriction. Plot <b>402</b> has a peak displacement occurring substantially at point <b>404</b>. The frequency at point <b>404</b> is referred to herein as the natural resonant frequency as it indicates the highest expected displacement when the actuator <b>1</b> is operated without a meaningful load. As is clear from plot <b>402</b>, displacement peaks rapidly within a given range of frequencies. The rapid increase and decrease in displacement about the natural resonance frequency at point <b>404</b> occurs due to resonant characteristics of smart material actuator <b>1</b>. Accordingly, if the desired range of operational displacement is predetermined, based for example and without limitation on the displacement required to drive a compressor shaft, it is possible to determine the frequencies at which the range of desired displacement will occur near, and preferably substantially centered around, the natural resonant frequency, as is shown by representative resonant operation range <b>406</b>, which begins at the natural resonant frequency range lower bound <b>405</b> and ends at natural resonant frequency range upper bound <b>407</b>. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the placement of natural resonant frequency range lower bound <b>405</b> and natural resonant frequency range upper bound <b>407</b> will be a matter of choice dependent on the particular application, which will dictate the range of displacements necessary for efficient operation of whatever load is to be actuated by actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. Accordingly, in some applications natural resonant frequency range <b>406</b> will be select to be narrower than in other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Plot <b>412</b> illustrates the relationship between frequency and displacement when the same actuator <b>1</b> is operated with a constant load applied to actuator arm(s) <b>41</b>. As illustrated in plot <b>412</b>, the point of maximum displacement occurs substantially at point <b>414</b>, which occurs at a frequency referred to herein as the loaded resonant frequency, with the loaded resonant operation range being shown by frequency range <b>416</b>. Loaded resonant frequency range <b>416</b> is bounded by loaded resonant frequency range lower bound <b>415</b> and loaded resonant frequency range upper bound <b>417</b>. A number of relationships are apparent from plots <b>402</b> and <b>412</b>, including that loaded resonant frequency range <b>416</b> will be both higher and narrower than natural resonant frequency range <b>406</b>. Also apparent is that, when the voltage is maintained at a substantially constant level, the peak displacement occurring at the loaded resonant frequency indicated by point <b>414</b> will be lower than the displacement occurring at the natural resonant frequency indicated by point <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the relationships between frequency and displacement of loaded and unloaded actuators <b>1</b> when voltage is varied according to load. Plot <b>422</b> illustrates the relationship between frequency and displacement of a smart material actuator <b>1</b> having no external load attached to actuator arm(s) <b>41</b> at voltage levels indicated by plot <b>428</b>. The natural resonant frequency in plot <b>422</b> is indicated by point <b>424</b> with natural resonant frequency range <b>426</b> being bounded by natural resonant frequency range lower bound <b>425</b> and natural resonant frequency range upper bound <b>427</b>. Plot <b>432</b> illustrates the relationship between frequency and displacement of a smart material actuator <b>1</b> having a substantially constant load attached to actuator arm(s) <b>41</b>, also at voltage levels indicated by plot <b>428</b>. The loaded resonant frequency in plot <b>432</b> is indicated by point <b>434</b> with loaded resonant frequency range <b>436</b> being bounded by loaded resonant frequency range lower bound <b>435</b> and loaded resonant frequency range upper bound <b>437</b>. As is shown by plot <b>428</b>, voltage levels may be increased to achieve comparable displacement at the natural resonant frequency indicated by point <b>424</b> and the loaded resonant frequency indicated by point <b>434</b>. Therefore, by varying voltage in addition to frequency, the advantage of the increased stroke occurring at resonant frequencies can be maintained across different load levels. Varying the voltage also assists in minimizing the difference between the width of natural resonant frequency range <b>426</b> and loaded resonant frequency range <b>436</b>. While plots <b>422</b> and <b>432</b> demonstrate the relationship between load and frequency around resonant ranges <b>426</b> and <b>436</b> respectively, they are not necessarily reflective of the displacement levels outside of those ranges when the voltage is varied.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Given the basic relationships between resonant frequency, load, displacement and voltage described above, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that it is possible to adapt a smart material actuator <b>1</b> capable of variable frequency operation such that it may operate more efficiently by maintaining a resonant condition, meaning that it is operating within the loaded resonant frequency range <b>416</b>, <b>436</b> corresponding to the load attached to actuator arm(s) <b>41</b> at a given time. As the displacement generated by a given voltage when a smart material actuator <b>1</b> is operated in a resonant condition is greater than the displacement generated by the same voltage when it is not, it is apparent that greater efficiencies can be achieved my maintaining a resonant condition.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Because the dramatic increase in displacement at resonant frequencies can cause compliant members <b>32</b> to flex to the point of yielding (meaning that they either do not return substantially to their pre-flexed position or lose resilience to flexing to a significant degree), resonant operation has been avoided in the prior art. One reason the prior art has avoided resonant operation is that resonant frequencies tend to be dynamic, varying significantly based on a variety of factors that are constantly changing in real world applications, thereby making it difficult to maintain a resonant condition even when a safe voltage is used. For example, and without limitation, if an actuator <b>1</b> is utilized to drive a pump (not illustrated), the load applied to actuator arm(s) <b>41</b> will vary based on constantly changing factors such as backpressure, viscosity changes, and turbulence in the stream. Prior to the present invention, were an actuator driving such a pump to operate at resonance, and the loaded resonant frequency to change due to dynamic conditions, the actuator <b>1</b> would quickly &#x201c;bog down,&#x201d; because the energy required to drive the pump at resonance would likely be insufficient to drive the pump at non-resonant frequencies. Similarly, were the same actuator to operate near, but outside, resonance, then a change in dynamic conditions causing the resonant frequency of the actuator to match the frequency of operation could cause a rapid increase in displacement, thereby causing damage. For example, damage could occur to a smart material actuator otherwise suitable for use with the present invention if the displacement experienced during resonant operation caused compliant members <b>32</b> of mechanical webs <b>30</b> to &#x201c;overextend&#x201d; to the point that compliant members <b>32</b> exceed their yield points. This can happen easily when resonant operation occurs unexpectedly at too high a voltage level absent the present invention. In such situations, voltage levels are likely too high because higher voltage was required to generate useful displacement prior to entering resonant operation. When that same voltage is maintained and the increased displacement of resonant operation occurs, the yield point is exceeded and either compliant members <b>32</b> cease to operate correctly or piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> fails due to flexing or operation without sufficient compressive forces. One of the improvements offered by the present invention, therefore, is a means of achieving the benefits of resonant operation by allowing smart material actuator <b>1</b> to maintain resonant operation in varying conditions. To do so, however, it is necessary that controller <b>70</b> be adapted to react to changes in loaded resonant ranges <b>416</b>, <b>436</b> during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">One technique for doing so is illustrated by the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Controller <b>70</b> is an electronic control circuit electrically connected to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> and sensor <b>154</b>-<b>854</b>. Controller <b>70</b> is adapted to apply a power signal having a power signal voltage (meaning the alternating current voltage applied to the piezoelectric stack) and a power signal frequency (meaning the frequency of the alternating current being applied to the piezoelectric stack) to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> through stack terminal <b>102</b>. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that only stack one terminal <b>102</b> is required if controller <b>70</b> and piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> share a common ground or reference. The alternating current nature of the power signal will cause actuator <b>1</b> to activate and deactivate approximately at the same frequency as the power signal frequency. Controller <b>70</b> receives a sensor signal (meaning a dynamic electrical current or corresponding digital data) from sensor <b>154</b>-<b>854</b>. Sensor <b>154</b>-<b>854</b> is adapted such that sensor signal <b>70</b> will be proportionate to the degree of movement (or displacement) of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. One such embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in which sensor assembly <b>150</b> comprises compliant backing material <b>152</b> affixed between upper web attachment point <b>38</b> and lower web attachment point <b>39</b>, and sensor <b>154</b> affixed thereto. Terminals <b>156</b> are electrically connected to sensor <b>154</b> and to controller <b>70</b>. As actuator <b>1</b> activates and deactivates, lower web attachment point <b>39</b> and upper web attachment point <b>38</b> will move away from, and then toward, on another, thereby alternately relaxing and flexing backing material <b>152</b>, with greater and lesser degrees of flex and release corresponding to greater and lesser degrees of movement of actuator arm(s) <b>41</b>. Sensor <b>154</b> is adapted to generate an electrical signal corresponding to the strain or flex applied to compliant backing material <b>152</b>. In this way, sensor <b>154</b> generates a sensor signal proportionate to the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. As discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> illustrate alternate embodiments of sensors <b>254</b>-<b>554</b> mounted in different locations but capable of similar operation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, controller <b>70</b> is adapted to determine the phase angle between the power signal and the sensor signal. Plot <b>468</b> illustrates a relationship between phase angle, displacement (also referred to herein as degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>), and power signal frequency. As shown by plot <b>468</b>, when no load is applied to actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>, the phase angle increases as frequency increases, thus illustrating that the expected phase angle for any given frequency can be determined. In this way, a predetermined phase angle range can be calculated by determining the phase angles at the power signal frequencies indicated by points <b>465</b> (indicating entry of natural resonant operation) and <b>467</b> (indicating exit of natural resonant operation). The natural resonance phase angle will be the phase angle at peak resonance and the predetermined phase angle range should be such that the natural resonance phase angle is within, and preferably substantially centered within, the predetermined phase angle range. As phase angle changes relatively quickly in and around the predetermined phase angle range; controller <b>70</b> can sense and react quickly to changes that cause actuator <b>1</b> to enter and leave resonant operation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, controller <b>70</b> can take advantage of these relationships by first applying the power signal to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> in step <b>502</b>. Controller <b>70</b> then determines the phase angle in step <b>504</b> and compares it to the predetermined phase angle range in step <b>506</b>. If the phase angle is below the phase angle range, power signal frequency is adjusted in a first direction in step <b>510</b>. If it is above the predetermined phase angle range, the power signal frequency is adjusted in a second direction in step <b>508</b>. If the phase angle is within range, change in power signal frequency is not required. By repeating this process, resonant operation may be maintained or recaptured if lost through reference to the phase angle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Plot <b>462</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates the relationship between displacement and power signal frequency of an unloaded actuator, with point <b>464</b> representing the actuator's natural resonant frequency. Plot <b>472</b> illustrates the relationship between displacement and power signal frequency of an actuator under load with loaded resonant frequency represented by point <b>474</b>. As illustrated, the predetermined phase angle range when actuator <b>1</b> is loaded (occurring at frequencies between those indicated by points <b>475</b> and <b>477</b>) may be different from the predetermined phase angle range when actuator <b>1</b> is unloaded (occurring at frequencies between those indicated by points <b>465</b> and <b>467</b>). This relationship can be seen by comparing plots <b>468</b> (phase angle under no load) and <b>478</b> (phase angle under a constant load). The change in predetermined phase angle range, however, between loaded and unloaded states is understood to be easily approximated by a linear function. Accordingly, as load increases and decreases, the predetermined phase angle range may be shifted incrementally to compensate. Controller <b>70</b> may determine load based on the sensor signal as described above (which is proportionate to the degree of movement of arms <b>41</b> which degree will vary with load at a given voltage), or by other means apparent to those of skill in the art. In this way, by tracking the predetermined phase angle and adjusting the power signal frequency to maintain the actual phase angle within the predetermined phase angle range, controller <b>70</b> can maintain resonant operation of actuator <b>1</b> in changing conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As is discussed further below, the natural resonant frequency <b>464</b>, loaded resonant frequency <b>474</b> and their corresponding phase angles can change substantially depending on actuator design, application, and sensor location. Accordingly, whereas controller <b>70</b> will increase frequency (the first direction) upon determining the actual phase angle is below the predetermined phase angle range, and will decrease the frequency (the second direction) upon determining the actual phase angle is above the predetermined phase angle range where the relationships are as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, those directions could be reversed given different configurations. Accordingly, some initial measurement or calculation may be required to determine the predetermined phase angle ranges and the directions of adjustment to be used by controller <b>70</b> in a given application. It will also be understood that the breadth of natural resonant frequency range <b>466</b> and loaded resonant frequency range <b>476</b> will also vary according to application with the ranges sometimes being wider and other times being narrower than shown on the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In making changes to power signal frequency, the amount of the change needed can vary depending on how close, or far away, actuator <b>1</b> is from resonant operation. Accordingly, it is preferred to adjust the power signal frequency in increments proportional to the difference between the determined phase angle and the natural resonance phase angle. In this way, the farther outside the predetermined phase angle range the actual phase angle is determined to be, the greater the frequency adjustment that will be applied. To avoid overcompensation, however, it is preferred to have a maximum frequency increment. This helps prevent overcompensation and smoothes the frequency response of controller <b>70</b>. The maximum frequency increment will vary based on application and the speed of controller <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, as has been discussed above, it may be desirable to maintain a consistent displacement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b> across different loads. When utilizing the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, this can be accomplished by adapting controller <b>70</b> to increase the power signal voltage substantially upon determining that the measured phase angle is within the predetermined phase angle range when the degree, of movement is below a predetermined movement lower bound. In other words where controller <b>70</b> is maintaining resonant operation, but actuator <b>1</b> is not generating the minimum required displacement, controller <b>70</b> can increase the power signal voltage. Similarly, substantially upon determining that the measured phase angle is within the predetermined phase angle range, and that the degree of movement is above a predetermined movement upper bound, controller <b>70</b> can reduce the power signal voltage, thereby reducing the risk of extending mechanical webs <b>30</b> beyond their yield points.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to maintaining resonant operation by measurement of phase angle, it is also possible to maintain resonant operation by measuring the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b> without phase angle information. While this method may be used with any sensor location suitable to allow a sensor to provide a sensor signal proportional to the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>, it is preferred in applications where sensors <b>654</b>-<b>854</b> (illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>) are positioned in line with piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>. More particularly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a sensor <b>654</b>, such as those sensors described above, having terminals <b>656</b> may be mounted between piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> and second mounting surface <b>34</b>. As piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> expands and contracts, the strain on sensor <b>654</b> will be proportional to the degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b>. Applying the same principal, sensor <b>754</b> may be a single layer or multi-layer piezoelectric stack may be mounted in line with, but electrically isolated from, piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, either adjacent to second mounting surface <b>34</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) as illustrated, or adjacent to first mounting surface <b>24</b>&#x2032; (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). As is understood, such stacks, whether single layer or multi-layer, can be used as sensors by generating a sensor signal according to the mechanical force applied to them, in addition to acting as drivers as has been discussed in connection with the description of piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>. As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is also possible for a section of piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> to be adapted to act as sensor <b>854</b> by electrically isolating it from the remainder of the stack and providing separate inline sensor terminals <b>856</b> for electrical connection to controller <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in such embodiments, the desired actuating arm displacement range is predetermined based on the requirements of the desired application in step <b>602</b>. Controller <b>70</b> applies a power signal having a power signal frequency to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> as has been described above in step <b>604</b>. Based on the signal from sensor <b>654</b>-<b>854</b>, controller <b>70</b> then determines the actual degree of movement of actuating arm(s) <b>41</b> at step <b>606</b>. If the degree of movement is within the predetermined range, the power signal frequency is maintained. If it is outside the predetermined range, it may be adjusted in step <b>6010</b>. The process repeats in order to attain and/or maintain the resonant condition of actuator <b>1</b>. Where the power signal voltage is maintained at a level low enough to prevent mechanical webs <b>30</b> from reaching their yield point during resonant operation, this method can be used safely both to enter and to maintain resonance.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It will be understood by those in the art that the phase angle measurements described above provide additional information regarding the direction of the necessary frequency adjustment. Such directional information is not strictly needed, however, as controller <b>70</b> can &#x201c;hunt&#x201d; for the proper direction by incrementally increasing or decreasing the power signal frequency and monitoring the resulting change in the degree of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It will also be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that a degree of pre-load placed on piezoelectric stack <b>100</b> is desirable and that the degree of preload will impact the characteristics of the sensor signal generated by inline sensors <b>654</b>-<b>854</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, preload levels may be adjusted by including mechanical adjustment means <b>21</b> such that first mounting surface <b>24</b>&#x2032; can be moved to apply varying pressure on piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Just as the embodiments described herein may be used to maintain resonant operation, they may also be used to avoid resonant operation by reversing the methods already described such that controller <b>70</b> moves the power signal away from the range of resonant frequency once a threshold phase angle or threshold degree of movement is detected. Where displacement will be used, a maximum actuator arm displacement may be predetermined. Controller <b>70</b> may then be adapted to avoid operating actuator <b>1</b> in a resonant condition by applying a power signal having a power signal frequency to piezoelectric stack <b>100</b>, and adjusting the power signal frequency substantially upon determining that the degree of movement exceeds the predetermined maximum actuator arm displacement. This substantially prevents actuator <b>1</b> from operating in a resonant condition by changing the power signal frequency at the initial signs of the onset of resonance, thereby safely allowing operation at near resonant frequencies with voltages that would cause mechanical webs <b>30</b> to exceed their yield points at resonant frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As will be understood from the foregoing discussion, it is desirable to have an actuator <b>1</b> with a loaded resonant frequency (as indicated by points <b>414</b>, <b>434</b>, <b>474</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>) that corresponds to the frequencies demanded by the application. For example, where actuator <b>1</b> is applied to driving a compressor, it would be desirable for the loaded resonant frequency of actuator <b>1</b> at loads typically generated by the compressor to correspond to efficient speeds of operation for the compressor. For any given actuator <b>1</b>, that may not be the case. Therefore, also disclosed are methods of adjusting the resonant frequency of a smart material actuator according to the present invention to more closely match the demands of given applications. When discussing adjustment of resonance frequency, the general term &#x2018;resonant frequency&#x2019; is used as opposed to the more specific terms loaded resonant frequency and natural resonant frequency as the methods apply equally to adjusting resonance in both loaded and unloaded conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">One method of adjusting the resonant frequency of a smart material actuator involves adjusting the mass of the actuator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a mechanical amplifier <b>110</b> having a single mountable actuating arm <b>141</b> that is adapted for such adjustment. Fixed supporting member <b>120</b>, mechanical webs <b>130</b> and actuating arm <b>141</b> are formed of discrete components. As such, the mass of an assembled actuator utilizing mechanical amplifier <b>110</b> may be adjusted by replacing components with those made from heavier or lighter materials as necessary to adjust the resonant frequency. More particularly, a desired resonant frequency may be predetermined. Then the actual resonant frequency of an actuator utilizing mechanical amplifier <b>110</b> may be determined. If the actual resonant frequency is too low, components of mechanical amplifier <b>110</b> may be replace with lower mass components to raise the resonant frequency. If the actual resonant frequency is too high, higher mass components may be substituted to lower that frequency. A particularly convenient component to substitute when adjusting resonant frequency is mountable actuating arm <b>141</b>. Different arm designs (for example and without limitation solid arms, hollow arms) and arms of different materials (for example and without limitation stainless steel, aluminum, composite, or ceramic) will have different masses, thereby allowing for different resonant frequency adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An alternate embodiment of a mechanical amplifier <b>210</b> suitable for use with smart material actuators adapted for use with the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this embodiment, mountable arm <b>241</b> is a low mass, channel-shaped arm adapted to attach to amounting point <b>233</b> on mechanical webs <b>230</b>. By selecting arms with fully or partially hollow channels, a variety of mass adjustments may be achieved. Additionally, as illustrated the embodiments of mechanical amplifiers <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> are adapted to have either one or two mountable actuating arms <b>241</b>, thereby allowing for still more adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Mechanical amplifiers <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> offer a further method of adjusting resonant frequency. Because mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> are discrete components, it is possible to change the resonant frequency by altering the stiffness of compliant members <b>132</b>, <b>232</b>. As with adjusting mass, the first steps are to determine the desired resonant frequency and compare it to the actual resonant frequency. Then the resonant frequency can be raised by replacing mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> with mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> having stiffer compliant members <b>132</b>, <b>232</b>. Conversely, the resonant frequency may be lowered by replacing mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> with mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> having compliant members <b>132</b>, <b>232</b> that are less stiff. Stiffness may be adjusted in a variety of manners understood in the art including using different materials, increasing or decreasing the thickness of compliant members <b>132</b>, <b>232</b>, or alternatively increasing or decreasing their length. It will also be understood that allowing for mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> with longer compliant members <b>132</b>, <b>232</b> has an additional advantage of increasing the yield point of mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>. Increasing the yield point is desirable because it allows for a greater degree of safety by allowing mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> to withstand periods of greater than usual displacement without greatly diminishing the useful lifetime of mechanical webs <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A further method of adjusting resonant frequency is illustrated with the embodiment of mechanical amplifier <b>310</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Whereas actuators adapted for use in the present invention may conveniently be mounted to a fixed surface on by one mountable actuating arm <b>341</b> and a load to be actuated on a second mountable actuating arm <b>341</b>, other mounting methods are also possible. Changing among such mounting methods will also adjust resonant frequency in practice. In addition to utilizing two mountable actuating arms <b>341</b>, one attached to a fixed point and the other to an actuated load, it is also possible to directly mount the lower portion of mechanical webs <b>330</b> directly to a fixed surface. Alternatively, mounting block <b>360</b> may be attached to fixed supporting member <b>320</b> with mechanical fasteners passing through holes <b>365</b> and <b>325</b>. Mounting block <b>360</b> may then be attached to a fixed location allowing actuating arm(s) <b>341</b> to actuate freely. Each different mounting method will typically generate a different resonant frequency, thereby allowing for a further degree of freedom in matching, or tuning, the resonant frequency of an actuator comprising mechanical amplifier <b>310</b> to suit the needs of a particular application</p>
