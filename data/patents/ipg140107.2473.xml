<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Breast carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the U.S. (Jemal et al., 2005<i>. CA Cancer J Clin </i>55:10-30). Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer significantly improves 5-year survival rates (Ries et al., 2005. SEER Cancer statistics review. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.). Currently the only approved screening method for the detection for breast cancer is mammography.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past few years, several large-scale proteomic studies have begun to characterize the proteome of breast cancer (Pucci-Minafra et al., 2006<i>. Proteomics </i>6:2609-25; Celis et al., 2004<i>. Mol Cell Proteomics </i>3:327-44; Hudelist et al., 2006<i>. Proteomics </i>6:1989-2002). This high-throughput strategy leads to complex data sets that, while rich in information, are often not very useful in predicting proteins that may be sensitive and specific biomarkers for the disease.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest reproductive tract malignancy of women in Western countries (Ozols et al., 2004<i>. Cancer Cell </i>5:19-24). Ovarian cancer survival rates at years are only 30% for women diagnosed with distant metastases; however, the percentage survival climbs to 90% for women diagnosed with disease confined to the ovary (Hayat et al., 2007<i>. Oncologist </i>12:20-37). Unfortunately, fewer than 25% of women are diagnosed when the disease is confined, due primarily to the lack of screening tests capable of detecting ovarian cancers early.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reliable biomarkers are not available for the majority of cancers and precancerous conditions. Specifically, there is a lack of secreted biomarkers that can be detected through non-invasive assays such as blood tests. Without convenient and easily accessible screening tests for cancers and precancerous conditions, diagnostic delays will continue to plague the health care system and thwart efforts to detect and treat malignancies in their earliest stages.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to cancer biomarkers, particularly glycoprotein biomarkers. A preferred cancer biomarker according to the invention is a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein. The present invention additionally provides methods for identifying glycoproteins possessing a cancer-specific glycoform, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic methods and compositions related to glycoprotein cancer biomarkers. Cancer biomarkers of the invention can be specific for any cancer, without limitation. Preferred cancer biomarkers and are specific for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and liver cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the invention provides a diagnostic method for evaluating the presence, absence, nature or extent of cancer or a precancerous condition in a subject. The subject can be any mammalian subject, and is preferably a human or a domestic animal. In one embodiment, the diagnostic method involves detecting the presence of a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein in a biological sample obtained from the subject, wherein the cancer-specific glycoform comprises glycan that is indicative of the presence of cancer or a precancerous condition. The biological sample can include, without limitation a biological fluid, such as blood, serum or plasma, or it can be a tissue or organ sample.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Any convenient method can be used to detect the cancer-specific glycoform. In one embodiment, the cancer-specific glycoform can be detected by contacting the biological sample with a glycan-binding molecule specific for the glycan, under conditions that permit binding of the cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein to the glycan-binding molecule. Exemplary and preferred glycan-binding molecules include a lectin, a glycospecific antibody, a glycospecific aptamer, a glycospecific peptide, and a glycospecific small molecule. In other embodiments, other detection methods can be used, for example mass analysis methods such mass spectrometry.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment of the diagnostic method wherein cancer or a precancerous condition of the breast is evaluated, exemplary glycoprotein breast cancer biomarkers include glycoproteins set forth in Table 4, including periostin and osteoglycin. Examples of glycans that can be detected on a breast cancer-specific glycoprotein glycoform include a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,6) Man branched N-linked glycan and a branched N-linked glycan extended with N-acetyllactosamine. A preferred glycan-binding molecule for use in evaluating breast cancer is the lectin leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the diagnostic method wherein cancer or a precancerous condition of the ovary is evaluated, exemplary glycoprotein ovarian cancer markers include glycoproteins set forth in Table 8. Examples of glycans that can be detected on an ovarian cancer-specific glycoprotein glycoform include a glycan containing &#x3b1;(1,6)-fucose linked to core N-acetylglucosamine (core fucosylation), and a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,4) Man bisected N-linked glycan. Preferred glycan-binding molecules for use in evaluating ovarian cancer include erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA), <i>Aleuria aurantia </i>lectin (AAL) and <i>Datura stramonium </i>lectin (DSL).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, the invention provides a method for identifying a biomarker associated with cancer. In one embodiment, a biological test sample from a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition is contacted with a glycan-binding molecule specific for a glycan, under conditions that permit binding of the glycan-binding molecule to the glycan, when present, yielding a bound glycoprotein/glycan-binding molecule complex. The biological sample is preferably a tissue or organ sample; for example obtained from a cancerous tumor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A reference or control sample (a noncancerous biological sample) is preferably analyzed and compared with the test sample from the subject with cancer or a precancerous condition. The noncancerous biological sample can be from the same subject, a different subject, or it can be a pooled sample from a number of disease-free subjects. The noncancerous biological sample can be contacted with the glycan-binding molecule specific for the glycan, under conditions that permit binding of the glycan-binding molecule to the glycan, when present, to yield a bound glycoprotein/glycan-binding molecule complex. The presence of a cancer-specific glycoform can be evaluated by determining whether the amount of bound glycoprotein from the tumor sample is greater than the amount of bound glycoprotein from the noncancerous sample, wherein a greater amount in the tumor sample indicates the presence of a cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein. Preferred glycan-binding molecules include those that are preferred for use in the diagnostic method of the invention, but are not limited thereto. Preferred glycans that can be detected with a glycan-binding molecule according to the identification method of the invention a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,6) Man branched N-linked glycan, a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,4) Man bisected N-linked glycan, a glycan containing &#x3b1;(1,6) fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine, and a branched N-linked glycan extended with N-acetyllactosamine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, the invention includes glycoprotein cancer biomarkers identified using methods as described herein. Exemplary glycoprotein cancer biomarkers are set forth in Tables 4 and 6, and include a cancer-specific glycoform of periostin, preferably including a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,6) Man branched N-linked glycan component, and a cancer-specific glycoform of osteoglycin, preferably including GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,6) Man branched N-linked glycan component. Cancer-specific glycoforms of glycoproteins included in the present invention include but are not limited to cancer-specific glycoforms possessing one or more of the following glycan components or structural features: a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,6) Man branched N-linked glycan component and a branched N-linked glycan extended with N-acetyllactosamine, a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,4) Man bisected N-linked glycan component, and an &#x3b1;(1,6) fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The diagnostic methods of the invention and the biomarker identification method of the invention are both amenable to multiplexing. For example, a multiplexed diagnostic method for evaluating the presence, absence, nature or extent of cancer or a precancerous condition in a subject can include providing a biological sample obtained from the subject, wherein the biological sample includes a plurality of glycoproteins; and, for each of the plurality of glycoproteins, determining the presence, absence or amount of a cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein in the biological sample, wherein the presence, absence or amount of the cancer-specific glycoform is indicative of cancer or a precancerous condition. In a multiplexed breast cancer diagnostic method, preferably the plurality of glycoproteins evaluated includes at least two proteins independently selected from the proteins set forth in Table 4. More preferably, the multiplexed breast cancer detection method detects cancer-specific glycoforms of periostin and osteoglycin. In a multiplexed ovarian cancer diagnostic method, preferably the plurality of glycoproteins evaluated includes at least two proteins independently selected from the proteins set forth in Table 8.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present invention is based upon the discovery that there exist cancer-specific glycoforms of various glycoproteins, and that these glycoforms can be identified, detected, and distinguished through the use of glycan-binding molecules such as lectins. Cancer-specific glycoforms serve as useful biological markers, i.e., biomarkers, of cancer or precancerous conditions. The cancer-specific biomarkers of the invention can be used to detect or monitor the progression of cancer or precancerous conditions, as well as to distinguish cancerous or precancerous conditions from each other and from benign (non-cancerous) disease states. The cancer-specific biomarker may be specific for a disease stage, hormone receptor status, lymph node status and her2/new status. The present invention provides both individual biomarkers as well as a panel of biomarkers useful for cancer screening.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Surprisingly, the invention allows detection of a cancer biomarker protein that may be present in equal or indistinguishable protein levels in diseased and normal samples. Although the total protein level or abundance may be equal as between the two samples, the invention facilitates discrimination between a protein glycoform that is present in the diseased and a different protein glycoform present in the normal sample.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Advantageously, cancer-specific biomarkers of the invention include glycoproteins that are present in blood or blood components, such as serum and/or plasma, or that have been secreted into other biological fluids. Biomarkers that are present in bodily fluids are especially well-suited for high throughput screening and early detection efforts. Blood and other bodily fluids present a readily accessible format for early detection. The identification of fluid biomarkers and development of a non-invasive screening test for cancers and precancerous conditions represents a significant medical advance.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Exemplary cancer-specific biomarkers of the invention include periostin and osteoglycin (also known as mimecan), each of which possesses at least one cancer-specific glycoform.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The invention also provides a method for identifying cancer-specific biomarkers. The identification method of the invention represents a targeted glycoproteomic approach to biomarker identification. The method makes use of a glycan-binding molecule, such as a glycospecific antibody, an a glycospecific aptamer, or a lectin, to identify a glycoform of a glycoprotein that is enriched in a biological sample containing cancer cells compared to a normal biological sample, and is thus cancer-specific. In some instances, the identification method may find a cancer-specific glycoprotein that is not found at all in normal samples. In other instances, the identification method may find a cancer-specific protein that is not a glycoprotein, but associates with a glycoprotein that binds to the glycan-binding molecule and is as a result affinity-enriched. In other instances, the identification method may find a cancer-specific glycoprotein, which is not glycosylated in its normal form but becomes glycosylated during oncogenic transformation. Typically, however, the method identifies a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein, with different glycoforms of the glycoprotein being found in healthy and cancerous tissues or fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Lectins and other glycan-binding molecules can be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention to detect the presence of cancer-specific biomarker glycoforms, but it should be understood that cancer-specific glycoforms of glycoproteins can be detected using other detection methods as well. Furthermore, in addition to having utility in diagnostic methods, the cancer-specific biomarkers of the invention may serve as or may further suggest additional therapeutic targets.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Cancer-Specific Biomarker</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A biomarker is a molecular, biological, or physical characteristic that can be measured or otherwise evaluated as an indicator of a normal biologic process, disease state, or response to a therapeutic intervention. The biomarker of the invention is a &#x201c;cancer-specific&#x201d; biomarker, i.e., it is indicative of cancer or a precancerous condition. Biomarkers of the invention include, but are not limited to, an RNA transcript, a protein, or a modified protein such as a glycoprotein. Biomarkers are detectable and/or measurable by any of a variety of methods such as biochemical and/or molecular assays.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cancer-specific biomarker may be indicative of cancer or a precancerous condition by its presence, absence, increase in amount, decrease in amount, or differential glycosylation. Advances in proteomic methods now enable one to quantify a biomarker such that increases or decreases in the abundance of the biomarker, in addition to the complete presence or absence of the biomarker, may be indicative of the presence of cancer or a precancerous condition. Amounts of biomarker can be determined in absolute or relative terms. Accordingly, a glycoprotein biomarker may indicate the presence of cancer or a precancerous condition simply by its presence, absence or amount compared to a noncancerous sample or a predetermined level; however, the cancer-specific glycoprotein biomarker preferably takes the form of a cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein. In another embodiment, the cancer-specific biomarker is an enzyme that catalyzes the particular linkage characterizing, and preferably specific to, the cancer-specific glycoform.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The cancer-specific biomarker of the invention is preferably a protein, more preferably a post-translationally modified protein, and even more preferably, a glycoprotein. The term &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; as used herein, refers broadly to a polymer of two or more amino acids joined together by peptide bonds. The term &#x201c;protein&#x201d; does not imply a particular polymer length and thus includes peptides, oligopeptides, and polypeptides. The term protein also includes molecules which contain more than one peptide joined by a disulfide bond, or complexes of peptides that are joined together, covalently or noncovalently, as multimers (e.g., dimers, tetramers). The term &#x201c;glycoprotein&#x201d; includes any molecule that contains both a protein component and a carbohydrate component. The carbohydrate component is commonly referred to as a &#x201c;glycan.&#x201d; As used herein, the term glycoprotein is inclusive of a glycopeptide, a glycopolypeptide and a proteoglycan. A glycan may contain one monosaccharide, or it may contain two or more monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds. A glycan can include nonrepeating or repeating monosaccharides, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, the term &#x201c;glycan&#x201d; is interchangeable with the term saccharide, which includes a monosaccharide, a disaccharide or a trisaccharide; it can include an oligosaccharide or a polysaccharide. An oligosaccharide is an oligomeric saccharide that contains two or more saccharides. The structure of an oligosaccharide is typically characterized by particular identity, order, linkage positions (including branch points), and linkage stereochemistry (&#x3b1;, &#x3b2;) of the monomers, and as a result has a defined molecular weight and composition. An oligosaccharide typically contains about 2 to about 20 or more saccharide monomers. In a polysaccharide, the identity, order, linkage positions (including branch points) and/or linkage stereochemistry can vary from molecule to molecule. Polysaccharides typically contain a larger number of monomeric components than oligosaccharides and thus have higher molecular weights. The term &#x201c;glycan&#x201d; as used herein is inclusive of both oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, and includes both branched and unbranched polymers as defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The glycan component of a glycoprotein can be N-linked or O-linked. An N-glycan is attached to a nitrogen atom, for example, at the side chain nitrogen atom of an asparagine amino acid within the peptide. An O-linked glycan is attached to an oxygen atom, for example at the side chain hydroxyl oxygen of a hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, serine, or threonine amino acid within the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">&#x201c;Glycosylation&#x201d; refers to the covalent attachment of at least one saccharide moiety to a molecule. Glycosidic linkages include O-glycosidic linkages, N-glycosidic linkages, S-glycosidic linkages and C-glycosidic linkages. An O-glycosidic linkage is formed between the anomeric carbon (C1) of a saccharide and an oxygen atom of another molecule (such as another saccharide or a polypeptide), while an N-glycosidic linkage is formed between the anomeric carbon (C1) of a saccharide and a nitrogen atom of another molecule. Likewise, S-glycosidic linkages and C-glycosidic linkages involve a sulphur and carbon atom from another molecule, respectively. In addition, glycosidic linkages are classified according to the ring position of the carbon atoms participating in the bond. For example, a 1,4 glycosidic linkage is formed between the first carbon (C1) on a first saccharide and the fourth carbon (C4) on a second saccharide while a 1,6 glycosidic linkage is formed between the first carbon (C1) on a first saccharide and the sixth carbon (C6) on a second saccharide. Glycosidic linkages are further classified as &#x3b1;-glycosidic or &#x3b2;-glycosidic according to whether the substituent groups on the carbons flanking the oxygen in the saccharide are pointing in the same or opposite directions. The term &#x201c;glycosylation&#x201d; as used herein should be broadly construed so as to encompass the covalent linkage of any other carbohydrate moieties such as fucose and sialic acid, and as such includes fucosylation or sialylation. Most N-linked glycans share a common structure, referred to as a core, which typically contains three mannose, and two N-acetylglucosamine residues. The core may contain modifications such as sulfation or phosphorylation; the core may be intact or it may be truncated. Terminal modifications and core modifications of a glycan can include glycosylations. Core glycosylation refers to the addition of glycosyl moieties to a core N-acetylglucosamine. Core fucosylation refers to the addition of a fucose residue to the core N-acetylglucosamine.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A glycan can be branched or unbranched. A complex glycan is a glycan that contains at least one branch point. In a complex or branched glycan, the monosaccharide at the branch point is covalently linked to two other saccharides at carbons other than C1. For example, a branch point monosaccharide may be linked to other monosaccharides at C4 and C6, in addition to being linked to another monosaccharide or to an amino acid at C1. A complex glycan may be, without limitation, biantennary, triantennary, or tetraantennary. Additionally or alternatively, a complex glycan may be bisected (see, e.g., the structure catalyzed by MGAT3 in reaction 5 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Cancer-Specific Glycoforms</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Glycosylation is a dynamic, post-translational modification that can be altered during the development and progression of a cancer or a precancerous condition. As a result, the same glycoprotein (&#x201c;same&#x201d; in the sense that it contains the same or essentially the same amino acid sequence; for example protein isoforms are considered to be the same protein) may be expressed both before and after oncogenic transformation, but the glycosylation of the glycoprotein before and after oncogenic transformation may be different. Glycoproteins having the same or essentially the same protein sequence, but exhibiting a difference in glycosylation, are termed &#x201c;glycoforms.&#x201d; A cancer-specific glycoform is thus distinguishable from other (e.g., normal) glycoform(s) by a difference in glycosylation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Differences in glycosylation that can produce distinct glycoforms include the removal of a glycan component, the addition of a glycan component, a change in the glycan component such as the substitution of one glycan component for another, and the rearrangement of one or more glycan components on the glycoprotein, as where a glycan component is shifted from one position on the polypeptide sequence to another.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Differences in glycosylation can be detected, according to the present invention, by utilizing a glycan-binding molecule, such as a glycospecific antibody, a glycospecific aptamer, or a lectin as further described herein, that is selective and/or specific for the cancer-specific glycoform. A particularly preferred glycospecific antibody is one that binds to an epitope that includes portions of both the polypeptide sequence and the glycan. Differences in glycosylation can also be detected spectroscopically. For example mass spectrometry can be used to characterize the glycan component and distinguish glycoforms.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;cancer-specific glycoform&#x201d; and &#x201c;tumor-specific glycoform&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to a glycoform of a glycoprotein which is found in a subject affected with cancer or a precancerous condition and which differs from a glycoform found in noncancerous tissue. The presence, absence or expression level of the cancer-specific glycoform is indicative of the presence, absence, nature, or extent of a cancer or a precancerous condition. In a cancer-specific glycoform, the protein component is the same as that found in the normal glycoform, but the glycan component is specific to a cancer or a precancerous condition. In other words, an exemplary cancer-specific glycoform is differentially glycosylated relative to the glycoform present in a normal or non-diseased sample. As shown in the following examples, a cancer-specific glycoform may be characterized by, for example, a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,6) Man branched N-linked glycan component, a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,4) Man bisected N-linked glycan component, an &#x3b1;(1,6) fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine, or a branched N-linked glycan extended with N-acetyllactosamine. For example, a subject having cancer or a precancerous disease may express a glycoprotein containing a &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan component while this &#x3b2;(1,6) structure is absent from the analogous glycoprotein in a subject not having cancer or a precancerous condition. In this instance, the glycoprotein having the &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structure is the cancer-specific glycoform of that glycoprotein, and the detection of the cancer-specific glycoform is indicative of the presence of a cancer or a pre-cancerous condition.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Note that the designation &#x3b2;(1,6) as in a &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan is beta(1,6); the designation &#x3b2;(1,4) as in &#x3b2;(1,4) bisected N-linked glycan is beta(1,4); and the designation &#x3b1;(1,6) as in &#x3b1;(1,6) fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine is alpha(1,6).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some cases, the cancer-specific glycoform may be present in a disease-free individual, but expression of the cancer-specific glycoform may be elevated or reduced in an individual having cancer or a precancerous condition, in which case it is the change in expression level that is indicative of cancer or a precancerous condition. In other cases, the cancer-specific glycoform may be present only in a patient having cancer or a precancerous condition, and a different glycoform may be detectable in nonaffected individuals. In yet other cases, the glycoprotein itself (the cancer-specific biomarker), which in this case may exist only as a single glycoform may be found only in patients having cancer or a precancerous condition, and may not be detectable in nonaffected individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Cancer-specific glycoprotein glycoforms of the invention can be structurally characterized or identified by one or more of their protein sequence, their ability to bind one or more glycan-binding molecules, and the chemical structure of their glycan component. An example of a cancer-specific glycoform is L-PHA reactive periostin, which can be identified or distinguished by, for example, sequential or concurrent contact with L-PHA lectin and an anti-periostin antibody. The ability of a cancer-specific glycoform to bind a particular glycan-binding molecule, e.g., a lectin, provides structural information about the glycoform in that it indicates that the glycoform possesses one or more structural features, such as a particular glycosidic linkage, necessary to bind the glycan-binding molecule. One of skill in the art can, if desired, isolate and further characterize the glycoform, for example by performing a structural analysis to determine monosaccharide composition, linkage positions, branching, or sequence of the glycan component, but such structural characterization of the glycan component is not necessary in order to practice the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Examples of cancer-specific glycoprotein biomarkers that have been identified according to the identification method of the invention and which are particularly useful are described in more detail below and include, without limitation, periostin, osteoglycin (also called mimecan), lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP-1), and lectin galactosidase soluble binding protein 3 (GALS3BP). Advantageously, cancer-specific glycoforms of these glycoproteins may be secreted or show residency on the outer surface of the cell from which they may be shed and find their way into the bloodstream or a bodily discharge.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Glycan-Binding Molecules</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present invention makes use of glycan-binding molecules to detect glycoprotein glycoforms. The term &#x201c;glycan-binding molecule&#x201d; refers to any molecule that is capable of binding to a glycan component of a glycoprotein. Preferably, the glycan-binding molecule is glycoform-specific; that is, it selectively binds the glycan of one glycoform of a glycoprotein but not another, such that it can be used to distinguish different glycoforms of the glycoprotein. A glycoform-specific glycan-binding molecule is referred to herein as a &#x201c;glycospecific.&#x201d; A glycan-binding molecule can be natural or synthetic. Examples of glycan-binding molecules include, without limitation, a lectin, a glycospecific antibody, a glycospecific aptamer, a glycospecific peptide, or a glycospecific small molecule. The term &#x201c;aptamer&#x201d; includes an RNA aptamer, a DNA aptamer, and a peptide aptamer, without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the glycan-binding molecule selectively binds to a combination of the glycan component and the peptide component. For example, in the case of a glycan-binding molecule that is an antibody, the epitope includes portions of the glycan moiety as well as portions of the polypeptide sequence. This enhanced selectivity allows a single glycan-binding molecule to distinguish a glycoprotein from other proteins as well as from other glycoforms of the same protein. It also allows discrimination between glycoforms that have identical or essentially identical composition (i.e., same polypeptide sequence and glycan component) but wherein the glycan is attached at different locations in the polypeptide sequence as between the two glycoforms. In other words, the glycan-binding molecule can detect site-specific differences in glycosylation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Preferably, the method of the invention utilizes a lectin to identify or detect a cancer-specific glycoprotein glycoform. Lectins are proteins or glycoproteins that bind to all or part of a glycan structure. Typically, lectins are non-enzymatic in action and are non-immune in origin. A lectin may bind to a glycan moiety which is part of a glycoprotein or another glycan-containing molecule such as glycolipids, glycophosphatidylinositols, and glycosaminoglycans. Lectins occur ubiquitously in nature and are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants and animals. Exemplary lections include, without limitation, P-lectins, I-lectins, C-lectins, S-lectins (galectins), selectins, microbial carbohydrate proteins, glycosamineglycan binding proteins, and plant lectins. Lectins may also be produced synthetically by methods commonly used in the art such as recombinant DNA technology. A lectin useful in the method of the invention may be isolated from any source and may be naturally or synthetically produced, without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Importantly, lectins are capable of binding to specific glycans. Advantageously, the high specificity of a lectin for a particular glycan moiety enables the use of a lectin-glycoprotein binding to precipitate, isolate and/or detect glycoproteins (such as a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein) from or in a biological sample. For example, a type of N-linked glycosylation that is often increased in tumors, including breast and colon carcinoma, is the N-linked &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycan. This glycan structure associated with the transition to malignancy is recognized by the lectin L-PHA, particularly when the glycan also expresses a distal &#x3b2;(1,4) linked galactose.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Lectins and their specificities are widely known in the art (see Cummings and Etzler, &#x201c;Antibodies and Lectins in Glycan Analysis,&#x201d; in <i>Essentials of Glycobiology Second Edition</i>, Varki et al. (Eds.); Cold Spring Harbor Press: Woodbury, N.Y.; 2009 and Tao et al., 2008 Glycobiology 18(10):761-769). Table 1 shows exemplary lectins and their binding specificities. It should be understood that Table 1 is illustrative only, and is not comprehensive with respect to either known lectins or with respect to the specificities shown for a particular lectin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also shows exemplary lectin specifities.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Generally, in the biomarker identification method of the invention, any lectin may be used, without limitation. In the diagnostic method of the invention, a lectin that is specific for the cancer-specific biomarker (e.g., glycoform) to be detected can be used. Preferred lectins for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, <i>Aleuria aurantia </i>lectin (AAL), concanavalin A (Con A), <i>Datura stramonium </i>lectin (DSL; also known as DHA, <i>Datura stramonium </i>agglutinin), <i>Phaseolus vulgaris </i>erythroagglutinin (E-PHA), <i>P. vulgaris </i>leukoagglutinin (L-PHA), <i>Maackia amurensis </i>agglutinin (MAA), and <i>Sambucus nigra </i>agglutinin (SNA, inclusive of SNAI and SNAII).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Identification of a Biomarker</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Included in the invention is a method for identifying a biomarker, preferably a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment of the method, a glycan-binding molecule, such as a lectin, is combined with a biological sample obtained from a patient with cancer or a precancerous condition, or from a cancer cell culture or animal with cancer or a precancerous condition (animal model), under conditions that allow the lectin to bind to a glycoprotein to faun a lectin-glycoprotein complex. A control experiment is also performed. This lectin enrichment step coupled with a protein identification strategy identifies specific glycoproteins from the disease sample that are not enriched in the corresponding control sample. More particularly, the binding levels between the two samples are compared, and if they differ, the lectin-glycoprotein complex is optionally isolated, and the glycoprotein biomarker is identified. It should be noted that the presence, absence, increase in amount, decrease in amount, or differential glycosylation of the glycoprotein in the sample from the patient with cancer or a precancerous condition, compared to the analogous glycoprotein in the control sample, is indicative of the presence of a cancer-specific biomarker. The identification of cancer-specific biomarkers that selectively bind to a cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein (thereby causing different binding levels based on differential glycosylation of a glycoprotein found in both normal and disease samples) is particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Optionally, the glycan-binding molecule used in the method of identifying a biomarker may be tagged. The reasons and methods for tagging proteins are well known in art. For example, a protein may be tagged in order to facilitate isolation or tracking. Various types of tags that facilitate isolation or purification of the tagged biomolecule are commercially available and well known in the art and include, for example, beads (magnetic, sepharose, glass, agarose etc.), fusion peptides (hemagglutin, 6-histadine, c-myc, fluorescent proteins, GST, etc.), or antibody-based technologies such as biotin-avidin. A tag may include a detectable marker. Detectable markers are widely used in the art and may be used for visualization. Examples or detectable markers include, but are not limited to, enzymatic reactions such as horseradish peroxidase, colorimetic readouts such as 3,3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), and the use of fluorescence, radioactivity, or chemiluminescence.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Methods for detecting proteins, and thereby methods for detecting lectin-glycoprotein binding, are also well known in the art include, for example, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, immunoblotting (i.e. Western blotting). Methods of isolating a protein are well known in the art and include, for example, immunoprecipitation (IP), sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), or 2D gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The glycoproteins isolated in the lectin-glycoprotein complex may be identified by a number of different means that are commonly used in the art. Optionally, the components of the lectin-glycoprotein complex may be cleaved from each other prior to analysis through chemical or enzymatic cleavage. Preferably, the cleavage is enzymatic. Both the glycan and the protein components may be identified through methods that are routine in the field and well known in the art. Protein identification and sequencing methods are well known in the art and include, without limitation, Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Typically, protein sequencing is followed by comparison of the protein sequence against databases such as Entrez (available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website found on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and UniProt (available at the European Bioinformatics Institute website found on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprotf). These databases are publically available and the methods of using them are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Optionally, the method may include identifying or characterizing the glycan moiety present on the glycoprotein. The glycan component may be structurally identified by deglycosylating the isolated glycoprotein and subjecting the glycan component to methods commonly used to elucidate saccharide structures such as chemical analysis, mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The method for identifying a biomarker optionally utilizes a panel of lectins. A &#x201c;panel of lectins&#x201d; is to be broadly understood to encompass one or more lectins, for example, at least 2 lectins, at least 5 lectins, or at least 10 lectins. The lectins used in the panel may have the same glycan specificity, similar glycan specificity or disparate specificity. Preferably, the panel of lectins consists of lectins having specificity for glycans containing branch points. More preferably, the panel of lectins consists of lectins having specificity for outer-branched glycans. A preferred panel of lectins contains at one, two, three, four, five, six or all seven lectins selected from AAL, ConA, DSL, E-PHA, L-PHA, MAA, and SNA, and optionally, additional lectins. A particularly preferred panel of lectins includes one or more of E-PHA, AAL, DSL, and/or L-PHA.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">One of skill in the art will recognize that while the identification method is preferably performed using a lectin as the glycan-binding molecule, the method can be performed using any molecule capable of binding the glycan component of a glycoprotein, preferably a glycospecific molecule capable of selectively binding a glycoform of a protein. Such glycospecific molecules include, without limitation, a lectin, a glycospecific antibody, a glycospecific aptamer, a glycospecific peptide, a glycospecific peptidomimetic or other small glycospecific molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The biological sample used in the biomarker identification method of the invention is preferably a sample obtained from an organ or tissue, or a fluid associated with an organ or tissue, although it may also be a biological fluid such as blood or blood components, a bodily discharge, aspirate, and the like. More preferably, the biological sample of the method for identifying a biomarker is a tissue biopsy. The biological sample obtained from the patient having cancer or a precancerous condition preferably contains cancer cells. The sample may be pre-treated such that the cells are lysed, and partially purified to isolate, for example, a protein fraction or glycoprotein fraction prior to contact with the glycan-binding molecule. An example of an optional purification step is delipidation of the sample. The method therefore encompasses combining a glycan-binding molecule with one or more glycoproteins thus purified, partially purified or isolated from a biological sample (candidate biomarkers) to assay the particular glycoprotein(s) for cancer-specificity. Differential binding of the glycoprotein(s) in the biological sample compared to a control sample is indicative of the presence of a candidate biomarker.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Material from an experimental model (including both animal models and culture systems) can also be used to identify a cancer-specific biomarker. In experimental models and cultures, carcinogenic properties or the cancer or precancerous condition may be spontaneously present or may be induced. One of skill in the art is familiar with methods for transforming cells and inducing tumors in experimental models.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A biological sample also includes in vitro culture constituents derived from organ, tissue, or cell culture including, but not limited to, conditioned media, tissue homogenates, whole cells, cell lysates, and cellular fractions or components. However, it is important to note that the cellular mechanisms and processes of in vitro cultures may not accurately represent the cellular mechanisms and processes of cells that have been isolated from an in vivo setting in which the cellular microenvironment plays in important role in the maintenance of cellular mechanisms and processes, thus the use of biological samples obtained directly from a patient is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A control sample useful in the biomarker identification method of the invention includes a biological sample which is obtained from an experimental model (including both animal models and culture systems) that does not exhibit carcinogenic properties or from a subject without cancer or a precancerous condition. The control sample may also be referred to as a non-diseased sample. Preferably, the control sample is obtained from the same source as the biological sample having cancer or a precancerous condition. For example, typically multiple biopsy samples are taken in parallel such that one sample contains tissue exhibiting cancer or a precancerous disease while a second or subsequent sample contains adjacent, non-diseased tissue. Alternatively, tissue may be examined histologically and tissue exhibiting cancer or precancerous condition and non-diseased tissue present in the same tissue sample may be separated by techniques such as, but not limited to, laser capture microdissection. Control samples obtained from the same source are often referred to as tissue-matched controls. For example, when practicing the biomarker identification method to identify breast cancer specific biomarkers, control samples are preferably obtained from the same patient using disease-free samples outside the tumor margin.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some instances, a control sample may not be obtainable from the same source as the biological sample having exhibiting cancer or a precancerous condition. A control sample may be obtained from a second model or subject that does not exhibit carcinogenic properties or from a subject without cancer or a precancerous condition. Optionally, the control sample may be a pool of samples from multiple models that do not exhibit carcinogenic properties or from multiple subjects without cancer or precancerous conditions. For example, when practicing the biomarker identification method to identify ovarian cancer specific biomarkers, control samples (and optionally the experimental samples as well) are typically pooled samples.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, the control sample may be obtained from an experimental model or a subject exhibiting a particular disease state. A number of cancers are characterized by progressive disease states, such as those characterized by inflammation, dysplasia, hyperplasia, or cancer stages. In some tissues or organs, various disease states are distinct from one another. For example, a non-diseased pancreas may progress to either pancreatitis or to a pancreatic cancer. However, in other tissues or organs, there is a distinct disease progression. For example, non-diseased endometria may progress to endometrial hyperplasia which further progresses to endometrial cancer. In addition, non-diseased breast tissue may develop into breast hyperplasia that often progresses into a breast cancer. Thus, the method of the invention may be used to identify biomarkers specific to each stage of cancer or to specific disease states.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It will be appreciated that an enzyme that catalyzes a particular linkage specific to a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein (as compared with a normal glycoform) can also be cancer-specific biomarker. That is, once a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein has been identified, and the differential glycosylation has been characterized, enzymes such as glycosyltransferases (GT) and glycosylhydrolases (GH) that catalyze the cancer-specific glycosylation can also serve as cancer-specific biomarkers. For example, expression of MGAT3 is increased in human ovarian tumor samples relative to normal ovarian tissue (Example III). Additional examples of such enzymes include, without limitation, alpha-(1,6)-fucosyltransferase encoded by the FUT8 gene, the mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferase enzymes encoded by the Mgat genes (or the GnT genes), and the mannosidases encoded by the ManII genes.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A number of cancer-specific biomarkers have been identified using the biomarker identification method of the invention. They include periostin, osteoglycin (also called mimecan), lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP-1), and lectin galactosidase soluble binding protein 3 (GALS3BP). Each of these biomarkers has a cancer-specific glycoform, which can be selectively detected using a lectin, as illustrated in the following Examples. Proteins involved in certain metabolic pathways are particularly preferred as breast cancer biomarkers, including those involved in urokinase plasminogen activator pathway and the TGF&#x3b2; pathway (such as the extracellular proteoglycans decorin and biglycan), as well as binding proteins related to cell adhesion, cell-cell communication, organ development and metabolism, and proteins that respond to external stimulus.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Preferred glycoproteins for use as biomarkers specific to breast cancer include, but are not limited to, proteins listed in Table 4 and in Table 5 (Example II). Breast cancer biomarkers that have glycoforms containing a &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan component are preferred. Breast cancer biomarkers are preferably L-PHA reactive. In a preferred embodiment, a breast cancer biomarker is periostin (POSTN), osteoglycin (mimecan; OGN), haptoglobin-related protein (HPR), apo-A1 precursor (APOA-1), collagen VI &#x3b1;3 (COL6A3), collagen &#x3b1;1 VI chain precursor (COL6A1), collagen &#x3b1;1 VI isoform 2C2 (COL6A2), tubulin &#x3b1;6 (TUBA1C), variable Ig (IGLV4-3), triosphosphate iso (TPI1), &#x3b1;-1 antitrypsin inhibitor (SERPINA1), vimentin-like 50 kDA (VM), or 14-3-3-zeta protein (KCIP-1). Abbreviations are used in the following examples and are provided here for convenience and ease of reference only. It is believed that neither osteoglycin nor 14-3-3-zeta protein have been previously associated with breast cancer, and further that this is the first report of a difference in glycosylation between the faun of periostin found in normal breast tissue, and the form of periostin found in breast cancer tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferred glycoproteins for use as biomarkers specific to ovarian cancer include, but are not limited to, proteins listed in Table 8 (Example IV) and in Tables 10 and 11 (Example VII). Ovarian cancer biomarkers that have glycoforms containing glycans that exhibit core fucosylation and bisected (also referred to as &#x201c;bisecting&#x201d;) glycans, preferably bisected complex N-glycans, are preferred. Ovarian cancer biomarkers are preferably E-PHA reactive, AAL reactive, or DSL reactive. More preferably, ovarian cancer biomarkers may be selected from the group including periostin (POSTN), biglycan (BGN), heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) serine protease inhibitor H1 (SERPINH1), lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1), lectin galactosidase soluble binding protein 3 (LGALS3BP), complement factor B (CFB), fibulin 5 (FBLN5), mucin 5b (MUC5b), and lactotransferrin (LTF). Particularly preferred biomarkers include periostin, thrombospondin 1, and lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1. For example, the cancer-specific form of periostin is E-PHA reactive and possesses bisected N-linked glycans. LAMP-1 cancer-specific forms are DSL-reactive and/or AAL-reactive.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In another aspect, the glycoprotein of the invention is used to produce a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody that recognizes the cancer-specific biomarker. Preferably the antibody is a glycospecific antibody as previously defined. Briefly, the glycospecific antibody recognizes differences in glycosylation of a glycoprotein. More preferably, the antibody recognizes a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody recognizes and/or selectively binds to a combination of the glycan component and the peptide component of the cancer-specific biomarker. Antibodies of the invention include but are not limited to those that recognize cancer-specific glycoforms of periostin, osteoglycin/mimecan, or thrombospondin 1. The invention encompasses the method of making said antibodies, as well as the antibodies themselves and hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For preparation of an antibody of the present invention, any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture may be used. For example, the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler and Milstein (256 Nature 495-497 (1975)) may be used. See also Ausubel et al., Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual, (Harlow &#x26; Lane eds., Cold Spring Harbor Lab. 1988); Current Protocols in Immunology, (Colligan et al., eds., Greene Pub. Assoc. &#x26; Wiley Interscience N.Y., 1992-1996).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The present invention also provides for a hybridoma cell line that produces a monoclonal antibody, preferably one that has a high degree of specificity and affinity toward its antigen. Such cell lines can be produced artificially using known methods and still have the characteristic properties of the starting material. For example, they may remain capable of producing the antibodies according to the invention or derivatives thereof, and secreting them into the surrounding medium. Optionally, the hybridoma cell lines may occur spontaneously. Clones and sub-clones of hybridoma cell lines are to be understood as being hybridomas that are produced from the starting clone by repeated cloning and that still have the main features of the starting clone.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Antibodies can be elicited in an animal host by immunization with a cancer-specific biomarker as identified herein, or can be formed by in vitro immunization (sensitization) of immune cells. For example, the host or cell can be immunized using a three-component carbohydrate vaccine that consists essentially of three main components: at least one carbohydrate component that contains a B-epitope; at least one peptide component that contains a helper T-epitope; and at least one lipid component which functions as a built-in adjuvant. Preferably, the three-component carbohydrate vaccine has as its B-epitope, its T-epitope, or both, the glycospecific region of the cancer-specific biomarker of the invention. Advantageously, the three-component carbohydrate vaccine is thus able to elicit both a humoral response to the B-epitope and a cellular immune response to T-epitope enabling the production of high-titer IgG antibodies that recognize the cancer-specific biomarker of the invention. Exemplary three-component carbohydrate vaccines and methods of making them are described in, for example, WO 2007/079448, US Patent Publication 2009/0041836 A1, and WO 2010/002478.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The antibodies can also be produced in recombinant systems in which the appropriate cell lines are transformed, transfected, infected or transduced with appropriate antibody-encoding DNA. Alternatively, the antibodies can be constructed by biochemical reconstitution of purified heavy and light chains.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once an antibody molecule has been produced by an animal, chemically synthesized, or recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences known in the art to facilitate purification.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies) and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. &#x201c;Antibody fragments&#x201d; comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to Fab, Fab', and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; and single-chain antibody molecules. The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to antibodies that are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; as used herein also includes naturally occurring antibodies as well as non-naturally occurring antibodies, including, for example, single chain antibodies, chimeric, bifunctional and humanized antibodies, as well as antigen-binding fragments thereof. Such non-naturally occurring antibodies can be constructed using solid phase peptide synthesis, can be produced recombinantly or can be obtained, for example, by screening combinatorial libraries consisting of variable heavy chains and variable light chains as described by Huse et al. (Science 246:1275-1281 (1989)). These and other methods of making functional antibodies are well known to those skilled in the art (Winter and Harris, Immunol. Today 14:243-246 (1993); Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989); Harlow and Lane, supra, 1988); Hilyard et al., Protein Engineering: A practical approach (IRL Press 1992); Borrabeck, Antibody Engineering, 2d ed. (Oxford University Press 1995)).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In all mammalian species, antibody peptides contain constant (i.e., highly conserved) and variable regions, and, within the latter, there are the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and the so-called &#x201c;framework regions&#x201d; made up of amino acid sequences within the variable region of the heavy or light chain but outside the CDRs. Preferably the antibody of the present invention has been humanized. As used herein, the term &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody refers to antibodies in which non-human CDRs are transferred from heavy and light variable chains of the non-human immunoglobulin into a variable region designed to contain a number of amino acid residues found within the framework region in human IgG. Similar conversion of mouse/human chimeric antibodies to a humanized antibody has been described before. General techniques for cloning murine immunoglobulin variable domains are described, for example, by the publication of Orlandi et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86: 3833 (1989), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Techniques for producing humanized MAbs are described, for example, by Jones et al., Nature 321: 522 (1986), Riechmann et al., Nature 332: 323 (1988), Verhoeyen et al., Science 239: 1534 (1988), and Singer et al., J. Immun. 150: 2844 (1993), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Methods of using the antibody that recognizes and/or selectively binds to a cancer-specific biomarker are also encompassed by the invention. Uses for the antibody of the invention include, but are not limited to, diagnostic, therapeutic, and research uses. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody can be used for diagnostic purposes. Because differential glycosylation is associated with a variety of disease states, detection of changes in the levels glycan modifications may be interpreted as early indicators of the onset of such diseases. For example, the presence of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycosylation on periostin is a marker of breast cancer (Example II and Example V). Therefore, identifying an increased level of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycosylation in a biological sample of breast tissue relative to a non-disease control sample may be indicative of the presence of cancer.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Detection of Cancers and Precancerous Diseases</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The goal of cancer screening is to find cancers and precancerous conditions prior to the development of symptoms. As used herein the term &#x201c;screening&#x201d; refers to tests and examinations used to evaluate the presence, absence, nature or extent of a cancer or a precancerous condition. The term &#x201c;early detection&#x201d; refers to specific screening processes that allow detection and evaluation of a cancer or precancerous condition at an early point in disease progression. For example, early detection allows the evaluation of a cancer or a precancerous condition in subjects who do not yet display symptoms of the cancer or precancerous condition. Cancers or precancerous conditions that are detected due to the manifestation of symptoms tend to be late-stage cancers that are relatively advanced and may have spread beyond the primary tumor site. In contrast, cancers found during early detection screens are more likely to be in an early stage and still be confined to the primary tumor site. It is widely understood and documented in the art that cancers that are detected early and remain as small, primary tumors are more easily treated and have better prognoses than cancers that are detected at later stages in which the tumors are large and have likely metastasized.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Diagnostic Assay</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Included in the present invention is a method for detecting a cancer or a pre-cancerous condition in a subject. The method utilizes the biomarkers of the invention, as described herein, and can be used alone or in combination with other procedures commonly used to detect or evaluate cancer or a precancerous condition. The method for detecting a cancer or a precancerous condition in a subject includes assaying for the presence of a biomarker and is useful for, among other things, diagnosing the presence of, evaluating the stage of, and determining prognosis of a cancer of precancerous condition.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In embodiments of the diagnostic assay wherein the biomarker is a glycoprotein glycoform, the diagnostic assay makes use of a glycan-binding molecule, such as a lectin, to discriminate among different glycans and thereby glycoforms, and optionally a second binding molecule, typically an antibody specific for the polypeptide component of the glycoprotein (regardless of isoform), to identify the glycoprotein. The antibody specific for the polypeptide component is referred to herein as a &#x201c;protein antibody.&#x201d; For example, a cancer-specific glycoform of the cancer biomarker periostin can be recognized by the lectin L-PHA, but L-PHA is not specific for periostin, as it can recognize the same glycan on other glycoproteins. The L-PHA reactive periostin can be unequivocally identified as periostin through the use of a periostin antibody, which is commercially available from, for example, Abcam. Advantageously, the glycan-binding molecule and/or the protein antibody can be detectably labelled. A preferred detectable label is biotin.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a preferred embodiment of the diagnostic method of the invention, the biomarker is a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein. Exemplary glycoprotein glycoforms are set forth elsewhere herein. It should be understood that the invention is generally applicable detection of any cancer-specific glycoform, without limitation. Cancer-specific glycoprotein glycoforms can include, for example, contain glycan components that include, for example, a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,6) Man branched N-linked glycan component, a GlcNAc &#x3b2;(1,4) Man bisected N-linked glycan component, an &#x3b1;(1,6) fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine, or a branched N-linked glycan extended with N-acetyllactosamine.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The diagnostic assays of the invention are described below with reference to a lectin, but it should be understood that any glycan-binding molecule, such as a glycospecific antibody, a glycospecific aptamer, a glycospecific peptide, or a glycospecific small molecule, can be used in place of a lectin.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment of the diagnostic method of the invention, a glycan-specific molecule, such as a lectin, is combined with a biological sample isolated from a subject, under conditions to allow lectin-glycan binding, yielding a lectin-glycoprotein complex. The resulting lectin-glycoprotein complex is isolated, and the lectin-reactive glycoprotein biomarker is detected, wherein detection of the biomarker is indicative of presence of cancer or a precancerous condition. Methods of detecting or measuring the levels of a protein, including a glycoprotein, are well known in the art and include, without limitation, immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, and immunoblotting (i.e. Western blotting). The glycoprotein biomarker can be conveniently detected using a detectably labelled antibody specific for the protein (a protein antibody). Optionally, the method may further include comparing the amount of biomarker to the amount of biomarker in a reference sample, or to a reference level, to determine whether the amount of the biomarker is indicative of the presence of cancer or a precancerous condition.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In an alternative embodiment of the diagnostic method of the invention, the glycan specific molecule is a glycospecific antibody. The method includes combining a glycospecific antibody with a biological sample isolated from a subject, under conditions to allow antibody-glycan binding, yielding an antibody-glycoprotein complex, and the antibody-reactive glycoprotein biomarker is detected, wherein detection of the biomarker is indicative of presence of cancer or a precancerous condition. Methods of detecting or measuring the levels of a protein, including a glycospecific antibody, are well known in the art and have been previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In cases where glycosylation is altered in the disease state, an antibody that is specific to either the disease state or the non-disease state may be used. Preferably, the antibody is specific to the disease state and binding of the antibody to the protein or peptide is indicative of the presence of the disease state in the subject. In cases where the antibody is specific to the non-disease state, a lack of binding of the antibody to the protein or peptide is indicative of the presence of the disease state in the subject. Alternatively, glycosylation may be present in the disease state and absent in the non-disease state or glycosylation may be absent in the disease state and present in the non-disease state. Optionally, the method may further include incubating a second, non-diseased, biological sample with an antibody of the invention, detecting binding of the antibody to a protein or peptide, and comparing antibody binding in the first and second samples.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Additionally, for protein and peptides where glycosylation is present in both the disease state and the non-disease state, but is altered (i.e. increased or decreased) in the disease state, the method may further include quantitating the level of antibody binding in the first sample, quantitating the level of antibody binding in the second, non-diseased sample, and comparing the binding levels. A change in antibody binding in the first sample compared to the non-diseased sample is indicative of the presence of the infection, disease or disorder in the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Any biological sample can be tested, without limitation. Advantageously, the invention permits detection of the biomarker in bodily fluids, providing a convenient, low-cost screening option. Biological samples that can be tested in the diagnostic method of the invention include, without limitation, organs, tissues (including biopsies), fecal matter, bone marrow, lymph tissue, biological fluids, and bodily discharges obtained from a human or veterinary subject. Biological fluids may include, without being limited to, blood (including components of blood such as serum or plasma), urine, bile, spinal fluid, lymph fluid, ascites fluid, pancreatic ductal fluid, sputum, pleural fluid, tears, saliva, mucus, breast milk and bodily discharges (such as vaginal discharge, nasal discharge, and nipple aspirate). A biological fluid is also intended to include breath in both a vaporous and liquid form. Preferably, the biological sample is obtained from a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition, although the screening method of the invention contemplates that both diseased and nondiseased subjects will be screened. Preferably, the biological sample in the diagnostic method of the invention is a biological fluid. More preferably, the biological sample is serum, vaginal discharge, or nipple aspirate. Even more preferably, the biological sample is serum.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another embodiment, the diagnostic method includes combining a glycoform-specific lectin with one or more purified or partially purified glycoproteins obtained from a biological sample, enabling lectin-glycan binding to form a lectin-glycoprotein complex, and detecting a cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein, wherein detection of the cancer-specific glycoform is indicative of presence of cancer or a precancerous condition. Isolation or purification of the glycoprotein(s) prior to contact with the lectin can be accomplished by fractionating the sample using any convenient method, for example by contacting the sample with a lectin with lesser specificity (e.g., concanavalin A, which binds high mannose, hybrid, and complex biantennary glycans). Likewise, the biological sample can be first contacted with a protein antibody to isolate the glycoprotein, and then contacted with the glycoform-specific molecule, such as a lectin, to determine whether the isolated glycoprotein is a cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein. Optionally, the method may further include comparing the amount of biomarker to a reference, wherein altered glycosylation or altered expression of the biomarker relative to the reference is indicative of the presence of cancer or a precancerous condition.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the diagnostic method of the invention, the glycan-binding molecule selectively binds to a combination of the glycan component and the peptide component. For example, in the case of a glycan-binding molecule that is an antibody, the epitope includes portions of the glycan moiety as well as portions of the polypeptide sequence. This enhanced selectivity allows a single glycan-binding molecule to distinguish a glycoprotein from other proteins as well as from other glycoforms of the same protein, thereby performing in a single step the functions of the glycan discrimination and protein identification.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Furthermore, it should be understood that detection of a cancer-specific glycoform or other biomarker in the diagnostic assay of the invention is not limited to chemical or immunochemical binding methods but includes any method of detection, without limitation, including for example spectroscopic detection such as mass spectrometric analysis, fluorescence, magnetic, electromagnetic or optical methods, or chemical analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another embodiment of the diagnostic method of the invention, a subject's bodily fluids, tissues or organs can be assayed for the presence of an autoimmune response to cancer or a precancerous condition. More specifically, the subject can be screened for the presence of circulating antibodies to one or more cancer biomarkers of the invention. For example, antigen that include a peptide sequence and glycan component that characterize a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein can be synthesized, and the subject's bodily fluid, tissue or organ can be contacted with the antigen to determine the presence of an antibody that binds thereto. The diagnostic assay is readily scalable and amenable to multiplexing in order to facilitate cancer screening using a multiplicity of synthetic cancer biomarkers.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In embodiments of the diagnostic assay wherein the biomarker is a glycosyltransferase (GT) or a glycosylhydrolyase (GE) enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a cancer-specific glycoprotein glycoform, the diagnostic assay typically measures RNA transcript levels for the enzyme, or enzyme activity.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Accordingly, in another embodiment, the diagnostic method involved detecting an enzyme biomarker that catalyzes a particular linkage characterizing a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein. Detection of an enzyme may occur at either a protein or a transcript level. Methods of detecting a protein include, without limitation, immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, and immunoblotting (i.e. Western blotting). Examples of assays that may be used to detect a transcript are well known in the art and include, for example, Northern blot assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions, RNase protection assays, and the like. Optionally, the method for detecting a biomarker in a subject, wherein the biomarker is an enzyme that catalyzes the particular linkage characterizing the cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein may further include comparing the amount of biomarker to a reference, wherein altered expression of the biomarker is indicative of the presence of cancer or a precancerous condition.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Preferred enzyme biomarkers include, without limitation, enzymes encoded by the genes listed in Table 6 (Example III). Particularly preferred biomarkers include, without limitation N-acetyl glucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8), mannosidase N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3 (MGAT3), MGAT4a, MGAT4b, MGAT5, and MGAT5b. GnT-V catalyzes the addition of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycans. FUT8 catalyzes the addition of core fucosylated N-linked glycans. MGAT3 catalyzes the addition of bisected N-linked glycans. MGAT4a and MGAT4b catalyze the addition of outer-branched N-linked &#x3b2;(1,4) glycans. MGAT5 catalyzes the addition of outer branched N-linked &#x3b2;(1,4) glycans. These glycan moieties are recognized by preferred lectins of the invention such as AAL, ConA, DSL, E-PHA, L-PHA, MAA, and SNA.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A &#x201c;reference&#x201d; includes, without limitation, a control sample (as previously defined) that may be used in comparison against the biological sample isolated from a subject. For example, the reference may be obtained from a subject without cancer or a precancerous condition. Optionally, the reference may be a pool of samples obtained from at least two subjects without cancer or a precancerous condition. Alternatively, the reference may be obtained from a subject having a cancer or a pre-cancerous condition at a determined stage. Alternatively, the reference may be a previously obtained biological sample from the subject. Alternatively, the reference may be a published or commonly known level of the biomarker (Galen, <i>Beyond Normality: the predictive value and efficiency of medical diagnosis</i>, Wiley &#x26; Sons: New York, N.Y.; 1975). For example, prostatic states such as non-diseased prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer each exhibit a particular range of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) biomarker and the level of PSA associated with each state is commonly accepted by clinicians and used as a reference in diagnostic assays.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; and &#x201c;pre-cancerous condition&#x201d; refer to any uncontrolled and/or undesired growth of cells. The cancer or pre-cancerous condition is intended to include a hyperplastic growth, a benign tumor, a malignant tumor, or a metastasized tumor. A tumor is not limited to a solid tumor, but is intended to include any uncontrolled and/or undesired growth of cells including, for example, blood tumors that do not form a solid mass. The tumor may consist of, without being limited to, epithelial cells, stromal cells, undifferentiated cells, or any combination thereof. An epithelial cell is any cell that covers a surface, or lines a cavity or the like, and that, in addition, performs the functional aspect of the tissue such as any secretory, transporting, or regulatory function. Epithelial cells may be further classified as, for example, endothelial or mesothelial cells. Nonlimiting examples of epithelial cells include squamous, cuboidal, columnar, transitional, simple, stratified, and secretory. A stromal cell, also referred to as a mesenchymal cell, provides support for or surrounds tissues and organs. Nonlimiting examples of stromal cells include fibroblasts, immune cells, pericytes, endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. A carcinoma is a tumor derived from or consisting primarily of epithelial cells. Preferably, the cancer of pre-cancerous condition of the present invention is a carcinoma. Exemplary carcinomas for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, breast, ovarian, colon, rectal, colorectal, pancreatic, or liver carcinomas.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">This diagnostic method of the invention is highly amenable to multiplexing. For example, a panel of glycoform-specific (glycospecific) binding molecules (binding elements), such as lectins, glycospecific antibodies, or glycospecific aptamers, can be used to assay the biological sample for the presence or absence of cancer-specific glycoform biomarkers. The glycoform-specific binding molecules selected for use in the multiplexed assay preferably, but need not, bind cancer-specific glycoforms of a plurality of different glycoproteins, e.g., periostin and osteoglycin. The glycoproteins present in the glycoprotein/lectin complexes can then be identified using protein-specific antibodies. In another example, a panel of protein-specific antibodies (binding elements) can be used to assay the biological sample for the presence or absence of different glycoproteins that are known to possess a cancer-specific glycoform, then the bound glycoprotein/antibody complexes can be further assayed for the presence of cancer-specific glycoforms by contacting them with a plurality of glycospecific molecules such as lectins, glycospecific aptamers, or glycospecific second antibodies known to selectively bind the cancer-specific glycoforms.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A multiplexed panel is to be broadly understood to encompass a multiplicity of binding elements. A multiplexed panel can include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more biomarkers. Preferably, the biomarker panel includes at least two biomarkers selected from periostin, osteoglycin, lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1, and lectin galactosidase soluble binding protein 3. More preferably, the biomarker panel includes at least periostin and osteoglycin.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Preferably, the method for identifying a biomarker is a high-throughput assay. High throughput assays allow numerous samples to be reviewed rapidly and simultaneously for the presence of one or more particular glycan components. Typically, a high-throughput assay is performed in a micro-titer plate that enables the review of, for example, at least 6, at least 24, at least 96, at least 384, at least 1536, or at least 3456 samples. Assays that use micro-titer plates are well known in the art and are capable of, for example, detecting molecular interactions, detecting cell growth, detecting enzymatic activity, nucleic acid quantitation, and immunoassays. Detection methods commonly used in such assays include, but are not limited to absorbance, fluorescence intensity, and luminescence. Preferably, the method of identifying a biomarker utilizes enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect lectin-glycoprotein binding. Alternatively, a high-throughput assay may include any assay that simultaneously evaluates a large number or samples, such as microarray technologies.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Therapeutic Applications</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Also included in the invention is a therapeutic method and pharmaceutical composition for treating a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition. The method and pharmaceutical composition for treating a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition can be used alone or in combination with other procedures commonly used to treat cancer or a precancerous condition such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Cancer-specific glycoforms contain aberrant glycan moieties relative to the glycoform present in a non-diseased subject. Glycosylation and the resulting glycan moiety affect the ability of the protein to transduce normal cellular signals. For example, the glycan moiety present on a cancer-specific glycoform may cause a physical block of a typical binding interaction, prevent typical migration, induce atypical migration, or otherwise interfere with the normal signal transduction of the glycoprotein to result in mis-regulated cellular signaling that can result in the development of cancer or a precancerous condition. Therefore, inhibiting the production of or the function of a cancer-specific glycoform may restore normal signal transduction pathways to treat or prevent cancer or a precancerous disease.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In one embodiment, the method for treating a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition may include administering a therapeutic agent capable of targeting a biomarker, wherein the biomarker is a cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein. Administration of the therapeutic agent can be prophylactic or, alternatively, can be initiated after the development of a cancer or a precancerous condition. Treatment that is prophylactic, for instance, initiated before a subject manifests symptoms of a cancer or a precancerous condition, is referred to herein as treatment of a subject that is &#x201c;at risk&#x201d; of developing the condition. Treatment initiated after the development of a cancer or a precancerous condition may result in decreasing the severity of the symptoms of one of the conditions, or completely removing the symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The term &#x201c;therapeutic agent,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a molecule capable of inhibiting a cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein. Inhibition may occur at a number of different levels. For example, one could prevent transcription, prevent translation, prevent posttranslational modification, or prevent function of the cancer-specific glycoform. Methods for preventing transcription are well known in the art and include, without limitation, and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), morpholinos, and anti-sense DNA-hybridizing probes. Methods for preventing translation are well known in the art and include, without limitation, RNA interference (RNAi), and small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Methods for preventing posttranslational modification include inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes the particular linkage characterizing the cancer-specific glycoform by any of the inhibition methods listed herein. Methods for preventing the function of the cancer-specific glycoform are well known in the art and include, without limitation, antibody technology, peptidomimetics, and small molecule inhibitors. Preferably, the therapeutic agent of the invention prevents the aberrant glycosylation of the cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Also included in the invention is a composition containing the therapeutic agent. A composition may be prepared by methods well known in the art of pharmacy. In general, a composition can be formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Typically, the composition further contains a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable,&#x201d; as used herein, means that the therapeutic agent so described is suitable for use in contact with a subject without undue toxicity, incompatibility, instability, allergic response, and the like. Typically, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The therapeutic agent may be administered by a number of methods including, but not limited to, oral and systemic administration. Therapeutic amounts are amounts which eliminate or reduce the patient's tumor burden, or which prevent or reduce the proliferation of metastatic cells. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the therapeutic agent can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. For administration by inhalation, the active compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration includes transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Preferably the therapeutic agent is a glycan-binding molecule including, but not limited to lectins, glycospecific antibodies, and any small molecules capable of specifically binding to the cancer-specific glycoform. More preferably, the therapeutic agent is a lectin or a glycan-specific antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Optionally, the method may further include conjugating the therapeutic agent to a cytotoxic agent, further enhancing toxicity to targeted cells. Such agents include, but are not limited to, known chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapeutic agents, and radiotherapeutic agents.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In another embodiment, the invention may include a method for treating a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition, wherein the glycan moiety present on the cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein is a targeting moiety. Glycans are typically maintained on the cell surface. Therefore, the cancer-specific glycoform of a glycoprotein provides a novel target for delivering therapeutic agents to the tumor. Currently, one of the major issues in cancer therapies is effectively targeting the tumor cells. Consequently, a majority of the cancer therapies currently available are toxic to many healthy cells as well as to cancer cells.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The method for treating a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition, wherein the glycan moiety present on the cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein is a targeting moiety may include administering a glycan-binding molecule conjugated to a therapeutic agent to a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition, wherein the glycan-binding molecule or glycopeptide binding specifically targets the glycan moiety on the cancer-specific glycoform of the glycoprotein.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">It should be noted that although the invention is described primarily with respect to cancer and precancerous conditions in humans, it is equally applicable to all mammalian subjects and, in that regard, has application in veterinary and research settings as well as in human medical contexts. Preferably, the subject is a mammal. A mammal may include, without limitation, domestic animals (such as cats, dogs, horses, and cattle), laboratory animals (such as mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys), and humans. More preferably, the subject is a human.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. It is to be understood that the particular examples, materials, amounts, and procedures are to be interpreted broadly in accordance with the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth herein.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Glycosylation is a dynamic post-translational modification that changes during the development and progression of various malignancies. Oncogenically transformed cells demonstrate defined changes in glycan structures, in particular they show increased amount of a specific type of N-linked structure known as the &#x3b2;(1,6) branch (Pierce et al., 1997 <i>Glycoconj J</i>14:623-630). The enzyme known as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) adds GlcNAc in a &#x3b2;(1,6) linkage to form the branch that leads to the formation of complex polylactosamine structures. During the oncogenesis of breast carcinoma, GnT-V transcript levels and activity are increased due to activated oncogenic signaling pathways. Elevated GnT-V levels leads to increased &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures on glycoproteins that can be measured by the binding of a specific lectin, L-PHA. L-PHA immunohistochemical staining on paraffin sections of normal breast carcinoma, ductal hyperplasia, and carcinoma in situ reveal that L-PHA staining was qualitative at the point cells are progressing to carcinoma in situ (Fernandes et al., <i>Cancer Res., </i>1991. 51:718-723). The L-PHA staining of breast carcinoma frequently shows a coarse granular type punctate staining pattern. L-PHA does not bind to non-diseased breast epithelial cells, but during the progression to invasive carcinoma, cells show a progressive increase in L-PHA binding.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">We have developed a procedure for intact protein L-PHA-affinity enrichment followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to identify potential biomarkers for the early detection of breast carcinoma. We have characterized the media from the invasive breast cancer cell line MBAMB231 for L-PHA-reactive proteins, and found that this methodology clearly detects glycoproteins with &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycan structures as well as proteins that are associated with these glycoproteins. Our results identified proteins participating in the urokinase plasminogen activator pathway and the TGFb pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In example II we analyzed matched normal and malignant tissue from patients with invasive breast ductal carcinoma. L-PHA enrichment coupled with ESI-MS identified specific glycoproteins from the tumor tissue that are not enriched in the corresponding normal tissue sample for the same patient. These results indicate that lectin enrichment strategies that target glycan changes known to occur during the oncogenesis of a particular tumor can be a powerful method of biomarker discovery.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Methods</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Cells were cultured in serum-free media. Proteins secreted from cultured cells were collected from the media, concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged. Biotinylated L-PHA lectin was added to the proteins. Magnetic streptavidin particles were then added to the solution containing both the proteins and the biotinylated L-PHA. Lectin-bound glycoproteins were captured using a magnetic stand, washed, and eluted in urea/DTT. The eluted proteins were carboxyamidomethylated and subjected to a tryptic digestion and C18 reverse phase chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">CID fragmentation was carried out on an LTQ. All experiments were performed using nanospray of eluent from a reverse-phase C18 capillary column (75 mM by 10 cm) using an increasing gradient of acetonitrile in formic acid. Data was stringently filtered using Turbo Sequest to achieve a false positive rate of less than 1.5% for any single peptide (protein false positive rate of less than 0.3% with 2+ peptides) using an inverted database.</p>

GnT-V is the only glycosyltransferase in breast cancer cells that adds the branched &#x3b2;(1,6) glycan structure required for L-PHA binding. Therefore to test the specificity of the L-PHA lectin we have suppressed the expression of GnT-V using RNA interference. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a lectin blot showing the reactivity of L-PHA toward total cellular proteins extracted from wild-type and GnT-V(&#x2212;) MDA-MB231 invasive breast carcinoma cells (the three bold bands are non-specific bands resulting from the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase detection).</p>

Conclusions
</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">GnT-V glycosylation correlates with transition from normal breast epithelium to carcinoma in situ. GnT-V glycosylation can be identified by the specific and high affinity binding of the lectin L-PHA. In this evaluation of secreted L-PHA reactive glycoproteins from an invasive breast carcinoma cell line we have specifically captured, identified, and initiated mapping of N-glycosylated peptides using mass spectrometry. Our results have identified several glycoproteins implicated in cell proliferation and cell migration control mechanisms. In Example II we show the use of this lectin affinity method to pull out &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycoproteins from matched normal and ductal invasive carcinoma tissue samples, correlate the results and identify potential biomarkers for the development of a serum-based breast cancer screening assay as illustrated in Example V.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Glycosylation is clearly the most complex set of post-translational modifications that proteins undergo during biosynthesis, and several specific types of glycan epitopes have been shown to be associated with various types of cancer (Kim and Varki, 1997. Glycoconj J 14:569-76; Hakomori, 2001<i>. Adv Exp Med Biol </i>491:369-402). The glycosylation patterns of cell surface glycoproteins play important roles in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. During oncogenesis, distinct signal transduction pathways are altered, leading to the differential expression of numerous genes. Genes known as glycosyltransferases (GT) and glycosyihydrolases (GH), responsible for the addition and removal of sugars on proteins in the ER and Golgi apparatus, can change activity during oncogenesis, causing different oligosaccharide structures to emerge on cell surface glycoproteins (Pierce and Arango, 1986<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>261:10772-10777; Meezan et al., 1969<i>. Biochemistry </i>8:2518-2524). These glycan changes can have potent effects on the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor invasion and metastasis (Guo et al., 2002<i>. Cancer Res. </i>62:6837-6845; Guo et al., 2003<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>278:52412-52424; Guo et al., 2007<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>282:22150-22162; Abbott et al., 2006<i>. Exp. Cell Res. </i>312:2837-2850). Factors contributing to the regulation of glycosylation include: nucleotide sugar donor availability, substrate availability, sequential reactions, and transcriptional regulation of GT and GH. Studies examining the dynamics of the glycome during differentiation of stem cells have found that changes in GT and GH mRNA levels correlate well with glycan structures observed (Nairn et al., 2007<i>. J. Proteome Res. </i>6:4374-4387). Therefore, despite the complexity of factors influencing glycosylation, transcriptional regulation of the enzymes involved in the synthesis and catabolism of glycans seems to be the one of the primary mechanisms to control glycan structures on the cell surface. Comparative studies examining the differences in GT and GH expression patterns between normal and tumor tissue could direct the discovery of tumor-specific glycosylation changes associated with particular malignancies, which could then be exploited to develop diagnostic and cell targeting reagents.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A particular type of N-linked glycosylation that is often increased in tumors is the N-linked &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycan (Pierce and Arango, 1986<i>. J Biol Chem </i>261:10772-7) that is bound by the lectin, L-PHA, when the glycan also expresses a distal &#x3b2;(1,4) linked galactose (circled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982<i>. J Biol Chem </i>257:11235-40; Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982<i>. J Biol Chem </i>257:11230-4). For example, staining of normal breast epithelia shows insignificant reactivity with L-PHA; yet, in breast carcinoma, staining by this lectin significantly increases (Fernandes et al., 1991<i>. Cancer Res </i>51:718-23; Dennis and Laferte, 1989<i>. Cancer Res </i>49:945-50). Expression of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycan structures in both breast and colon carcinoma appears to be a qualitative change exhibited at the transition to malignancy, which is likely caused by up-regulation of the glycosyltransferase known as GnT-V (GnT-Va, Mgat5a) that synthesizes the N-linked &#x3b2;(1,6) branch (Buckhaults et al., 1997<i>. J Biol Chem </i>272:19575-81). This glycosylation is often a step toward the formation of more complex poly N-acetyllactosamine glycan structures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which serve as ligands for the class of animal lectin known as galectins that are often elevated in metastatic carcinoma (Lagana et al., 2006<i>. Mol Cell Biol </i>26:3181-93). A recent study staining more than 700 primary breast tumors with L-PHA found that &#x3b2;(1,6) branched oligosaccharides were an independent prognostic indicator for poor outcome in primary node-negative tumors (Handerson et al., 2005<i>. Clin Cancer Res </i>11:2969-73).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Experimental modulation of GnT-V activity, both in vivo and in vitro, results in changes in carcinoma invasiveness and metastasis, supporting the conclusion that increases in the posttranslational modification of proteins by GnT-V is a mechanism by which tumor cell malignancy may increase (Guo et al., 2002<i>. Cancer Res </i>62:6837-45; Guo et al., 2003<i>. J Biol Chem </i>278:52412-24; Cheung et al., 2007<i>. Glycobiology </i>17:828-37; Guo et al., 2007<i>. J Biol Chem </i>282:22150-62).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In this example, we show the development of a simple glycoproteomic strategy to identify the glycoproteins from breast tissue that bind to a specific carbohydrate binding protein or lectin known as L-PHA (L-phytohemagglutinin). Glycosylation is a dynamic post-translational modification that changes during the development and progression of various malignancies. During the oncogenesis of breast carcinoma, the glycosyltransferase known as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Va (GnT-Va) transcript levels and activity are increased due to activated oncogenic signaling pathways. Elevated GnT-V levels leads to increased &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures on glycoproteins that can be measured using L-PHA. L-PHA does not bind to non-diseased breast epithelial cells, but during the progression to invasive carcinoma, cells show a progressive increase in L-PHA binding. Our experimental design utilizes intact proteins and allows for the identification of glycoproteins whose glycans are bound by the lectin L-PHA, as well as those proteins/glycoproteins that may associate with the bound glycoproteins (Abbott et al., April 2008 <i>J. Prot. Res. </i>7(4):1470-1480; Abbott et al., April 2008 <i>J. Prot. Res. </i>7(4):1470-1480 online Supporting Information is available on the World Wide Web at pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/pr700792a/suppl_file/pr700792g-file004.pdf).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Here we describe a procedure for intact protein L-PHA-affinity enrichment, followed by nanospray ionization mass spectrometry (NSIMS/MS), and subsequent proteomic data analysis to identify potential biomarkers for breast carcinoma. Our results demonstrate that this technique can be an effective method to identify proteins with tumor-specific glycosylation changes. We identified L-PHA reactive glycoproteins from matched normal (non-diseased) and malignant tissue isolated from patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Comparison analysis of the data identified 34 proteins that were enriched by L-PHA fractionation in tumor relative to normal for at least 2 cases of ductal invasive breast carcinoma (Table 4). Of these 34 L-PHA tumor enriched proteins, 12 (periostin, haptoglobin-related protein, apo-A1 precursor, osteoglycin, collagen VI &#x3b1;3, tubulin &#x3b1;6, collagen &#x3b1;1 VI chain precursor, collagen &#x3b1;1 VI isoform 2C2, variable Ig, triosphosphate iso, &#x3b1;-1 antitrypsin inhibitor and vimentin-like 50 kDa) are common to all 4 matched cases analyzed. These results indicate that lectin enrichment strategies targeting a particular glycan change associated with malignancy can be an effective method of identifying potential biomarkers for breast carcinomas with diverse clinical features.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Specimens.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Tissue specimens, matched normal and tumor, from patients with histologically proven invasive ductal breast carcinoma were collected in accordance with approved institutional review board Human subject's guidelines at Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Ga. Board certified clinical oncologists and pathologists carried out all clinical and histological analysis of the biopsies. All specimens for this study were immediately frozen at &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. until proteomic analysis. For the initial validation of our L-PHA affinity enrichment method we analyzed 4 patients with matched normal and malignant breast tissue (Table 3).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Sample Processing, L-PHA Enrichment, and MS.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Frozen tissue samples were processed as follows: 100 mg of tissue was de-lipidated using a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (4:8:3, v/v/v) as described previously (Seppo et al., 2000<i>. Eur J Biochem </i>267:3549-58; Aoki et al., 2007<i>. J Biol Chem </i>282:9127-42). Delipidated and precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet was given an additional wash with acetone and water (4:1) on ice for 15 minutes. Intact proteins were extracted from the delipidated tissues using a mild detergent solution as follows: 5 mg of delipidated protein powder was dissolved in 300 &#x3bc;l of 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% NP40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 1 protease inhibitor tablet, the sample was sonicated 3 times for 10 second pulses at setting 5 (Vertis Virsonic microtip). The supernatant was taken after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. The protein concentration of the sample was determined by BCA assay and 600 &#x3bc;g of total protein lysate was dialyzed overnight at 4&#xb0; C. into 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate using a 4,000 MWCO tube-O-dialyzer (GBiosciences). The sample was adjusted to 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM MgCl2 before the addition of the lectin. Biotinylated L-PHA (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif.) (10 &#x3bc;g) was added and the sample was rotated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. Bound L-PHA reactive proteins were captured using 100 &#x3bc;l paramagnetic streptavidin particles (Promega) at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. After extensive washing in 1&#xd7;PBS, captured proteins were eluted with 200 &#x3bc;l of 2M Urea/0.2 mM DTT/40 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 52&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. The eluted fraction was separated from the paramagnetic streptavidin particles using a magnetic stand. Eluted proteins were carboxyamidomethylated by adding an equal volume of iodoacetamide (10 mg/ml in 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate) in the dark for 45 minutes and digested with 5 &#x3bc;g of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. Tryptic peptides were acidified with 200 &#x3bc;l of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalting was performed using C18 spin columns (Vydac Silica C18, The Nest Group, Inc.). Eluted peptides were dried in the speed vac and resuspended in 78 &#x3bc;l buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and 2 &#x3bc;l of buffer B (80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) and filtered through a 0.2 &#x3bc;M filter (nanosep, PALL). Samples were loaded off-line onto a nanospray column/emitter (75 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;8.5 cm, New Objective) self-packed with C18 reverse-phase resin in a nitrogen pressure bomb for 10 minutes. Peptides were eluted via a 160-minute linear gradient of increasing B at a flow rate of approximately 250 nl/min. directly into a linear ion trap (LTQ, Thermo Co. San Jose, Calif. equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source). The top eight ions from the full MS (300-2000M/Z) were selected for CID fragmentation at 34% with a dynamic exclusion of 2.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Permethylation of Glycans.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">To facilitate the analysis of oligosaccharides by MS, N-linked glycans released by N-glycanase were permethylated as described previously (Aoki et al., 2007<i>. J Biol Chem </i>282:9127-42). Briefly, following extraction from tissue samples, delipidated proteins were digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin. The resulting digests were enriched for glycopeptides, which were then treated with PNGaseF (Prozyme) to release N-linked glycans. Contaiminants, buffer, salts, and residual peptides were removed from the released glycans by Sep-Pak C18 chromatography and the resulting glycan preparation was permethylated prior to analysis by nanospray ionization mass spectrometry using a linear ion trap (LTQ; Thermo Finnagan). The total ion mapping (TIM) functionality of the Xcalibur software package (version 2.0) was used to obtain total glycan profiles for each sample. Through TIM analyses, automated MS and MS/MS spectra are obtained in small mass increments across a broad range of m/z values. For the analysis of tissue samples, TIM analysis was performed from m/z=500&#x2212;2000. This mass range collects MS profiles and MS/MS fragmentation spectra for glycans detected from their 1+ to 4+ charge states. Following data collection, resulting TIM profiles are filtered for the presence of characteristic glycan fragments in the associated MS/MS spectra. By plotting the signal intensity of characteristic fragments as a function of elapsed scan time, a TIM chromatogram is generated that indicates the relative prevalence of specific glycan structures. For assessing the presence of &#x3b2;(1,6)-branched glycans extended with at least two N-acetyllactosamine repeats, TIM scans were filtered for the loss of a Hex-HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc fragment from the parent ion.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Proteomic Data Analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The raw peptide data was converted to mzXML using ReAdW. MS/MS spectra were searched against the International Protein Index (IPI) human sequence database (IPI.HUMAN.v.3.26; available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/Databases.html, 67,665 sequences) using MyriMatch (Hakomori, 1999<i>. Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1473:247-266). The MyriMatch search criteria included only tryptic peptides, all cysteines were presumed carboxyamidomethylated, and methionines were allowed to be oxidized. MyriMatch searches allowed a precursor error of up to 1.25 m/z and a fragment ion limit of within 0.5 m/z. All ambiguous identifications that matched to multiple peptide sequences were excluded. The identified proteins (2+ peptides required) from each individual tumor and normal sample were filtered and grouped using IDPicker software (Zhang et al., 2007<i>. J Proteome Res. </i>6:3549-57). IDPicker software incorporates searches against a reverse database, probability match obtained from MyriMatch, and DeltCN scores to achieve false discovery rates typically&#x3c;5%. Information about IDPicker tools can be found at http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/msrc/bioinformatics/. The raw data files were also analyzed using the TurboSequest algorithm (Peng et al., 2003<i>. J Proteome Res </i>2:43-50; Yates et al., 1995. Anal Chem 67:1426-36; Yates et al., 1996<i>. Analyst </i>121:65 R-76R) to achieve a false discovery rate of less than 0.3% for proteins assigned by 2+ peptides using an inverted database (BioWorks 3.1, Thermo Finnigan). Our results indicate that the final MyriMatch/IDPicker proteins list and TurboSequest proteins list showed near complete agreement. All proteins reported in this manuscript were identified using both methods. We found no evidence of amino acid carbamylation following urea elution and DTT reduction.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0155">One hundred micrograms of delipidated protein powder were solubilized in 1&#xd7;TBS/1% triton X-100/protease inhibitor tablet for precipitation using antiperiostin (Abcam) (1 &#x3bc;g). Bound proteins were captured using protein G plus agarose or streptavidin paramagnetic particles before gel electrophoresis and transfer to PVDF membrane prior to probing using biotinylated L-PHA (1:5,000). For L-PHA precipitations 500 &#x3bc;g of delipidated protein powder was solubilized in 1&#xd7;TBS/1% tritonX-100/protease inhibitors before adding 10 &#x3bc;g of biotinylated L-PHA and mixing overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Magnetic streptavidin beads (100 &#x3bc;l) were used to pull down the L-PHA bound complexes. After washing the beads, proteins were released by boiling in sample loading buffer and separated on 4-12% NuPage Bis-Tris gels and transferred to PVDF membrane before detection using either anti-periostin Ab (1:1,000) (Abcam) or anti-haptoglobin Ab (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">An initial set of 5 human ductal invasive breast carcinoma tissue samples were used to evaluate the use of the lectin L-PHA to bind and enrich for potential glycoprotein biomarkers to distinguish breast cancer from normal tissue. As shown in Table 3 these cases represent metastatic and non-metastatic disease, cases positive and negative for amplified her2/neu, and cases that were both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive and negative. Our approach is to analyze breast tissue, comparing normal and tumor tissue from the same patient, to identify potential glycoproteins that react with the lectin L-PHA. All cases showed increased levels of L-PHA binding indicative of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycans except case 10406, therefore, case 10406 was not analyzed by NSI-MS. We conclude that 4 out of 5 cases or 80% of the tumor tissue analyzed had proteins with increased levels of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures relative to normal breast tissue. To isolate these L-PHA reactive glycoproteins, we developed a method using intact proteins for the lectin binding, which differs from the more common method of using glycopeptides (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In addition, we found that delipidation of the breast tissue prior to analysis significantly improved MS/MS results (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) (Aoki et al., 2007<i>. J Biol Chem </i>282:9127-42).</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">To verify that L-PHA binding accurately reports intrinsic differences in glycan expression between tumor and adjacent normal tissue, total N-linked glycans were profiled for tissues taken from case 2417, which exhibited the greatest relative increase in tumor-associated L-PHA recognition (Table 3). The prevalence of glycans carrying a &#x3b2;(1,6) branch extended with N-acetyllactosamine was compared in tumor and adjacent normal preparations by quantifying the signal intensity of a specific fragment ion detected in TIM analysis. By filtering TIM profiles for the presence of a permethylated Hex-HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc fragment, the relative abundances of several &#x3b2;(1,6) branched parent ions were measured and compared. The most prevalent of the detected glycans extended with N-acetylactosamine was increased more than 2.5-fold in tumor tissue relative to adjacent normal tissue, compared using equivalent protein amounts as starting material (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The trimmed, high mannose glycan Man5GlcNAc2, that serves as an early precursor for complex terminal modifications including &#x3b2;(1,6) branching, was found in equal prevalence between the two tissues (data not shown). Therefore for case 2417, the increased abundance of L-PHA reactive proteins identified by MS/MS from tumor tissue compared with normal tissue correlates with increases in &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-glycan structures, confirming the specificity of the lectin enrichment analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Proteins Showing Tumor-Specific Increased Reactivity with L-PHA.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">We detected a total of 258 L-PHA reactive proteins (2 or more peptides) from the 4 tumors showing elevated L-PHA reactivity that were analyzed by MS/MS. For each of the 258 unique proteins identified, we examined the number of peptides identified for that protein from NSI-MS/MS analysis of normal tissue and tumor tissue before and after L-PHA fractionation. Differences in protein abundance between normal and tumor were normalized by determining the ratio of peptides identified in patient matched normal and tumor tissue prior to L-PHA fractionation. Proteins were eliminated in each case if they did not show a minimum of 1.5 fold increase in peptides identified from tumor relative to normal after L-PHA fractionation. From the list of proteins showing at least a 1.5 fold increase in tumor relative to normal, proteins were considered &#x201c;enriched&#x201d; following LPHA fractionation if they were identified from at least 2 cases. A total of 34 proteins had increased peptides and spectra present in L-PHA fractionations isolated from tumor compared with normal tissue for at least 2 separate cases of ductal invasive breast carcinoma (Table 4, number of spectra in parenthesis). The peptide sequences for these proteins are provided in Table 5. As expected, the majority of these proteins are predicted to be glycoproteins by searching databases such as GenBank and IPI. Since we do not compete L-PHA bound proteins from the magnetic beads using a competitive sugar hapten, we have identified some proteins that are predicted to be non-glycosylated and are likely binding to L-PHA reactive glycosylated proteins. We utilized DAVID 2007 (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) to annotate the function of the proteins listed in Table 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). The top 2 functional classifications of glycoproteins showing differential binding to L-PHA in ductal invasive breast carcinoma relative to normal breast tissue are (i) binding proteins related to cell adhesion and cell-communication, and (ii) proteins that respond to external stimulus. These results indicate that largest group of proteins showing increases in &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycosylation function in mediating communication of the tumor cell with the extracellular matrix (COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, COL14A1) and neighboring cells (HPX, BGN, DCN, VIM, POSTN, VTN, THBS1, OGN). The second highest group of proteins with elevated L-PHA reactive glycoproteins participates in the response of the tumor cells to environmental stress. This group includes the members of the lectin-induced complement pathway (C3 and C4B), activators of complement (HPR), immunoglobulin/MHC complex (IGHA1, IGLV4-3, IGHM), enzyme inhibitors (SERPINA1, 14-3-3 zeta/delta, COL6A3, THBS1), enzyme activators of MMP (HPX), and enzymes that detoxify (PRDX1). This information contributes to our knowledge of the functions of glycoproteins acquiring &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures in breast carcinoma and offers insights into how the acquisition of these structures may be associated with breast cancer progression. Several of the proteins enriched by L-PHA are predicted to participate in the development of the skeletal system and organ development (POSTN, ANXA2, DCN, COL6A3, PRDX1, and OGN). There are also several enzymes that participate in the glycolytic pathway that are enriched by L-PHA (PGK1, TPI1, ENO1, LDHA, and PKM2). Overall, these results suggest that proteins that are participating in cell communication, organ development, and metabolism derive &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures in breast tumors. The abnormal elevated expression of these glycan structures on these proteins in breast epithelial cells may play roles in tumor progression and invasion (Guo et al., 2007<i>. J Biol Chem </i>282:22150-62).</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Interestingly, many of the proteins identified in Table 4 are connected with TGF&#x3b2; signaling pathways. A recent manuscript identifies increased TGF&#x3b2; protein levels in breast tumor tissue as a factor that correlates with shorter disease-free survival (Desruisseau et al., 2006<i>. Br J Cancer </i>94:239-46). Many of the proteins we identified after L-PHA enrichment in tumor tissue are either induced by TGF&#x3b2; (POSTN, COL6A3, SERPINA1) or are known to bind TGF&#x3b2; with nanomolar affinities (BGN, DCN). It will be interesting to determine how &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycosylation influences the binding of TGF&#x3b2; to these proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">L-PHA Capture Facilitates the Identification of Biomarkers Likely to be Found in Serum.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">We have examined the predicted cellular distribution of proteins enriched by L-PHA listed in Table 4. The distribution is primarily extracellular (56%) and cytoplasmic (29%) with the remainder of proteins localized on the plasma membrane (9%) or unknown (6%) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). L-PHA-affinity enrichment significantly concentrates proteins identified from the extracellular region. For comparison, only 14-15% of the total proteins isolated from normal and tumor before L-PHA enrichment are extracellular (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">L-PHA Enrichment can Identify Novel Markers for Breast Carcinoma.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Approximately 73% of the 34 tumor L-PHA enriched proteins have been previously reported in breast cancer studies (n=25); while 29% (n=9) have not been previously cited for breast cancer (Table 4). One of the novel, tumor-specific L-PHA reactive glycoproteins that we identified, known as osteoglycin (OGN), was present at similar levels of peptide abundance in normal and tumor breast tissue before L-PHA fractionation. However, OGN is consistently identified from tumor tissue after L-PHA fractionation. Osteoglycin has not been identified as a potential marker for breast cancer previously, likely due to the consistent levels of protein present in normal and tumor. Another interesting protein not previously associated with breast cancer is the 14-3-3 zeta protein. This protein is not predicted to be glycosylated and is probably enriched by L-PHA due to association with a protein that binds L-PHA. 14-3-3 zeta functions as an adapter protein that binds with other proteins controlling cell growth and proliferation. The cellular localization of 14-3-3 zeta protein has been reported to be largely cytoplasmic, but it has been reported to be present on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi (Fu et al., 2000<i>. Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol </i>40:617-47). We find in 3 out of the 4 cases significant tumor-specific association with L-PHA for 14-3-3 zeta. Similar levels of 14-3-3 zeta present in normal and tumor tissue probably prevented previous identification of this protein as a marker for breast cancer. We conclude that selective enrichment using the lectin L-PHA has enabled the identification of novel markers for breast carcinoma and adds an additional level of biomarker selection.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">L-PHA Enrichment Increases the Identification of Markers Common to Breast Carcinoma Cases with Diverse Clinical Features.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The quest to identify markers for the early detection of many tumors has been hampered by tumor heterogeneity. Our approach, focusing on a specific post-translational modification that increases in parallel with malignant progression, has enabled the identification of 12 markers common to all 4 cases of breast carcinoma analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). A key element of our success is the targeting of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures that are normally expressed at a low level in non-diseased breast epithelial cells. This targeted approach has enabled the identification of proteins that change glycosylation only in breast carcinoma tumor tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Validation of Glycoproteins with Differential L-PHA Reactivity in Normal and Tumor Tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">We have selected 2 markers for further validation from Table 4. These glycoproteins were selected due to enrichment in tumor tissue for all cases analyzed in Table 4.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Periostin.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Periostin (POSTN) has been identified as a possible factor promoting breast cancer progression through induction of angiogenesis (Shao et al., 2004<i>. Mol Cell Biol </i>24:3992-4003). Previous studies analyzing mRNA levels by pooled RNA sampling and immunohistochemistry arrays indicated that POSTN mRNA and protein levels were increased in malignant breast epithelial cells (Shao et al., 2004<i>. Mol Cell Biol </i>24:3992-4003; Grigoriadis et al., 2006<i>. Breast Cancer Res </i>8:R56). We found in the total MS/MS analysis of matched normal and malignant breast tissue before L-PHA fractionation that there were roughly twice as many POSTN peptides identified from tumor tissue compared with normal tissue for cases 10119 and 2207. For case 11827, we did not detect POSTN before L-PHA fractionation and for 2417 we found equivalent levels of POSTN peptides identified in normal and tumor tissue before L-PHA enrichment using NSI-MS/MS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). These results are not quantitative and are only a qualitative assessment of abundance. However, they suggest that examining alterations in the abundance of POSTN protein alone would not be a selective marker for breast carcinoma. However, we identified POSTN peptides after L-PHA enrichment and MS/MS analysis in all 4 of the tumor tissues analyzed with only 1 peptide identified in normal tissue for case 2417 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). The high degree of tumor-specific association of POSTN with LPHA suggests that the presence of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycosylation on POSTN is a marker of breast cancer. To confirm these results, we have immunoprecipitated POSTN from normal and tumor breast tissue using an anti-periostin antibody and probed the blot using biotinylated LPHA. Tissue amounts were limiting for case 10119 preventing further analysis of this case. For each case analyzed, POSTN reactivity with L-PHA is higher compared with the matched normal tissue control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, panel 1). To normalize for total periostin protein, we probed the membrane using the anti-periostin antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> panel 2). To confirm these results, we precipitated using biotinylated L-PHA followed by detection using the anti-periostin antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> panel 3). To quantitate the relative increase in L-PHA reactive periostin, films for total periostin and LPHA reactive periostin were scanned and analyzed by densitometry (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>). Overall, our results indicate that POSTN acquires increased levels of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked structures in the breast tumor tissue relative to normal breast tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Haptoglobin-Related Protein Precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Haptoglobin-related precursor protein (HPR) has 90% sequence identity to the conventional form of haptoglobin (HP) found in serum. The adult liver expresses low levels of HPR mRNA (Bensi et al., 1985<i>. EMBO J</i>4:119-26) and very little HPR protein has been detected in serum (Fawcett et al., 1990<i>. Biochim Biophys Acta </i>1048:187-93), suggesting that the HPR we detected in breast carcinoma tissue is likely expressed by breast cancer epithelial cells. HPR shares antigenic epitopes with the pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A that is secreted from uterine epithelial cells or placenta during pregnancy and has been reported as an independent prognostic factor useful for detecting the recurrence of breast cancer (Kuhajda et al., 1989<i>. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>86:1188-92; Kuhajda et al., 1989<i>. N Engl J Med </i>321:636-41). To validate the identification of L-PHA reactive HPR as a breast tumor-specific marker we performed L-PHA precipitation followed by Western blotting. Due to the fact that we did not detect HPR prior to L-PHA affinity enrichment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>) we have chosen to validate using L-PHA precipitation followed by detection using an anti-haptoglobin antibody that recognizes HP as well as HPR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>). Our results revealed an increased association of the beta chain of haptoglobin with L-PHA for the tumor tissue compared with normal breast tissue in cases 2417 and 2207. For case 11827, we observed a similar intensity in beta haptoglobin between normal and tumor on the Western blot. In all 3 cases, the tumor haptoglobin displayed a shift to a larger molecular weight compared with normal breast tissue from the same patient. Therefore, we conclude that in agreement with our MS/MS data, tumor haptoglobin has elevated &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures compared with normal.</p>

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Elevation of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycans in breast cancer has been previously cited as a poor prognostic indicator (Handerson et al., 2005<i>. Clin Cancer Res </i>11:2969-73). In this study we have used L-PHA, a lectin that specifically recognizes these glycan structures, to pull out potential biomarkers for breast carcinoma. Using this type of targeted glycoproteomic approach enabled us to identify markers common to breast cancer tissues with different stages, hormone receptor status, lymph node status, and her2/neu status. Our ability to analyze the relative abundance of biomarkers in normal and tumor tissue from the same patient, before and after L-PHA fractionation, eliminates possible bias that may be introduced from differences in individual gene expression profiles. Our targeted glycoproteomic approach has enabled the identification of several potential markers for breast carcinoma. Therefore, future studies focused on defining the normal and tumor glycome of various tissues can be useful for the development of new lectin targeting strategies to identify glycoproteins with tumor-specific glycan alterations.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">TGF&#x3b2; Connection.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">We have identified several proteins either induced by TGF&#x3b2;, or known to associate with TGF&#x3b2;, suggesting a link between &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycosylation in breast tumors and the TGF&#x3b2; pathway. Changes in downstream signaling controlled by TGF&#x3b2; have been documented for breast cancer (Gomis et al., 2006<i>. Cancer Cell </i>10:203-14). However, unlike other types of malignancy that have evaded the normal growth-inhibitory functions of TGF&#x3b2; through inactivating mutations in TGF&#x3b2; receptors, the mechanisms of breast cancer resistance to TGF&#x3b2;-mediated growth inhibition remain poorly understood (Massague and Gomis, 2006<i>. FEBS Lett </i>580:2811-20). We have found increased &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycosylation on several extracellular proteins known to interact with TGF&#x3b2;. Differential glycosylation of these ligands may initiate alterations in TGF&#x3b2; signaling. The extracellular proteoglycans decorin and biglycan have been shown to bind TGF&#x3b2; reducing its bio-availability for TGF&#x3b2;RI and TGF&#x3b2;RII during skeletal muscle differentiation (Droguett et al., 2006. Matrix Biol 25:332-41). Therefore, it may be possible that the aberrant glycosylation of small leucine-rich proteoglycans such decorin (DCN) and biglycan (BGN) increases the amount of TGF&#x3b2; sequestered in the extracellular matrix complexes making less TGF&#x3b2; available for canonical TGF&#x3b2; receptor activation. Increased expression of TGF&#x3b2; in fibroblasts has been shown to induce the expression of several glycoproteins implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer such as collagen VI &#x3b1;3, tenascin, and PAI-1 (Berking et al., 2001<i>. Cancer Res </i>61:8306-16). In this study, we have identified collagen VI &#x3b1;3 (COL6A3) as one of the proteins enriched by L-PHA in tumor tissue. Collagen VI upregulation and secretion is associated with increased cell survival via resistance to apoptosis through down-regulation of Bax and prevention of &#x3b2;1 integrin-mediated apoptosis (Ruhl et al., 1999<i>. J Biol Chem </i>274:34361-8). Logically, increased levels of TGF&#x3b2; in the tumor should initiate the cytostatic effect often associated with TGF&#x3b2; signaling. However, elevated TGF&#x3b2; levels in the tumor can have an opposite effect by inducing collagen VI expression that can oppose cytostatic effects by blocking apoptosis (Ruhl et al., 1999<i>. J Biol Chem </i>274:34361-8). Interestingly, collagen VI has been shown to associate in a ternary complex with DCN, and BGN by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Reinboth et al., 2006<i>. J Biol Chem </i>281:7816-24). COL6A3, DCN, and BGN were enriched by L-PHA in at least 2 cases (Table 4) suggesting a possible link between the formation of this complex and the presence of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycans. Experiments investigating the impact of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycosylation on the formation of this complex and the resulting effect on cell survival in breast epithelial cells will be necessary to evaluate this hypothesis as a possible mechanism for breast tumor cells evasion of TGF&#x3b2;-induced cytostatic response.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">An Enrichment of L-PHA Reactive Glycoproteins that have Functions in the Skeletal System.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Many of the proteins that were enriched by L-PHA in tumor tissue have proposed functions in the skeletal system and a gene encoding one of these proteins, periostin (POSTN), has been identified as a gene expressed in the myoepithelial cells of breast tumors (Grigoriadis et al., 2006<i>. Breast Cancer Res </i>8:R56). This gene has also been reported to be expressed in normal bone chondrocytes and pre-osteoblasts; both are mesenchymal cell types (Blumer et al., 2006<i>. J Anat </i>208:695-707). We find in our analysis of breast tissue after L-PHA fractionation that we detect POSTN almost exclusively in the tumor. This is the first identification of a difference in the glycosylation of POSTN for breast cancer tissue relative to normal breast tissue. Prior to L-PHA fractionation we detect POSTN in both normal and tumor tissue, likely due to stromal expression. We do not separate epithelial and stromal cells before L-PHA fractionation, therefore, our data strongly support the notion that POSTN with complex &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycan structures is expressed mainly in the breast tumor epithelial cells since there is very little L-PHA reactive POSTN isolated from normal breast tissue. The activation of POSTN expression in osteoblasts has been linked to twist, a bHLH transcription factor that controls the expression of embryonic mesenchymal genes during development (Oshima et al., 2002<i>. J Cell Biochem </i>86:792-804). Twist expression has been reported to be increased in lobular infiltrating breast cancer (Yang et al., 2004<i>. Cell </i>117:927-39; Kang and Massague, 2004<i>. Cell </i>118:277-9). Therefore, these observations may explain how POSTN is expressed in breast epithelial cells. Also, TGF&#x3b2; has been shown to increase the expression of POSTN in cardiac development providing another possible explanation for how POSTN may be expressed in breast cancer epithelial cells (Norris et al., 2004<i>. Anat Rec A Discov Mol Cell Evol Biol </i>281:1227-33).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">GnT-V, the gene that adds the &#x3b2;(1,6) GlcNAc branch leading to the formation of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycans has recently been implicated in the maintenance of bone density as GnT-V (&#x2212;/&#x2212;) mice show a loss of bone mineral density (Cheung et al., 2007<i>. Glycobiology </i>17:828-37). It is possible that POSTN may be a preferred substrate for GnT-V in osteoblasts and chondrocytes during development. Therefore, the abnormal expression of both GnT-V and POSTN in breast carcinoma epithelial cells would lead to significant changes in breast epithelial cell adhesion and migration, promoting tumor progression.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Another protein, osteoglycin (OGN), which was enriched by L-PHA in breast tumor tissue relative to normal tissue was originally identified in bone as an osteoinductive factor (Bentz et al., 1989<i>. J Biol Chem </i>264:20805-10). OGN along with DCN and BGN are members of a group of small lecuine-rich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs) that are important during skeletal development. BGN and DCN are also involved in the development and maintenance of bone. More pronounced loss of bone mass is present in the double knockout of BGN and DCN than for each individual gene knockout suggesting that both of these SLRPs play a role in the maintenance of bone (Corsi et al., 2002<i>. J Bone Miner Res </i>17:1180-9). Interestingly, DCN is also found to be expressed in the myoepithelial cells of the breast (Grigoriadis et al., 2006<i>. Breast Cancer Res </i>8:R56). Exactly how the presence of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycosylation on these proteins within the breast tissue may influence malignancy is unknown. One can postulate that increased &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycans may influence the formation of collagen fibrils making it easier for tumor cells to migrate and invade through the basement membrane. Many proteins that we have identified as highly L-PHA reactive in tumor tissue relative to normal tissue have reported functions in skeletal development. This suggests that L-PHA reactive N-linked structures may be promoting mesenchymal functions within breast epithelial cells. Future experiments will test if GnT-V expression levels can affect the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest female reproductive tract malignancy in Western countries. Less than 25% of cases are diagnosed when the cancer is confined, pointing to the critical need for early diagnostics for ovarian cancer. Identifying the changes that occur in the glycome of ovarian cancer cells may provide an avenue to develop a new generation of potential biomarkers for early detection of this disease. Epithelial ovarian cancers are comprised of five major subtypes (serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, and transitional adenocarcinomas), with serous and endometrioid being the two most common types. Epithelial ovarian cancer arises in humans from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), epithelial inclusion cysts, or the tubal fimbria (Lee et al., 2007<i>. J. Pathol. </i>211:26-35; Auersperg et al., 2001<i>. Endocr. Rev. </i>22:255-288). Several oncogenes have been implicated in ovarian cancer development including: c-myc, k-ras, erbB2, egfr, p53, b-catenin, brca1/2, pten, and others (Orsulic et al., 2002<i>. Cancer Cell </i>1:53-62; Aunoble et al., 2000<i>. Int. J. Oncol. </i>16:567-576; Dinulescu et al., 2005<i>. Nat. Med. </i>11:63-70). Utilizing this knowledge, a mouse model of human epithelial endometrioid ovarian carcinoma was developed by adenoviral infection of the Cre recombinase in the OSE of conditional mice engineered to activate oncogenic k-ras and inactivate pten (Dinulescu et al., 2005. Nat. Med. 11:63-70). The combination of these mutations leads to the induction of malignant epithelial endometrioid ovarian carcinoma lesions that recapitulate the morphology and histology of the human disease (Dinulescu et al., 2005<i>. Nat. Med. </i>11:63-70). Several clinical studies have recently validated these genetic results by identifying the first cases of human ovarian carcinomas with synchronous k-ras and pten mutations (Irving et al., 2005<i>. Hum. Pathol. </i>36:605-619; Kolasa et al., 2006<i>. Gynecol. Oncol. </i>103:692-697).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">We performed a glycotranscriptomic analysis of endometrioid ovarian carcinoma using human tissue, as well as a newly developed mouse model that mimics this disease. Our results show that the N-linked glycans expressed in both nondiseased mouse and human ovarian tissues are similar; moreover, malignant changes in the expression of N-linked glycans in both mouse and human endometrioid ovarian carcinoma are qualitatively similar. We have used a quantitative real-time PCR approach (qRT-PCR) to quantitatively measure changes in the expression levels of enzymes in the N-linked biosynthetic pathway for mouse and human epithelial ovarian endometrioid carcinomas. Comparative lectin blot analysis was used to confirm changes in glycan structures predicted by qRT-PCR results. Lectin reactivity was used as a means for rapid validation of glycan structural changes in the carcinomas that were predicted by the glycotranscriptome analysis. Among several changes in glycan expression noted, the increase of bisected N-linked glycans and the transcripts of the enzyme responsible for its biosynthesis, GnT-III, was the most significant. This study provides evidence that glycotranscriptome analysis can be an important tool in identifying potential cancer biomarkers (Abbott et al., August 2008 <i>Proteomics </i>8(16):3210-3220; Abbott et al., August 2008 <i>Proteomics </i>8(16):3210-3220 online Supporting Information available at http://www.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc<sub>&#x2014;</sub>2120/2008/pro200800157_s.pdf.</p>

Human endometrioid ovarian cancers (N=3) (0.90% tumor) were obtained from women as frozen tissue from the Ovarian Cancer Institute (Atlanta, Ga.).

Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. After DNase treatment, RNA (2 mg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) with random hexamers and Oligo (dT). Primer pairs for assay genes and control genes were designed within a single exon using conditions described in Nairn et al. (2008<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>283:17298-17313) and listed in Table 6. Primers were validated with respect to primer efficiency and single product detection. The control gene, Ribosomal Protein L4 (RPL4, NM<sub>&#x2014;</sub>024212) was included on each plate to control for run variation and to normalize individual gene expression. Samples were run with negative control templates prepared without reverse transcription to ensure amplification is specific to cDNA. Triplicate Ct values for each gene were averaged and the SD from the mean was calculated. Data were converted to linear values and normalized as described previously (Nairn et al., 2007<i>. J.

The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10 000&#xd7; g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Biotinylated lectin (Con A, Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif.) (2 mg) was added to 50 mg cleared lysate at 47&#xb0; C. for 2 h. Paramagnetic streptavidin beads (50 mL) were added to separate Con A bound and unbound proteins. Unbound fractions, 10 mg, were separated on 4-12% NuPage Bis Tris gels and transferred to PVDFinembrane at 25 V for 1.5 h.

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Expression Data from the N-Linked Biosynthetic Pathway for Normal Ovary.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Enzymes from the N-linked glycosylation pathway (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) were chosen for analysis based on low levels of redundancy and the previous correlations of transcript levels with glycan structural analysis in mouse tissues (Nairn et al., 2008<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>283:17298-17313). Before analyzing tumor tissues, we examined the relative transcript abundance of these enzymes using pooled RNA isolated from normal mouse and human ovarian tissue. The development of epithelial endometrioid ovarian tumors in the model developed by Dinulescu et al. (2005<i>. Nat. Med. </i>11:63-70) utilizes adenoviral infection of the Cre recombinase into the outer epithelial layer of the ovary to initiate tumor formation. This technique allows the noninfected ovary within the same animal to serve as a normal control. From the group of genes analyzed, there are both similarities and differences in transcript expression profiles between mouse and human normal ovary. Transcripts present in higher abundance for both species are: FUT8, MGAT1 (human) or MGAT2 (mouse), and MOATS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B</figref> and C). These enzymes are involved in the branching (MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT5) or core fucosylation (FUT8) of N-linked glycans (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). Due to the higher levels of these transcripts, core fucosylated hybrid type or core fucosylated complex branched N-linked glycans are likely to be abundant in both mouse and human ovary. The MGAT3 transcripts are present at low levels in both mouse and human ovaries (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B</figref> and C). The lower levels of MGAT3 transcripts suggest that bisecting N-linked glycans may be present at lower levels in normal mouse and human ovary tissue. Interestingly, the levels of MGAT4b transcripts are very high in mouse compared with human. However, for both mouse and human the MGAT4a levels are lower. These genes are both capable of adding N-acetylglucosamine in &#x3b2;(1,4) linkage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). Considering the levels of both MGAT4a and MGAT4b, along with abundant MGAT5 levels, tri- and tetra-antennary complex N-linked glycans should be present in normal ovary. Enzymes showing differences in transcript abundance in mouse and human are the mannosidases, MAN2A1 (Man II) is more abundant in human ovary, while MAN2A1 (Man II) and MAN2A2 (Man IIx) are equally abundant in mouse ovary. Overall, for this subset of genes participating in the N-linked pathway, transcript levels in both mouse and human normal ovary show a high degree of species conservation.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Comparative Analysis of Normal and Epithelial Endometrioid Ovarian Carcinoma.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">To investigate possible differences in the expression of GT and GH in malignant epithelial ovarian tissue, RNA from mouse endometrioid and human endometrioid carcinoma was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Total RNA from age-matched human normal ovary was purchased from a commercial source. Human normal ovarian tissue samples were averaged for comparison with the qRT-PCR results from individual human tumor tissues. The mouse normal samples qRT-PCR results were also averaged to enable comparison with qRT-PCR results from individual mouse tumor tissues. The levels of MGAT1 and MGAT2 transcripts were increased above normal for both mouse and human tumors suggesting increased complex N-linked glycans (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref> and B). The transcripts encoding FUT8, the enzyme responsible for &#x3b1;(1,6) fucosylation of the core N-linked glycan, increased on average 1.5-2-fold relative to normal for mouse tumor tissues (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). However, in human endometrioid ovarian tumors, an increase in FUT8 transcripts occurred in only one of three cases analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). These results indicate that the factors regulating transcript levels of FUT8 may be more complex in human ovarian cancer. The transcript levels for MGAT3 in both mouse and human tumor samples were increased significantly (average of 18-fold for human and 16-fold for mouse) relative to normal ovarian tissue. The lower transcript abundance of MGAT3 observed for mouse and human normal ovary (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B</figref> and C) contrast with the large increase in MGAT3 transcripts observed for all cases of epithelial endometrioid carcinoma analyzed in both mouse and human (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref> and B). The commonality of this change for mouse and human tumor samples along with the magnitude of the change predict the possibility of isolating glycoproteins with complex bisecting N-linked glycans as markers for endometrioid ovarian cancer. Transcripts encoding enzymes that perform outer branching of complex N-linked glycans such as MGAT4a, MGAT4b, and MGAT5 are increased in mouse and human ovarian cancer relative to normal. MGAT4a transcripts are increased at a higher level relative to normal for mouse compared with human (2-6-fold and 1.5-4-fold, respectively). However, levels of MGAT4b were also elevated in human tumor tissue, while mouse MGAT4b transcript levels in mouse tumor were not significantly increased. The different regulation of MGAT4b transcripts in mouse and human ovarian tumor tissue may highlight a possible species-specific difference in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. However, the cumulative effect of increases in MGAT4a, MGAT4b, and MGAT5 predict more branched complex N-linked glycan structures present in endometrioid ovarian cancer relative to normal.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Comparative Lectin Analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">To investigate whether the tumor-specific changes in GT transcript levels correlate with glycan structures found on glycoproteins, we used lectin separation and blotting techniques. The carbohydrate binding preferences for lectins are diverse, allowing the selection of lectins to detect a wide range of oligosaccharide structures. Lectins (E-PHA, LPHA, DSL, and AAL) recognizing the oligosaccharide products of FUT8, MGAT3, MGAT4a, MGAT4b, MGAT5, and MGAT5b are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. These are only examples of oligosaccharide structures that these lectins can bind to and are not intended to be a complete list of all structures capable of binding the lectins. Sugar residues previously described as a determinant for binding of each lectin are circled (Nagata et al., 1991<i>. Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1076:187-190; Wimmerova et al., 2003<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>278:27059-27067; Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>257:11235-11240; Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>257:11230-11234; Yamashita et al., 1987<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>262:1602-1607). Con A is a lectin that recognizes branched mannose residues with high affinity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), and this lectin was used to separate the high-mannose, hybrid, and complex biantennary oligosaccharides from the complex tri- and tetra-antennary N-linked glycans prior to lectin blot detection (Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>257:11235-11240). Total cell lysates from the three mouse tumors were pooled for lectin analysis due to the high degree of correspondent changes observed in the qRT-PCR experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Increased Core Fucosylation in Ovarian Tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">All three mouse endometrioid ovarian tumors analyzed showed elevated levels of FUT8 transcripts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The lectin AAL has a high affinity for the core &#x3b1;(1,6) fucose linked product that would result from FUT8 activity (Nagata et al., 1991. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1076:187-190). Core fucosylation can be found on hybrid type N-linked glycans as well as complex bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary oligosaccharides. However, no differences in AAL binding to Con A bound fractions were observed between normal and tumors, suggesting that the levels of core fucosylation do not change significantly on hybrid type and complex biantennary N-linked glycans for ovarian tumors (data not shown). AAL binding to the unbound Con A fraction increases significantly to glycoproteins isolated from ovarian tumors compared to normal ovarian tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that the core fucosylation of complex tri- and tetra-branched oligosaccharides increased for tumors relative to normal. To analyze human ovarian cancer tissues, individual samples were analyzed due to the differences in qRT-PCR results for these cases for FUT8. AAL binding to glycoproteins isolated from human endometrioid ovarian tumors was similar to the levels predicted by qRT-PCR results for case 471. Case 471 had a 0.4-fold increase in FUT8 mRNA compared with normal and shows seven-fold increase in the level of AAL binding relative to normal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 11B</figref>, lane 4). Case 711 had similar levels of FUT8 transcripts and shows levels of AAL reactivity similar to the normal control sample (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 11B</figref>, lane 2). Case 741 had lower levels of FUT8 expression compared with normal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>), yet AAL binding was significantly increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, lane 3). To better evaluate the fucosylation of this case we used qRT-PCR to analyze all known fucosyltransferases and fucosidases. Our results indicate a two-fold reduction in the levels of a-L-fucosidase (FUCA2) expression (data not shown). We did not observe this decrease in FUTA2 for cases 711 and 471, suggesting that this may be contributing to the increased levels of core a-1,6-fucosylation for case 741. Our data suggest that in the majority of cases for both mouse and human, core fucosylation levels are elevated. Therefore, glycoproteomic studies targeting the core fucose could potentially lead to the isolation of tumor-specific markers for ovarian cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Ovarian Tumors have Increased Levels of Bisecting Complex N-Linked Glycans.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">N-glycans containing a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine are produced by the activity of MGAT3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). This enzyme showed the largest increases in expression in ovarian tumor tissues compared with normal ovary tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref> and B). Lectin analysis of mouse tissues using the lectin E-PHA, whose binding is dependent on the presence of bisecting GlcNAc (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), shows 0.2&#xd7; the levels of E-PHA binding for tumor relative to normal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, lanes 3 and 4). Human ovarian tumor glycoproteins analyzed for E-PHA binding showed positive correlation with qRT-PCR results for each case. For example, case 471 and 741 had the highest and second highest increases in MGAT3 transcript levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) and these cases also have the highest levels of EPHA binding (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, lanes 7 and 8). Case 711 had a lower increase in MGAT3 transcripts measured by qRT-PCR and shows a lower level of E-PHA binding than cases 471 and 741. In every endometrioid ovarian tumor analyzed, mouse and human, there were elevated bisecting complex N-linked glycans compared with normal controls. Although the datasets are small, these results strongly suggest that the presence of bisecting complex N-glycans is a marker for ovarian tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Tri- or Tetra-Antennary Complex N-Linked Glycans are Increased in Ovarian Tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The lectins known as DSL and L-PHA recognize the outer branches of complex N-linked glycans (MGAT4a, MGAT4b, MGAT5, and MGAT5b) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). L-PHA is specific for the &#x3b2;(1,6) branched, galactosylated product of MGAT5; while DSL can recognize the &#x3b2;(1,4) branch added by MGAT4a and MGAT4b as well as the MGAT5 branch (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). MGAT4a and MGAT4b transcript levels were elevated for human endometrioid ovarian tumors and MGAT4a transcripts were amplified for mouse tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref> and B). These genes can perform the same glycosyltransferase reactions and their elevations predict the existence of more &#x3b2;(1,4) branched glycans and increased DSL binding. Indeed, analysis of unbound Con A fractions indicate elevated levels of DSL binding to mouse tumor glycoproteins compared with glycoproteins from normal mouse ovary (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, lanes 5 and 6). The levels of DSL binding to tumor glycoproteins isolated from human ovarian tumors were lower compared with AAL or E-PHA binding (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, lanes 9-12) and this correlates with a lower change in transcript levels for MGAT4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). Interestingly, L-PHA binding levels for mouse ovarian tumor tissues were not increased above normal, despite increases in MGAT5 transcripts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 11A</figref>, lanes 7 and 8). Human tumor samples had higher levels of MGAT5 transcripts compared with normal and do show a slight increase in LPHA binding compared with normal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 11B</figref>, lanes 13-16). Mouse ovarian tumors had a two-fold increase in MGAT5 and human ovarian tumors had a three- to five-fold increase in MGAT5 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref> and B and Table 7). Based on these findings elevated L-PHA binding would be expected. However, we find no increase in L-PHA binding for mouse ovarian tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) and a lower than expected increase in L-PHA reactivity to glycoproteins from human ovarian tumors. These results may indicate that the MGAT3 elevated activity may inhibit MGAT5 activity and this will be discussed further in the discussion. Overall, the DSL lectin is useful for capturing glycoproteins with the MGAT4 or MGAT5 branch, and based on our analysis, would be an effective lectin for isolating glycoprotein markers with elevated (3 (1,4) or (3 (1,6) complex branched glycans for endometrioid ovarian tumors.</p>

Discussion
</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In this report we have used a glycotranscriptome approach to characterize the N-linked glycan profiles of normal ovary and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma. Our results provide several significant findings: (i) mouse and human normal ovarian tissues have a similar expression profile for certain enzymes participating in the formation of N-linked glycans suggesting some degree of species conservation, (ii) enzymes changing in expression for tumors isolated from the mouse model of human endometrioid ovarian cancer correspond qualitatively with changes observed for human tumors of the same malignancy, (iii) E-PHA, AAL, and DSL reactivity levels were elevated in endometrioid ovarian tumors relative to normal indicating that these lectins could be useful together for biomarker discovery or to improve the specificity of existing ovarian tumor markers.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Glycosylation Changes Observed for Reproductive Malignancies.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Analysis of glycoprotein glycosylation patterns is emerging as a powerful tool to discriminate normal glycoproteins from glycoproteins marking diseases such as cancer. Over 20 years ago, researchers began to observe glycosylation changes occurring on cell surface glycoproteins following oncogenic transformation (Pierce and Arango, 1986<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>261:10772-10777; Meezan et al., 1969<i>. Biochemistry </i>8:2518-2524; Kobata and Amano, 2005<i>. Immunol. Cell Biol. </i>83:429-439; Hakomori, 1999<i>. Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1473:247-266). For breast cancer, increased &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycans emerged qualitatively from the transition to malignancy due to elevated expression of the MOATS gene (Buckhaults et al., 1997<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>272:19575-19581; Fernandes et al., 1991<i>. Cancer Res. </i>51:718-723). Few studies have evaluated glycosylation changes for ovarian cancer (An et al., 2006<i>. J. Proteome Res. </i>5:1626-1635; Saldova et al., 2007<i>. Glycobiology </i>17:1344-1356; Kui Wong et al., 2003<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>278:28619-28634; Wang et al., 2005<i>. Gynecol. Oncol. </i>99:631-6390). However, from the small group of studies conducted, Rudd and coworkers (Saldova et al., 2007<i>. Glycobiology </i>17:1344-1356) found increased levels of bisecting core fucosylated complex N-linked glycans in the serum of ovarian cancer patients compared with normal serum. This result agrees with our data showing increased core fucosylation and bisecting glycans in endometrioid ovarian tumor tissues. Therefore, there is a high probability of isolating and identifying glycoproteins shed into serum from ovarian carcinomas with differences in glycosylation. Lebrilla (An et al., 2006<i>. J. Proteome Res. </i>5:1626-1635) have monitored changes in glycan structures in the serum of ovarian cancer patients using MALDI-FTMS and find several tumor-specific changes for neutral oligosaccharides in MALDI spectra. This study employed a &#x3b2;-elimination procedure to remove oligosaccharides; therefore the neutral glycans changing in the serum could correspond to N- or O-linked glycans. Our data suggest that neutral glycans from the N-linked biosynthetic pathway such as core fucosylation and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine are increased significantly in ovarian tumor tissue relative to normal. Therefore, it should be possible to identify the glycoproteins that have these neutral N-linked glycan alterations from patient serum. In conclusion, our data in addition to these previous studies indicate that like breast cancer, ovarian tumor formation results in distinct altered glycan structures.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Comparison of Changes in Glycosylation Between a Mouse-Model of Endometrioid Ovarian Cancer and Human Endometrioid Ovarian Cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Ovarian tumors derived from the mouse model of human endometrioid ovarian cancer developed by Dinulescu et al. (2005. Nat. Med. 11:63-70) are well differentiated and recapitulate human ovarian cancer histologically. The benefits of mouse models are numerous, including: stable genetics, controlled environmental factors such as diet, and most importantly, the ability to sample tissue and serum at different stages of tumor development. Our data demonstrate that the glycomic changes occurring in the N-linked pathway for mouse-derived epithelial endometrioid ovarian tumors show corresponding changes in human ovarian endometrioid tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Increased Knowledge about the N-Linked Glycan Pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The N-linked glycosylation pathway consists of a series of sequential reactions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). The qRT-PCR approach enabled the quantization of the transcript levels for several enzymes with a wide dynamic range. The total pathway approach offers a chance to learn more about how synchronous oncogenic signaling changes can influence glycosylation. A summary of the average fold changes in expression measured for each enzyme analyzed is provided in Table 7. Some interesting findings that have resulted from this study include: (i) increased variability in FUT8 levels for human ovarian cancer versus mouse tumors, suggesting more complex influences controlling the levels of core fucosylation, (ii) lower levels of L-PHA reactivity for glycoproteins with elevated MGAT5 mRNA levels suggests possible inhibition of MGAT5 activity by MGAT3.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Genetic factors influencing glycosylation patterns have not been extensively studied. Although there has been a study recently published examining the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in the mucin-type glycosylation of MUC1 (Sellers et al., 2008<i>. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. </i>17:397-404). This study found that genetic polymorphisms within glycosylation enzymes analyzed for MUC1 may be playing a role in the underglycosylation of this protein in ovarian cancer patients suggesting that genetic factors can affect glycosylation. Several of the GT and GH enzymes included in this study are located in similar regions of the chromosomes (Table 7). MGAT1 and MGAT4b are located on the same chromosome in close proximity and show very different expression profiles for ovarian cancer. This seems to suggest that elevations in MGAT1 expression are probably not related to gain of chromosome copy, or MGAT4b would be increased in a similar manner. The changes in expression observed for GT enzymes in ovarian cancer could be due to differences in factors regulating GT promoters.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The small sample size of human endometrioid carcinoma cases analyzed in our study suggests that FUT8 expression and activity are more variable. Due to the lack of variability in the mouse model, we postulate that in humans there may be unknown factors in ovarian tumors either genetic or epigenetic that are capable of influencing core fucosylation. The FUT8 variability in human ovarian tumors contrasts with MGAT1, MGAT2, and MGAT3 which seems to be unaffected by genetic differences. More studies examining the glycomic changes in human cancer samples performed in conjunction with murine models are needed to better understand the possible role of genetic regulation on glycosylation.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The product of MGAT3 activity, the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine structure, has been reported to inhibit the activity of MGAT5 (Yoshirnura et al., 1995<i>. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>92:8754-8758; Taniguchi et al., 1996<i>. Glycobiology </i>6:691-694). We find that MGAT3 levels are substantially increased far above MGAT5 levels in ovarian tumors. Therefore, one possibility for why we observe less change in L-PHA reactivity for ovarian tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref> and B), despite increased levels of MGAT5 expression, may be that the addition of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine by MGAT3 prevented the addition of the &#x3b2;(1,6) branched oligosaccharide structure. Competition for the same nucleotide sugar donor (UDP-GlcNAc) does not seem to be a factor since MGAT4a and MGAT4b addition (evidenced by DSL binding) is unaffected by the large increase in MGAT3 activity. The addition of bisect bisecting N-acetylglucosamine to the trimannosyl core N-linked glycan has been reported to occur in opposition to &#x3b2;(1,6) branching performed by MGAT5 during the cell cycle (Guo et al., 2000<i>. Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1495:297-307). In this study the authors found that the mRNA levels and protein levels for MGAT5 were not changing, yet there was less MGAT5 enzyme activity at stages of the cell cycle when MGAT3 activity levels were high. These data along with our data support the notion that increased MGAT3 activity inhibits the addition of &#x3b2;(1,6) branched glycans by MGAT5 and the mechanism of this inhibition is currently unknown.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Bisecting Oligosaccharides and Cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Elevated levels of MGAT3 expression and an increase in bisecting glycans have been reported for pancreatic cancer and hepatoma (Ishibashi et al., 1989<i>. Clin. Chim. Acta </i>185:325-332; Nan et al., 1998<i>. Glycoconj. J. </i>15:1033-1037). Studies using diethylnitrosamine to induce liver tumor formation in mice null for MGAT3 showed reduced tumor formation (Wang et al., 2005<i>. Gynecol. Oncol. </i>99:631-639; Bhaumik et al., 1998<i>. Cancer Res. </i>58:2881-2887). However, if MGAT3 was overexpressed there is no induction or augmentation of tumor growth using diethylnitrosamine (Stanley, 2002<i>. Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1573:363-368). This result suggests an indirect effect of MGAT3 overexpression on liver tumorigenesis. In ovarian tumors, bisecting glycan structures predominate as evidenced by increased MGAT3 mRNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref> and B) and elevated EPHA binding (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref> and B). Bisecting structures have also been documented on CA125 isolated from the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3 (Kui Wong et al., 2003<i>. J. Biol. Chem. </i>278:28619-28634). Mice null for MGAT3 are viable and reproduce normally. This, along with the fact that MGAT3 is expressed at a low level in normal ovary, suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting MGAT3 could be useful for retarding ovarian tumor progression with minimal interruption of normal ovary functions.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In conclusion, the glycomic analysis presented in this manuscript provides a framework for future glycoproteomic studies. These studies will enable the identification of the proteins that express bisecting N-linked glycans and allow for the structural characterization of the bisecting oligosaccharides.</p>

<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Glycan changes present in ovarian cancer may differ from glycan changes present in breast cancer. Potential biomarkers of ovarian cancer, as shown in Table 8, were discovered in ovarian tissue using methods analogous to those described in Examples II and III, using lectins that recognize bisecting N-linked glycans (E-PHA), core-fucosylated (AAL), and &#x3b2;(1,4) branched glycans (DSL). As shown below, not all of the identified proteins were predicted to by glycosylated proteins (glycoproteins). These may associate with other, lectin-reactive glycoproteins or have acquired a glycan to become a glycoprotein as part of oncogenic transformation.</p>

<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Increased &#x3b2;(1, 6) branched glycans in breast cancer. Serum (5 &#x3bc;l) from patients with breast cancer (BC) and healthy patients (NL) was incubated with 10 &#x3bc;g of biotinylated LPHA in 300 &#x3bc;l of lectin binding buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Paramagnetic streptavidin beads were added and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Bound complexes were captured using a magnet and washed with lectin binding buffer 3&#xd7; before separating the proteins on a 4-12% NuPage Bis-Tris gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and probed using the indicated antibodies, anti-periostin and anti-osteoglycin. Periostin (POSTN) from breast cancer (BC) cases (BC3, BC4, BC5 and BC6) show increased reactivity with LPHA compared with the POSTN from normal (NL) cases (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). These cases also exhibit an additional isoform of periostin reacting with L-PHA that is of a higher molecular weight. Osteoglycin (OGN) from BC cases (BC1, BC3, BC4, BC5, and BC6) also shows increased reactivity with L-PHA compared with OGN from NL cases. Combining these results, serum from BC1, BC3, BC4, BC5, and BC6 have significant increases in L-PHA reactive POSTN and/or OGN compared to serum from healthy women. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> thus provides evidence of increased &#x3b2;1,6 branched glycans on periostin (POSTN) and osteoglycin (OGN) (also referenced as mimecan) in serum from breast cancer (BC) cases compared with normal (NL) serum.</p>

<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Tumor-specific glycosylation in ovarian cancer. Markers were selected for validation based on results obtained using glycoproteomic analysis of endometrioid ovarian tumor (TU) tissue compared with benign (NL) ovary tissue (Example IV). Lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP-1) was immunoprecipitated from 500 &#x3bc;g of pre-cleared protein lysate obtained from ovarian tumor tissue or normal ovarian tissue in 300 &#x3bc;l of 1&#xd7; Tris-buffered saline, 1% triton-X-100 using 2 &#x3bc;g of anti-LAMP-1 monoclonal antibody (E-Bioscience). Bound antibody complexes were captured using 50 &#x3bc;l of protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. Complexes were washed stringently using 1&#xd7;TBS/1% triton X-100 buffer before separating the proteins on 4-12% NuPage Bis-Tris gels prior to transfer to PVDF membrane for 2 hours at 25V. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4&#xb0; C. in 3% BSA/1&#xd7;TBST before detection using the indicated biotinylated lectin (DSL, AAL, E-PHA) (1:5,000 dilution) followed by streptavidin-HRP (1:5,000) incubation and Western Lightening Plus (Perkin Elmer) detection. LAMP-1 isolated from tumor tissue shows increased reactivity with the DSL and AAL lectins compared with LAMP-1 isolated from normal ovary (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>). The lower band represents a non-specific reaction of the streptavidin-HRP with a protein from the tissue lysates. This band serves as a control for equivalent protein content in the immunoprecipitation reactions; confirming that the increased band density for LAMP-1 from tumor tissue compared with normal is due to increased glycosylation and not a difference in protein input. These results definitively demonstrate significantly elevated levels of branched N-linked glycans that have either &#x3b1;1,3 or &#x3b1;1,6 linked fucose on LAMP-1 in ovarian tumor tissue compared to benign ovarian tissue. POSTN was immunoprecipitated from 500 &#x3bc;g of pre-cleared protein lysate as described above using 2 &#x3bc;g of an anti-periostin polyclonal antibody (Abeam). There is no POSTN reacting with the DSL lectin. However, POSTN isolated from tumor tissue is reacting with the AAL and E-PHA lectins, while there is no detectable band present in the POSTN isolated from normal tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). These results suggest that POSTN from ovarian tumor tissue has increased core fucosylation and increased levels of bisecting glycans compared with POSTN from normal ovary. The lower non-specific band again demonstrates an equivalent amount of protein present in the precipitation reactions. Lectin galactoside soluble binding protein 3 (LGALS3BP) was immunoprecipitated as described for LAMP-1 using a goat polyclonal antibody to LGALS3BP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). LGALS3BP isolated from normal and tumor tissue shows no change in reactivity to DSL and AAL, however, there is an increased reactivity with E-PHA for LGALS3BP from ovarian tumor tissue compared to normal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>). These results suggest that LGALS3BP has increased bisecting N-linked glycans in ovarian tumor tissue relative to normal ovarian tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Increased bisecting glycans in ovarian cancer. Serum (5 &#x3bc;l) was incubated with 10 &#x3bc;g of biotinylated E-PHA in 300 &#x3bc;l of lectin binding buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Paramagnetic streptavidin beads were added and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.

Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and probed using the indicated antibodies, anti-periostin and anti-&#x3b1;-1 acid GP as a control. Ovarian tumors (OT) OT1, OT4, and OT5 have increased levels of periostin interacting with EPHA when compared to all benign cases analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>). These cases also show evidence of multiple isoforms of periostin present after EPHA precipitation. These results indicate that POSTN present in the serum of patients with ovarian cancer have bisecting N-linked glycans while POSTN that may be present in the serum of women with benign gynecologic diseases does not have this glycan structure. These results correlate with the immunoprecipitation results obtained from ovarian cancer tissue compared with normal ovarian tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). &#x3b1;-1 acid glycoprotein (&#x3b1;-1 acid GP) is a ubiquitous protein found in serum that does not show any changes in the abundance of bisecting N-linked glycans (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). These results demonstrate that equivalent levels of protein were present in the E-PHA precipitation reactions. Therefore, the absence of POSTN in the E-PHA precipitation from serum of women with benign gynecologic disease is not due to protein degradation or reduced protein input. These results provide evidence that the presence of bisecting N-linked glycans on periostin is an ovarian tumor-specific marker found in serum.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Increased Fucosylated Glycans on Lysosomal-Associated Glycoprotein 1 (LAMP-1).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Serum (5 &#x3bc;l) was incubated with 10 &#x3bc;g of biotinylated AAL in 300 &#x3bc;l of lectin binding buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Paramagnetic streptavidin beads were added and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Bound complexes were captured using a magnet and washed with lectin binding buffer 3&#xd7; before separating the proteins on a 4-12% NuPage Bis-Tris gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and probed using the indicated antibodies. Ovarian tumors (OT1, OT2, OT3, and OT5) have increased levels of Lamp-1 interacting with AAL compared to benign cases analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). These cases also show evidence of a slower migrating form of Lamp-1, further evidence of a change in glycosylation. These results correlate with the immunoprecipitation results obtained from ovarian cancer tissue compared with normal ovarian tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>). The lower panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a streptavidin (SA-HRP) interacting protein for each lane. These results demonstrate that equivalent levels of protein were present in the AAL precipitation reactions. Therefore, the increased abundance of Lamp-1 in the AAL precipitation from serum of women with ovarian cancer is not due to increased protein input. These results provide evidence that the fucosylation of N-linked glycans on Lamp-1 is an ovarian tumor-specific marker found in serum.</p>

<heading id="h-0034" level="1">Identification of Candidate Biomarkers with Cancer-Specific Glycosylation in the Tissue and Serum of Endometrioid Ovarian Cancer Patients by Glycoproteomic Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Epithelial ovarian cancer is diagnosed less than 25% of the time when the cancer is confined to the ovary, leading to 5 year survival rates of less than 30%. Therefore, there is an urgent need for early diagnostics for ovarian cancer. Our study using glycotranscriptome comparative analysis of endometrioid ovarian cancer tissue and normal ovarian tissue led to the identification of distinct differences in the transcripts of a restricted set of glycosyltransferases involved in N-linked glycosylation. Utilizing lectins that bind to glycan structures predicted to show changes, we observed differences in lectin-bound glycoproteins consistent with some of the transcript differences. In the present study, we have extended our observations by the use of selected lectins to perform a targeted glycoproteomic analysis of ovarian cancer and normal ovarian tissues. Our results have identified several glycoproteins that display tumor-specific glycosylation changes. We have verified these glycosylation changes on glycoproteins from tissue using immunoprecipitation followed by lectin blot detection. The glycoproteins that were verified were then analyzed further using existing microarray data obtained from benign ovarian adenomas, borderline ovarian adenocarcinomas, and malignant ovarian adenocarcinomas. Those verified glycoproteins found to be expressed above control levels in the microarray datasets were then screened for tumor-specific glycan modifications in serum from ovarian cancer patients. Results obtained from two of these glycoprotein markers, periostin and thrombospondin, have confirmed that tumor-specific glycan changes can be used to distinguish ovarian cancer patient serum from normal serum.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest reproductive tract malignancy of women in Western countries (Ozols et al., Cancer Cell 2004. 5: 19-24). Approximately 22,000 new cases are diagnosed each year and about 45% of these women will be alive at 5 years (Hayat et al., Oncologist 2007. 12: 20-37). Methods useful for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer could significantly improve survival rates. For example, ovarian cancer survival rates climb to greater than 90% for women diagnosed when the disease is confined to the ovary (Hayat et al., Oncologist 2007. 12: 20-37). In this study we are focusing on a specific type of ovarian cancer found to comprise 16-25% of ovarian cancer cases known as endometrioid ovarian cancer (Storey et al., Cancer 2008. 112: 2211-2220). This cancer arises from the outer epithelial lining of the ovary similar to other types of ovarian cancer such as serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, clear cell carcinoma, and mucinous carcinoma. Many endometrioid ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an earlier stage, enabling the study of early malignant lesions.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Glycosyltransferase expression levels have been shown to change in certain tumors (Buckhaults et al., J Biol Chem 1997. 272: 19575-19581; Seales et al., Oncogene 2003. 22: 7137-7145; Takahashi et al., Int J Cancer 2000. 88: 914-919). Glycan structures that are added by these glycosyltransferases can be detected by specific lectins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>). In an earlier study, we used human endometrioid ovarian tissue, as well as a mouse model of human endometrioid ovarian cancer, and a quantitative real-time PCR approach (qRT-PCR) to measure quantitative changes in the expression levels of a set of enzymes in the N-linked biosynthetic pathway (Abbott et al., Proteomics 2008. 8: 3210-3220). We were able to identify glycosyltransferases within the N-linked pathway that had significantly increased transcript levels in the tumor tissues compared to normal. The use of lectins to fractionate complex biological samples such as tissue and serum for protein identification by mass spectrometry is becoming a sensitive method to isolate potential disease markers (Yang et al., Clin Chem 2006. 52: 1897-1905; Abbott et al., J Proteome Res 2008. 7: 1470-1480; Mechref et al., Methods Mol Biol 2008. 424: 373-396; Kim et al., Proteomics 2008. 8: 3229-3235; Pierce, &#x201c;Cancer Glycomics.&#x201d; in Cummings and Pierce (Eds.), Handbook of Glycomics. Academic Press, San Diego 2009). Our approach targeting specific glycan structures that are changing in correlation with malignant disease has been used successfully for breast cancer (Abbott et al., J Proteome Res 2008. 7: 1470-1480). In this study, we have extended this technique for natural and malignant human ovarian tissue using fractionation with multiple lectins. Our mass spectrometry results have identified tumor-specific glycosylation changes on glycoprotein markers not previously identified for ovarian cancer. In addition, we have validated these glycan changes on glycoproteins in tissue and serum collected from the patients in this study. Our approach using tissue as the initial source for glycoproteomic analysis, followed by validation in serum, has enabled us to find novel tumor-specific glycoprotein markers that may be useful for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer (Abbott et al, Proteomics 2010, 10:470-481).</p>

<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Tumor Samples and Sample Preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Human endometrioid ovarian cancers (n=5) and non-diseased human ovary tissue (n=4) were obtained from women as frozen tissue from the Ovarian Cancer Institute (Atlanta, Ga.). Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this research from The Georgia Institute of Technology, The University of Georgia, and Northside Hospital (Atlanta, Ga.). Our analysis included frozen tissue (minimum of 50 mg) wet weight, which we were able to obtain from 5 tumor and 4 non-diseased age-matched ovary samples. Frozen tissue was made into a fine powder in the presence of liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Tissue powder was delipidated using a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (4:8:3, v/v/v) as described previously (Aoki et al., J Biol Chem 2007. 282: 9127-9142). Delipidated protein pellets were given an additional wash with acetone and water (4:1) on ice for 15 minutes before drying under nitrogen. Delipidated pellets were stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until use.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Lectin Binding and MS Sample Processing.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Intact proteins were extracted from the delipidated tissues using a mild detergent solution as follows: 20 mg of delipidated protein powder was dissolved in 300 &#x3bc;l of 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, one protease inhibitor tablet, the sample was sonicated 3 times for 10 second pulses at setting 5 (Vertis Virsonic microtip). The supernatant was taken after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. The protein concentration of the sample was determined by BCA assay and 600 &#x3bc;g of total protein lysate was dialyzed overnight at 4&#xb0; C. into 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate using a 4,000 MWCO tube-O-dialyzer (GBiosciences). Minimal loss of protein occurred following dialysis due to the use of neutral non-binding membrane, &#x2266;5%. The sample was adjusted to 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>before the addition of the following lectins: biotinylated E-PHA (Phaseolus Vulgaris Erythroagglutinin), biotinylated AAL (<i>Aleuria Aurantia</i>), and biotinylated DSL (Datura Stramonium) (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif.) (10 &#x3bc;g each) was added and the sample was rotated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. Bound lectin reactive proteins were captured using 100 &#x3bc;l paramagnetic streptavidin particles (Promega) at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. After washing in 1&#xd7;PBS, captured proteins were eluted with 200 &#x3bc;l of 2M Urea/4 mM DTT/40 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 52&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. The eluted fraction was separated from the paramagnetic streptavidin particles using a magnetic stand. Eluted proteins were carboxyamidomethylated by adding an equal volume of iodoacetamide (10 mg/ml in 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate) in the dark for 45 minutes and digested with 5 &#x3bc;g of sequencing grade trypsin (1:50, Promega) at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. Tryptic peptides were acidified with 200 &#x3bc;l of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalting was performed using C18 spin columns (Vydac Silica C18, The Nest Group, Inc.). Eluted peptides were dried in the speed vac and resuspended in 19.5 &#x3bc;l buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and 0.5 &#x3bc;l of buffer B (80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) and filtered through a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter (nanosep, PALL). Samples were loaded off-line onto a nanospray column/emitter (75 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;13.5 cm, New Objective) self-packed with C18 reverse-phase resin in a nitrogen pressure bomb for 10 minutes. Peptides were eluted via a 160-minute linear gradient of increasing B at a flow rate of approximately 200 nl/min. directly into a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo Co. San Jose, Calif. equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source). The top eight ions from the full MS (300-2000 m/z) were selected for CID fragmentation at 36% with a dynamic exclusion of 2 repeat counts using an exclusion time of 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Proteomic Data Analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The raw MS data was converted to mzXML using ReAdW, a software written at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Wash., which is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.systemsbiology.org. MS/MS spectra were searched against the International Protein Index (IPI) human sequence database (IPI.HUMAN.v.3.26; available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/Databases.html) using MyriMatch (Tabb et al., J Proteome Res 2007. 6: 654-661). The MyriMatch search criteria included only tryptic peptides, all cysteines were presumed carboxyamidomethylated, and methionines were allowed to be oxidized. MyriMatch searches allowed a precursor error of up to 1.25 m/z and a fragment ion limit of within 0.5 m/z. All ambiguous identifications that matched to multiple peptide sequences were excluded. The identified proteins (2+ peptides required) from each individual tumor and normal sample were filtered and grouped using IDPicker software (Zhang et al., J Proteome Res 2007. 6: 3549-3557). IDPicker software incorporates searches against a separate reverse database, probability match obtained from MyriMatch, and DeltCN scores. Information about IDPicker tools can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/msrc/bioinformatics/. Variance for sample processing between normal and tumor samples were calculated by measuring the number of peptides identified for proteins that adhere to the lectins in a non-glycan dependent manner, such as serum albumin. Our results indicate 14.6%&#xb1;0.16 variance between normal and tumor cases analyzed.</p>

The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000&#xd7; g for 10 minutes. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Lysate (500 &#x3bc;g) was pre-cleared using protein A/G beads and normal IgG from the species of the primary antibody prior to immunoprecipitation. Antibodies to indicated biomarkers (2 &#x3bc;g) were added to 500 &#x3bc;g pre-cleared lysate at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. Protein A/G beads (50 &#x3bc;l) were added to separate antibody bound and unbound proteins. Proteins bound to protein A/G were separated on 4-12% NuPage Bis Tris gels and transferred to PVDF membrane at 25 V for 1.5 hours. Membranes were blocked overnight in 3% BSA/TBST buffer before lectin blot detection using a 1:5,000 dilution of the following biotinylated lectins: <i>Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin </i>(E-PHA), <i>Aleuria aurantia </i>(AAL), and <i>Datura stramonium </i>(DSL), Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif.).

<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Lectins recognizing specific glycan structures within the N-linked glycosylation pathway (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>) were chosen for glycoproteomic analysis based on our results demonstrating that the mRNA levels of the enzymes that synthesize these glycans were elevated 2-18 fold in ovarian cancer tissue relative to normal ovary (Abbott et al., Proteomics 2008. 8: 3210-3220). The enzymes showing the largest elevations in mRNA levels were MGAT 4a, MGAT4b, MGAT5, MGAT3, and FUT8. As shown circled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the lectin <i>Datura stramonium </i>(DSL) can recognize the &#x3b2;(1,4) branched N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) added by the glycosyltransferases MGAT4a and MGAT4b, as well as the &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-acetylglucosamine added by the glycosyltransferase MGAT5 (Wu et al., Glycoconj J 2008). The lectin <i>Aleuria aurantia </i>(AAL) has a high affinity for the core &#x3b1;(1,6) fucose-linked product that results from the activity of the FUT8 glycosyltransferase (Nagata et al., Biochim Biophys Acta 1991. 1076: 187-190; Iskratsch et al., Anal Biochem 2009. 386: 133-146). <i>Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin </i>(E-PHA) binds with the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine that is produced by the activity of the glycosyltransferase known as MGAT3.</p>

<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Intact glycoproteins were extracted from ovarian tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>) before isolating lectin reactive proteins using the lectins DSL, AAL, and E-PHA. The cases of ovarian cancer chosen for analysis are shown in Table 9: five cases of endometrioid ovarian cancer (2 early stage and 3 later stage) and four cases of normal ovary tissue (age matched with tumor cases). Following multiple lectin enrichment, eluted intact glycoproteins were processed to tryptic peptides prior to MS/MS analysis. MS/MS data for each tissue sample were analyzed using the flow diagram for outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. Myrimatch searches were used to filter m/z data against the reverse human IPI database to achieve a false discovery rate of less than 2% for proteins identified with a minimum of 2 peptides. We identified cumulatively 504 unique proteins from the ovarian tumor tissue and 315 unique proteins from normal ovarian tissue after multilectin enrichment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, &#x3e;60% of the unique protein identifications were made with 3 or more peptides. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> also indicates that there was a 38% increase in the number of proteins enriched by lectins from tumor tissues relative to normal ovarian tissues. These results are expected due to the increased expression of the glycosyltransferases that add these glycan structures in ovarian cancer tissue versus non-diseased ovary (Abbott et al., Proteomics 2008. 8: 3210-3220). The proteins identified in tumor and non-diseased cases were then grouped using the IdPicker software. Proteins that were enriched in tumor cases at a spectral abundance of 1.5&#xd7; (150%) above normal were selected. In addition, a second criterion that was applied required the protein to be present at a 1.5&#xd7; increase in at least 3 of the 5 tumor cases analyzed. Table 10 lists select proteins that remained following both data filtering criteria. The peptide sequences for those proteins and additional identified proteins are provided in Table 11. Approximately 40% of the proteins in this list contain a signal sequence and are predicted to be glycoproteins. Since we do not elute proteins from the lectin column with sugar haptens, many of the proteins not predicted to be glycoproteins by sequence analysis may be associating with glycoproteins that have bound to the lectins.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The database DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) was used to annotate the function of the proteins shown in Table 10. The top 3 functional classifications of the proteins enriched by multilectin affinity chromatography of ovarian tumor tissue relative to non-diseased ovarian tissue were: antioxidant activity (3.2E-8), glucose metabolism (8.7E-7), and cellular adhesion (9.8E-3). Considering only glycoproteins containing signal sequences, the functional categories are dominated by the antioxidant (examples include: CP, LDHA, LTF, SERPINH1, CFB, and LAMP1) and cellular adhesion (examples include: POSTN, THBS1, FIBLN5, MUC5b, and HSPG2) categories. Glycoproteins in these functional categories play significant roles in the progression and metastatic spread of ovarian cancer. Therefore, strategies to co-target the glycan moieties on these glycoproteins as well as their peptide epitopes may contribute to new therapeutic strategies with greater specificities that could be useful to inhibit ovarian tumor cell adhesion and spread in the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Most of the glycoproteins listed in Tables 10 and 11 have never been exploited as potential biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The two proteins for which we are presenting further development, periostin (POSTN) and thrombospondin (THBS1), have been cited as being present in ovarian cancer (Gillan et al., Cancer Res 2002. 62: 5358-5364; Bignotti et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol 2007. 196: 245 e241-211). These proteins have not, however, been developed into potential diagnostic assays, likely due to their presence in the serum of normal patients. Our identification of tumor-specific glycosylation changes on POSTN and THBS1 for ovarian cancer tissue and patient serum appears to be novel. By extension, therefore, it is likely that other glycoproteins in Tables 10 and 11 may be useful as candidate ovarian cancer markers based on glycosylation differences.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Validation Studies</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Glycoproteins from Table 10 were chosen for validation studies based on their reported identification in serum (Liu et al., J Proteome Res 2005. 4: 2070-2080). Since the glycoproteomic studies were performed with 3 lectins simultaneously, the glycoproteins markers listed in Table 10 likely have multiple, distinct glycan structures. A direct method to confirm and characterize glycan changes on glycoproteins is to immunoprecipitate the protein using an antibody directed against its polypeptide, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, then detection of the glycan of interest using a labeled lectin. In an effort to find markers for early stage disease, a single stage I case (sample 3, Table 9) was chosen for validation along with a non-diseased case (sample 7, Table 9). An example of validation is shown for the marker POSTN in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. Our results indicated that POSTN was reactive with the lectins AAL (panel 2, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>) and E-PHA (panel 3, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>) only in the tumor tissue. There was no reactivity of POSTN with the lectin DSL (panel 1, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>). The tumor-selective reactivity of POSTN with AAL and E-PHA suggest that this marker would be a good candidate for serum validation.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">By contrast to POSTN, the glycoprotein LAMP-1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1) has elevated reactivity with DSL and AAL (panel 1 and 2, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) in tumor tissue relative to normal tissue but very little change in E-PHA reactivity (panel 3, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>). Equivalent levels of protein were present in each immunoprecipitation for normal and tumor, evidenced by the detection of a streptavidin-reactive protein present on each blot which was observed without lectin present. These results confirm the ability of the lectins to recognize and bind to specific glycan structures and suggest that core fucosylation (AAL reactivity, panel 2) is the most significantly changing glycan structure on LAMP-1 in ovarian cancer tissue. Although we did not detect LAMP-1 in normal tissue by proteomic analysis (Table 10), the detection of LAMP-1 lectin reactivity in normal tissue (panel 1 and 2, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) by immunoprecipitation and Western blot suggest that this marker is not a prime candidate for further serum validation. A technical difference in the conditions that produced the MS/MS data in Table 10 and the Western blot data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> for LAMP-1 was the denaturation of the protein prior to lectin blot analysis and not prior to the lectin chromatography/MS analysis. LAMP-1 is a heavily N-glycosylated protein, at least 17 potential sites of glycosylation, and it is quite possible that denaturation could render glycosylation sites accessible for lectin binding that are not as exposed under the native conditions used for the multilectin affinity prior to MS/MS analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">During our studies, we also observed that when glycoproteins were highly reactive with E-PHA, there was low DSL reactivity; conversely, if the protein was highly positive for DSL reactivity, the E-PHA reactivity was low (compare DSL data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). These results suggest that the presence of a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (detected by E-PHA) could either inhibit DSL lectin binding or that the presence of the bisecting glycan inhibited glycosylation reactions on the protein to which DSL binds. The marker POSTN has been shown to express elevated &#x3b2;(1,6) branched N-linked glycans in invasive ductal breast carcinoma (Abbott et al., J Proteome Res 2008. 7: 1470-1480). Our observation that E-PHA and DSL co-reactivity does not appear to exist in a single glycoprotein population suggests that the E-PHA-reactive form of POSTN may be a selective marker for ovarian cancer. Our results suggest, therefore, that it is possible for a single glycoprotein, POSTN, to be a marker for two different types of cancer depending on specific differences in the glycans that it expresses.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Our ultimate goal is to identify glycoprotein markers that can be used to detect early stage ovarian cancers. Ovarian cancers originate via diverse oncogenic signaling mechanisms (Aunoble et al., Int J Oncol 2000. 16: 567-576); therefore, potential markers identified by any study may not be present at detectable levels in serum from patients with a wide variety of histological types of ovarian tumors. In order to identify markers for serum validation studies that could have the broadest applicability, we consulted the extensive microarray dataset generated by The Ovarian Cancer Institute laboratory at The Georgia Institute of Technology. Microarray transcript expression profiling has been shown to discriminate benign and malignant ovarian tumors (Warrenfeltz et al., Mol Cancer 2004. 3: 27). Microarray expression data were analyzed for those glycoproteins in Table 10 whose sequences predicted that they could be secreted into serum. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, microarray expression data revealed that the majority of potential serum glycoprotein markers identified have increased mRNA expression levels in tumors above normal. Considering the microarray data, tissue verification data, and high abundance predicted by MS spectral count analysis in ovarian cancer cases, we chose POSTN and THBS1 for initial serum validation. To validate glycan changes on glycoproteins from serum, biotinylated lectins were coupled to magnetic streptavidin beads to isolate lectin-reactive proteins prior to Western blot detection using antibodies directed against specific proteins. The validation of two candidate markers in sera is presented: POSTN (2 fold increase in expression arrays) and THBS1 (4 fold increase in expression arrays) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, boxed). The glycoprotein POSTN displays increased bisecting N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation and core fucosylation in ovarian tumor tissue, as evidenced by increased E-PHA and AAL reactivity, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> panel 2 and 3). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, serum samples from four of five tumor cases have E-PHA-reactive POSTN detected above normal serum levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, panel 1, cases 1, 3, 4, 5). Initial validation results suggest, therefore, that expression of the bisecting N-linked structure on POSTN in serum is associated with ovarian cancer. Lower grade tumors such as those in cases 3 and 4 are positive as well as higher grade tumors. While only one band migrating at approximately 98 kD was observed in tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> panel 2 and 3), in serum we observed three bands migrating at approximately 98 kD, 80 kD, and 65 kD. The presence of smaller forms may also be due to proteolytic cleavage in serum. There is one potential N-linked glycosylation site, and it is located in the C-terminus of POSTN. The reactivity of these smaller forms of periostin with the lectin E-PHA indicates that N-terminal cleavage of POSTN may occur after release into serum. We observed that core fucosylated (AAL reactive) POSTN was present at variable levels in serum, and its presence in non-diseased and tumor serum showed no association with the presence of malignant. These results suggest that POSTN with AAL reactivity is released into the serum from a tissue other than ovary.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The candidate marker THBS1 shows increased core fucosylation in ovarian cancer tissue relative to normal, based on AAL reactivity. AAL precipitation and antibody analysis of THBS1 in serum samples indicates that in four of five tumor cases (cases 1-4), THBS1 was more reactive with AAL compared to non-diseased serum cases (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, panel 2). Again, both low grade and higher grade cases are positive for AAL reactivity with THBS1. We observed only one form of THBS1 from tissue migrating at approximately 135-140 kD. However, in serum we observed a form migrating at a slightly lower molecular weight &#x2dc;125 kD, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. The higher molecular weight glycoform can be detected at a lower level of expression in some cases, such as case 1 and 2. THBS1 has three-four N-linked sequons, with two-three located toward the N-terminus region and one in the C-terminus region. The cleavage of THBS1 that may be occurring in serum does not affect its tumor-specific AAL reactivity, however. In these experiments, serum input amounts and quality were assessed by measuring the levels of E-PHA reactive alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, panel 3). Taken together, these results identify E-PHA-reactive POSTN and AAL-reactive THBS1 as candidate markers useful in the distinguishing of sera from endometrioid ovarian cancer patients and sera from non-diseased controls. Combining the Western blot results for both markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>) all 5 tumor cases (samples 1-5) are more lectin reactive when compared with normal serum (cases 6-9). Therefore, the cumulative detection of both glycoproteins with their tumor-specific glycan structures can distinguish the serum of ovarian endometrioid cancer patients from normal serum in 5/5 cases tested.</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">We have used a focused approach targeting N-linked glycan structures that appear to be increased in endometrioid ovarian cancer tissue relative to normal ovary to identify potential glycoprotein markers for this cancer. This strategy has led to the identification of 47 potential tumor-specific lectin-reactive markers. We have presented tissue and serum validation methods that add confidence that in many cases the tumor-specific glycoform detected in serum has originated from the tumor. The goal of future investigations is to develop a multi-glycoprotein-marker panel that when assayed together could provide an effective means for the early detection, prognosis, and monitoring of all types of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">Bisecting Glycans and Core Fucosylation in Ovarian Cancer</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The role of bisecting glycans in most epithelial cancers is thought to suppress metastasis by suppressing the addition of branched complex N-linked glycans that can promote tumor cell migration (Schachter, Adv Exp Med Biol 1986. 205: 53-85; Takahashi et al., Carbohydr Res 2009. 344: 1387-1390; Lau et al., Cell 2007. 129: 123-134). Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a unique type of epithelial cancer due to its origination from the outer epithelial surface of the ovary that exhibits both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics (Lee et al., J Pathol 2007. 211: 26-35; Auersperg et al., Endocr Rev 2001. 22: 255-288). Cell-cell adhesive contacts are important in the regulation of cell signaling events that promote tumorigenesis. Most epithelial tumors have a loss of cell-cell adhesion due to decreased expression of E-cadherin. However, EOC maintain E-cadherin expression and cell-cell adhesion junctions during tumor development and progression (De Santis et al., Oncogene 2009. 28: 1206-1217). This observation leads to the hypothesis that a possible feedback loop connecting the expression of bisecting N-linked glycans added by GnT-III and E-cadherin expression in EOC. GnT-III expression is regulated by E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells (Akama et al., 2008. 8: 3221-3228). Conversely, GnT-III can glycosylate E-cadherin, increasing the cell surface levels of E-cadherin and further stimulating GnT-III expression and activity[31]. The effect of increased E-cadherin on the cell surface would elevate the AKT/PI3K pathway promoting ovarian cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis (De Santis et al., Oncogene 2009. 28: 1206-1217). Another way that bisecting glycans could promote EOC tumorigenesis is through the inhibition of apoptosis. GnT-III over-expression in HeLa cells has been shown to suppress peroxide-induced apoptosis (Shibukawa et al., J Biol Chem 2003. 278: 3197-3203). Therefore, ovarian cancer cells under oxidative stress may activate apoptotic pathways that are then suppressed by GnT-III activity and the presence of bisecting glycans on cell surface receptors. The mechanisms of how GnT-III activity can suppress apoptosis are not fully understood, and specific acceptors of glycosylation responsible have not been identified, however. Future glycoproteomic studies on membrane glycoproteins isolated from ovarian tumor tissue could lead to the identification of cell surface glycoprotein receptors that may be potential therapeutic targets.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Core fucosylation, a common N-linked glycan modification, is increased in and serves as a marker for several cancers (Comunale and Mehta, Methods Mol Biol 2009. 520: 59-74; Comunale et al., J Proteome Res 2009. 8: 595-602; Mehta and Block, Dis Markers 2008. 25: 259-265; Inamori et al., J Biol Chem 2004. 279: 2337-2340; Nakagawa et al., J Proteome Res 2008. 7: 2222-2233). Increased core fucosylation on glycoproteins promotes growth factor signaling, since FUT8&#x2212;/&#x2212; mice are small and die during prenatal development (Wang et al., Methods Enzymol 2006. 417: 11-22). FUT8 expression has also been implicated in the regulation of EGFR and PDGF receptor internalization and signaling (Wang et al., J Biol Chem 2006. 281: 2572-2577). Core fucosylation has also been linked to enhanced E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in colon cancer cells by reducing the turnover of cell surface E-cadherin (Osumi et al., Cancer Sci 2009. 100: 888-895). Therefore, the cumulative effect of increased bisecting N-acetylglucosamine and core fucosylation on E-cadherin would likely promote ovarian cancer tumorigenesis.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">Cell Stress and Glycosylation Changes</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Our glycoproteomic data has identified several non-N-linked-glycosylated proteins enriched by multi-lectin chromatography of ovarian tumor extracts. Many of these proteins are heat shock proteins and chaperones (GRP78, HSPB1, YWHAG, CCT5), protein disulfide isomerases (PDIA3, PDIA4, PDIA6), and glucose metabolism enzymes (GPI, PGK1, PGD, PGAM1). Tumor cells that are proliferating rapidly create a glucose-deprived, hypoxic environment (Brahimi-Horn et al., J Mol Med 2007. 85: 1301-1307). The classes of non-N-linked-glycosylated proteins observed to be enriched by multi-lectin chromatography may be managing this type of cellular stress. Many of these proteins such as GRP78 have been identified on the cell surface in previous proteomic studies (Shin et al., J Biol Chem 2003. 278: 7607-7616). GRP78 is induced by glucose deprivation and acts as a cell survival factor capable of inhibiting apoptosis in many tumors (Yeung et al., Oncogene 2008. 27: 6782-6789; Kumar and Tatu, Proteomics 2003. 3: 513-526). While GRP78 may not be an ideal biomarker for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer due to its increased levels in many different types of cancer, it may, however, be useful in directing therapeutics (Lee, Cancer Res 2007. 67: 3496-3499). Although GRP78 contains no predicted N-linked glycosylation sequons, we sought to test whether GRP78 isolated by immunoprecipitation would be bound directly by lectins. We immunoprecipitated GRP78 from ovarian cancer tissues, subjected the bound proteins to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, but observed no reactivity with the lectins used in this study (data not shown). Therefore, GRP78 must be binding tightly enough to glycoproteins to be enriched by lectin affinity. Which glycoproteins GRP78 is binding with on the surface of ovarian cancer cells is currently unknown. Future studies identifying the cell surface glycoproteins GRP78 may be binding with may provide targets for peptide therapeutic strategies to block the anti-apoptotic activity of GRP78. Our approach solubilizing proteins in mild detergent would not allow for the identification of possible membrane glycoproteins that may be GRP78 cell surface binding partners.</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">Glycoprotein Markers and Potential Involvement in Ovarian Cancer Spread</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Ovarian cancer cells typically form multicellular aggregates and may spread by attachment to the peritoneal abdominal wall lining (Burleson et al., J Transl Med 2006. 4: 6). This type of non-hematological tumor-spread may be influenced by the extracellular matrix proteins identified in this study, such as POSTN, BGN, HSPG2, THBS1, and FIBLN5, and corresponding interactions with their cell receptors. A recent proteomic study to identify expression profiles associated with invasive potential in ovarian cancer cell lines found that the most significantly enriched signaling pathway promoting invasivity was extracellular matrix receptor signaling (Sodek et al., Mol Biosyst 2008. 4: 762-773). The adhesive glycoproteins that we have validated as glycomarkers for ovarian cancer, POSTN and THBS1, have been implicated in promoting tumor spread (Gillan et al., Cancer Res 2002. 62: 5358-5364; Bignotti et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol 2007. 196: 245 e241-211). Future studies will focus on determining if increased core fucosylation and bisecting N-glycans on these glycoproteins augment ovarian cancer peritoneal adhesion with a focus on identifying potential mechanisms that could be targeted to block EOC peritoneal adhesion.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">Relationship of the Results of this Study to CA-125, a Glycoprotein Marker for Ovarian Cancer</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The best known glycoprotein marker for ovarian cancer is CA-125 (MUC16). Serum protein levels of this marker may be used to monitor ovarian cancer patients during treatment; however, due to variable concentrations of CA-125 in benign diseases, this assay has not been routinely as a diagnostic assay (Clarke-Pearson, N Engl J Med 2009. 361: 170-177). CA-125 is a large mucin protein containing both N- and O-linked glycans, and its complexity has hampered detailed analysis of its glycan structures. However, the glycosylation patterns of CA-125 and certain acute-phase glycoproteins have been documented to change in ovarian cancer (Saldova et al., Glycobiology 2007. 17: 1344-1356; Saldova et al., Dis Markers 2008. 25: 219-232; Jankovic et al., Cancer Biomark 2008. 4: 35-42). For example, Jankovic et al., compared the glycans of CA-125 isolated from amniotic fluid to CA-125 from the OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell line and found a significant increase in the reactivity of OVCAR3 CA-125 with the lectin E-PHA compared to CA-125 from amniotic fluid (Jankovic et al., Cancer Biomark 2008. 4: 35-42). These data agree with our finding that bisecting N-linked glycans are elevated in ovarian cancer tissue relative to normal ovary (Abbott et al., Proteomics 2008. 8: 3210-3220). Despite these findings, however, we were unable to detect CA-125 in our glycoproteomic analysis of endometrioid ovarian cancer tissue, which may reflect differences between endometrioid ovarian cancer and other adenocarcinomas of the ovary. We did identify another mucin, MUC5b, which showed increased binding to the lectins used in this study, suggesting that different types of ovarian cancers may secrete different dominate mucins. These data suggest that assays targeting mucin glycoproteins may not have sufficient sensitivity for a variety of histological types and grades of ovarian tumors. The ability to correlate focused glycoproteomic data with genomic microarray data from a diverse sampling of histological type ovarian tumors will likely lead to glycomarkers with increased sensitivity for many histological subtypes of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">In conclusion, the glycoproteomic results presented offers initial validation that glycoproteins with tumor-specific glycan changes can be used to distinguish malignant ovarian tissue and serum from normal ovarian tissue and serum. The glycosylated candidate markers and non-glycosylated candidate markers identified with tumor-specific lectin affinity are promising for the detection and potential therapeutic intervention of endometrioid ovarian cancer and possibly other forms of ovarian cancer.</p>
