<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a home appliance and a washing machine, and more particularly, to a home appliance and a washing machine, in which a patterned ornament and a transparent member are closely attached to each other, achieving water-tight sealing therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, to arouse a user's aesthetic appreciation and to achieve harmony with surrounding environments, an external appearance defining part of a home appliance, called a body, cabinet, case, casing, or the like, is subjected to painting, coating, image printing, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, in the case of a laundry treating machine as one kind of a washing machine, an exterior panel is attached to an outer surface of a casing member that defines an external appearance of the machine, in order to improve aesthetics of the machine according to user demand for an aesthetic product. In particular, recently, aesthetics of a home appliance is no less important, as a judgment standard of purchase, than functionality or performance and thus, improving aesthetics of a product becomes important.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, to improve aesthetics of a product, an image has been printed on the product using a silk screen. In this case, printing an image using the silk screen is unrelated to material characteristics of a member defining a printing surface and thus, has a limit in presentation of material texture of the member and creation of three-dimensional feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, constituent elements of the exterior panel do not show close adhesion therebetween, causing invasion of water through the rim of the exterior panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a home appliance and a washing machine, in which a flat rim of an ornament is closely attached to a transparent member, resulting in a sealed gap between the ornament and the transparent member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The objects of the present invention are not limited to the above-mentioned object and other objects that have not mentioned above will become evident to those skilled in the art from the following description.</p>

The laundry treating machine may include a washer, a dryer, a combined washing/drying machine, a spin-drier, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the following embodiments of the present invention describe a laundry treating machine <b>1</b> falling under the category of a washing machine, the present invention is not limited thereto and is applicable to a variety of washing machines. Furthermore, it is noted that the present invention is applicable to a variety of home appliances.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front view showing the laundry treating machine <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the laundry treating machine <b>1</b> includes a body having a wash space (not shown) to wash laundry therein, a control unit <b>10</b> provided in an upper region of the body to control general operations of the laundry treating machine <b>1</b> upon receiving an operation command from a user, a door <b>20</b> to open or close a front side of the wash space, and a pedestal <b>30</b> provided in a lower region of the body to perform, e.g., drying, deodorization, and sterilization of shoes received therein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control unit <b>10</b> includes a display device <b>14</b> to display information related to general operations of the laundry treating machine <b>1</b>.

In addition, the control unit <b>10</b> further includes a user manipulation button <b>13</b> to allow the user to input an operation command. In one example, the user manipulation button <b>13</b> may take the form of a rotary encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An external appearance defining part of a home appliance, which is called a body, case, cabinet, or the like (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;casing member&#x201d;), is generally fabricated through injection molding. An injection molded article may allow an exterior panel to be attached to an outer surface thereof. In this case, to arouse a user's aesthetic appreciation, the exterior panel may be formed with an image <b>21</b>, in the form of a figure, pattern, or the like, by printing or etching.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The laundry treating machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of exterior panels. The plurality of exterior panels may include a control unit exterior panel <b>10</b><i>a </i>to define an external appearance of the control unit <b>10</b>, a door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>to define an external appearance of the door <b>20</b>, and a pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a </i>to define an external appearance of the pedestal <b>30</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of the partially cut-way portion A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the laundry treating machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view showing an ornament <b>100</b> of the laundry treating machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view of the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the laundry treating machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>includes the ornament <b>100</b> on which an image is formed by an image processing technology, such as photo-etching, and a transparent member <b>130</b> coupled to a surface of the ornament <b>100</b> by means of an adhesive member <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The surface of the ornament <b>100</b> is formed with an image, in the form of a figure, pattern, or the like, so as to make the ornament <b>100</b> aesthetically pleasing. Specifically, the transparent member <b>130</b> serves as a protective coating layer on the surface of the ornament <b>100</b> to allow the ornament <b>100</b> to be seen from the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ornament <b>100</b> is preferably made of a metal, which can be easily photo-etched. When the ornament <b>100</b> is made of a metal, aesthetics of the ornament <b>100</b> can be improved by maximizing material texture of the metal via polishing or photo-etching. In particular, the ornament <b>100</b> may be made of stainless steel (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;STS&#x201d;). As is known, STS has excellent corrosion-resistance, durability, and reflectivity and is easily photo-etched. In addition, when STS is subjected to cutting or photo-etching, a processed surface of STS exhibits a high gloss that is peculiar to a metal, making an external appearance of a product look more luxurious.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In more detail, the ornament <b>100</b> is formed at the surface thereof with a plurality of hair lines <b>102</b>. The hair lines <b>102</b> may be formed by polishing the surface of the ornament <b>100</b> in a given direction. Specifically, the hair lines <b>102</b> may be realized by a processing device that uses an abrasive sheet formed with appropriate sizes of particles. As the abrasive sheet is rotated at a high speed, the hair lines <b>102</b> of discontinuous pitches are formed on the surface of the ornament <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The hair lines <b>102</b> serve to maximize the material texture of the ornament <b>100</b>, and have the effects of improving material texture of a metal by polishing, preventing glare via scattered reflection of indoor light, and creating a luxurious external appearance. In particular, although a smooth metal plate may cause irregular reflection light when it is slightly deformed by external shock thus having an unpleasing external appearance, processing hair lines on a metal surface can solve this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The ornament <b>100</b> is further formed at the surface thereof with a patterned portion <b>110</b>. The patterned portion <b>110</b> may be realized by photo-etching. Here, photo-etching is an ultra-precision processing technology and includes coating a photoresist film on a metal surface, exposing and developing a partial image by ultraviolet light, and then, etching the exposed metal surface.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In more detail, photo-etching is a combination of photolithography and etching. Photolithography includes applying a photoresist solution over a substrate to form a photoresist film, and selectively exposing and developing a partial image on the film by ultraviolet light having passed through a photo-mask (i.e. a patterned film).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Etching is a technology for selectively etching a material surface using a developed photoresist film as a protective film. Specifically, etching is one kind of a recess forming technology for perforating and cutting a recess in a metal surface where no protective film is present via electrolytic etching or chemical etching using an acid or alkali solution, ferric chloride solution, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After completing the etching of the metal surface as described above, a finishing process for removing the protective film using an alkali solution, organic solvent, or the like may be added.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The patterned portion <b>110</b> may be formed on the surface of the ornament <b>100</b> by photo-etching. Photo-etching allows delicate lines of approximately 0.02 mm&#x2dc;0.03 mm to be presented on the ornament <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, the patterned portion <b>110</b> includes recesses <b>112</b> indented from a surrounding plane by etching. The recesses <b>112</b> consist of outline recesses <b>112</b><i>a </i>defining an outline of an image and plane recesses <b>112</b><i>b </i>defining a plane of the image. In the present embodiment, the patterned portion <b>110</b> wholly defines a petal-shaped image. An outline of the image is realized by the outline recesses <b>112</b><i>a</i>, and a plane of the image is realized by the plane recesses <b>112</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The patterned portion <b>110</b> may be realized by photo-etching in a state wherein the hair lines <b>102</b> have been formed on the ornament <b>100</b>. In this case, the outline recesses <b>112</b><i>a </i>are preferably deeper than the plane recesses <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the hair lines <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The patterned portion <b>110</b> may include a plurality of the recesses <b>112</b>. Respective ones of the plurality of recesses <b>112</b> may have various depths and widths under control of an etching degree. The various depths and widths of the plurality of recesses <b>112</b> cause, e.g., differences in paths, reflection angles, and reflected amount of light, advantageously enabling creation of a three-dimensional image. In particular, various depths of spaces are created between the transparent member <b>130</b> coupled to the surface of the ornament <b>100</b> and the plurality of recesses <b>112</b>, resulting in maximized three-dimensional effect.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Meanwhile, assuming that a plastic casing member formed by injection molding is subjected to mirror printing and thereafter, a transparent member made of reinforced glass is coated on the casing member, a printed surface of the injection molded casing member may scratch the transparent member during coating. More particularly, an outline of a printed image is generally defined by a thin and sharp line raised from a surrounding plane, thus acting to scratch the transparent member.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The laundry treating machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention has an advantage of preventing the transparent member <b>130</b> from being scratched because the outline recesses <b>112</b><i>a </i>defining the outline of the image are deeply indented from the surrounding plane.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The transparent member <b>130</b> is made of a transparent material suitable to allow the patterned portion <b>110</b> and the hair lines <b>102</b> to be seen from the outside. The transparent material may be selected from reinforced glass, glass, a PolyCarbonate (PC) sheet, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The transparent member <b>130</b> is attached to the ornament <b>100</b> by use of the adhesive member <b>120</b>. The adhesive member <b>120</b> may be made of Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA). In a state wherein PSA is interposed between two objects to be coupled, PSA acts to attach the two objects to each other upon receiving a predetermined pressure. PSA can achieve desired adhesive strength even under conditions of a room temperature and low pressure and therefore, has an advantage of realizing attachment of an object without deformation of the object. The adhesive member <b>120</b> is seated over the hair lines <b>102</b> of the ornament <b>100</b>, serving to attach the transparent member <b>130</b> and the ornament <b>100</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although photo-etching employed in the first embodiment of the present invention includes coating a photoresist film on the ornament <b>100</b>, exposing and developing a partial image on the film, and then, chemically etching the ornament <b>100</b>, in an alternative embodiment, a desired shape of image may be directly sketched on the ornament <b>100</b> and thereafter, sand cutting may be performed along the sketched image. Of course, various other methods capable of etching an image in the ornament <b>100</b> may be applied without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With formation of the recesses <b>112</b>, predetermined spaces are created between the transparent member <b>130</b> and the ornament <b>100</b>, allowing the ornament <b>100</b> to exhibit different shadow effects and material textures according to viewing directions. That is, maximizing three-dimensional effect of the patterned portion <b>110</b> viewed from the outside is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In more detail, a part of light directed to the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>is reflected by a front surface of the transparent member <b>130</b>, another part of the light is reflected by a front surface of the adhesive member <b>120</b> after passing through the transparent member <b>130</b>, and another part of the light is reflected by the recesses <b>112</b> after passing through the adhesive member <b>120</b>. In this case, maximized three-dimensional effect can be accomplished because the transparent member <b>130</b>, the adhesive member <b>120</b>, and the recesses <b>112</b> reflect the light at different angles. Moreover, further enhanced three-dimensional effect can be accomplished because of refraction of the light passing through the transparent member <b>130</b> and/or the adhesive member <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ornament <b>100</b> is formed along a rim thereof with a flat surface portion <b>104</b> rather than being formed with the hair lines <b>102</b> or the patterned portion <b>110</b>. The flat surface portion <b>104</b> is not affected by polishing of the hair lines <b>102</b> and also, is not affected by etching of the patterned portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The flat surface portion <b>104</b> is formed inward from the rim of the ornament <b>100</b> and has a width &#x201c;a&#x201d;. When the transparent member <b>130</b> and the ornament <b>100</b> are attached to each other by use of the adhesive member <b>120</b>, the flat surface portion <b>104</b> achieves surface attachment with respect to the adhesive member <b>120</b>, having the effect of increasing an attachment area. Specifically, one surface of the adhesive member <b>120</b> is closely attached to the flat surface portion <b>104</b> of the ornament <b>100</b>, and the other surface of the adhesive member <b>120</b> is closely attached to the transparent member <b>130</b>, whereby a gap between the ornament <b>100</b> and the transparent member <b>130</b> can be sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the flat surface portion <b>104</b> is formed at the rim of the ornament <b>100</b> to achieve surface attachment with respect to the adhesive member <b>120</b> and in turn, the adhesive member <b>120</b> achieves surface attachment with respect to the transparent member <b>130</b>, furthermore, coupling strength between the ornament <b>100</b> and the transparent member <b>130</b> can be enhanced. This has the effects of preventing the transparent member <b>130</b> from peeling off and also, preventing propagation of bacteria, such as mold, etc., due to water entering a gap between the transparent member <b>130</b> and the ornament <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view of the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the laundry treating machine according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Hereinafter, a description of the same configurations as the above described first embodiment will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in a state wherein the ornament <b>100</b> is formed at the rim thereof with the flat surface portion <b>104</b>, a first sealing member <b>106</b> may be inserted along the flat surface portion <b>104</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a configuration wherein the adhesive member <b>120</b> covers the entire upper surface of the ornament <b>100</b> including the flat surface portion <b>104</b> and the first sealing member <b>106</b> is seated on the adhesive member <b>120</b> along the flat surface portion <b>104</b>, in an alternative embodiment, the adhesive member <b>120</b> may be placed to cover a partial surface of the ornament <b>100</b> except for the flat surface portion <b>104</b>, and only the first sealing member <b>106</b> may be seated on the flat surface portion <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferably, the first sealing member <b>106</b> has a shape corresponding to that of the flat surface portion <b>104</b>.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as described above, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>is integrally formed such that the transparent member <b>130</b> and the ornament <b>100</b> are coupled to each other by use of the adhesive member <b>120</b>. The door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the outer surface of the door casing member <b>22</b>, completing formation of the door <b>20</b>. In this case, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be attached to the door casing member <b>22</b> by use of a sealant or a double-sided tape <b>125</b>. In particular, the sealant <b>125</b> is filled between the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the door casing member <b>22</b> and can act to attach an object with excellent adhesive strength while exhibiting high water-resistance, strong cohesion for a long time, and less material deterioration and variation.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The ornament <b>100</b> is preferably made of a metal, and the printed layer <b>140</b> is preferably made of a transparent material to allow metallic material texture of the ornament <b>100</b> to be seen from the outside. The printed layer <b>140</b> may be made of a transparent colored material. In this case, with cooperation of the color of the printed layer <b>140</b> and the metallic material texture of the ornament <b>100</b>, enhanced aesthetics of the ornament <b>100</b> can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a front view showing exterior panels of the laundry treating machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 12</figref>, as described above, the exterior panels include the control unit exterior panel <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and the pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this case, the control unit exterior panel <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and the pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be formed as a single body. In one example, after a single exterior panel is patterned to form an image, the patterned exterior panel may be split into the control unit exterior panel <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and the pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The above described exterior panel fabrication method of splitting the single patterned panel into the control unit exterior panel <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and the pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a </i>has an advantage of easily realizing a continuous image throughout a plurality of adjacent panels.

For this, after the image <b>15</b> is formed by photo-etching in a state wherein the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a </i>are formed as a single body, cutting of the single body is performed, enabling easy realization of the image <b>15</b>. In particular, realizing the continuous image <b>15</b> on the neighboring panels, i.e. the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a</i>, may advantageously arouse unity and coordination, resulting in visual stability.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Of course, it is not essential that the control unit exterior panel <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and the pedestal exterior panel <b>30</b><i>a </i>be formed as a single body. For example, an exterior panel having a curved surface portion, such as the control unit exterior panel <b>10</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, may be separately fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a front view showing a laundry treating machine <b>2</b> according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing a configuration of the door exterior panel <b>20</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.
