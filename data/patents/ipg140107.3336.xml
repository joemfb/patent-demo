<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a circuit structure and a layout method thereof, and more particularly to a semiconductor circuit structure wherein the circuit structure thereof can avoid damaging from stresses, and a layout method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For increasing the integrated level of the semiconductor, circuit patterns in multi-layers are designed to increase the amount of elements held in a single chip. The circuit patterns employ metal line structures, such as plugs or contacts, to be connected with each other for forming a whole loop. Furthermore, for not contacting the circuit patterns in the multi-layers with each other, which do not connect the metal lines, dielectric layers are generally formed between the circuit patterns in the multi-layers to separate the circuit patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a conventional semiconductor circuit structure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor circuit structure <b>100</b> mainly includes a substrate <b>110</b> and a plurality of circuit patterns <b>120</b> disposed on the substrate <b>110</b>. Since a position distribution of the circuit patterns <b>120</b> are determined by the semiconductor manufacturing standards and the property of the circuit structure, distances between the circuit patterns <b>120</b> are different.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when the distances between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>120</b> are too large, that is, a great insulating area <b>130</b> is formed between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>120</b>, stresses born by the semiconductor circuit structure <b>100</b> in manufacturing are apt to concentrate at junctions of the insulating area <b>130</b> and the circuit patterns <b>120</b>, such that the circuit patterns <b>120</b> are apt to be disrupted or distorted.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a semiconductor circuit structure, which can transfer stresses in manufacturing out of circuit patterns, to improve a process yield thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is also directed to a layout method of a semiconductor circuit, which can protect circuit patterns from being damaged by stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A semiconductor circuit structure in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention comprises a substrate and an interconnect structure.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A layout method of a semiconductor circuit in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention is provided. The layout method is firstly putting a plurality of circuit patterns on a substrate, wherein a first distance is the largest distance between any one of the circuit patterns and one of other circuit patterns adjacent thereto. The layout method is then determining whether the first distance is larger than a first critical value. Later, when the first distance is larger than the first critical value, at least a closed loop pattern is putted in one of the areas corresponding to the first distance between the pair of the circuit patterns. The closed loop pattern is putted in a same layer with the circuit patterns, surrounds between the pair of circuit patterns and is insulated form the circuit patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, at least a second distance is between any one of the pair of circuit patterns and the circuit patterns adjacent thereto, and the second distance is less than the first critical value. The layout method further comprises determining whether the second distance is larger than a second critical value. Wherein, when the second distance is larger than the second critical value, the layout method further comprises putting at least a linear pattern corresponding to the second distance, and the linear pattern is connected with the closed loop pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the layout method of the semiconductor circuit further comprises determining whether a width of the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern is larger than the first critical value.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the dummy pattern may be ringed-shape, polygon-shape or irregular-shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the first distance between the at least a pair of circuit patterns is larger than the first critical value, the layout method further comprises putting at least one dummy pattern between the pair of the circuit patterns before putting the closed loop pattern. The subsequent putted closed loop pattern surrounds the dummy pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the layout method further comprises putting at least one dummy pattern in the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern after putting the closed loop pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, before putting the closed loop pattern, the layout method further comprises determining whether the first distance is larger than a third critical value. When the first distance is larger than the third critical value, a plurality of closed loop patterns are disposed in the area corresponding to the first distance between the pair of circuit patterns, and distances between the closed loop patterns are less than the first critical value.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe exemplary embodiments of the present semiconductor circuit structure and a layout method thereof, in detail. The following description is given by way of example, and not limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic view of a semiconductor circuit structure in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the semiconductor circuit structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> along a line I-I&#x2032;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b> includes a substrate <b>210</b> and an interconnect structure <b>220</b>. The interconnect structure <b>220</b> is disposed on the substrate <b>210</b>, and includes a plurality of circuit patterns <b>222</b> and at least a closed loop pattern <b>224</b>. The closed loop pattern <b>224</b> surrounds between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> may surrounds between the two adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> along contours of the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be noted that, the circuit patterns <b>222</b> are elements with electrical functions of the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b>, and shapes thereof are determined in actual needs and not limited in the present invention. Furthermore, the circuit patterns <b>222</b> may be independent circuits, and also may be connected with each other via another circuit pattern <b>225</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The closed loop pattern <b>224</b> has not any electrical function in the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b>. That is, the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> is electrically insulated from the circuit patterns <b>222</b> and any other element.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, distances between the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> and the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> are determined by the different manufacturing generations (such as, 0.18 um generation, 0.13 um generation or 90 nm generation, etc.) and different element layers (such as, gate layer, interconnect metal layer or metal-plug layer, etc.). The distances thereof may be equal or larger than the minimum rule of the element layer of the manufacturing generation. In this exemplary embodiment, a minimum distance between the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b> may be 70 micrometers, but it is not used to limit the present invention. Furthermore, a width of the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> may be equal to those of the circuit patterns <b>222</b>. Alternatively, the width of closed loop pattern <b>224</b> may be less than or larger than those of the circuit patterns <b>222</b>. The width of the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> may be not a definite value. For example, different closed loop patterns <b>224</b> may have different widths. Alternatively, widths in different disposing directions of a same closed loop pattern <b>224</b> may be different.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In detail, the interconnect structure <b>220</b> further includes a plurality of dielectric layers <b>226</b> and a plurality of conductive plugs <b>228</b>. The conductive plugs <b>228</b> are formed in the dielectric layers <b>226</b> to electrically connect the conductive films in the different layers with each other. The circuit patterns <b>222</b> are formed on one of the dielectric layers <b>226</b>, or formed in the dielectric layers <b>226</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to electrically connect other semiconductor elements (not shown) via the conductive plugs <b>228</b>. The insulating area <b>223</b> between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> is a part of the dielectric layers <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be noted that, the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b> are manufactured in a same process. That is, the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b> are arranged in a same layer of the interconnect structure <b>220</b>, and are made of a same material. In detail, the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> may be made of a conductive material same to those of the circuit patterns <b>222</b>, such as metal or poly-silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> it can be seen that, this exemplary embodiment disposes the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b>. Thus, when the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b> bears heat stresses or mechanical stresses, most of the stresses will be concentrated at the junctions between the insulating area <b>223</b> and the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> to avoid the stresses disrupting or distorting the circuit patterns <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specially, if there is further a distance between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> less than the space of the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> occupied, a linear pattern <b>525</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be formed therein to connect to the closed loop pattern <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view of a semiconductor circuit structure in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the semiconductor circuit structure <b>600</b> is similar to the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b> of the above exemplary embodiment, and the following will only describe differences therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The interconnect structure <b>220</b> of the semiconductor circuit structure <b>600</b> further includes at least a dummy pattern <b>622</b>. The dummy pattern <b>622</b> is disposed in the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> to further solve the problem of stresses concentration when the insulating area <b>223</b> between the circuit patterns <b>222</b> is large, or avoid the loading effect of the etching process, the photo lithography, or the chemical mechanical planarization caused by the densities of the patterns are too larger. The dummy pattern <b>622</b> is electrically insulated from the circuit patterns <b>222</b> and other elements.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this exemplary embodiment, the interconnect structure <b>220</b> includes a plurality of dummy patterns <b>622</b>, and the dummy patterns <b>622</b> may be any polygon-shape, such as a square as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> or a rectangle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Of course, the dummy patterns <b>622</b> also may be a ringed-shape (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) or other irregular shapes. The present invention does not limit the contour and the arrange mode of the dummy patterns <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the dummy patterns <b>622</b> in the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> may be separated from the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), also may be connected with the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The persons skilled in the arts can determine the dummy patterns <b>622</b> and the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> in actual needs, and they are not limited in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Except employing the dummy patterns <b>622</b> to further solve the problem of stresses concentration in the above embodiment, another exemplary embodiment of the present invention further can dispose a plurality closed loop patterns <b>224</b> between the two adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The closed loop patterns <b>224</b> surrounds between the two adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> along the contours of the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> to avoid concentrating the stresses born by the semiconductor circuit structure <b>900</b> in manufacturing at the junctions between the insulating area <b>223</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For making the persons skilled in the arts more understand the present invention, the following embodiments will describe layout methods of semiconductor circuits of the present invention cooperated with FIGS.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an implementing flow chart of a layout method of a semiconductor circuit in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 10</figref> together, the layout method of the semiconductor circuit of this exemplary embodiment is firstly putting a plurality of circuit patterns <b>222</b> on a substrate <b>210</b> as shown in a step S<b>1010</b>. Wherein, a first distance L<sub>1 </sub>is the largest distance between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b>. It should be noted that, the distance between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> is a minimum distance between the two adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> at a horizontal line. The layout method thereof is then determining whether the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>is larger than a first critical value as shown in a step S<b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In detail, when the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>between the adjacent circuit patterns are less than the first critical value, it represents that the stresses born by the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b> in manufacturing are not apt to be concentrated at the junctions between the insulating area <b>223</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b>. On the contrary, when the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> is larger than the first critical value, it represents that the stresses born by the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b> in manufacturing are apt to be concentrated at the junctions between the insulating area <b>223</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b>. Therefore, at least a closed loop pattern <b>224</b> needs to be putted between the pair of the circuit patterns <b>222</b>, which is shown in a step S<b>1030</b>. Therefore, the stresses born by the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b> in manufacturing will be transferred to the junction between the insulating area <b>223</b> and the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> to avoid the stresses damaging the circuit pattern <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">From the above, the minimum distance L<sub>2 </sub>between the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b> is determined by the different manufacturing generations (such as, 0.18 um generation, 0.13 um generation or 90 nm generation, etc.) and the different element layers (such as, gate layer, interconnect metal layer or metal-plug layer, etc.), and is not limited in the present invention. Therefore, in an exemplary embodiment, the first critical value may be two times of the width L<sub>3 </sub>of the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> adding three times of the minimum distance L<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be noted that, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 11</figref>, if there is the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> larger than the first critical value, and there is also a second distance L<sub>4 </sub>less than the first critical value between one of the pair of the circuit patterns <b>222</b> and the adjacent circuit pattern <b>225</b>, the layout method thereof is further determining whether the second distance L<sub>4 </sub>is larger than the second critical value after disposing the closed loop pattern <b>224</b>, which is shown in a step S<b>1110</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the second critical value may be a time of the width of the linear pattern <b>525</b> adding two times of the minimum distance L<sub>2</sub>. Then when the second distance L<sub>4 </sub>is larger than the second critical value, the layout method will comprises the step of putting the linear pattern <b>525</b> corresponding to the second distance L<sub>4</sub>, which is shown in a step S<b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">On the other hand, if the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> is smaller than the first critical value, the step S<b>1110</b> also can be performed for determining whether the second distance L<sub>4 </sub>is larger than the second critical value, and then the step S<b>1120</b> is performed while the second distance L<sub>4 </sub>is larger than the second critical value.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an implementing flow chart of a layout method of a semiconductor circuit in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 6</figref>, specially, for further solving the problem of stresses concentration, this exemplary embodiment still can put at least a dummy pattern <b>622</b> in the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> after putting the closed loop pattern <b>224</b>, which is shown in a step S<b>1040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is an implementing flow chart of a layout method of a semiconductor circuit in accordance with other exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 6</figref> together, this exemplary embodiment still can determine whether the width L<sub>5 </sub>of the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> is larger than the first critical value before putting the dummy pattern <b>622</b>, which is shown in a step S<b>1035</b>. When the width L<sub>5 </sub>of the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> is larger than the first critical value, the dummy pattern <b>622</b> is putted in the area surrounded by the closed loop pattern <b>224</b>, which is shown in a step S<b>1040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be noted that, the present invention does not limit the shape of the dummy pattern <b>622</b>, and the shape thereof may be any polygon-shape (such as the quadrangle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) or a ringed-shape (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) or other irregular shapes. In addition, the dummy pattern <b>622</b> may be connected with the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), or be separated from the closed loop pattern (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> again, other exemplary embodiment may firstly put the dummy pattern <b>622</b> in the insulating area <b>223</b> between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b>, and then put the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> to surround the dummy pattern <b>622</b> therein. In other words, the present invention does not limit the sequence of putting the dummy pattern <b>622</b> and the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> in the layout process.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> again, it should be noted that, if the insulating area <b>223</b> between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> is too large, a plurality of closed loop patterns <b>224</b> may be putted in the insulating area <b>223</b> to further decrease the concentration of the stresses of the semiconductor circuit structure <b>200</b>. The following exemplary embodiments will describe the layout method of the semiconductor circuit in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention cooperated with FIGS.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an implementing flow chart of a layout method of a semiconductor circuit in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 9</figref>, if determining the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>between the adjacent circuit patterns <b>222</b> is larger than the first critical value in the step S<b>1020</b>, the layout method is then determining whether the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>is larger than a third critical value, which is shown in a step S<b>1025</b>. When the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>is larger than the third critical value, this exemplary embodiment will put a plurality of closed loop patterns <b>224</b> in the areas corresponding to the first distance L<sub>1 </sub>when performing the step S<b>1030</b>. The distances of the closed loop patterns <b>224</b> are less than the first distance L<sub>1</sub>, and the minimum distance L<sub>2 </sub>between the closed loop patterns <b>224</b> and between the closed loop patterns <b>224</b> and the circuit patterns <b>222</b> is determined by the different manufacturing generations (such as, 0.18 um generation, 0.13 um generation or 90 nm generation, etc.) and the different element layers (such as, gate layer, interconnect metal layer or metal-plug layer, etc.), and is not limited in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an implementing flow chart of a layout method of a semiconductor circuit in accordance with other exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a schematic layout view of the semiconductor circuit structure in accordance with other exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> together, this exemplary embodiment still can put at least a vacancy <b>223</b> at the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> as shown in a step S<b>1050</b> after performing the step S<b>1030</b> to put the closed loop pattern <b>224</b>, such that the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> is a discontinuous pattern. The size of the vacancy <b>227</b> may be determined in actual needs.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It should be noted that, the layout method can be applied in the exemplary embodiment of the circuit patterns <b>222</b> being radio frequency circuit patterns, to avoid the closed loop pattern <b>224</b> interfering signals of the radio frequency circuit patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In summary, the present invention disposes the closed loop pattern between the adjacent circuit patterns, and the closed loop pattern is electrically insulated from other elements, to solve the problem of concentrating the stresses in the periphery of the circuit patterns to disrupt or distort the circuit patterns. Therefore, the present invention can improve effectively the mechanical strength of the semiconductor circuit structure to increase the manufacturing yield thereof.</p>
