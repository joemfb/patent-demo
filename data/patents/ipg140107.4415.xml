<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wireless access point connects various wireless communication devices to a wireless network, and relays data to and/or from the associated wireless communication devices. For example, the wireless communication devices, such as, for example, computers, printers, data storage devices, audio/video devices, and/or the like, may be connected to an access point directly or indirectly, and may exchange data with each other. Thus, the wireless access point is a very popular choice for implementing a home wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, a wireless access point is a stationary device that requires an external power source and therefore cannot be used when no power source is available. Moreover, to connect to a network via a stationary access point, a wireless device must be within a certain limited operational range of the wireless access point.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a known communication network <b>10</b> in which a stationary access point (AP) <b>12</b> is connected to a distribution system <b>14</b> via a wired link <b>16</b>. The distribution system <b>14</b> can be a wired local area network (LAN), for example, connected to a larger network such as the Internet (not shown) via a server <b>18</b>. As is typical, the stationary AP <b>12</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU) <b>20</b> coupled to a Wi-Fi card <b>22</b> and a memory <b>24</b>. The stationary AP <b>12</b> is also connected to a permanent power source <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As one of the conditions for establishing a communication link to the stationary AP <b>12</b> in order to access the server <b>18</b> or other network hosts, a device equipped with a wireless transceiver must be within the operating range <b>30</b> of the stationary AP <b>12</b>. Thus, a personal computer <b>32</b> disposed within the range <b>30</b> and the stationary AP <b>12</b> can communicate and form a basic service set (BSS) <b>34</b> (i.e., an association of devices including an access point and at least one station). On the other hand, a personal computer <b>36</b> is disposed outside the range <b>30</b> and cannot establish a communication link with the stationary access point <b>12</b> to participate in the BSS <b>34</b>. Similarly, if the personal computer <b>32</b> leaves the range <b>30</b>, the communication link to the stationary AP <b>12</b> will be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of an example communication network in which a mobile phone <b>50</b> is equipped with a compact, low code-footprint, low-power embedded AP module (hereinafter, &#x201c;embedded AP&#x201d;) <b>52</b> to establish wireless communication links with devices <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> located within an operating range <b>58</b> of the embedded AP <b>52</b>, and to form a BSS <b>60</b> that includes the embedded AP <b>52</b> and the devices <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. In an embodiment, the BSS <b>60</b> utilizes a wireless local area network (WLAN) communication protocol such as specified in the IEEE 802.11a, b, g, or n standards. The mobile phone <b>50</b> also operates in a mobile telephony network <b>70</b> that utilizes a mobile communication protocol such as the 3rd Generation (3G) family of standards defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a code divisional multiple access (CDMA) protocol, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) specification from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), or any suitable mobile communication protocol. To communicate with a base station <b>72</b> or other infrastructure elements associated with the network <b>70</b>, the mobile phone <b>50</b> includes an antenna <b>80</b> coupled to a signal processing and control unit <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">During operation, the embedded AP <b>52</b> operates independently of the signal processing and control unit <b>84</b> to control the operation of the BSS <b>60</b>, which may include one or several stations wirelessly connected to the embedded AP <b>52</b>. The embedded AP <b>52</b> implements the functionality of the stationary AP <b>12</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as well as one or more (or none) of such features as efficient power management, station-specific rate adaptation, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth&#xae; coexistence support, etc., discussed in more detail below. The embedded AP <b>52</b> in effect provides a portable network cloud which wireless devices (e.g., laptops with wireless cards, wireless printers, personal digital assistants, etc.) can join to communicate with each other or with external hosts via the network <b>70</b>. Thus, in one mode of operation, the embedded AP <b>52</b> routes or forwards data units between the devices <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. In another mode of operation, the embedded AP <b>52</b> routes or forwards data units between the device <b>54</b> or <b>56</b> and the network <b>70</b>. Additional modes of operation of the embedded AP <b>52</b> and the mobile phone <b>50</b>, as well as various topologies of the BSS <b>60</b> that the embedded AP <b>52</b> can support, are discussed in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In general, the signal processing and control unit <b>84</b> implements the primary functionality of the mobile phone <b>50</b> (or a similar portable device) and can include a processor having an architecture suitable for low power applications, such as an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor. In an embodiment, the signal processing and control unit <b>84</b> utilizes an operating system (OS) such as the Symbian OS, the QNX OS, or any other suitable operating system, to run drivers and applications. In an embodiment, because the embedded AP <b>52</b> includes an independent processing module such as a microprocessor or a processor embedded in an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), for example, the embedded AP <b>52</b> consumes few resources of the mobile phone <b>50</b>, and does not require that the signal processing and control unit <b>84</b> implement AP-specific functionality. Rather, an AP interface <b>88</b> allows the embedded AP <b>52</b> and the signal processing and control unit <b>84</b> to exchange data and control information. In an embodiment, the AP interface <b>88</b> supports a standard application programming interface (API) function set to make the embedded AP <b>52</b> easily portable (i.e., easily incorporated into a variety of different mobile phones or other types of devices). In some embodiments, the AP interface <b>88</b> is compatible with the Secure Digital (SD) standard so that the embedded AP <b>52</b> is incorporated into an SD card and can be removably inserted into an SD connector of the mobile phone <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, the AP interface <b>88</b> is a Universal Serial Port (USB) based interface, and the embedded AP <b>52</b> is provided in a separate external housing that is removably connectable to the mobile phone via a universal serial bus (USB) cable. Other suitable interfaces can also be used such as other industry standard interfaces, proprietary interfaces, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In at least some of the embodiments, the AP interface <b>88</b> enables easy insertion and removal of the embedded AP <b>52</b> from the housing of the mobile phone <b>50</b>. If implemented using a USB standard, in one embodiment, the AP interface <b>88</b> includes a female USB connector, and the embedded AP <b>52</b> includes a male USB connector. In another embodiment, the embedded AP <b>52</b> includes a female USB connector and a USB cable is utilized to couple the AP <b>52</b> with the AP interface <b>88</b>. It is noted that in some embodiments, the AP interface <b>88</b> is also for coupling with devices other than the embedded AP <b>52</b>, such as memory cards, power supplies, a personal computer, etc. Also in some embodiments in which the AP <b>52</b> includes a connector for removably connecting with other devices such as the mobile phone <b>50</b>, the embedded AP <b>52</b> is similarly compatible with devices other than the mobile phone <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the example mobile phone <b>50</b> includes a memory unit <b>90</b> (e.g., RAM) and a mass data storage <b>92</b> (e.g., a magnetic disk, a DVD drive), and several modules to provide user interaction: a microphone <b>94</b>, a display <b>95</b>, a user input device <b>96</b> (e.g., a keyboard, a keypad, a touch screen, etc.), and an audio output module <b>97</b> (e.g., a speaker). Further, a power source <b>100</b> such as a lithium battery or other suitable battery, provides power to both the embedded AP <b>52</b> and the signal processing and control unit <b>84</b>. The AP interface <b>88</b> accordingly can provide power transfer functionality in addition to data transfer functionality. In an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>52</b> lacks a power source such as a battery that is sufficient to support all functionality of the embedded AP <b>52</b>, and is therefore powered directly from the power source <b>100</b> via the AP interface <b>88</b>. In other words, the embedded AP <b>52</b> includes either no power source or includes only a secondary power source that cannot support all transmitting, receiving, processing, etc. functions of the embedded AP <b>52</b>. For example, the embedded AP <b>52</b> can include a battery for powering a battery backed-up memory. However, in some embodiments, the embedded AP <b>52</b> includes a power processing unit such as a DC-to-DC converter to adjust the voltage, amperage, frequency, or other characteristics of the supply signal provided via the AP interface <b>88</b>. It is noted that the power source <b>100</b> in these embodiments does not supply a charging current to a battery of the embedded AP <b>52</b> that is sufficient to support all functions of the embedded AP <b>52</b>. Thus, in these embodiments, the power source <b>100</b> is considered to directly power the embedded AP <b>52</b>, albeit via a power processing circuit if included.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition to the mobile phone <b>50</b>, the embedded AP <b>52</b> can be used with any electronic device. Moreover, it is noted that the electronic device need not operate in a network, and that the embedded AP <b>52</b> can be used to connect several devices in a local network without providing access to the Internet or other external network.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, an example embedded AP <b>120</b> is discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, followed by a discussion of an AP controller that can be used in the embedded AP <b>120</b> or the embedded AP <b>52</b> with reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> then illustrate several example BSS topologies in which the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> can be used. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> illustrate example methods for configuring a device to operate in a dual BSS mode and routing data units between stations using an embedded AP, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Similar to the embedded AP <b>52</b>, the embedded AP <b>120</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be used with the mobile phone <b>50</b> or another electronic device. In an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>120</b> is based on a Marvell 8688 chipset. The embedded AP <b>120</b> includes a processing unit <b>122</b> that can be, for example, an ARM processor. The processing unit <b>122</b> implements an AP controller <b>124</b>, one example of which is discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The processing unit <b>122</b> is coupled to a static random access memory (SRAM) unit <b>126</b>, an RF module <b>128</b>, a baseband module <b>130</b>, a media access control (MAC) unit <b>132</b>, and a Bluetooth (BT) unit <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the RF module <b>128</b> is coupled to an antenna <b>140</b>. In general, the RF module <b>128</b> can implement any desired wireless technology such as one or several standardized communication protocols including, for example, the IEEE Standard 802.11a and its updates and amendments, the IEEE Standard 802.11b, the IEEE Standard 802.11g, the IEEE Standard 802.11n, and the IEEE draft standards 802.15.3 or 802.15.3c. To operate according to one or several of these standards, the RF module <b>128</b> can include one or several encoders and decoders, interleavers and de-interleavers, modulators and demodulators, digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters, and other components used in an RF communication path.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The embedded AP <b>120</b> receives data, control signals, and power via a host interface <b>150</b> that can be similar to or compatible with the AP interface <b>88</b> discussed above. In particular, the host interface <b>150</b> can include a set of electrical connectors to support power and data transfer, and a housing component to mate with a corresponding interface component of the device. As one example, the host interface <b>150</b> can include a male USB connector insertable into a female USB connector provided on the AP interface <b>88</b>. Using a data channel <b>152</b>, the embedded AP <b>120</b> exchanges data units (e.g., packets, frames, streams) with a host that utilizes the embedded AP <b>120</b>. A control channel <b>154</b> carries configuration commands and other information to ensure interoperability between the embedded AP <b>120</b> and the corresponding host. On a portable device, a user can enter configuration data related to the embedded AP <b>120</b> using a user interface of the portable device (e.g., the display <b>95</b> and the user input module <b>96</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the portable device can in turn forward configuration commands to the embedded AP <b>120</b> via the control channel <b>154</b>. Further, a power channel <b>156</b> provides a relatively small electrical signal to power the CPU <b>122</b> and other modules of the embedded AP <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the power channel <b>156</b> directly powers the CPU <b>122</b>. In another embodiment, the power channel <b>156</b> directly powers the RF module <b>128</b>. In yet another embodiment, the power channel <b>156</b> directly powers the CPU <b>122</b> and the RF module <b>128</b>. It is noted that because the embedded AP <b>120</b> does not require an external user interface such as the modules <b>94</b>-<b>97</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the embedded AP <b>120</b> can be configured to utilize very little power from the power source of the host device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Moreover, in an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>120</b> is configured to further reduce power consumption by implementing power saving techniques such as those described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/435,871, filed on May 5, 2009, and entitled &#x201c;Access Point Enhancements,&#x201d; and in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/118,727, entitled &#x201c;Portable AP Enhancements&#x201d; which was filed on Dec. 1, 2008, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. As one example, the embedded AP <b>120</b> powers down for small periods of time without disconnecting from stations participating in a BSS. In an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>120</b> powers down according to a schedule of communication timeslots, so that the RF module <b>128</b> receives or transmits data only when the embedded AP <b>120</b> is scheduled to participate in a timeslot (or potentially can participate in a contention-period timeslot).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment, the BT module <b>134</b> is for establishing Bluetooth communication links with external devices. The AP controller <b>124</b> ensures that Wi-Fi and BT properly coexist in the embedded AP <b>120</b>. In particular, the AP controller <b>124</b> allows Wi-Fi traffic (e.g., data being downloaded from the Internet to a laptop via the mobile phone <b>50</b>) and Bluetooth traffic (e.g., a streaming music file being downloaded from the Internet, played by the mobile phone <b>50</b>, and transmitted to a headset) to share a common channel with no adverse effect on each other. In some embodiments, the AP controller <b>124</b> can implement the techniques described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/243,077, entitled &#x201c;AP PS Enhancements&#x201d; filed on Sep. 16, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of an AP controller <b>200</b> that can be used in the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> to implement functionality such as one or more of as rate adaptation, channel selection, access control including encryption and authentication, as well as TCP/IP stack support and various IP applications to provide advanced routing and network capability to the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b>. Depending on the particular embodiment, the components of the AP controller <b>200</b> can be implemented utilizing hardware, a processor executing firmware instructions, a processor executing software instructions, or any combination thereof. In an embodiment, the components of the AP controller <b>200</b> are provided as computer-executable instructions on a computer-readable memory such as a CD-ROM (or any other type of carrier) or made available for download from a host disposed on the Internet and/or via a mobile telephony network. Further, an AP controller <b>200</b>, in some embodiments, includes only some of the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and/or includes components in addition to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The AP controller <b>200</b> includes an authentication module <b>202</b> and an encryption module <b>204</b> to support secure authorized access to the corresponding one or several BSS clouds. In an embodiment, the encryption module <b>204</b> supports one or several of the Wireless Encryption Protocol (WEP), the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), WPA2, the WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure (WAPI), etc., with open system authentication, pre-shared key (PSK), the IEEE 802.1x Standard for port-based network access control, etc. To facilitate configuration, the AP controller <b>200</b> further includes a Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) module <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The AP controller <b>200</b> further includes a rate adaptation module <b>210</b> to support link-specific data rates to provide efficient throughput on each link Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in an embodiment, the rate adaptation module <b>210</b> configures the link between the embedded AP <b>52</b> and the device <b>54</b> to have one data rate, and the link between the embedded AP <b>52</b> and the device <b>56</b> to have another data rate. The data rate on each of these links may depend on the required quality of service and/or on physical conditions on each link.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a channel selection module <b>212</b> evaluates several wireless channels to select the least congested channel. To this end, the channel selection module <b>212</b> can use any suitable techniques, including those known in the art. In an embodiment, a BT/Wi-Fi coexistence controller <b>214</b> ensures that a device using the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> can concurrently carry out Wi-Fi and BT operations, as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Still further, an access controller <b>216</b> implements a suitable access control mechanism to selectively allow or deny access to the corresponding BSS. For example, in an embodiment, the access controller <b>216</b> grants or denies access to each of the devices <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> based on device identity, device type, or any other parameter (which may be user-configurable). Also, a power control module <b>218</b> implements power management logic as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A TCP/IP stack controller <b>220</b> supports one or several network protocol layers (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, etc.) to route data between stations operating in the BSS with which the corresponding embedded AP is associated, and support certain network functionality without relying on the host that includes the embedded AP. It is noted that the TCP/IP stack controller <b>220</b> allows the host (e.g., the mobile phone <b>50</b>) to execute host-specific applications without needing to utilize its processing power for TCP/IP stack control functions. In an embodiment, the TCP/IP stack controller <b>220</b> also supports HTTP and/or HTTPS so that the embedded AP can run a web server, for example. In this embodiment, a user can configure the embedded AP using a standard web browser.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A buffering controller <b>222</b> allows the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> to buffer data using the SRAM unit <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) when appropriate. For example, when the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> routes data between the devices <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the embedded AP <b>52</b> and <b>120</b> need not transfer data units via the host interface <b>150</b> and can instead utilize local resources. It is noted that the buffering controller <b>222</b> and the SRAM unit <b>126</b> permit the host device to preserve both space and processing power that would otherwise need to be dedicated for data units being transferred between the devices <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the buffering controller <b>222</b> can also support a configuration option to route data packets to the memory of the host via the host interface <b>150</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a user can thus choose to always route data, including data internal to the BSS <b>60</b>, via the mobile phone <b>50</b> for the purposes of monitoring network traffic, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a forwarding controller <b>224</b> implements at least some of the routing and forwarding functionality discussed above, in an embodiment. In this embodiment, the forwarding controller <b>224</b> determines that a data unit such as an Ethernet packet traveling from the device <b>54</b> to the device <b>56</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be routed locally, i.e., within the BSS <b>60</b>. Accordingly, the forwarding controller <b>224</b> buffers the data packet using the buffering controller <b>222</b> and the SRAM unit <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and routes the data packet via the RF module <b>128</b> and the antenna <b>140</b>. In at least some of the embodiments, the forwarding controller <b>224</b> processes the data packet without waking up the host. On the other hand, if the data packet is addressed to the host (e.g., the mobile phone <b>50</b>) or a host on the Internet, the forwarding controller <b>224</b> forwards the data packet to the host via the host interface <b>150</b> to be consumed by the host or forwarded to the network <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a dual BSS mode controller <b>228</b> allows the corresponding embedded AP to participate in multiple BSS clouds. For example, in one embodiment, the embedded AP is adapted to operate as a station in one BSS and as AP in another BSS, when desirable. In at least some of the embodiments, the embedded AP is adapted to participate in multiple BSS clouds concurrently, when desirable. The BSS mode controller <b>228</b> controls the timing of context switching of the AP controller <b>200</b>, i.e., transitioning from one mode of operation to another mode of operation. Thus, the BSS mode controller <b>228</b> does not require that the embedded AP be power-cycled to transition between different modes of operation, in an embodiment. The BSS mode controller <b>228</b> also stores the BSS identity of the AP controller <b>200</b> for each BSS context. Dual mode of operation (i.e., operating as an AP in one BSS and a station in another BSS, concurrently) is further discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">From the foregoing, it is noted that embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> is configured to operate as a portable access point, and allows a portable device such as a mobile phone to provide a mobile Wi-Fi cloud. In one embodiment, the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> has a low code footprint because the AP controller <b>200</b> is dedicated specifically to AP functionality. Further, in an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> is constructed with a small form-factor convenient for packaging in a small form factor because the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> does not require a dedicated power source or user interface devices such as a display, a keypad, or even a button. In an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> is packaged in a USB pen-drive form factor. Still further, in an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> consumes little power during operation, and can be configured to sleep when not in service.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of an example a communication system <b>300</b> that includes a host <b>302</b> equipped and an embedded AP <b>304</b>, which may be similar to the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b>. The system <b>300</b> also includes stations <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> equipped with respective transceivers and able to communicate in a Wi-Fi network in which the embedded AP functions as an access point. The embedded AP <b>304</b> and the stations <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> form a BSS <b>310</b>. In this example configuration, the embedded AP <b>304</b> routes data between the stations <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> or, in some cases, between the host <b>302</b> and the station <b>306</b> or <b>308</b>. The topology illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be used to interconnect devices such as laptop computers, personal digital assistants, mobile phones, etc., operating as the stations <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, for example. To continue with this example, the host <b>302</b> is any suitable electronic device such as a mobile phone, a camera, a printer, an audio player, a video player, a personal computer, a laptop computer, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example communication system <b>320</b> in which a camera <b>322</b> uses an embedded AP <b>324</b> to connect to a computer host (e.g., a laptop computer) <b>326</b>. The computer host <b>326</b> in this example is configured to operate as a station, and the embedded AP <b>324</b> operates as an access point so that the computer host <b>326</b> and the embedded AP <b>324</b> form a BSS. Once the communication link is established, the camera <b>322</b> can transfer picture files and other data to the computer host <b>326</b> or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an example communication system <b>350</b> that includes a printer <b>352</b> with an embedded AP <b>353</b> that operates as a station in a BSS <b>354</b> and as an AP a BSS <b>356</b>. For example, a wireless router <b>360</b> serves as an AP to the printer <b>352</b> as well as one or several computers (not shown). In an example, the wireless router <b>360</b> is located in a home or business and a portable computer <b>362</b> (or a camera or some other suitable electronic device) belongs to a guest who wishes to send a document to the printer <b>352</b>. Rather than configuring the portable computer <b>362</b> with the information necessary for connecting to the BSS <b>354</b> (e.g., network name, security key), the embedded AP <b>353</b> can accept guest stations into the BSS <b>356</b> and allow guests to use the printing functionality of the printer <b>352</b> without allowing the guests to access any other portion of the home network. It is also noted that when a guest wishes to send a file to the printer <b>352</b> from a portable camera, for example, configuring the portable camera to participate in the home network is even more difficult, thus making the dual BSS mode of operation of the embedded AP <b>353</b> even more preferable. As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a component such as the dual BSS mode controller <b>228</b> can control access to the primary device (i.e., the printer <b>352</b>) from each BSS, store network identifiers of the embedded AP <b>353</b> for each BSS, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example communication network <b>400</b> that is used for running a multi-player gaming application, for example. A personal computer <b>402</b> includes an embedded AP <b>404</b> that operates as an AP and supports communication with personal computers <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> operating as stations. According to this network topology, each of the computers <b>402</b>, <b>406</b>, and <b>408</b> originates and receives data packets. In an embodiment, the embedded AP <b>404</b> can route data packets exchanged by the computers <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> via the computer <b>402</b>. In another embodiment, the embedded AP <b>404</b> determines, for each data packet, whether the data packet can be routed directly in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or whether the data packet should be forwarded to the computer <b>402</b>. Generally speaking, gaming devices, mobile phones such as smartphones, laptop computers, or any other Wi-Fi clients can form a BSS having the topology illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Of course, a device can also use an embedded AP such as the embedded AP <b>52</b> or <b>120</b> to operate in multiple modes. For example, a embedded AP laptop computer can operate the embedded AP similar to host <b>302</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for one application, and similar to the personal computer <b>402</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for another application. As another example, a mobile phone can utilize an embedded AP for &#x201c;tethering,&#x201d; i.e., connecting one or several computers to a network such as the Internet, and using the embedded AP as a modem. At other times, the same mobile phone can be used to set up a BSS similar to the BSS <b>310</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>450</b> for configuring a device to operate as a station in a first communication network and as an access point in a second communication network using the embedded AP. An embedded AP such as the embedded AP <b>353</b>, for example, can implement the method <b>450</b> to allow the corresponding host device (e.g., the printer <b>352</b>) to participate in more than one BSS. In an embodiment, the embedded AP includes an AP controller with a dual BSS mode controller that controls the configuration parameters for each BSS and context switching between the BSSs. At block <b>452</b>, a link to a wireless AP is established and the embedded AP obtains network parameters related to a first BSS in which the embedded AP is a station. Next, at block <b>454</b>, a link to another device is established and the embedded AP provides network parameters related to a second BSS to the other device. The embedded AP operates as an AP in the second BSS. Finally, at block <b>456</b>, the embedded AP begins to operate in the dual mode according to any suitable schedule or scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>500</b> to route data units between stations in a WLAN. An embedded AP such as the embedded AP <b>52</b> <b>120</b> can implement the method <b>500</b>. In block <b>502</b>, a data unit is received via the antenna <b>140</b> and the RF module <b>128</b>, for example. The destination of the data unit is determined in block <b>504</b>. If the destination is another station inside the BSS in which the embedded AP operates as an AP, the data unit is forwarded to the target station (block <b>506</b>). Otherwise, if at block <b>504</b> it is determined that the destination is outside the BSS or if the destination is the host, the data unit is forwarded to the host interface such as the AP interface <b>88</b> or the host interface <b>150</b>, for example. As discussed above, the host consumes the data packet if the host is the final destination of the data packet. Alternatively, in those embodiments where the host is connected to another network such as the Internet, the host forwards the data unit to the appropriate infrastructure element if the data unit is not intended for the host (e.g., the base station <b>72</b>).</p>
