<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to archery bows and more specifically to a grip used on archery bows.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An archer holds an archery bow by the grip in one hand, for example the left hand. The other hand is used to draw back the bowstring. As the bowstring is drawn using the right hand, the grip applies a reactive force to the left hand. The force interaction between the hand and the grip can have undesirable effects that impact accuracy of arrow shots. For example, the hand can impart lateral and/or twisting forces to the bow. Various forces between the hand and bow grip can impart undesirable horizontal and/or vertical travel to the rear end of an archer bow at launch. Many prior grip designs include a large, curved shape, for example that matches a curved shape that the hand assumes when holding a bow. Although such designs are comfortable, force interactions that are offset from a center line of the bow/grip can induce undesirable lateral and/or twisting forces.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There remains a need for novel bow and grip designs that minimize undesirable force interactions between the shooter and the bow.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">All US patents and applications and all other published documents mentioned anywhere in this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While this invention may be embodied in many different forms, there are described in detail herein specific embodiments of the invention. This description is an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For the purposes of this disclosure, like reference numerals in the figures shall refer to like features unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment of an archery bow grip <b>10</b> suitable for use with any type of archery bow. The grip <b>10</b> can be attached to an archery bow (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), for example being attached to an archery bow riser using any suitable method of attachment. In some embodiments, the invention comprises an archery bow having a grip <b>10</b> as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, an archery bow is shaped complimentary to the shape of the grip <b>10</b>, such that the grip <b>10</b> is matingly positioned and received by the archery bow.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The grip <b>10</b> can be formed using any suitable process, and can be made from any suitable material. In various embodiments, the grip <b>10</b> comprises one or more polymers, rubbers, wood, metal or any other suitable material, as well as various combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the grip <b>10</b> can be formed by removing material from a larger base material or perform. In some embodiments, the grip <b>10</b> can be molded, cast or the like. In some embodiments, the grip <b>10</b> comprises a single piece of material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, in some embodiments, the grip <b>10</b> comprises a body <b>12</b> comprising a first wall <b>20</b> and an opposed second wall <b>22</b>. The walls <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> define a groove <b>16</b> arranged to receive a portion of an archery bow, such as a riser. The groove <b>16</b> defines a central axis <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In some embodiments, an inner surface <b>30</b> of the first wall <b>20</b> is planar and an inner surface <b>32</b> of the second wall <b>22</b> is planar. In some embodiments the inner surfaces <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> are parallel to one another. In some embodiments the inner surfaces <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> extend parallel to the central axis <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, a cross-sectional shape of the groove <b>16</b> taken orthogonal to the axis <b>18</b> is substantially square or rectangular.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments the inner surfaces <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> are non-parallel to one another. Thus, in some embodiments, a cross-sectional shape of the groove <b>16</b> taken orthogonal to the axis <b>18</b> is trapezoidal. In some embodiments, the inner surfaces <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> can comprise curvature that can be convex and/or concave with respect to the axis <b>18</b>. Embodiments having curved inner wall surfaces <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may be better configured to resiliently engage an archery bow.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The grip <b>10</b> further comprises a connecting wall <b>40</b> that spans between the first wall <b>20</b> and the second wall <b>22</b>. In some embodiment, the connecting wall <b>40</b> comprises an inner surface <b>34</b> that defines the groove <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An outer surface <b>36</b> of the connecting wall <b>40</b> comprises a ridge having a peak <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, the peak <b>42</b> defines a straight line. In some embodiments, the peak <b>42</b> extends parallel to the axis <b>18</b> of the groove <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, the peak <b>42</b> and the central axis <b>18</b> are oriented in a common plane.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The grip <b>10</b> is generally mounted to a bow such that the peak <b>42</b> extends parallel to a central axis of the bow. Desirably, the bowstring of the bow will travel in a plane when the bow is drawn and released, and the peak <b>42</b> is oriented in the plane of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The connecting wall <b>40</b> is generally placed in compression when the grip <b>10</b> is attached to an archery bow and the bow is drawn. An archer's hand will generally abut the outer surface <b>36</b> of the connecting wall <b>40</b> and apply forces to the connecting wall <b>40</b> that are approximately equal to the draw weight of the bow, such as 60 pounds, 70 pounds, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The shape of the connecting wall <b>40</b> (e.g the ridge and peak <b>42</b>) and alignment of the peak <b>42</b> in the bowstring plane helps to prevent lateral forces and moments from being applied to the bow by the hand of the archer that engages the grip <b>10</b>. The reactive forces are desirably concentrated on the peak <b>42</b>, which reduces and relieves forces that would normally be applied to the grip <b>10</b> at locations lateral to the bowstring plane (e.g. on either side of the peak <b>42</b>). Thus, the shape of the ridge and peak <b>42</b> reduce undesirable force transfer and retain force reactions in the plane of the peak <b>42</b>, which is desirably also the plane of bowstring travel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the ridge comprises a first portion <b>46</b> and a second portion <b>48</b> located on opposite sides of the peak <b>42</b>, which meet at the peak <b>42</b>. At least a portion of the first portion <b>46</b> is nonparallel to the second portion <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, the first portion <b>46</b> and the second portion <b>48</b> are mirror images of one another. In some embodiments, a width dimension of the grip that is occupied by the peak <b>42</b> is less than a width dimension of the grip that is occupied by the first portion <b>46</b> or the second portion <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the first portion <b>46</b> and the second portion <b>48</b> are flat, wherein each may comprise a planar surface. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first portion <b>46</b> is oriented at an angle &#x3b8; to the second portion <b>48</b>. In various embodiments, the angle &#x3b8; can be selected as desired, for example ranging from approximately 160 degrees to 90 degrees or less. A higher angle &#x3b8; may result in greater comfort for the shooter. A lower angle &#x3b8; may further reduce undesirable force transfer, and also allow for a shooter to better feel the specific orientation of the grip <b>10</b> in the hand, thus allowing better consistency in hand placement. In some embodiments, the angle &#x3b8; ranges from 140 degrees to 130 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle &#x3b8; is approximately 135 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the first portion <b>46</b> comprises curvature. In some embodiments, the second portion <b>48</b> comprises curvature. In some embodiments, the curvature is convex with respect to the central axis <b>18</b> of the groove <b>16</b>, thus resulting in a sharper peak <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, a slope of the curvature increases closer to the peak <b>42</b>. In various embodiments, the curvature can be arcuate, elliptical, parabolic, etc. When the first and second portions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> comprise curvature, the angle &#x3b8; between the first and second portions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> near the peak <b>42</b> can be any suitable angle greater than zero.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the peak <b>42</b> is configured to be different from the first portion <b>46</b> and second portion <b>48</b> of the connecting wall <b>40</b>. In some embodiment, the peak <b>42</b> comprises a different color than the first portion <b>46</b> and second portion <b>48</b>. In some embodiment, the peak <b>42</b> comprises a different material than the first portion <b>46</b> and second portion <b>48</b>, for example having a different coefficient of friction.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The grip <b>10</b> is desirably configured for either left or right hands. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> depict a right-handed grip, which would be used in a right-handed bow, wherein the right hand grasps the bowstring and the left hand grasps the grip <b>10</b>. The invention also comprises mirror images (e.g. left-handed versions) of the embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, in some embodiments, the second wall <b>22</b> is thin, for example having a thickness dimension of 3/32&#x2033; or less. A portion of the archer's palm will typically abut an outer surface of the second wall <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the outer surface of the second wall <b>22</b> is flat. In some embodiments, the outer surface of the second wall <b>22</b> comprises curvature, for example being concave with respect to the axis <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The archer's finger tips will typically abut an outer surface <b>38</b> of the first wall <b>20</b>. The first wall <b>20</b> can be flat; however, in some embodiments, the first wall <b>20</b> is shaped to allow the fingertips to grasp the grip <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the outer surface <b>38</b> of the first wall <b>20</b> comprises a curved portion <b>21</b>. In some embodiments, the curvature is convex with respect to the axis <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the thickness of the first wall <b>20</b> increases as it extends away from the connecting wall <b>40</b>. Thus, the first wall <b>20</b> can have a thickness similar to the second wall <b>22</b> near the connecting wall <b>40</b> and can flare to a larger thickness as the distance from the connecting wall <b>40</b> increases. The flaring is most visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the first wall <b>20</b>, second wall <b>22</b> and connecting wall <b>40</b> can each flare outwardly near the top of the grip <b>10</b>, forming a flange <b>54</b>. The flange <b>54</b> is shaped to comfortably abut portions of the thumb, index finger and web between the thumb and index finger of an archer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show an embodiment of an archery bow <b>60</b> comprising a grip <b>10</b> as disclosed herein. The bow <b>60</b> comprises a riser <b>66</b>, opposed limbs <b>62</b> and a bowstring <b>70</b>. The grip <b>10</b> is attached to the riser <b>66</b>, wherein the connecting wall <b>40</b> (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is oriented between the riser <b>66</b> and the bowstring <b>70</b>. As illustrated, the bow <b>60</b> comprises a compound bow having rotatable members <b>64</b>, wherein at least one rotatable member comprises a cam. Other examples of bows are disclosed, for example, in US 2010-0089375 and US 2008-0127961, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In theory, the bow <b>60</b> defines a plane <b>72</b>, and the bowstring <b>70</b> moves in this plane <b>72</b> when the bowstring <b>70</b> is drawn and/or released. Many parts of the bow <b>60</b> are centered on the plane <b>72</b>. The grip <b>10</b> is arranged on the riser <b>66</b> such that the peak <b>42</b> is in the plane <b>72</b>.</p>
