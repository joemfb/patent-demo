<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methods enabling parallel processing of hash functions are provided. A data string including a plurality of pieces arranged in an order is hashed using a hash function to determine a plurality of authentication checkpoint hashes associated with the pieces. To authenticate the data string, the pieces are grouped into sets, and the authentication checkpoint hash associated with the piece following all other pieces of that set in the order is associated with that set. The system simultaneously performs a separate hash process on each set. That is, the system hashes the pieces of that set using the hash function to determine a result hash, and compares that result hash with the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set. The initial input to the hash function for the hash process for each set includes one of the pieces and either a default seed or an authentication checkpoint hash.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In today's digital age, an enormous amount of information, such as executable program code, documents, bank statements, insurance information, and the like, is stored as data on a variety of computing devices, such as servers, personal computers, tablet computing devices, and smart phones. The nature of such digitally-stored data renders it especially susceptible to unauthorized modification that is extremely difficult to detect with the naked eye. For example, an individual could change a few words in a few lines of a one hundred page contract to render that contract more favorable to that individual. In another example, an individual could insert a few lines of code into a program code including tens or hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code. When that program code is executed, the additional lines of code cause one or more functions of the executed program to operate differently than intended. In one instance in which the program code is stored on and executable by an electronic gaming machine (EGM) to operate a wagering game, such as a video slot game, such unauthorized modifications could provide the individual with an advantage in the video slot game that no other player would receive. Such examples outline the necessity to authenticate certain data strings, such as confidential documents and program code, stored on a computing device to ensure that such data strings have not been modified in an unauthorized manner. For instance, prior to executing a program code stored on an EGM, the EGM authenticates the stored program code to determine whether it has been modified in an unauthorized manner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While there are many ways to authenticate a data string, the use of a one-way hash function (referred to herein as a &#x201c;hash function&#x201d;) to determine whether a copy of a data string has been modified relative to the original data string (i.e., to authenticate the copy of the data string) is commonplace. Generally, a hash function is a function (such as a mathematical function) that converts a variable-length input string into a different, static-length output string commonly referred to as a result hash. Put differently, the input string is hashed using the hash function (i.e., input into the hash function) to obtain the result hash. Both the input string and the output string typically include letters, numbers, and/or other characters. For a given input string and a given hash function, when that input string is hashed using that hash function, the same result hash is always obtained. A hash function is referred to as a &#x201c;one-way&#x201d; hash function because it is relatively easy to use the hash function to obtain a result hash for a given input string (i.e., by hashing the input string using the hash function), but it is extremely difficult and, in certain instances, computationally infeasible, to obtain an input string for a given result hash. In other words, given an input string, it is easy to use the hash function to obtain the corresponding output string, but given an output string, it is nearly impossible to use the hash function to obtain the corresponding input string. Certain hash functions are collision resistant. For such a hash function, it is extremely difficult and, in certain instances, computationally infeasible, to determine two different input strings that, when hashed using the hash function (i.e., when input into the hash function), result in a same result hash. Thus, in such collision-resistant hash functions, each input string is associated with a unique corresponding result hash.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the same result hash is always obtained when a given input string is hashed using a given hash function, hash functions can be used to authenticate a copy of a data string by determining whether a result hash obtained from hashing the original data string is the same as a result hash obtained from hashing the copy of the data string. More specifically, a hash function is typically used to authenticate a copy of a data string in the following manner: (a) the original data string is hashed (such as at a first point in time) using a hash function to obtain a first result hash, (b) the copy of the data string is hashed (such as at a second subsequent point in time) using the same hash function to obtain a second result hash, and (c) the first result hash and the second result hash are compared to determine whether the first result hash and the second result hash are the same. If the first result hash and the second result hash are the same, the original data string and the copy of the data string are the same, and the copy of the data string is, therefore, authentic (i.e., has not been modified relative to the original data string). If the first result hash and the second result hash are different, the data string and the copy of the data string are not the same, and the copy of the data string is, therefore, not authentic (i.e., has been modified relative to the original data string).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example, Joe creates a document that Joe intends to email to Eileen. Before emailing a copy of the document to Eileen, Joe instructs his computer to hash the document (which is the input string in this example) using a hash function to obtain a first result hash. Joe emails a copy of the document and the first result hash to Eileen. After receiving the copy of the document and the first result hash, Eileen instructs her computer to hash the copy of the document using the same hash function to obtain a second result hash. Eileen compares the first result hash with the second result hash. If the two result hashes are the same, Eileen knows that the copy of the document is the same as the document Joe created. If the two result hashes are different, Eileen knows that the copy of the document is not the same as the document Joe created.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, Dan creates a document and saves the document on the hard drive of his computer. Dan is going on vacation, and wants to be sure that the document is not altered by his roommate Joey while he is away. Dan instructs his computer to hash the document (which is the input string in this example) using a hash function to obtain a first result hash, and stores the first result hash in a secure location. After returning from vacation, Dan again instructs his computer to hash the document using the same hash function to obtain a second result hash. Dan compares the first result hash with the second result hash. If the two result hashes are the same, Dan knows that the document was not altered since he first hashed the document. If the two result hashes are different, Dan knows that the document was altered since he first hashed the document.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In most instances, a data string is too large to be hashed at once. In such instances, the data string is typically divided into a plurality of data string pieces arranged in a designated order, and those data string pieces are sequentially hashed in the designated order. In these instances, a first data string piece in the designated order and a default seed are hashed using a hash function (i.e., are input into the hash function) to obtain a first result hash. For each subsequent data string piece in the designated order: (a) that data string piece, and (b) the result hash obtained from hashing the data string piece immediately preceding that data string piece in the designated order are hashed using the hash function (i.e., are input into the hash function) to obtain a result hash. Thus, it should be appreciated that in these instances the Nth data string piece cannot be hashed until the N-1th data string piece has been hashed because the result hash obtained from hashing the N-1th data string piece is used as one of the inputs to the hash function when the Nth data string piece is hashed. When each data string piece has been hashed, the final result hash represents the result of the entire data string being hashed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The quantity of data string pieces into which the data string is divided is typically determined based on the hash function used to hash the data string. That is, certain hash functions only operate on data string pieces of a specific size. For example, an MD5 hash hashes 128 bit data string pieces. Thus, in this example, the data string is divided into a plurality of 128 bit data string pieces, and then those pieces are hashed using the MD5 hash in the manner described above. Specifically, in this example, the quantity of data string pieces is equal to the size of the data string, in bytes, divided by sixteen and rounded up.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example hash of a program code (i.e., a data string) too large to be hashed at once. In this example, the program code is divided into the following four pieces to be hashed using a hash function <b>105</b> in the following designated order: a first piece of the program code <b>120</b>, a second piece of the program code <b>220</b>, a third piece of the program code <b>320</b>, and a fourth piece of the program code <b>420</b>. First piece of the program code <b>120</b> and a default seed <b>110</b> are first hashed using hash function <b>105</b> to obtain a first result hash <b>130</b>. That is, first piece of the program code <b>120</b> and default seed <b>110</b> are input into hash function <b>105</b>, and first result hash <b>130</b> is obtained as the output of hash function <b>105</b>. Next, second piece of the program code <b>220</b> and first result hash <b>130</b> (i.e., the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code immediately preceding second piece of the program code <b>220</b> in the designated order) are hashed using hash function <b>105</b> to obtain a second result hash <b>230</b>. That is, second piece of the program code <b>220</b> and first result hash <b>130</b> are input into hash function <b>105</b>, and second result hash <b>230</b> is obtained as the output of hash function <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Next, third piece of the program code <b>320</b> and second result hash <b>230</b> (i.e., the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code immediately preceding third piece of the program code <b>320</b> in the designated order) are hashed using hash function <b>105</b> to obtain a third result hash <b>330</b>. That is, third piece of the program code <b>320</b> and second result hash <b>230</b> are input into hash function <b>105</b>, and third result hash <b>330</b> is obtained as an output of hash function <b>105</b>. Next, fourth piece of the program code <b>420</b> and third result hash <b>330</b> (i.e., the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code immediately preceding fourth piece of the program code <b>420</b> in the designated order) are hashed using hash function <b>105</b> to obtain a final result hash <b>430</b>. That is, fourth piece of the program code <b>420</b> and third result hash <b>330</b> are input into hash function <b>105</b>, and fourth result hash <b>430</b> is obtained as an output of hash function <b>105</b>. Since fourth piece of the program code <b>420</b> is the piece of the program code that follows all other pieces of the program code in the designated order, the result hash obtained from hashing fourth piece of the program code <b>420</b> is the final result hash. It should be appreciated from the above example that this process of hashing a plurality of pieces of a data string (a plurality of pieces of a program code in the above example) is inherently sequential.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Hash functions are commonly used to authenticate a copy of a program code stored on a computing device before executing the copy of the program code. Put differently, hash functions are commonly used to ensure that a copy of a program code to be executed by a computing device is the same as the original program code. For example, a program code representing a video poker game to be operated by an EGM is created by a group of programmers at a first point in time. Before a copy of the program code is stored on the EGM, the program code is hashed using a hash function to obtain a result hash called an authentication final result hash. The authentication final result hash is encrypted and stored in association with a copy of the program code on the EGM. For instance, the copy of the program code and the encrypted authentication final result hash are sent to the EGM by a server through a data network and are stored on a memory device of the EGM. When the EGM receives an instruction to execute the copy of the program code, such as upon EGM startup, the EGM authenticates the copy of the program code before executing the copy of the program code. Specifically, the EGM authenticates the copy of the program code by: (a) hashing the copy of the program code stored on the EGM using the hash function (i.e., the same hash function used to obtain the authentication final result hash) to obtain a final result hash; (b) decrypting the authentication final result hash stored in association with the copy of the program code; and (c) comparing the authentication final result hash with the final result hash. If the authentication final result hash and the final result hash are the same, the EGM determines that the copy of the program code stored on the EGM is authentic (i.e., is the same as the program code hashed to obtain the authentication final result hash) and executes the copy of the program code. If the authentication final result hash and the final result hash are not the same, the EGM determines that the copy of the program code stored on the EGM is not authentic (i.e., is not the same as the program code hashed to obtain the authentication final result hash) and does not execute the copy of the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, in most cases a data string to be hashed is too large to hash at once, so the data string is divided into pieces and sequentially hashed in a designated order to obtain a final result hash. The final result hash is, in turn, compared to an authentication final result hash to authenticate the data string. More specifically, for each data string piece following the first data string piece (if any) in the designated order, that data string piece is hashed with the result hash obtained from hashing the immediately preceding data sting piece in the designated order to obtain a result hash, which is subsequently used as an input to the hash of the subsequent data string piece in the designated order. That is, for each data string piece following the first data string piece in the designated order, that data string piece cannot be hashed until the immediately preceding data string piece in the designated order has been hashed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As the size of the data string to be authenticated using the hash function increases, the quantity of data string pieces that must be individually hashed increases. Since such hashing must be performed sequentially on each data string piece, as the size of the data string increases the time it takes to hash the data string pieces also increases. For example, it takes a typical EGM up to 30 seconds to hash and authenticate a single program code in such a manner. It also takes this typical EGM additional time to hash and authenticate other data, such as paytable data, sound data, image data, textual data, and video data. On EGMs including multiple program codes (e.g., EGMs configured to operate multiple games), this amount of time is increased by a multiple that is equal to the quantity of program codes. For example, an EGM including ten program codes to be authenticated takes over 300 seconds to hash and authenticate the program codes.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This relatively long authentication period increases the time it takes the EGM to initialize and, therefore, directly decreases the amount of time the EGM is available to be played by players and directly increases the amount of time casino (or other gaming establishment) personnel must supervise the EGM initialization process to ensure there are no problems. Further, since such authentication only determines whether a single final result hash is the same as a single authentication final result hash, there is no way for casino personnel to pinpoint where an unauthorized modification lies when authentication fails. There is, therefore, a continuing need to provide systems and methods that speed the authentication process by simultaneously hashing multiple pieces of a data string using a hash function, and to provide systems and methods that enable unauthorized modifications in data strings to be pinpointed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods enabling parallel processing of hash functions using authentication checkpoint hashes. Generally, the system of the present disclosure is configured to authenticate a stored data string divided into a plurality of data string pieces by employing stored authentication checkpoint hashes to simultaneously hash a plurality of sets of the data string pieces. More specifically, in various embodiments, the system of the present disclosure is configured to authenticate a copy of a program code stored on an EGM and divided into a plurality of program code pieces by employing stored authentication checkpoint hashes to simultaneously hash a plurality of sets of the program code pieces to substantially decrease the time it takes the EGM to authenticate the copy of the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">At a first point in time, a processor hashes a data string divided into a plurality of data string pieces arranged in a designated order using a designated hash function to determine a plurality of authentication checkpoint hashes associated with the data string pieces. More specifically, a first data string piece in the designated order and a default seed are hashed using the designated hash function to obtain a first result hash, which is stored in association with the first data string piece as a first authentication checkpoint hash. For each subsequent data string piece in the designated order: (a) that data string piece, and (b) the result hash obtained from hashing the data string piece immediately preceding that data string piece in the designated order are hashed using the designated hash function to obtain a result hash, which is stored in association with that data string piece as an authentication checkpoint hash.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In various embodiments, the system of the present disclosure authenticates the data string at a second subsequent point in time by simultaneously hashing each of a plurality of sets of the data string pieces using the designated hash function and the authentication checkpoint hashes. It should be appreciated that, in certain embodiments, the system includes the processor used to determine the authentication checkpoint hashes, while in other embodiments the system does not include the processor used to determine the authentication checkpoint hashes. The system groups the data string pieces into a plurality of sets. Each of the sets includes at least one of the data string pieces. For each set, the system associates the authentication checkpoint hash associated with the data string piece following all other data string pieces of that set, if any, in the designated order with that set. The system simultaneously or substantially simultaneously performs a separate hash process on each set using the designated hash function. More specifically, for each set, the system hashes the data string pieces of that set using the designated hash function to determine a result hash, and compares that result hash with the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set to determine whether the data string pieces of that set are authentic. For each set, the initial input to the designated hash function for the hash process for that set includes: (a) one of the data string pieces, and (b) either the default seed (if that set includes the first data string piece in the designated order) or one of the authentication checkpoint hashes (if that set does not include the first data string piece in the designated order). Since the data string pieces, the default seed, and the authentication checkpoint hashes are all stored by the system at the second subsequent point in time, the initial inputs to the designated hash function for the hash process of each set are known values. Thus, each hash process for each set may be performed simultaneously or substantially simultaneously because the hash processes require no initial inputs that are based on any result hashes obtained from any other hash processes of any other sets.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should thus be appreciated that the system of the present disclosure enables data strings including large quantities of data string pieces to be authenticated by employing authentication checkpoint hashes to simultaneously hash multiple sets of the data string pieces. When applied to the authentication of a program code stored on an EGM, such simultaneous hashing causes the program code to be executed more quickly, which reduces loading or down time and increases the amount of time the EGM is available to be played by players.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Enabling Parallel Processing of Hash Functions Using Authentication Checkpoint Hashes</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods enabling parallel processing of hash functions using authentication checkpoint hashes. Generally, the system of the present disclosure is configured to authenticate a stored data string divided into a plurality of data string pieces by employing stored authentication checkpoint hashes to simultaneously hash a plurality of sets of the data string pieces. It should be appreciated that the present disclosure may be employed with any suitable data string, such as (but not limited to): (a) data strings representing executable program code; (b) data strings representing graphical elements such as images or videos; (c) data strings representing audio elements such as sound effects or music; (d) data strings representing paytable elements for a game; data strings representing textual elements; and (e) data strings representing any other suitable data. While the present disclosure may be employed with any suitable data string, in the embodiments and examples of the present disclosure described below the data string is an executable program code.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The program code is divided into a plurality of pieces that are arranged in a designated order. In various embodiments, before a system of the present disclosure can authenticate the program code, an authentication checkpoint hash must be determined for each piece of the program code by hashing the program code in the manner generally described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More particularly, for each piece of the program code, the result hash obtained as a result of that piece of the program code and either: (a) the default seed, or (b) the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code immediately preceding that piece of the program code in the designated order being hashed is stored as the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that piece of the program code. The authentication checkpoint hash associated with the piece of the program code following all other pieces of the program code in the designated order is referred to herein as an authentication final result hash.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example, a program code includes three pieces arranged in the following designated order: a first piece of the program code, a second piece of the program code, and a third piece of the program code. In this example, the first piece of the program code is associated with a first authentication checkpoint hash (which is the same as the result hash obtained from hashing the first piece of the program code and the default seed), the second piece of the program code is associated with a second authentication checkpoint hash (which is the same as the result hash obtained from hashing the second piece of the program code with the result hash obtained from hashing the first piece of the program code), and the third piece of the program code is associated with a third authentication checkpoint hash (which is the same as the result hash obtained from hashing the third piece of the program code with the result hash obtained from hashing the second piece of the program code). The third authentication checkpoint hash is the authentication final result hash because the third piece of the program code is the piece of the program code following all other pieces of the program code in the designated order.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be appreciated that, in certain embodiments, the system of the present disclosure determines the authentication checkpoint hashes, while in other embodiments the system of the present disclosure does not determine the authentication checkpoint hashes.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After an authentication checkpoint hash has been determined for each piece of the program code, the system groups the pieces of the program code into at least two sets of at least one of the pieces of the program code according to the designated order. That is, each of the sets includes one or a plurality of the pieces of the program code and, if the set includes a plurality of the pieces of the program code, those pieces of the program code of the set are arranged according to the designated order. It should be appreciated that any suitable quantity of sets may be employed, and that each set may include any suitable quantity of pieces of the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The quantity of sets is determined at the time the data string is initially hashed. In certain embodiments, the quantity of sets is determined based on processor power or based on the number of processors of the system. In one example in which the system includes two processors, the quantity of sets is two (i.e., equal to the number of processors). In another example in which the system includes four processors, the quantity of sets is four (i.e., equal to the number of processors). It should be appreciated that the quantity of sets to be employed may be determined in any other suitable manner and based on any other suitable factors.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Continuing with the above example, the system determines a first set of the pieces of the program code including the first piece of the program code and a second set of the pieces of the program code including the second and third pieces of the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments, the system associates one of the authentication checkpoint hashes with each of the sets. More specifically, for each of the sets: (a) if that set includes the piece of the program code following all other pieces of the program code in the designated order, the system associates the authentication final result hash with that set; and (b) if that set does not include the piece of the program code following all other pieces of the program code in the designated order, the system associates the authentication checkpoint hash associated with the piece of the program code following all other pieces of the program code of the set, if any, in the designated order with that set.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Continuing with the above example, the system associates: (a) the first set with the first authentication checkpoint hash because the only piece of the program code included in the first set is the first piece of the program code, which is associated with the first authentication checkpoint hash; and (b) the second set with the authentication final result hash because the second set includes the piece of the program code that follows all other pieces of the program code in the designated order (i.e., includes the third piece of the program code).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After associating one of the authentication checkpoint hashes with each of the sets, in various embodiments, to authenticate the program code the system simultaneously or substantially simultaneously performs a separate hash process on each set using the designated hash function. More specifically, for each set, the system hashes the pieces of the program code of that set using the hash function to determine a result hash, and compares that result hash with the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set to determine whether the pieces of the program code of that set are authentic. For each set, the initial input to the designated hash function for the hash process for that set includes: (a) one of the pieces of the program code, and (b) either a default seed or one of the authentication checkpoint hashes. It should be appreciated that since: (a) the pieces of the program code, (b) the default seed, and (c) the authentication checkpoint hashes are stored by the system, the initial inputs to the designated hash function for each of the hash processes are known values. That is, each hash process for each set may be performed simultaneously because the hash processes require no initial inputs that are based on any result hashes obtained from any other hash processes of any other sets.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Continuing with the above example, the system: (a) hashes the first piece of the program code of the first set using the designated hash function to obtain a result hash and compares that result hash to the first authentication checkpoint hash; and simultaneously (b) hashes the second and third pieces of the program code of the second set using the designated hash function to obtain a result hash and compares that result hash to the authentication final result hash. Further, in this example, the initial input to the hash process of the first set includes: (a) the first piece of the program code, and (b) the default seed, each of which are known values, and the initial input to the hash process of the second set includes: (a) the second piece of the program code, and (b) the first authentication checkpoint hash, each of which are known values.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">More specifically, for the set that includes the piece of the program code that precedes all other pieces of the program code in the designated order, the system: (a) uses the designated hash function to hash: (i) the piece of the program code that precedes all other pieces of the program code in the designated order, and (ii) a default seed to obtain a result hash; (b) for each of any remaining pieces of the program code of that set, uses the designated hash function to hash: (i) that piece of the program code, and (ii) the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code immediately preceding that piece of the program code in the designated order to obtain a result hash; and (c) determines whether the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code of that set that follows all other pieces of the program code of that set, if any, in the designated order is the same as the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set. If the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code of that set that follows all other pieces of the program code of that set, if any, in the designated order is the same as the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set, the system authenticates the piece(s) of the program code of that set. If not, the system does not authenticate the piece(s) of the program code of that set.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Continuing with the above example, the first set includes the piece of the program code that precedes all other pieces of the program code in the designated order (i.e., the first piece of the program code). Accordingly, the system: hashes the first piece of the program code and the default seed using the designated hash function to obtain a first result hash, and compares the first result hash to the first authentication checkpoint hash. If the first result hash and the first authentication checkpoint hash are the same, the first piece of the program code is authentic. If the first result hash and the first authentication checkpoint hash are different, the first piece of the program code is not authentic.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For each remaining set, the system: (a) uses the designated hash function to hash: (i) the piece of the program code of that set that precedes all other pieces of the program code of that set, if any, in the designated order; and (ii) the authentication checkpoint hash associated with the set including the piece of the program code immediately preceding that piece of the program code in the designated order to obtain a result hash; (b) for each of any remaining pieces of the program code of that set, uses the designated hash function to hash: (i) that piece of the program code; and (ii) the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code immediately preceding that piece of the program code in the designated order to obtain a result hash; and (c) determines whether the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code of that set that follows all other pieces of the program code of that set, if any, in the designated order is the same as the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set. For each remaining set, if the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code of that set that follows all other pieces of the program code of that set, if any, in the designated order is the same as the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set, the system authenticates the piece(s) of the program code of that set. If not, the system does not authenticate the piece(s) of the program code of that set.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Continuing with the above example, the system: (a) hashes the first authentication checkpoint hash and the second piece of the program code using the designated hash function to obtain a second result hash, (b) hashes the second result hash and the third piece of the program code to obtain a third result hash, and (c) compares the third result hash with the authentication final result hash. If the third result hash and the authentication final result hash are the same, the second and third pieces of the program code are authentic. If the third result hash and the authentication final result hash are different, the second and third pieces of the program code are not authentic.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be appreciated that the system may simultaneously perform such hashing processes in any suitable manner. In certain embodiments in which the system includes a quantity of processors that is greater than or equal to a quantity of the sets, the system assigns each of the hashing processes to a different one of the processors to perform. In other embodiments in which the system includes a quantity of processors that is less than a quantity of the sets, the system assigns each of the processors a certain number of the hashing processes to perform. For example, in a system including two processors and four hashing processes to perform, the system assigns two of the hashing processes to each of the processors to perform. In further embodiments, the system dynamically assigns hashing processes to the processors. In such embodiments, the system initially assigns each processor one or more hash processes to perform. The system subsequently assigns at least one hash process that has not been performed to whichever processor is the first to complete that processor's assigned hash processes. For example, in a system including two processors and three hash processes to perform, the system initially assigns each of the processors one of the hash processes to perform. The system subsequently assigns the remaining hash process to whichever processor finishes performing that processor's assigned hash process first. In other embodiments, the system takes advantage of hyperthreading to enable one or more processors to each act as a plurality of processors.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various embodiments, for each set, when the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code of that set that follows all other pieces of the program code of that set, if any, in the designated order is not the same as the authentication checkpoint hash associated with that set, the system generates an error message and, in certain embodiments, stores the error message, displays the error message, and/or transmits the error message to a third party. It should thus be appreciated that, in such embodiments, the system identifies which of the sets includes the piece or pieces of the program code that are not authentic.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As generally explained above, hash functions are commonly used to authenticate a copy of a program code before executing the copy of the program code. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref> below are block diagrams illustrating how example systems of the present disclosure employ authentication checkpoint hashes to simultaneously hash a plurality of sets of one or more pieces of a copy of a program code stored in an EGM. In this example, a program code representing a video slot game to be operated by an EGM is created by a group of programmers at a first point in time. Before a copy of the program code is stored on the EGM, the program code is divided into a plurality of pieces and hashed using a designated hash function to obtain a plurality of authentication checkpoint hashes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating this initial hash of the program code, which is used to determine the authentication checkpoint hash associated with each piece of the program code. In this example, the program code is divided into the following four pieces to be hashed using hash function <b>1105</b> in the following designated order: a first piece of the program code <b>1120</b>, a second piece of the program code <b>1220</b>, a third piece of the program code <b>1320</b>, and a fourth piece of the program code <b>1420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">First piece of the program code <b>1120</b> and a default seed <b>1110</b> are first hashed using hash function <b>1105</b> to obtain a first result hash <b>1130</b>.

First result hash <b>1130</b> is stored in association with first piece of the program code <b>1120</b> as first authentication checkpoint hash <b>1140</b>. Next, second piece of the program code <b>1220</b> and first result hash <b>1130</b> (i.e., the result hash obtained from hashing the piece of the program code immediately preceding second piece of the program code <b>1220</b> in the designated order) are hashed using hash function <b>1105</b> to obtain a second result hash <b>1230</b>.

Fourth result hash <b>1430</b> is stored in association with fourth piece of the program code <b>1420</b> as an authentication final result hash <b>1440</b> because fourth piece of the program code <b>1420</b> is the piece of the program code that follows all other pieces of the program code in the designated order.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The authentication checkpoint hashes are encrypted and stored in association with the copy of the program code on the EGM. For instance, the copy of the program code and the encrypted authentication checkpoint hashes are sent to the EGM by a server through a data network and are stored on a memory device of the EGM. When the EGM receives an instruction to initialize the copy of the program code, such as upon EGM startup, the EGM authenticates the copy of the program code before executing the copy of the program code by employing the authentication checkpoint hashes to simultaneously hash each of a plurality of sets of one or more of the pieces of the program code. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref> (described below) illustrate different examples of the copy of the program code being authenticated via parallel processing of hash functions employing authentication checkpoint hashes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating one example of how the copy of the program code is authenticated via parallel processing of hash functions employing authentication checkpoint hashes. More specifically, in this example, two sets each including two pieces of the copy of the program code are hashed simultaneously. The copy of the program code in this example is divided into the following four pieces arranged in the following designated order: first piece of the copy of the program code <b>1120</b>, second piece of the copy of the program code <b>1220</b>, third piece of the copy of the program code <b>1320</b>, and fourth piece of the copy of the program code <b>1420</b>. In this example, the pieces of the copy of the program code are grouped into the following two sets: (a) a first set includes first piece of the copy of the program code <b>1120</b> and second piece of the copy of the program code <b>1220</b>, and (b) a second set includes third piece of the copy of the program code <b>1320</b> and fourth piece of the copy of the program code <b>1420</b>. The system associates second authentication checkpoint hash <b>1240</b> (i.e., the authentication checkpoint hash associated with the piece of the copy of the program code following all other pieces of the copy of the program code of the first set in the designated order) with the first set, and associates authentication final result hash <b>1440</b> with the second set because the second set includes the piece of the copy of the program code following all other pieces of the copy of the program code in the designated order.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this example, a first processor of the system performs a first hash process <b>100</b> (described below) on the first set and a second processor of the system simultaneously performs a second hash process <b>200</b> (described below) on the second set.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In certain embodiments, the system employs a ways to win award determination. In these embodiments, any outcome to be provided is determined based on a number of associated symbols that are generated in active symbol display areas on the requisite number of adjacent reels (i.e., not on paylines passing through any displayed winning symbol combinations). If a winning symbol combination is generated on the reels, one award for that occurrence of the generated winning symbol combination is provided. At least U.S. Pat. No. 8,012,011 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0108408 and 2008/0132320 describe various examples of ways to win award determinations.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In various embodiments, the system includes a progressive award. Typically, a progressive award includes an initial amount and an additional amount funded through a portion of each wager placed to initiate a play of a primary game. When one or more triggering events occurs, the system provides at least a portion of the progressive award. After the system provides the progressive award, an amount of the progressive award is reset to the initial amount and a portion of each subsequent wager is allocated to the next progressive award. At least U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,766,079; 7,585,223; 7,651,392; 7,666,093; 7,780,523; and 7,905,778 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0020846, 2009/0123364, 2009/0123363, and 2010/0227677 describe various examples of different progressive systems.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As generally noted above, in addition to providing winning credits or other awards for one or more plays of the primary game(s), in various embodiments the system provides credits or other awards for one or more plays of one or more secondary games. The secondary game typically enables a prize or payout in to be obtained addition to any prize or payout obtained through play of the primary game(s). The secondary game(s) typically produces a higher level of player excitement than the primary game(s) because the secondary game(s) provides a greater expectation of winning than the primary game(s) and is accompanied with more attractive or unusual features than the primary game(s). It should be appreciated that the secondary game(s) may be any type of suitable game, either similar to or completely different from the primary game.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In various embodiments, the system automatically provides or initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of a triggering event or the satisfaction of a qualifying condition. In other embodiments, the system initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of the triggering event or the satisfaction of the qualifying condition and upon receipt of an initiation input. In certain embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition is a selected outcome in the primary game(s) or a particular arrangement of one or more indicia on a display device for a play of the primary game(s), such as a &#x201c;BONUS&#x201d; symbol appearing on three adjacent reels along a payline following a spin of the reels for a play of the primary game. In other embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition occurs based on a certain amount of game play (such as number of games, number of credits, amount of time) being exceeded, or based on a specified number of points being earned during game play. It should be appreciated that any suitable triggering event or qualifying condition or any suitable combination of a plurality of different triggering events or qualifying conditions may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In other embodiments, at least one processor of the system randomly determines when to provide one or more plays of one or more secondary games. In one such embodiment, no apparent reason is provided for the providing of the secondary game. In this embodiment, qualifying for a secondary game is not triggered by the occurrence of an event in any primary game or based specifically on any of the plays of any primary game. That is, qualification is provided without any explanation or, alternatively, with a simple explanation. In another such embodiment, the system determines qualification for a secondary game at least partially based on a game triggered or symbol triggered event, such as at least partially based on play of a primary game.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In various embodiments, after qualification for a secondary game has been determined, the secondary game participation may be enhanced through continued play on the primary game. Thus, in certain embodiments, for each secondary game qualifying event, such as a secondary game symbol, that is obtained, a given number of secondary game wagering points or credits is accumulated in a &#x201c;secondary game meter&#x201d; configured to accrue the secondary game wagering credits or entries toward eventual participation in the secondary game. In one such embodiment, the occurrence of multiple such secondary game qualifying events in the primary game results in an arithmetic or exponential increase in the number of secondary game wagering credits awarded. In another such embodiment, any extra secondary game wagering credits may be redeemed during the secondary game to extend play of the secondary game.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In certain embodiments, no separate entry fee or buy-in for the secondary game is required. That is, entry into the secondary game cannot be purchased; rather, in these embodiments entry must be won or earned through play of the primary game, thereby encouraging play of the primary game. In other embodiments, qualification for the secondary game is accomplished through a simple &#x201c;buy-in.&#x201d; For example, qualification through other specified activities is unsuccessful, payment of a fee or placement of an additional wager &#x201c;buys-in&#x201d; to the secondary game. In certain embodiments, a separate side wager must be placed on the secondary game or a wager of a designated amount must be placed on the primary game to enable qualification for the secondary game. In these embodiments, the secondary game triggering event must occur and the side wager (or designated primary game wager amount) must have been placed for the secondary game to trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In various embodiments in which the system includes a plurality of EGMs, the EGMs are configured to communicate with one another to provide a group gaming environment. In certain such embodiments, the EGMs enable players of those EGMs to work in conjunction with one another, such as by enabling the players to play together as a team or group, to win one or more awards. In other such embodiments, the EGMs enable players of those EGMs to compete against one another for one or more awards. In one such embodiment, the EGMs enable the players of those EGMs to participate in one or more gaming tournaments for one or more awards. At least U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2007/0123341, 2008/0070680, 2008/0176650, and 2009/0124363 describe various examples of different group systems.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In various embodiments, the system includes one or more player tracking systems. Such player tracking systems enable operators of the system (such as casinos or other gaming establishments) to recognize the value of customer loyalty by identifying frequent customers and rewarding them for their patronage. Such a player tracking system is configured to track a player's gaming activity. In one such embodiment, the player tracking system does so through the use of player tracking cards. In this embodiment, a player is issued a player identification card that has an encoded player identification number that uniquely identifies the player. When the player's playing tracking card is inserted into a card reader of the system to begin a gaming session, the card reader reads the player identification number off the player tracking card to identify the player. The system timely tracks any suitable information or data relating to the identified player's gaming session. The system also timely tracks when the player tracking card is removed to conclude play for that gaming session. In another embodiment, rather than requiring insertion of a player tracking card into the card reader, the system utilizes one or more portable devices, such as a cell phone, a radio frequency identification tag, or any other suitable wireless device, to track when a gaming session begins and ends. In another embodiment, the system utilizes any suitable biometric technology or ticket technology to track when a gaming session begins and ends.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In such embodiments, during one or more gaming sessions, the system tracks any suitable information or data, such as any amounts wagered, average wager amounts, and/or the time at which these wagers are placed. In different embodiments, for one or more players, the player tracking system includes the player's account number, the player's card number, the player's first name, the player's surname, the player's preferred name, the player's player tracking ranking, any promotion status associated with the player's player tracking card, the player's address, the player's birthday, the player's anniversary, the player's recent gaming sessions, or any other suitable data. In various embodiments, such tracked information and/or any suitable feature associated with the player tracking system is displayed on a player tracking display. In various embodiments, such tracked information and/or any suitable feature associated with the player tracking system is displayed via one or more service windows that are displayed on the central display device and/or the upper display device. At least U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,722,985; 6,908,387; 7,311,605; 7,611,411; 7,617,151; and 8,057,298 describe various examples of player tracking systems.</p>

Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p>
