<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an array-type-transducer-based high-power ultrasound delivery system and, more particularly, to an array-type macromolecule delivery system based on high-power ultrasound and microbubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The technical development and applications of high-power ultrasound in the medical equipment industry, among others, have reached a highly mature stage. Ultrasound transducers and emission control systems are also well-known and mature technologies. As the biomedical effects of ultrasound in medical applications are correlated to the initial mode, acoustic power, and emission duration of the ultrasound employed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set up regulations in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, when ultrasound is applied to a cell-containing nutrient broth in a Petri dish, a physical phenomenon known as &#x201c;inertial cavitation&#x201d; takes place in the ultrasound-conducting liquid medium. Briefly stated, when ultrasound is transmitted through an ultrasound-conducting liquid medium, the energy of the ultrasound causes the liquid molecules to produce countless vacuum bubbles, which expand rapidly and collapse as soon as the surface of the bubbles can no longer resist the external liquid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">More specifically, when the acoustic pressure of the ultrasound in the ultrasound-conducting liquid medium accumulates to a certain level, the bubbles begin to expand and are squeezed and closed in the positive-pressure area. When the countless tiny vacuum bubbles in the ultrasound-conducting liquid medium eventually implode violently due to compression and rarefaction in the oscillating process, the breaking bubbles accelerate and hence make a huge impact (up to thousands of atmospheres of pressure locally) on the membranes of the cells. Such a strong impact not only can enhance the permeation of macromolecules (e.g., plasmid DNA, particles, and drug molecules) through the cell membranes, but also forms microscopic pores on the membranes, the latter process called &#x201c;sonoporation&#x201d;. The micropores on the cell membranes will disappear in 24 hours, thus bringing the membranes back to their original state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Sonoporation is very likely to be a result of the inertial cavitation mechanism, and this physical property has given rise to the development of the ultrasonic microbubble-based delivery method in the 1990s, with a view to achieving gene delivery through sonoporation. This microbubble-based method can be used to deliver macromolecules such as plasmid DNA, functional genes, particles, drug molecules, or even nanoparticles to various types of cells, including, for example, primary cells, stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, or cell lines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the case of ultrasonic microbubble-based delivery systems that are designed to deliver macromolecules to cells of various types, all the systems in the literature and currently available on the market&#x2014;be they of the continuous wave or pulsed wave type, and regardless of whether they are for commercial use or are self-made systems&#x2014;are high-power ultrasound systems with a single-element ultrasound transducer. In other words, only one transducer is used in each system to perform ultrasonic radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since an ultrasound system with a single-element ultrasound transducer can only perform ultrasonic radiation on one culture well at a time, the entire operation, which typically involves a plurality of culture wells, is disadvantageously time-consuming and labor intensive. Moreover, as the ultrasound transducer is manually lowered into each culture well, the depth by which the ultrasound transducer dips into the ultrasound-conducting liquid medium cannot be standardized, nor can the radiation time be quantified. These add to the drawbacks of the conventional ultrasound systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The primary object of the present invention is to solve the problem of time-consuming and labor-intensive operation of the conventional ultrasound-transducer-based delivery systems as can be attributed to the use of a single ultrasound transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to solve the problem that the conventional ultrasound-transducer-based delivery systems do not allow quantification of the time for which and the depth by which the ultrasound transducer dips into an ultrasound-conducting liquid medium.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention provides an array-type-transducer-based high-power ultrasound delivery system which includes a support bracket and an array-type ultrasound transducer. The support bracket includes a set of first support members which form a vertical height, and a set of second support members each horizontally connected to one end of a corresponding one of the first support members and each having a plurality of grooves. The array-type ultrasound transducer includes a clamp which has N openings arranged in a one-dimensional array, where N is a positive integer. The clamp also has a wedge on each of its two lateral sides, and the wedges can be moved in a Y-axis direction to engage in the grooves. In addition, the array-type ultrasound transducer includes N ultrasound transducers respectively engaged in the openings.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Implementation of the present invention at least involves the following inventive steps:</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">1. The use of multiple ultrasound transducers instead of a single ultrasound transducer increases operation speed and lowers labor requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">2. The clamp can be moved, and the ultrasound transducers operated, in a fully automatic, partially automatic, or manual manner to enable control and quantification of the depth by which the ultrasound transducers dip into an ultrasound-conducting medium.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The detailed features and advantages of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to a preferred embodiment so as to enable persons skilled in the art to gain insight into the technical disclosure of the present invention, implement the present invention accordingly, and readily understand the objects and advantages of the present invention by perusal of the contents disclosed in the specification, the claims, and the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an array-type-transducer-based high-power ultrasound delivery system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a support bracket <b>110</b>, an array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b>, and a plurality of containers <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the support bracket <b>110</b> includes a set of first support members <b>111</b> and a set of second support members <b>112</b>. The set of first support members <b>111</b> includes at least two first support members <b>111</b>. Likewise, the set of second support members <b>112</b> includes at least two second support members <b>112</b>. Each first support member <b>111</b> is a vertically standing post that forms a vertical height. Each second support member <b>112</b> is a plate horizontally connected to one end of a corresponding one of the first support members <b>111</b> such that both the second support members <b>112</b> extend toward the same side of the first support members <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each second support member <b>112</b> has a plurality of grooves <b>113</b>. The depth of the grooves <b>113</b> not only determines the depth by which the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> (as described further below) of the array-type transducer <b>120</b> can dip into the containers <b>130</b>, but also enables accurate alignment between the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> and the containers <b>130</b>. The grooves <b>113</b>, which are shown as U-shaped grooves by way of example, are arranged at one end of each second support member <b>112</b> and are away from the position where each second support member <b>112</b> is connected to the corresponding first support member <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this embodiment, the first support members <b>111</b> are spaced apart from each other, and the second support members <b>112</b> are connected to the upper ends of the first support members <b>111</b> respectively. Further, a transverse bar <b>115</b> is provided between the second support members <b>112</b> to keep the distance therebetween, thus allowing the second support members <b>112</b> to remain parallel to each other. Moreover, the bottom portion of the support bracket <b>110</b> is connected with a base plate <b>114</b> for supporting the support bracket <b>110</b> in a firm and stable manner. When viewed from the side, the assembly of the base plate <b>114</b> and the support bracket <b>110</b> has a generally Z shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> includes a clamp <b>121</b> and N ultrasound transducers <b>124</b>, where N is a positive integer. The clamp <b>121</b> has N openings <b>122</b>, and the openings <b>122</b> are arranged in a one-dimensional array. In other words, the openings <b>122</b> are linearly arranged on the clamp <b>121</b> at a fixed spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each opening <b>122</b> is configured for receiving and clamping one ultrasound transducer <b>124</b>, and the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> are engaged in the openings <b>122</b> respectively. The ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> can be high-power ultrasound transducers. Apart from securing the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b>, the clamp <b>121</b> serves to facilitate movement of the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b>, as explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A wedge <b>123</b> is provided on each of two lateral sides of the clamp <b>121</b>. The wedges <b>123</b> can be moved along a Y-axis direction to connect with the grooves <b>113</b>. Thus, the clamp <b>121</b> can be moved along the Y-axis direction and engage with different grooves <b>113</b> by means of the wedges <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each wedge <b>123</b> is formed with at least one grip portion <b>125</b> on the outer side. When the array-type-transducer-based high-power ultrasound delivery system <b>100</b> is manually operated, the grip portions <b>125</b> can be held by hand in order to move the clamp <b>121</b>. When the system <b>100</b> is operated by mechanical arms or the like, the grip portions <b>125</b> are gripped by the mechanical arms so that the clamp <b>121</b> can be moved in a fully or partially automatic manner.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each wedge <b>123</b> has a post-like structure and is provided with at least one positioning element <b>126</b>. The wedges <b>123</b>, together with the positioning elements <b>126</b>, allow the array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> to move in an X-axis direction. Each positioning element <b>126</b> is a protruding structure for securing the clamp <b>121</b> in position in the grooves <b>113</b> and limiting the range of movement of the wedges <b>123</b> along the X-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The containers <b>130</b> are arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. Each X-axis array <b>131</b> of the two-dimensional matrix is composed of A containers <b>130</b> arranged along the X-axis direction, where A is a positive integer. Along the Y-axis direction, the containers <b>130</b> form M X-axis arrays <b>131</b>, where M is also a positive integer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the containers <b>130</b> can be Petri dishes for holding an ultrasound-conducting medium <b>133</b>. The ultrasound-conducting medium <b>133</b> can be a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the array-type-transducer-based high-power ultrasound delivery system <b>100</b> may further include a temperature-adjusting water tank <b>132</b> for receiving and heating the containers <b>130</b>. The temperature-adjusting water tank <b>132</b> may contain water <b>134</b> or other substances for adjusting the temperatures of the containers <b>130</b> and of the ultrasound-conducting medium <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a side elevational view of the array-type-transducer-based high-power ultrasound delivery system <b>100</b>, the array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> can be moved along the Y-axis direction from one pair to another pair of the grooves <b>113</b>, so as for the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> to continue processing different containers <b>130</b>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> is displaced vertically away from the containers <b>130</b> before it can be moved in the Y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> can be vertically moved so as to dip into or leave the ultrasound-conducting medium <b>133</b> in the containers <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, A is 6, and M is 4. Therefore, the containers <b>130</b> are arranged in a 6&#xd7;4 or 3&#xd7;2 two-dimensional matrix, wherein each X-axis array <b>131</b> includes six containers <b>130</b> arranged along the X-axis direction, and four X-axis arrays <b>131</b> are formed along the Y-axis direction. Moreover, each second support member <b>112</b> has four grooves <b>113</b> that correspond in position to the containers <b>130</b> in the Y-axis direction. Thus, even if the wedges <b>123</b> of the array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> are engaged in different grooves <b>113</b>, the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> will be in accurate alignment with the containers <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, with N being 3 in the present embodiment, the clamp <b>121</b> has three openings <b>122</b>, and the array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> includes three ultrasound transducers <b>124</b>, wherein each ultrasound transducer <b>124</b> is engaged in one opening <b>122</b>. Therefore, when the clamp <b>121</b> of the array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> is connected with the grooves <b>113</b>, three containers <b>130</b> can be processed at the same time to increase operation speed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment, the array-type ultrasound transducers <b>120</b> can be moved vertically upward to leave the containers <b>130</b>, then moved along the Y-axis direction to the containers <b>130</b> in the next X-axis array <b>131</b>, and then moved vertically downward so as for the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> to dip into the containers <b>130</b>. Furthermore, as the array-type ultrasound transducer <b>120</b> can be moved in a fully or partially automatic manner or manually, not only can the depth of the grooves <b>113</b> be designed to control the depth by which the ultrasound transducers <b>124</b> dip into the containers <b>130</b>, thus reducing operational variables, but also the requirement for labor can be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The features of the present invention are disclosed above by the preferred embodiment to allow persons skilled in the art to gain insight into the contents of the present invention and implement the present invention accordingly. The preferred embodiment of the present invention should not be interpreted as restrictive of the scope of the present invention. Hence, all equivalent modifications or amendments made to the aforesaid embodiment should fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
