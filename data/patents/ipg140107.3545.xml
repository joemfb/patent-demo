<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The various circuit and method embodiments described herein relate in general to current sensing circuits and techniques, and, more specifically, to circuits and techniques to synthesize a sense resistor using an active component to enable current sensing over a large dynamic range.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current sense resistors are widely known. An example of a typical current sense resistor circuit <b>10</b> and its use is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which a sense resistor <b>11</b>, a control device, such as a MOSFET <b>12</b>, and a load <b>14</b> are connected in series between a voltage supply <b>16</b> and a reference potential <b>18</b>. The current in the sense resistor <b>11</b> develops an output voltage across the sense resistor <b>11</b>, which can be sensed by a current sense comparator <b>20</b>. Typically, the circuit <b>10</b> senses current using the resistor <b>11</b> and looks for a specific voltage via the current sense comparator <b>20</b>, representing a current threshold. The current sense resistor circuit <b>10</b> is accurate, stable, and inexpensive, but requires a significant voltage across the sense resistor <b>11</b>, so that offset and noise are insignificant.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The circuit <b>10</b> implements a linear regulator that controls load current based on a voltage input, but is weak, because as the control signal that is applied drops, the signal across the sense resistor <b>11</b> also drops, and the offset and noise of the comparator <b>20</b> limit accuracy and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, when the current sense threshold adjusted in a system in which a current sense resistor circuit is used, either a very accurate current sense comparator <b>20</b> with very low offset is required, or a high resistance sense resistor <b>11</b> needs to be used. A high resistance sense resistor, however, drops an excessive voltage at high current and a barely adequate voltage at low current. Therefore, this solution is inefficient because a lot of power is wasted at high current level, and serious demands are placed on the comparator <b>20</b> at low current level.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another current sensing technique that has been used is a current mirror <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The current mirror <b>30</b> has a reference side having a reference current source <b>32</b> and MOSFET <b>34</b> connected in series and a mirror side having MOSFETs <b>36</b> and <b>12</b> and load <b>14</b> connected in series between the voltage source <b>16</b> and reference potential <b>18</b>. The current from the reference current source <b>32</b> is driven through the MOSFET <b>34</b> to create a voltage on its gate and on the gate of a sensing MOSFET <b>36</b>, thereby setting its resistance. The current through the sensing MOSFET <b>36</b> develops a voltage on its drain, which is sensed by the comparator <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Typically, the reference current portion of the current mirror <b>30</b> is provided from an external current. This allows scaling but does not actually generate a voltage proportional to current, which is used for feed-forward and other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is a circuit that provides a stable and predictable sense resistance that can sense control currents over a wide dynamic range to provide a constant voltage threshold for good accuracy and high efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the concepts described herein, a feedback circuit is employed to synthesize a resistor using a MOSFET or other active component. By using two synthesizers with matched, and possibly scaled devices, an external, accurate reference resistor can be employed so that the synthesized resistance is stable and predictable. A multiplier or other converter in the system can be used to scale the synthesized resistor with the current command signal, so that when a low current is commanded, a high resistance is synthesized. This allows a constant voltage threshold, for good accuracy and high efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, in one example described herein, a load current sensing circuit has a first sense resistor circuit to sense a current in a load in series therewith and a second sense resistor circuit having components replicating the components of the first sense resistor circuit. A resistor is coupled to the second sense resistor circuit. When an input command voltage is applied to the first and second sense resistor circuits to establish a predetermined response in the second sense resistor circuit, a predetermined sense resistance is established in the first sense resistor circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, a circuit is described having a first sense resistor circuit having components including a first-circuit active element to provide a sense resistance established by an input command voltage to sense a current in a load in series therewith. A second sense resistor circuit has components replicating the components of the first sense resistor circuit including a replicated active element, a resistance of the replicated active element also being established by the input command voltage. A precision resistor is coupled to the replicated active element to provide a load thereto. When the input command voltage establishes a voltage across the replicated active element, a voltage is established across the first-circuit active element in proportion thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another example, a method is described for sensing a load current. The method includes providing a first sense resistor circuit having a first-circuit active element for connection in series with a load to provide a sense resistance in accordance with an input command voltage applied thereto. The first sense resistor circuit is replicated with a replicated sense resistor circuit having a replicated active element. A precision resistor is coupled to the replicated active element. When the input command voltage is applied to the replicated active element and adjusted to produce a predetermined voltage across the replicated active element, a predetermined sense resistance is established in the first circuit active element.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Broadly, a method and circuit are shown by which a sense resistor can be synthesized by producing a replicated or synthesized precision sense resistor in an ideal environment and from which the sense resistor under actual load can be configured. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, an example of one circuit <b>40</b> being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to which reference is now made.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the circuit <b>40</b>, a first sense resistor circuit <b>42</b> is provided that has components that include a first-circuit active element, MOSFET <b>36</b>. The MOSFET <b>36</b> provides a sense resistance to sense a current, I, in a load <b>14</b> in series therewith. The resistance of the MOSFET <b>36</b> is established as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The circuit <b>40</b> may be used in many current limit applications; for example, it may be used in dimmable lighting applications where it is desired to control current in an LED load, or the like, with one circuit over a wide dynamic range, for instance over a range of 100:1 or 1000:1. Alternatively, it may be used to serve as a primary side current sense LED driver, or the like in which in which the current in the load <b>14</b> may be switched or controlled by a control device, such as a MOSFET <b>12</b>, or the like, in known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The resistance of the MOSFET <b>36</b> is controlled by an input command voltage, Vin, on line <b>44</b>, in a manner described below in greater detail. The voltage developed across the MOSFET <b>36</b> is connected to a comparator or regulating amplifier <b>20</b>, which compares the voltage to a threshold voltage, Vth, as shown. Although a comparator or regulating amplifier <b>20</b> is shown as an illustrative use for the circuit <b>40</b>, any circuit or other circuit that operates based on the information derived from the voltage across the synthesized resistance can be equally advantageously employed. Moreover, the circuit need not have a single fixed threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the example illustrated, the first sense resistor circuit <b>42</b> has an amplifier <b>46</b> with its output connected to the gate of the MOSFET <b>36</b>. The amplifier <b>46</b> may be, for instance, an operational amplifier, but may have a modest gain between about 2 and 5, for example. A feedback resistor <b>48</b> is connected between the drain of the MOSFET <b>36</b> and the input of the amplifier <b>46</b>, and a resistor <b>50</b> is connected between the input of the amplifier <b>46</b> and the input command voltage, Vin, on line <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A second sense resistor circuit <b>42</b>&#x2032;, sometimes referred to herein as a replicated sense resistor circuit, is provided having components substantially replicating the components of the first sense resistor circuit <b>42</b>. Thus, the second sense resistor circuit <b>42</b>&#x2032; has a replicated active element, MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032;, the resistance of which being established by the input command voltage, Vin, on line <b>44</b>. Like the first sense resistor circuit <b>42</b>, the second sense resistor circuit <b>42</b>&#x2032; has an amplifier <b>46</b>&#x2032; with its output connected to the gate of the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032;. The amplifier <b>46</b>&#x2032; may be, for instance, an operational amplifier of construction that is substantially the same as that of the amplifier <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A feedback resistor <b>48</b>&#x2032; is connected between the drain of the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032; and the input of the amplifier <b>46</b>&#x2032;, and a resistor <b>50</b>&#x2032; is connected between the input of the amplifier <b>46</b>&#x2032; and the input command voltage, Vin, on line <b>44</b>. The values of the resistors <b>48</b>&#x2032; and <b>50</b>&#x2032; may be substantially the same as the values of the resistors <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> of the first sense resistor circuit <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A reference resistor <b>54</b>, which may be a precision resistor, is connected in series between a supply voltage, V, and the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032; to provide a precision load thereto. Thus, when an input command voltage, Vin, on line <b>44</b> establishes a voltage, Vref, across the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032; it also established a voltage across the MOSFET <b>36</b> in the first sense resistor circuit <b>42</b> in proportion thereto to establish the resistance provided by the MOSFET <b>36</b>. It should be noted the MOSFETs <b>36</b> and <b>36</b>&#x2032; are partially resistive on their own, and when they are used in the feedback circuit as described, they can be made to behave like variable linear resistors.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another embodiment of the sense resistor synthesizer circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to which reference is now additionally made. In the circuit <b>60</b>, a first sense resistor circuit <b>64</b> has a first-circuit active element, MOSFET <b>36</b>, to provide a sense resistance to sense a current, I, in a load <b>14</b> in series therewith. The sense resistance of the MOSFET <b>36</b> is established by an input command voltage, Vin on line <b>44</b>, which is applied through multiplier/divider circuit <b>62</b> to the gate of the MOSFET <b>36</b>. A line <b>66</b> connects the drain of the MOSFET <b>36</b> to the multiplier/divider circuit <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a similar manner as described above, the voltage developed across the MOSFET <b>36</b> is connected to a comparator or regulating amplifier <b>20</b>, which compares the voltage to a threshold voltage, Vth, as shown. Although a comparator or regulating amplifier <b>20</b> is shown as an illustrative use for the circuit <b>60</b>, any circuit or other circuit that operates based on the information derived from the voltage across the synthesized resistance can be equally advantageously employed. Moreover, the circuit need not have a single fixed threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A second sense resistor circuit <b>64</b>&#x2032; has components replicating the components of the first circuit, including a replicated active element, MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032;, to provide a sense resistance to sense a current, I, in a precision reference resistor <b>54</b> in series therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sense resistance of the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032; is also established by the input command voltage, Vin on line <b>44</b>, which is applied through multiplier/divider circuit <b>62</b>&#x2032; to the gate of the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032;. A line <b>66</b> connects the drain of the MOSFET <b>36</b> to the multiplier/divider circuit <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A reference resistor <b>54</b>, which may be a precision resistor, is connected in series between a supply voltage, V, and the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032; to provide a precision load thereto. When the input command voltage is applied to the multiplier/divider circuit <b>62</b>&#x2032;, a voltage, Vref, is established across the MOSFET <b>36</b>&#x2032;. In addition, a voltage is also established across the MOSFET <b>36</b> in the first sense resistor circuit <b>64</b> in proportion thereto. Thus, by establishing the predetermined current, I, in the replicated sense resistor circuit <b>64</b>&#x2032;, the resistance provided by the MOSFET <b>36</b> in the first sense resistor circuit <b>64</b>, hence the current, I, in the load <b>14</b>, is established.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should again be noted the MOSFETs <b>36</b> and <b>36</b>&#x2032; are partially resistive on their own, and when they are used in the feedback circuit with the multiplier/divider circuits <b>62</b> and <b>62</b>&#x2032;, as described, they can be made to behave like variable linear resistors. Moreover, although MOSFET devices are shown for illustration in the circuit embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, any active device, and more particularly, any device in which current is a function of input, can be used with a feedback circuit to achieve the synthesized resistor function described.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an example of a circuit <b>62</b>/<b>62</b>&#x2032; is shown, instantiations of which can serve as the respective multiplier/dividers <b>62</b> and <b>62</b>&#x2032; in the circuit <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As can be seen, the circuit <b>62</b>/<b>62</b>&#x2032; has voltage inputs, respectively from line <b>44</b> and from the drain of an associated MOSFET <b>36</b> or <b>36</b>&#x2032;. The voltage output is connected to the gate of the associated MOSFET <b>36</b> or <b>36</b>&#x2032;. Of course, the circuit <b>62</b>/<b>62</b>&#x2032; is shown merely as an example, and other multiplier/divider circuits may be equally advantageously employed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Like the circuit <b>40</b>, the circuit <b>60</b> may be used in many current limit applications; for example, it may be used in dimmable lighting applications where it is desired to control current with one circuit over a wide dynamic range, for instance over a range of 100:1 or 1000:1. Alternatively, it may be used to serve as a primary side current sense LED driver, or the like in which the load <b>14</b> may be, for example, LEDs, or the like. The current in the load <b>14</b> may be switched or controlled by a control device, such as a MOSFET <b>12</b>, or the like, in known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus, it can be seen that circuits of the type exemplified by circuit <b>40</b>, circuit <b>60</b>, or the like, enable the value of the sense resistance provided by the active elements described to be established to any desired value. As the active elements invert the input voltage, the higher the input command voltage, the lower the resistance of the active elements. With the replicated circuits, as described, significant technical advantages can be achieved, including high efficiency, low cost, and high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, it should be appreciated that although the components of the replicated circuit, for instance sense resistor circuits <b>42</b>&#x2032; and <b>64</b>&#x2032; may be substantially identical to the components of the first sense resistor circuits <b>42</b> and <b>64</b> in the examples illustrated, the components of the replicated circuit may have a predetermined proportionality with respect to the components of the first circuit. More particularly, the channel of the MOSFET in the replicated circuit may be twice, half, or other factor, as wide as the channel of the MOSFET in the first circuit. The values of the resistors, or other components, of the replicated circuit can be selected to have a predetermined ratio with respect to the corresponding components of the first circuit, and so on. In this case, the value of the current produced in the reference resistor of the replicated circuit can be correlated to the value of the resistance produced in the first-circuit active element.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a method embodiment for sensing a load current, with reference now additionally to the flow chart <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, box <b>72</b> illustrates providing a first sense resistor circuit having a first-circuit active element for connection in series with a load to provide a sense resistance in accordance with an input command voltage applied thereto. Box <b>74</b> illustrates replicating the first sense resistor circuit with a replicated sense resistor circuit having a replicated active element.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Box <b>76</b> illustrates providing a precision resistor coupled to the replicated active element. And box <b>78</b> illustrates applying an input command voltage to the replicated active element, whereby when the input command voltage is adjusted to produce a predetermined voltage across the replicated active element, a predetermined sense resistance is established in the first circuit active element, thereby controlling the current, I, in the load <b>14</b>.</p>

It will be understood that other transistor types and other transistor conductivities may be equally advantageously employed with appropriate circuit or supply voltage changes.</p>
