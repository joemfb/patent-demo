The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile or digital download reproduction of all or part of the patent document, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention pertains to hot air dryers used to quickly dry garments, such as pants, jackets, shirts, sweaters, mittens, shoes and boots.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hot air dryers are commonly used to individually dry shoes, boots, gloves, mittens. Unfortunately, when one of these items is wet and need drying, other garments worn by the individual are also wet and need drying. Therefore, hot air dryers that simultaneously dry different types of items and garments are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many garments, such as jackets, vests, and sweaters are made of multiple layers of material that can become wet. Such garments when wet, are also heavy. In order to dry them thoroughly, the garments must be evenly spread out on a surface so that air may circulate around and through the wet layers. In some instances, it is important that all of the wet layers in the garment be dried out in a relatively short time period (i.e. overnight).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The outside layer on a jacket or coat is usually made of water resistant material that impedes movement of moisture into and out of the jacket's inner layers. The inside layers are often made of thick, insulating material while the jacket's inner layer is made of non-abrasive, absorbent material. When the jacket or coat is hung-up to dry overnight, the outside and inside layers usually dry in a few hours while the inner layers and seams may be damp the next morning.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some instances, hooks and shower bars are not available for hanging wet garments. Therefore, dryers that are self supporting and can hold multiple wet garments would be desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a portable, garment drying apparatus that can individually support and uniformly dry multiple different kinds of items and garments in a quick manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing objects are achieved by the garment drying apparatus disclosed herein that includes a lower base with an air source and blower assembly mounted thereon and attached to a multiple garment hanging assembly. Disposed between the lower base and the multiple garment hanging assembly are two upward extending hollow air transfer tubes that deliver air from the base to the multiple garment hanger assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The multiple garment hanger assembly includes a hollow transverse brace with two upward extending outer end brackets perpendicularly aligned and attached thereto. The transverse brace may be used to hold a folded pair of pants or a hanger. Attached to the upper ends of the two end brackets is an upper shoulder component used to support an unfolded jacket or coat. The upper shoulder component is similar to the hanger that holds the jacket in a natural expanded, hung position for maximum air circulation. The upper shoulder component includes a plurality of air vents and a center opening that enables air delivered below the upper shoulder component to travel upward and through the upper shoulder component and contact the inside surfaces of garments supported thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">During operation, the lower base with the hot air source and blower assembly is relatively heavy and acts as a ballast to hold the two air transfers tubes in a vertical upright position. The two air transfer tubes are relatively long so that a pair of pants may be folded over and hung over the transverse brace. Because the transverse brace includes vents, hot air is able to flow upward into the space created between the transverse brace and the upper shoulder component. Further, the air vents created in the upper shoulder component enable air to travel through the upper shoulder component and contact the inside surface of the jacket or sweater hung over the upper shoulder component so that all layers in the jacket of sweater are uniformly dried.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, there is shown a garment hanger drying apparatus <b>10</b> that includes a lower base <b>11</b> with a combination electric hot air source and blower assembly <b>17</b> mounted thereon. Attached to the base <b>11</b> are two hollow, upward extending hot air transfer tubes <b>20</b>, <b>25</b>. Perpendicularly aligned and attached to the ends of the two air transfer tubes <b>20</b>, <b>25</b> is a hollow transverse hollow brace <b>30</b> with two upward extending outer end brackets <b>40</b>, <b>45</b>. The two end brackets <b>40</b>, <b>45</b> are perpendicularly aligned and attached to an upper shoulder component <b>50</b> suspended in a parallel, elevated location above the transverse brace <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The lower base <b>11</b> has a bottom flat surface <b>12</b> that allows the apparatus <b>10</b> to be supported on a flat surface. The base <b>11</b> is hollow and includes two ports <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> that connect to the lower ends of the two air transfer tubes <b>20</b>, <b>25</b>.
