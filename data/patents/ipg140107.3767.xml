<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An exemplary environment is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in which one or more aspects of various embodiments may be implemented. In the illustrated environment, an exemplary system <b>100</b> may include at least an intra-e-paper assembly (herein &#x201c;e-paper&#x201d;) <b>102</b> for display of information based upon conformation of the e-paper and classification of the information being considered for display.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Some exemplary implementations of the e-paper <b>102</b> may utilize various display aspects related to technology commonly referred to as &#x201c;electronic paper,&#x201d; &#x201c;e-paper,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic ink,&#x201d; and &#x201c;e-ink&#x201d; such as plate type electronics using liquid crystal electronics or organic electroluminescence electronics. Some exemplary implementations may use one or more thin and/or foldable electronic circuit boards to provide a more paper-like flexibility for the e-paper <b>102</b> without need for hinged connections between portions or regions of the e-paper. Other implementations of the e-paper may also have alone or in combination with the flexible portions more rigid type portions such as with the plate type electronics in which various portions or regions of the e-paper <b>102</b> are coupled together with mechanical connectors such as hinges or micro-hinges or other coupling mechanisms. Some exemplary implementations may have one or more batteries mounted thereon to furnish power for changing displayed content. Some exemplary implementations may require power for maintaining the displayed content. Other exemplary implementations may have display aspects with a memory function in lieu of such power requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Some exemplary implementations of the e-paper <b>102</b> may utilize display aspects of microcapsule electrophoretic or twist ball type electronics. An exemplary microcapsule-electrophoretic display unit implementation may not require power for maintaining the displayed content.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some exemplary implementations, black (or other colored particles) charged to negative polarity and white (or other colored particles) charged to positive polarity may be contained in transparent microcapsules that are positioned between films having a transparent electrode such as indium tin oxide (ITO). When a voltage is used to apply negative electric charge to a specific portions of microcapsules, the white (or other colored particles) move to a lower microcapsule portion and the black (or other colored) particles) electrophoretically migrate toward an upper microcapsule portion. Consequently, an image of white (or one or more other colors) and black (or one or more other colors) may be displayed on the exemplary implementation of the e-paper <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When positive electric charge is applied to an entire surface display layer and/or an internal display layer beneath the surface display layer of the e-paper <b>102</b>, the white particles may move to an upper portion of a part of the microcapsule. Consequently, the surface becomes white, which can be used to delete an image. Microcapsule-electrophoretic exemplary versions of the e-paper <b>102</b> may require power to move the white and black particles at the time of rewrite. However, because the white and black particles normally stay on the electrode due to electrostatic adsorption or intermolecular force, power may not be required to maintain displayed content akin to a memory function.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An exemplary twist-ball (Gyricon bead) implementation of the e-paper <b>102</b> may use balls having a spherical diameter of 10 micrometers to 100 micrometers, which can be painted, respectively, in two colors (for example, white and black) for each hemisphere, have charged states (plus and minus) corresponding to the respective colors, and may be buried in a transparent insulating sheet put between a pair of electrodes. Balls painted in two colors may be supported in an insulating liquid such as silicon oil in a cavity slightly larger than the ball diameter so that applied voltage rotates the charged ball to display one of the painted colors. Since the rotated ball can be positionally fixed by electrostatic adsorption, if the applied voltage is removed, displayed content may remain without continuing to apply power. Other aspects of approaches to e-paper displays can be used by other implementations of the e-paper <b>102</b>. For instance, a bendable A4 sized display panel by LG Philips of South Korea reportedly measures 35.9-centimeters diagonally, is 0.3-millimeter thick, and can display up to 4,096 colors while maintaining the energy efficient qualities that inevitably come with using energy only when the image changes. Supporting e-paper display aspects can be further found in various technical documents such as International PCT Application Publication Nos.

For instance, in the context of reading the e-paper <b>102</b>, a flick of the e-paper may cause a brief conformation during the flicking action as compared to a conformation in which the e-paper is being read. Relatively speaking, in the context of the reading, the flicking action can be viewed as transient whereas the conformation during reading of the e-paper <b>102</b> can be viewed as persistent. In another context, a transition from one conformation to another of the e-paper <b>102</b> can be viewed as a series of transient conformations whereas the before and after conformations subject to the change can be viewed as persistent. In some contexts transient could be in terms of seconds and persistent would be in terms of minutes. In other contexts transient could be in terms of minutes and persistent would be in terms of hours. In other contexts transient could be in terms of hours and persistent could be in terms of days.

Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and/or systems and/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and/or devices and/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary.

Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms (e.g., the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).</p>
