<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to methods and systems for designing chips, and more specifically to methods and systems for pre-route generation for chip design.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A physical design for an integrated circuit or &#x201c;chip&#x201d; is created through a design process. Floorplanning is a part of the chip design process in which cells or instances (integrated circuit implementation of some logical or electronic function) are positioned relative to other cells, and space is allocated for the cells. A given floorplanning often involves a balance between available space (cost of the chip), required performance, and a need to have certain cells in close proximity of other cells.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The routing for the cells (i.e., the connections or wiring between cells) associated with the physical design may be created through a custom design process or may be automatically drawn by software tools. The custom design process involves a person drawing the wires for the physical design of the chip in a layout mode. When the routing is hand drawn, changes to the design may require significant changes to the routing and thereby cause significant additional work by the person performing the drawing. Software routing, on the other hand, typically makes a number of trade-offs based on a number of factors or constraints to generate the routes for the physical design of the chip.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, a method involves receipt of a routing selection. The routing selection is for a path between at least a first cell and a second cell that are associated with a functional description of an integrated circuit. The method further involves modifying a floorplan associated with the functional description to create a modified floorplan that has a physical design change relative to the floorplan. The method then further involves automatically generating a pre-route based on receipt of the routing selection and the modified floorplan. The pre-route may have the same path and/or the same performance as the path associated with the routing selection. The method then further involves adding the pre-route to a physical design of the chip to create a pre-routed physical design. The pre-route is generated and added to the physical design by the method prior to generation and addition of a plurality of additional floorplan routes to the physical design. The pre-route may be a trunk and the plurality of additional floorplan routes may be a plurality of branches associated with the trunk.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, a system includes a processor coupled to a memory. The system includes a route selection module deployed in the memory and executed by the processor to receive a routing selection. The system further includes a floorplan module deployed in the memory and executed by the processor to modify a floorplan associated with the functional description to create a modified floorplan having a physical design change relative to the floorplan. The functional description may be in netlist format. The system further includes a pre-routing module deployed in the memory and executed by the processor to automatically generate a pre-route based on receipt of the routing selection and the modified floorplan. The system further includes a route addition module deployed in the memory and executed by the processor to adding the pre-route to a physical design of the chip to create a pre-routed physical design.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Aspects of the present disclosure involve methods and systems for flexible and repeatable pre-route generation. Paths may be selected for route generation prior to the generation of other routes. The generation and addition of these selected routes pre-route the physical design of a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">At the outset of designing a new chip, a functional description for the chip is created. The functional description generally specifies a number of cells that enable the chip to provide certain desired functionality. The cells of the chip typically provide the integrated circuit description for gates, invertors, flip-flops, and other functional components of the chip. For example, routing provides the connections between cells such that wires are connected to pins of the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Certain routes are selected from floorplans for pre-routing and are given precedence over non-selected paths. These route selections are prioritized in that resources on the chip are allocated for the pre-routes prior to the routes for which route selections have not been received.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Rules may be specified to enable automated drawing of pre-routes. The rules may enable an operator of the automation tool to ensure that certain requirements of the routes and/or the chip design itself are met. A given pre-routing rule may include a style that is defined as a single shape or a combination of shapes that constitute the path of the route. The path represents the wire used to connect cells of the chip. The shape or shapes that constitute the style constitute the two dimensional appearance of the path.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Throughout the design process the floorplan will be modified, and as the floorplan is modified, pre-routes will continue to be generated or modified and added to the modified chip design despite floorplan modification. The pre-routes may have the same paths as the routes that were selected in the floorplan, or may be paths that are not the same but are still based on the paths in the floorplan. In general, the paths of the pre-routes are not the same as the paths associated with the routing selection. Instead, the paths of the pre-routes are modified based on the differing position of the cells maintaining a same or similar topology to the path of the original route selection. In addition, the paths of the pre-routes generally have at least substantially the same performance as the paths of the previously selected routes. The performance of a given path involves, by way of example, timing behavior, power, noise, and/or electro-migration. Thus, the paths of the pre-routes may be used in the physical design of the chip despite a physical design change to the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the methods and systems discussed herein enable an acceptable design solution to be identified earlier in the design process. For example, an operator may expend less time to create a routed physical design of the chip. Using less time, more and faster iterations of the routing of the physical design may be tried until an acceptable design solution is identified.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the methods and systems enable pre-routes to be generated that meet a performance specification. For example, while automatic routing of a physical design of a chip may not meet performance specification because routes do not meet appropriate timing, the methods and systems can be used to ensure that the performance specification is met for all routes of the physical design.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The pre-routes may be flexible in that they may accommodate changing of the floorplans without re-defining the pre-routes. In some embodiments, the pre-routes may be replicated or may be similar to a selected route despite changes made to the floorplans. Similar routes generally have the same route characteristics despite having a changed floorplan. In some embodiments, the pre-routes are consistent, flexible, and repeatable while accommodating at least some amount of floorplan changes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further the pre-routes may improve the ability to meet constraints associated with a chip. Finally, automatic generation of pre-routes may be performed despite changes to the physical design.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> in which flexible and repeatable pre-route generation may be performed. The system <b>100</b> is an example platform in which one or more embodiments of the methods may be used. However, the flexible and repeatable pre-route generation may also be performed on other platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An operator may perform the flexible and repeatable pre-route generation by using the operator device <b>102</b>. The operator may use the operator device <b>102</b> as a stand-alone device to perform the flexible and repeatable pre-route generation, or may use the operator device <b>102</b> in combination with a design device <b>106</b> available over a network <b>104</b>. When the design device <b>106</b> is used in the system <b>100</b>, in general at least a portion of the functionality that generates flexible and repeatable pre-routes is performed on the design device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The operator device <b>102</b> may be in a client-server relationship with the design device <b>106</b>, a peer-to-peer relationship with the design device <b>106</b>, or in a different type of relationship with the design device <b>106</b>.

In one particular embodiment, the routing subsystem <b>202</b> includes a processor, memory coupled to the processor, and a number of the aforementioned modules deployed in the memory and executed by the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The routing subsystem <b>202</b> may be implemented in a number of different ways. For example, the routing subsystem <b>202</b> may be implemented as an add-on or an extension to otherwise available software, hardware, or both. The routing system <b>202</b> may be deployed as stand-alone software, hardware, or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In general, routing of the physical design of the chip begins with the floorplan module <b>402</b> receiving the functional description of the chip design. The floorplan module <b>402</b> may then use the functional description to generate the floorplan. The floorplan module <b>402</b> may display the generated floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The functional description describes the size of the chip, the operations or tasks that the chip is intended to perform, as well as constraints of the chip (e.g., power consumption). The functional description also identifies cells and connections between the cells. Placement of wires relative to the location of other wires that connect the cells and/or shield on whether certain wires need to be protected from other wires may be identified in the functional description. The functional description may be in netlist format or in a different format. In some embodiments, the floorplan module <b>402</b> codes the functional description into register transfer language (RTL).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As the design of the chip evolves, the functional description of the chip may be modified. The functional description, when provided in netlist format or another format, may be verified by the operator, the floorplan module <b>402</b>, or both, to determine whether the functional description is acceptable. If a determination is made that the functional description is unacceptable (e.g., there is an error in the functional description), the modification to the functional description may cause the operator to change the design.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The floorplan generated by the floorplan module <b>402</b> is a schematic representation of the placement of the cells and describes how cells lie in relation to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After generation of the floorplan, the route selection module <b>404</b> receives a routing selection of a path between cells (e.g., a path between a first cell and a second cell) of the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The selected routes are floorplan routes that are selected for pre-routing and are thus prioritized above other routes that are generated in the routing process. A topology of the physical design identifies the pins of the cells and the routing in the form of horizontal positioning of the path, the vertical positioning of the path, and the layer selection of the path. These pre-routes are generated to reflect the appropriate routing and are added to a physical design of the chip prior to the generation and addition of other floorplan routes that have not been selected for pre-routing. The physical design, once completed with cells and routings, may be used to manufacture the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The floorplan routing selection may be received by the route selection module <b>404</b> from the operator (e.g., through a user interface), through the analysis device <b>112</b>, through the operator device <b>102</b>, through the design device <b>106</b>, or otherwise received. A single floorplan routing selection or multiple floorplan routing selections may be received by the route selection module <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The floorplan routing selection, when received from the analysis device <b>112</b>, may be received as a result of analysis of the floorplan by the analysis device <b>112</b>. The analysis device <b>112</b> may receive and use the functional description of the chip to perform floorplan routing selection. For example, the analysis device <b>112</b> may automatically (e.g., without human intervention) perform simulations to identify the floorplan routing that takes the longest amount of time for a signal to traverse the path and may make the floorplan routing selection based on the identification. In some embodiments, the operator of the analysis device <b>112</b> (or another user) may set a timing threshold so that certain paths above, below, and/or equal to the threshold are pre-routed. In some embodiments, the selected routing (the pre-routes) are critical nets that are timing critical and non-selected routing are non-critical nets that are not timing critical.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A pre-routing rule may be established for the selected routing by the pre-routing rule module <b>406</b>. The pre-routing rule defines the pre-route for routing prior to non-selected routes. When multiple routes are selected by the route selection module <b>404</b>, multiple pre-routing rules may be established by the pre-routing rule module <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, the pre-routing rules are not modified despite changes to the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, the pre-routing rule may indicate that the route or path between certain cells has a turn (e.g., a right turn). The pre-routing rule may provide flexibility on where the turn will occur in the path between the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The pre-routing of cells may be defined by one or a series of routing shapes. The routing shapes used in a series may be offset relative to one another based on the current position of the cells. When the position of the cells change, the offset may automatically be modified in a corresponding manner.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the pre-routing rule includes a single shape or multiple shapes of the path. A route shape is associated with a particular style or styles. For example, a particular style may include a first set of shapes and another style may include a different set of shapes. Examples of shapes that may be used with a style include a line, an L-shape or a Z-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The pre-routing rule may further define the topology of the path by route layers, route width, route spacing (e.g., minimum spacing), and/or route grid. The route spacing may indicate how close and/or far apart paths can be from one another. The route grid indicates a set of route tricks which define a space in which a wire placed is allowed. For example, the pre-routing rule may indicate that the path passes through two layers, that the path is two units thick, that no other path may be within one unit of the path, and an acceptable location where the path may be drawn. A route shape may have its own route layers, route width, route space, and route grid.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The floorplan module <b>402</b> modifies a floorplan associated with the functional description. Generally, the floorplan is modified by repositioning one or more of the cells of the floorplan. However, the floorplan may also be changed by adding or removing cells. The resulting modified floorplan has a physical design change relative to the previous version of the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the floorplan module <b>402</b> may modify the floorplan based on a determination that the floorplan has an error, that the floorplan does not meet a performance specification, or both. For example, the error may be a bug in the netlist and the fixing of the bug may change the chip design on which the floorplan is based. For example, the bug may be a placement of a cell that would cause the resulting chip to not provide the desired functionality and the cell placement would then be modified in the floorplan by the floorplan module <b>402</b>. The performance specification may include the speed or timing of the chip design. The determination of the floorplan error or timing issue may be made by the floorplan module <b>402</b>, the operator interacting with the routing subsystem <b>202</b>, or may otherwise be made.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The modification of the floorplan by the floorplan module <b>402</b> may change the length of the pre-routes that are generated by the pre-routing module <b>410</b>. The pre-routes generally adjust to changes made to the floorplan because by having defined route styles for the paths between certain cells of the floorplan, the exact cell placement in the floorplan may be modified and yet the resulting pre-routes are still generated. Thus, for example, when a floorplan is first generated, a route between cell A and cell B is selected for pre-routing because it is a critical path. When the floorplan is modified, the position of cell B is moved. Prior to routing the entire floorplan, pre-routes, such as the routing selection between cell A and cell B, are first checked to determine if a new or modified route is needed. A different path between cell A and cell B is generated to account for the new position of cell B (as well as any other cell changes) accordingly to the role established for the pre-route. Hence, if the path between cell A and cell B is in an L-shape, that L-shape is maintained in the modified route.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, some aspect of the modification of the floorplan may prohibit the automatic generation of some or all of the pre-routes. For example, positioning of cells in the chip could be so dramatically different that the pre-routes cannot be generated without modification to the pre-routing rules. The operator may be notified of the failure to perform the automatic generation. The operator may then modify the floorplan, the pre-routing rule, select other or new routes for prerouting, or take a different action with respect to the floorplan if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The route precedence module <b>408</b> may be deployed in the routing subsystem <b>202</b> to determine route precedence of the modified floorplan. The route precedence of the routes of the modified floorplan may be automatically determined, or may be identified by a user (e.g., the operator) in a routing file that is accessed by the route precedence module <b>408</b>. By way of example, the route precedence module <b>408</b> may scan the routing file that includes routing rules for the cells of the floorplan and process the routing rules in priority order from highest priority to lowest priority.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The pre-routing module <b>410</b> generates the pre-routes. A pre-route generated for a modified floorplan, where the placement of cells for the pre-route does not change, will have all of the same characteristics as the originally selected route as the modified floorplan required no change for the particularly selected route. When the positions of some of the cells have changed, the generated pre-routes will be similar, due to the pre-routing rules, to the previously generated routes that were selected for pre-routing. In some embodiments, the pre-routes are automatically generated. In some embodiments, the creation of the pre-route includes a set of one or more routing shapes defined by a style or shape type.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By way of example, if a cell A moves, and cell A is connected to cell B with an L route, the L route is modified (e.g., vertical distance of the path becomes a bit longer) to reflect the new positioning of cell A.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The route addition module <b>412</b> then adds the pre-routes to a physical design of the chip to create a pre-routed physical design. In some embodiments, the pre-routing of the pre-routes by the pre-routing module <b>410</b> and the route addition module <b>412</b> enable reproduction of the pre-routes despite changes to the floorplan. The changes may include changes in position of the cells that have been pre-routed. In one embodiment, the routes selected for routing include trunks, and routes that are not selected for routing include interconnections that connect to the trunks. In general, trunks route higher priority data in a chip while interconnections connect and route lower priority data in the chip. For example, a trunk may be designed to handle simultaneous signals while the interconnections do not handle such data.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When a pre-routing rule has been established, generation of the pre-routes is based on establishment of the pre-routing rule and the modification of the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the constraint module <b>414</b> accesses routing constraints. While the pre-routing rule generally describes the path taken by the route, the routing constraints describe characteristics of the route or define conditions that particular routes are expected to meet. The generation of the pre-routes is then also based on any applicable routing constraints. Examples of routing constraints including route timing, route power, and route noise. For example, the pre-routing rule may define the shape of the path between two cells and the routing constraints define an acceptable amount of signal that may interfere with the signal being transmitted on the path. Pre-routing may enable the routing constraints to be met on the pre-routes despite changes made to the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After pre-routing the physical design, additional floorplan routes are generated by the routing module <b>416</b> based on the modified floorplan. Typically, the floorplan routes are lower priority routes then the generated pre-routes. The route addition module <b>412</b> then adds the additional floorplan routes to the pre-routed physical design of the chip. The pre-routes are typically not modified or replaced by the additional floorplan routes. The additional routes generated by the routing module <b>416</b> may be auto-constructed such that operator input is not need to complete the routing of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The resulting physical design of the chip that includes circuit representations of the components (devices and interconnects) may then be converted into geometric representations of shapes which, when manufactured in the corresponding layers of materials, may ensure the desired functioning of the components.</p>

The method <b>500</b> may be performed by the operator device <b>102</b> or the design device <b>106</b> of the system <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or may be otherwise performed. For simplicity the method <b>500</b> describes a single pre-route, and associated systems and methods. However, the method <b>500</b> may be used to generate and use multiple pre-routes sequentially, simultaneously, or otherwise.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A pre-routing rule may be created based on receipt of the routing selection at block <b>508</b>. For example, the pre-routing rule may be a rule to generate a pre-route for a path between cell A and cell B.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A floorplan associated with the functional description is modified at block <b>510</b> to create a modified floorplan. The modified floorplan has a physical design change relative to the floorplan. In some embodiments, the modification includes modifying placement of a single cell or multiple cells of the floorplan of the chip design. For example, the position of cell A may move in the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A determination of route precedence of the modified floorplan may be made at block <b>512</b>. The pre-routes that have been selected have greater route precedence than non-selected routes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A pre-route is generated at block <b>514</b> based on receipt of the routing selection and the modified floorplan. In general, the generated pre-route is based on the route selected for pre-routing in that the pre-route may have the same path as the route selected by the routing selection or may be an altered path based on the modifications made to the floorplan. In some embodiments, the pre-route is a flexible pre-route in that the path of the pre-route adjusts with the repositioning of cells. For example, the pre-route between cell A and cell B may be generated. Even though the cell A has moved, the pre-route that includes a path between cell A and cell B may still be generated. In some embodiments, the pre-route is automatically generated without human interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, routing constraints are accessed and the generation of the pre-route is then based on the receipt, the modification, and the routing constraints. In one particular example, generation of pre-route is based on establishment of a pre-routing rule for the selected route, establishing one or more constraints for the route, and the modification of the floorplan.</p>
