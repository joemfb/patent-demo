<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An angled tissue cutting instrument comprises an angled outer tubular member rotatably receiving a flexible inner tubular member. The inner member has a flexible region in correspondence with an angle of the outer member. The flexible region comprises a helically cut length portion of an elongate tubular body of the inner member and a continuous solid flexible surface secured to an outer surface of the body along the helically cut length portion. A method of fabricating a flexible inner tubular member involves forming a helical cut through the solid wall of a length portion of a tubular body and securing a continuous solid flexible surface to the outer surface of the body along the helically cut length portion to form a flexible region.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to tissue cutting instruments having an elongate inner member rotatably disposed in an elongate outer tubular member to cut anatomical tissue and, more particularly, to angled tissue cutting instruments and methods of fabricating angled tissue cutting instruments having an elongate flexible inner tubular member rotatably disposed in an elongate angled outer tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Surgical cutting instruments in which an elongate inner member is rotated within an elongate outer tubular member have become well accepted in surgical procedures where access to a cutting site in a patient's body is gained via a narrow or small size natural or surgically created anatomical opening or passage establishing communication with the cutting site from externally of the patient's body. Typically, the outer tubular member includes a distal end with an opening defining a cutting port or window, and the inner member includes a distal end carrying a cutting configuration exposed by or from the cutting port for engaging anatomical tissue at the cutting site. Proximal ends of the inner and outer members ordinarily include hubs which attach to a powered handpiece disposed externally of the patient's body and having a motor for rotating the inner member relative to and within the outer member. The cutting configuration of the inner member can have various configurations depending upon the surgical procedure to be performed, the type of tissue to be cut and/or the desired cutting action. The opening in the distal end of the outer member may be suitably configured to cooperate with the particular cutting configuration of the inner member to cut anatomical tissue. Often the inner member is tubular and has an aspiration port at its distal end communicating with the lumen of the inner tube so that material, including loose tissue resulting from a cutting procedure, can be aspirated from the cutting site through the aspiration port and lumen of the inner member. Many tissue cutting instruments are designed to allow irrigating fluid to flow along the instruments for discharge at the cutting site, and some tissue cutting instruments are designed for flow of irrigating fluid between the outer and inner members. It is advantageous in tissue cutting instruments for the direction of rotation of the inner member to be reversible during operation for operation of the instruments in both forward and reverse rotational directions. An example of a rotary tissue cutting instrument of the aforementioned type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,203,444 to Bonnell et al for use in performing arthroscopic knee surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many tissue cutting instruments are straight, with longitudinally or axially straight inner and outer members as represented by the Bonnell et al patent. In straight tissue cutting instruments, it is typical for the outer tubular member to comprise an outer tube and for the inner tubular member to comprise an inner tube having an outer diameter for being accommodated in the inner diameter of the outer tube while allowing the inner tube to rotate within the outer tube. Typically, there is a small annular gap or clearance between the outer diameter of the inner tube and the inner diameter of the outer tube, and irrigating fluid may flow along the irrigation channel defined by this gap or clearance for discharge through the cutting port. The lumen of the inner tube defines the aspiration passage in communication with the aspiration port at the distal end of the inner tube and through which material is aspirated when suction is produced in the lumen of the inner tube. Since an elongate body of the straight inner tube is normally of unbroken solid wall construction, there are no openings through the wall of the body of the inner tube through which suction in the aspiration passage may be lost and/or through which irrigating fluid may be drawn into the aspiration passage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In many surgical procedures, it is advantageous for the tissue cutting instruments to be non-straight or angled to access cutting sites which are not accessible or are more difficult to access with straight tissue cutting instruments. Angled tissue cutting instruments normally comprise an elongate angled outer tubular member and an elongate flexible inner tubular member which conforms to the angled configuration of the outer member while being rotatable therein. The angled configuration of the outer member can be formed by various angles, bends or curves, as limited by the ability of the flexible inner tubular member to bend. As with straight tissue cutting instruments, irrigating fluid may flow through an irrigation channel between the angled outer tubular member and the flexible inner tubular member, and aspiration may be conducted through an aspiration passage of the flexible inner tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The flexible inner tubular members of many angled tissue cutting instruments utilize spirally or helically wound coils or springs to transmit torque to rotate the cutting configuration when the inner members are rotated within the outer members. Flexible inner members that employ a single spirally or helically wound coil to impart flexibility while transmitting torque are represented by U.S. Pat. No. 4,466,429 to Loscher et al and U.S. Pat. No. 4,445,509 to Auth. A single coil tends to unwind when rotated in a direction opposite its winding so that torque can only be transmitted efficiently in one rotational direction. Accordingly, angled tissue cutting instruments utilizing this type of flexible inner member cannot be operated in both forward and reverse rotational directions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Flexible inner tubular members having a plurality of coaxial spirally or helically wound coils disposed one on top of the other and wound in alternating opposite directions relative to one another have been used in angled tissue cutting instruments to transmit torque in both rotational directions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,646,738 to Trott describes an angled tissue cutting instrument in which the flexible inner tubular member comprises separate distal and proximal end portions and a composite spiral interposed between the distal and proximal end portions to allow the inner tubular member to bend. The composite spiral is similar to the flexible shaft disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 177,490 to Fones et al and is made up of an inner spiral, a middle spiral and an outer spiral arranged one on top of the other with their windings alternating in direction. The distal and proximal end portions include reduced diameter neck portions which are telescopically received within opposite ends of the inner spiral to facilitate welding of the distal and proximal end portions to opposite ends of the composite spiral. Each spiral adds material and labor costs to the flexible inner tubular member and, therefore, to the angled tissue cutting instrument. Another disadvantage of the flexible inner tubular member used in the Trott instrument is that the neck portions tend to stiffen the composite spiral in the vicinity of the cutting tip thereby preventing the inner member from bending adjacent the cutting tip. In addition, it is possible for the separate components to become detached from one another during use such that torque can no longer be effectively transmitted to the cutting configuration. Angled tissue cutting instruments in which the flexible inner tubular member is like that disclosed in the Trott patent are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,253 to Fucci and U.S. Pat. No. 5,529,580 to Kusunoki et al.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,438 to Shturman and U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,595 to Shturman et al relate to a flexible drive shaft comprising inner and outer oppositely wound helical wire layers along the entire length of the drive shaft. The drive shaft of the Shturman patent is referred to in the Shturman et al patent as being difficult and time-consuming to manufacture. The drive shaft of the Shturman et al patent has its outer helical layer made up of a single wire and its inner helical layer made up of a plurality of wires, which must all be wound around a forming mandrel so that the drive shaft requires many parts and is still difficult and time-consuming to manufacture. Flexible shafts or tubular members comprising two layers of helical windings or coils have many of the same disadvantages as flexible tubular members that have three helical windings or coils.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another disadvantage associated with the use of helical coils or springs to transmit torque while imparting flexibility is that spaces or gaps between the coils may be presented along the body of the flexible inner tubular member which allow suction in the lumen or aspiration passage of the inner tubular member to be dissipated such that less suction is applied at the aspiration port for reduced aspiration efficiency. A weakened suction force or vacuum in the aspiration passage and/or at the aspiration port may lead to clogging or jamming of the tissue cutting instrument due to tissue build-up. Clogging or jamming of tissue cutting instruments due to tissue build-up undesirably leads to the need for frequent cleaning or substitution of the instruments during use, which is time consuming and increases the duration of the surgical procedure to the detriment of the patient and the surgeon. Loss of irrigation efficiency is another problem where spaces are presented between the coils, since irrigating fluid flowing between the outer and inner members may be drawn through the spaces into the aspiration passage. An additional drawback of helical coils or springs is the tendency of the coils or springs to require tightening or preloading. Furthermore, coils or springs have a tendency under certain loading conditions to relax or unwind, and thus expand, thereby increasing the possibility of the inner member binding within the outer member. Relaxation of the coils or springs also makes it more likely that sizable spaces or gaps will be presented between the coils, especially on bending, through which suction in the lumen of the inner member may be lost and/or through which irrigating fluid flowing between the inner and outer members may be drawn into the inner member lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,003 to Anctil et al relates to an angled tissue cutting instrument and to a method of fabricating an angled tissue cutting instrument in which the flexible inner tubular member has a flexible region interposed between a drive shaft and a cutting tip. The flexible region includes a flexible polymeric tube having ends that receive necks of the drive shaft and cutting tip, respectively. A collar of heat shrink tubing is disposed over each end of the tube. When heat is applied, the collars shrink and the polymeric material is caused to flow into slots in the necks to form a mechanical joint. The heat shrunk tubing may be removed after the polymeric material has cured. Counter wound wires embedded in the polymeric material assist in transmitting torque in forward and reverse rotational directions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another approach to flexible inner tubular members of angled tissue cutting instruments has involved forming relief apertures or slots through the walls of solid inner tubes to impart flexibility to the inner tubes as represented by U.S. Pat. No. 5,152,744 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,505 to Krause et al. In the angled tissue cutting instruments described in the aforementioned Krause et al patents, the inner tubes have discrete, unconnected apertures or slots formed therein such that torque transmission is limited. Also, the slots present spaces through which fluid can flow to and from the lumen of the inner tube.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,241 to Heimberger discloses a flexible tube particularly useful as a shank for a flexible endoscope. The flexible tube is formed by cutting a gap in a closed path in a longitudinally straight solid tube to form interlocking but completely materially or physically separated tube sections that allow the tube to bend axially. The flexible tube may not be well suited for use as a rotatable inner tubular member of a surgical cutting instrument since its torque capabilities may be limited to relatively low single direction and bidirectional rotational speeds. Additionally, it is possible for the individual tube sections to disconnect or become detached when the tube is bent. Spaces are presented between the individual tube sections allowing the exchange of fluid between the outside and the inside of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Angled tissue cutting instruments having inner tubes with continuous helical cuts therein to impart flexibility are illustrated by U.S. Pat. No. 6,053,922 to Krause et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,438 B1 to Adams and U.S. Pat. No. 6,533,749 B1 to Mitusina et al. In the angled tissue cutting instruments disclosed by Krause et al '922, no additional layer of material is secured over the helically cut inner tube. Accordingly, the instrument may be suitable for transmitting torque in one direction only and may be of limited torsional strength, as well as the helical cut presenting a space through the wall of the inner tube through which fluid may flow. The angled tissue cutting instruments described in the Adams and Mitusina et al patents have flexible inner tubular members including flexible regions formed by a helical cut in an inner tube and two spiral wrap layers disposed over the helical cut in the inner tube one on top of the other in alternating directions. The instruments disclosed in the Adams and Mitusina et al patents overcome the primary disadvantages of wound helical coils or springs and can effectively transmit torque in both rotational directions at relatively high rotational speeds with minimal wind-up and with the structurally interconnected inner tube eliminating the problems of disconnection or detachment of the inner tube. The use of multiple spiral wrap layers over the helical cut reduces but does not eliminate the possibility of suction being lost from the lumen of the inner tube and/or irrigating fluid entering into the lumen of the inner tube since the helical cut and spiral wraps still present spaces for fluid flow between the outside and the inside of the tubular member. The use of a helically cut inner tube achieves a high degree of bendability and allows flexibility to be imparted to the inner tube adjacent the cutting configuration. However, each spiral wrap layer adds material and labor costs to the flexible inner tubular member and, therefore, to the angled tissue cutting instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It would be desirable to provide an alternative construction for the flexible inner tubular members of angled tissue cutting instruments wherein the flexible inner tubular members retain the benefits of utilizing a helically cut inner tube and allowing torque transmission in forward and reverse rotational directions, while replicating a solid wall inner tubular member construction for increased aspiration and irrigation efficiencies and reduced risk of clogging, reducing wind-up, providing increased structural strength, and reducing the labor and materials needed to fabricate the flexible inner tubular members of various diametric sizes of angled tissue cutting instruments having angled outer members with angles of various magnitudes, radii of curvature and directions.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The aforesaid objects are achieved individually and in combination, and it is not intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more of the objects to be combined unless expressly required by the claims attached hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some of the advantages of the present invention are that the cutting configuration of the flexible inner tubular member may be a cutting tip formed integrally, unitarily with the inner tube or as a separate component attached to a forward end of a body of the inner tube; various different cutting configurations can be used including end cutters, side cutters, trimmers, resectors, shavers, abraders and burs; the cutting configuration can be configured to produce various cutting actions independently or in cooperation with the distal end of the outer tubular member including side cutting, end cutting, trimming, burring, abrading and resection; the inner tubular member can be angled or bent adjacent the cutting configuration; the outer tubular member can include one or a plurality of angles at various locations along the length of the outer tubular member; the angle or angles in the outer tubular member may be formed by various curves, bends or angles of various magnitudes and radii of curvature and may extend in various directions; the flexible inner tubular member may have one or a plurality of flexible regions; plural flexible regions may be spaced longitudinally from one another along the length of the inner tube for being disposed in the angles, respectively, of the outer tubular member; a single flexible region may be of sufficient length to be disposed in more than one angle of the outer tubular member; irrigating fluid can be supplied along the angled tissue cutting instrument internally and/or externally for discharge at a cutting site; the inner tubular member can have one or more aspiration ports at various locations for aspirating materials at the cutting site into the lumen or aspiration passage of the inner tubular member; the flexible inner tubular member can be fabricated in various diametric sizes for use in angled tissue cutting instruments of various sizes including 2.9 mm, 3.5 mm, 4.0 mm and 4.5 mm instruments; the angled tissue cutting instrument can be driven by any suitable powered surgical handpiece capable of rotating the inner tubular member relative to and within the outer tubular member; and the angled tissue cutting instrument is useful in various types of surgery including surgery of the head and neck as well as other types of surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">These and other objects, advantages and benefits are realized with the present invention as generally characterized in an angled tissue cutting instrument comprising an elongate angled outer tubular member and an elongate flexible inner tubular member rotatably disposed within the outer tubular member to transmit torque in forward and reverse rotational directions. The outer tubular member includes a proximal end, a distal end, a bend between the proximal end and the distal end, and an opening at the distal end defining a cutting port in communication with the lumen of the outer tubular member. The inner tubular member comprises a proximal end, a distal end, an elongate tubular body between the proximal end and the distal end of the inner tubular member, and a cutting configuration at the distal end of the inner tubular member for exposure by the cutting port to cut anatomical tissue when the inner tubular member is rotated within the outer tubular member. A continuous helical cut is formed along a length portion of the tubular body, which is of solid wall construction prior to the helical cut being formed therein. The helical cut is formed in the tubular body at a helix angle in a first direction about the tubular body to impart flexibility along the length portion by which the inner tubular member conforms to the angled outer tubular member while being rotated within the angled outer tubular member. A continuous solid flexible surface is secured to an outer surface of the tubular body. A flexible region of the inner tubular member comprises the helically cut length portion of the tubular body and the flexible surface secured to the outer surface of the tubular body along the helically cut length portion. The flexible region is in correspondence with the bend in the angled outer tubular member such that the flexible region is disposed within and conforms to the bend while transmitting torque to the cutting configuration when the inner tubular member is rotated relative to and within the outer tubular member in the forward and reverse rotational directions. The lumen of the tubular body defines an aspiration passage through the flexible inner tubular member, and an aspiration port at the distal end of the inner tubular member is in communication with the aspiration passage. An irrigation channel is defined between the inner diameter of the outer tubular member and the outer diameter of the inner tubular member. The flexible region replicates a solid wall tubular construction such that suction in the aspiration passage is not lost through the wall of the flexible region and irrigating fluid in the irrigating channel does not enter the aspiration passage through the wall of the flexible region.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flexible surface may comprise a heat shrunk sleeve disposed over the helically cut length portion. The flexible region may further include a layer of adhesive between the sleeve and the outer surface of the tubular body by which the sleeve is secured to the tubular body. The helical cut may be formed in the tubular body in a stepped pattern comprising repeating interconnected steps. Each step comprises a transverse cut segment extending transverse to the length of the tubular body at the helix angle in the first direction and a longitudinal cut segment extending from the transverse cut segment along the length of the tubular body. The transverse cut segment meets the longitudinal cut segment at an outside corner forming a step configuration. The longitudinal cut segment extends from the transverse cut segment at the outside corner to an inside corner at which the longitudinal cut segment meets the transverse cut segment of the next step. The steps repeat at about 120 degree rotational intervals about a central longitudinal axis of the tubular body. In a preferred embodiment, the helix angle is 20 degrees. The helical cut tightens as the inner tubular member is rotated relative to and within the outer tubular member in a forward rotational direction. The flexible surface prevents the tubular body from unwinding when the inner tubular member is rotated in a reverse rotational direction such that the inner tubular member transmits torque to the cutting configuration in both forward and reverse rotational directions. The bond between the flexible surface and the tubular body reduces wind-up in that clockwise and counterclockwise movements are restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention is further characterized in a method of fabricating an angled tissue cutting instrument and, in particular, the flexible inner tubular member of an angled tissue cutting instrument. The method involves forming a continuous helical cut along a solid wall length portion of an elongate tubular body at a helix angle in a first direction about the tubular body to impart flexibility along the length portion, and securing a continuous solid flexible surface to an outer surface of the tubular body along the length portion to form a flexible region. The tubular body is inserted for rotation within an angled outer tubular member with the flexible region disposed within a bend in the outer tubular member and a cutting configuration carried at a distal end of the tubular body exposed by a cutting port in a distal end of the outer tubular member. The step of securing may involve positioning a heat shrinkable sleeve over the helically cut length portion of the tubular body with an adhesive disposed between the sleeve and the outer surface of the tubular body, and applying heat to shrink the sleeve diametrically over the tubular body.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An angled tissue cutting instrument <b>10</b> according to the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and comprises an elongate angled outer tubular member <b>12</b> and an elongate flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> for being rotatably disposed in angled outer tubular member <b>12</b>. The angled outer tubular member <b>12</b> is typically made of stainless steel and includes a distal end <b>16</b>, a proximal end <b>18</b> and a central longitudinal axis <b>19</b> that follows a non-straight or angled longitudinal path. The proximal end <b>18</b> is typically attached to an outer member hub <b>20</b>, which may be made of plastic. An opening is formed in the distal end <b>16</b> and defines a cutting port or window <b>22</b> providing communication with the lumen of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> from externally of distal end <b>16</b>. The cutting port <b>22</b> can have various configurations and may be circumscribed by a peripheral edge. The peripheral edge that circumscribes the cutting port <b>22</b> can be a non-cutting edge or a cutting edge as depicted for outer tubular member <b>12</b>, which has a peripheral cutting edge <b>23</b> circumscribing the cutting port <b>22</b>. The cutting edge <b>23</b> can have various configurations to cut anatomical tissue including a series of cutting teeth on opposite sides of axis <b>19</b> as shown for cutting edge <b>23</b>. The outer member hub <b>20</b> may have a connector <b>24</b> in communication with the lumen of the angled outer tubular member <b>12</b> by which irrigating fluid may be supplied to the lumen of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Angled outer tubular member <b>12</b> has one or more bends, curves or angles <b>26</b>, each of which may be of various magnitudes and radii of curvature and may extend in various directions at various locations along the length of the outer tubular member <b>12</b>. Angled outer tubular member <b>12</b> has a single bend <b>26</b> and includes a straight proximal length portion <b>28</b> extending distally from outer member hub <b>20</b> to the bend <b>26</b> which is adjacent, near or close to the distal end <b>16</b>. The central longitudinal axis <b>19</b> of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> is contained in a plane, with the bend <b>26</b> extending downwardly in this plane from the proximal length portion <b>28</b> looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, it should be appreciated that the central longitudinal axis <b>19</b> of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> does not have to lie in or be contained in a plane and that the bend <b>26</b> may extend upwardly, downwardly or laterally from the proximal length portion <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> includes a distal end <b>30</b>, a proximal end <b>32</b> and a central longitudinal axis <b>33</b> of variable configuration due to flexibility of the inner tubular member <b>14</b>. The proximal end <b>32</b> is typically attached to an inner member hub <b>34</b>, which may be made of plastic. The distal end <b>30</b> carries a cutting configuration <b>36</b> that may have various configurations to cut anatomical tissue. An opening is formed through the distal end <b>30</b> and defines an aspiration or suction port <b>38</b> in communication with an aspiration or suction passage defined by the lumen <b>40</b> of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b>. The aspiration port <b>38</b> may have various configurations and may be disposed at various locations on the inner tubular member <b>14</b>. The cutting configuration <b>36</b> may comprise a cutting edge circumscribing the aspiration port <b>38</b> as depicted for flexible inner tube member <b>14</b>. In particular, the cutting configuration <b>36</b> illustrated for flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> comprises a peripheral cutting edge circumscribing the aspiration port <b>30</b> and comprising a series of cutting teeth on opposite sides of axis <b>33</b>. In the case of angled tissue cutting instrument <b>10</b>, the cutting configuration <b>36</b> of the inner tubular member <b>14</b> cooperates with the cutting edge <b>23</b> of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> to cut anatomical tissue. However, it should be appreciated that the cutting configuration <b>36</b> of the inner tubular member <b>14</b> can cut anatomical tissue independently, without there being a cooperating cutting edge on the outer tubular member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The outer and inner member hubs <b>20</b> and <b>34</b> are ordinarily coupled with a powered surgical handpiece (not shown) for rotating the inner tubular member <b>14</b> relative to and within the outer tubular member <b>12</b>. The powered surgical handpiece maintains the longitudinal position of the outer and inner members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> relative to one another so that the cutting configuration <b>36</b> is exposed by or from the cutting port <b>22</b> to access and cut anatomical tissue as the inner tubular member <b>14</b> is rotated within the outer tubular member <b>12</b>. A representative powered surgical handpiece is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,231 to Bays, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. As described above, the outer member <b>12</b> may have a cutting edge <b>23</b> that cooperates with the cutting configuration <b>36</b> to effect tissue cutting. There is sufficient annular space between the inner diameter of outer member <b>12</b> and the outer diameter of inner member <b>14</b> to define an irrigation channel between the outer and inner members for the flow of irrigating fluid supplied to the lumen of the outer member <b>12</b> through connector <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to access anatomical tissue in a cutting procedure, the angled tissue cutting instrument <b>10</b> is typically introduced through a natural or surgically created anatomical opening or passage in a patient's body to position the distal end <b>16</b> of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> at a cutting site in the patient's body while the handpiece is maintained externally of the patient's body. Exposure of the cutting configuration <b>36</b> by or from the cutting port <b>22</b> allows anatomical tissue at the cutting site to be accessed and cut by the cutting configuration. The aspiration port <b>38</b> establishes communication between the cutting site and the lumen or aspiration passage <b>40</b> of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> and, when suction is produced in the lumen <b>40</b>, typically via the handpiece, materials such as tissue debris are drawn into the lumen <b>40</b> via the aspiration port <b>38</b> for aspiration from the patient's body. Where the cutting configuration <b>36</b> comprises a cutting edge circumscribing the aspiration port <b>38</b>, the cutting configuration and aspiration port register with the cutting port <b>22</b>, and the cutting edge <b>23</b> if provided, as the inner member <b>14</b> rotates within the outer member <b>12</b>. Irrigating fluid may be supplied to the irrigation channel between the outer and inner tubular members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> for discharge at the cutting site through the cutting port <b>22</b>. A source of irrigating fluid may be coupled with the connector <b>24</b> to supply the irrigating fluid to the lumen of outer member <b>12</b> for flow between the inner diameter of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> and the outer diameter of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> has one or more flexible regions <b>42</b> for transmitting torque to rotate the cutting configuration <b>36</b> when the inner member <b>14</b> is rotated relative to and within the outer member <b>12</b> in forward and reverse rotational directions, while allowing the inner tubular member <b>14</b> to conform to the angled configuration of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> as it is rotated therein. The flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> has one flexible region <b>42</b> of sufficient length to extend within the bend <b>26</b> so that the inner tubular member <b>14</b> conforms to the bend <b>26</b> while being rotatable within the outer tubular member <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the flexible region <b>42</b> is disposed at a location along the length of the inner tubular member <b>14</b> in correspondence with the bend <b>26</b> in the outer tubular member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> illustrate the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> as well as a method of fabricating the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> comprises an elongate inner tube <b>44</b>, which may be made of stainless steel, presenting an elongate tubular body <b>45</b> extending between distal end <b>30</b> and proximal end <b>32</b>. The proximal end <b>32</b> of the inner tubular member <b>14</b> may be defined by a rearward or proximal end of the inner tube <b>44</b>. The inner tube <b>44</b> may be knurled along the proximal end <b>32</b> to facilitate attachment of the inner tube <b>44</b> to the inner member hub <b>34</b>. The distal end <b>30</b> of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> may be made of stainless steel and may be formed integrally, unitarily or monolithically with the inner tube <b>44</b> or as a separate component attached to a forward or distal end of the elongate body <b>45</b> of inner tube <b>44</b>. The lumen <b>40</b> of the inner tube <b>44</b> defines the aspiration passage of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b>. The distal end <b>30</b> may comprise a cutting tip, which may be hollow to establish communication between the aspiration port <b>38</b> and the lumen <b>40</b> through inner tube <b>44</b>. The inner tube <b>44</b> is longitudinally or axially straight and is of unbroken solid wall construction along the body <b>45</b>, and at least along the flexible region <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a continuous helical cut <b>46</b> is formed in the body <b>45</b> of inner tube <b>44</b> along a length portion of the body <b>45</b> corresponding to the flexible region <b>42</b>. The helical cut <b>46</b> is continuous from end to end and is formed in the inner tube <b>44</b> at a helix angle A in a first direction, i.e. clockwise (right hand) or counterclockwise (left hand), about the central longitudinal axis <b>33</b> of the inner tube <b>44</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The helical cut <b>46</b> is formed in the inner tube <b>44</b> in a stepped pattern, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, comprising repeating interconnected steps <b>48</b>. However, the helical cut <b>46</b> can be formed in various other patterns including a plain helix or spiral without any steps. Each step <b>48</b> includes a transverse or circumferential cut segment <b>50</b> extending transverse to the length of the inner tube <b>44</b> and its body <b>45</b> in the first direction about the axis <b>33</b> of the inner tube <b>44</b> and its body <b>45</b>, and a longitudinal cut segment <b>52</b> extending along the length of the inner tube <b>44</b> and its body <b>45</b> from the transverse cut segment <b>50</b> to the transverse cut segment <b>50</b> of the next step. The transverse cut segment <b>50</b> extends in the first direction about axis <b>33</b> at the helix angle A to a plane P perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis <b>33</b>. The transverse cut segment <b>50</b> and the longitudinal cut segment <b>52</b> of the step <b>48</b> meet at an outside corner <b>54</b> to form a step configuration. The longitudinal cut segment <b>52</b> extends from the transverse cut segment <b>50</b> at the outside corner <b>54</b> to meet the transverse cut segment <b>50</b> of the next step at an inside corner <b>56</b>. The transverse cut segment <b>50</b> meets the longitudinal cut segment of the previous step at the previous inside corner. The helical cut <b>46</b> may be of uniform pitch along the length portion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or may be of non-uniform pitch along the length portion to vary the flexibility of the inner tube <b>44</b> along the length portion.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each transverse cut segment <b>50</b> defines the helix angle A with a plane P perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis <b>33</b> of the inner tube <b>44</b>. The longitudinal cut segments <b>52</b> are shorter in length than the transverse cut segments <b>50</b>, and the longitudinal cut segments <b>52</b> may be parallel to the central longitudinal axis <b>33</b>. The steps <b>48</b> repeat at about 120&#xb0; rotational intervals about the central longitudinal axis <b>33</b>, with the outside corner <b>54</b> rotationally offset about 120&#xb0; about axis <b>33</b> from the inside corner <b>56</b> of the previous step. In a preferred embodiment, the helix angle A is about 20&#xb0; in a left hand first direction. However, the helical cut <b>46</b> may extend in the right hand direction, and the helix angle A can be other than about 20&#xb0; in the left or right hand directions. Preferably, the helical cut <b>46</b> is formed in the inner tube <b>44</b> by laser cutting. The helical cut <b>46</b> may extend all the way to the cutting tip of the flexible inner tubular member to impart flexibility to the inner tube <b>44</b> adjacent the cutting tip. The helical cut <b>46</b> extends entirely through the wall thickness of inner tube <b>44</b> to impart flexibility while the inner tube remains materially and structurally interconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> further comprises a coating or layer of adhesive <b>58</b> disposed over the outer surface of the elongate body <b>45</b> of inner tube <b>44</b> along the helically cut length portion thereof corresponding to flexible region <b>42</b>. The coating or layer of adhesive <b>58</b> may be applied to the outer surface of inner tube <b>44</b> in various ways including spraying the adhesive on the outer surface of the inner tube. Representative but not limiting adhesives include 3M Hi-Strength <b>90</b> spray adhesive and 3M High-Tack <b>76</b> spray adhesive. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a mandrel <b>60</b> may be disposed within the lumen <b>40</b> of the inner tube <b>44</b> with a close fit and of sufficient length to extend within the helically cut length portion and prevent the adhesive <b>58</b> from entering the lumen <b>40</b> through the helical cut <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a heat shrinkable sleeve <b>62</b> position or disposed over the adhesively coated and helically cut length portion of the inner tube <b>44</b>. The sleeve <b>62</b> has an inner diameter receiving the outer diameter of the adhesively coated and helically cut length portion of inner tube <b>44</b> with a loose fit to facilitate sliding the sleeve <b>62</b> into position on the adhesively coated and helically cut length portion of the inner tube <b>44</b> corresponding to flexible region <b>42</b>. FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) shrink tubing may be used as the sleeve <b>62</b>. Other materials which may be suitable for sleeve <b>62</b> include polyester and polyolefin as well as other heat shrinkable materials. The sleeve <b>62</b> may have a wall thickness of about 0.010 inch and may have any suitable shrink ratio to obtain a close or snug fit over the inner tube <b>44</b> in response to the application of heat as described below. As an example, the sleeve <b>62</b> may have a 1.3 to 1 shrink ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts heat being applied to the sleeve <b>62</b> to shrink the sleeve diametrically to obtain a close or snug fit with the outer surface of inner tube <b>44</b> along the length portion. Heat can be applied in various ways including the use of induction heaters and heat guns. The heat shrunk sleeve <b>62</b> sandwiches the adhesive <b>58</b> between the outer surface of the inner tube <b>44</b> and the inner diameter of the sleeve <b>62</b>, and the mandrel <b>60</b> may be used to prevent the adhesive from entering lumen <b>40</b> through helical cut <b>46</b>. The adhesive <b>58</b> is bonded to the inner tube <b>44</b> and the sleeve <b>62</b>. The flexible region <b>42</b> of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> thusly comprises the helically cut length portion of inner tube <b>44</b> corresponding to flexible region <b>42</b>, and a continuous solid flexible surface secured to the outer surface of the elongate body <b>45</b> along the helically cut length portion. The flexible surface may comprise sleeve <b>62</b>, and the flexible surface may be secured to the outer surface of the inner tube <b>44</b> via the layer of adhesive <b>58</b> disposed between the flexible surface and the outer surface of the inner tube.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The flexible region <b>42</b> is capable of transmitting torque to rotate the cutting configuration <b>36</b> when the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> is disposed within the outer tubular member <b>12</b> while allowing the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> to conform to the angled configuration of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> as it is rotated therein. The flexible region <b>42</b> is capable of transmitting torque when the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> is rotated relative to and within the angled outer tubular member <b>12</b> in both forward and reverse rotational directions. The bond between adhesive <b>58</b> and the inner tube <b>44</b> and the sleeve <b>62</b> reduces wind-up of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> in that clockwise and counterclockwise movements are restricted. Also, the heat shrunk sleeve <b>62</b> prevents the inner tube <b>44</b> from unwinding. The heat shrunk sleeve <b>62</b> is disposed over the entire helically cut length portion of the inner tube <b>44</b> and is bonded to the inner tube <b>44</b> such that the flexible region <b>42</b> replicates a solid wall tube construction in that no spaces or openings are presented along the outer surface of the flexible region <b>42</b>. The wall thickness of the flexible region <b>42</b> comprises the wall thickness of the helically cut length portion of inner tube <b>44</b>, the nominal thickness of adhesive <b>58</b> and the wall thickness of heat shrunk sleeve <b>62</b>. Thus, the flexible region <b>42</b> comprises an inner wall, corresponding to the helically cut length portion of inner tube <b>44</b>, along the inner diameter of the inner tubular member <b>14</b>, and an outer wall, corresponding to solid surface <b>62</b> covering the helically cut length portion, along an outer diameter of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b>. The wall thickness of the flexible region <b>42</b> is solid along its outer surface or diameter due to the solidity of the outer wall corresponding to solid surface or sleeve <b>62</b>. Since there are no openings or spaces which go entirely through the wall thickness of flexible region <b>42</b> and since there are no openings or spaces along the outer surface or diameter of flexible region <b>42</b> which are in communication with the lumen <b>40</b>, suction produced in the lumen or aspiration passage <b>40</b> is not lost through the wall thickness of the flexible region <b>42</b>. Furthermore, irrigating fluid supplied between the angled outer tubular member <b>12</b> and the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> is not drawn into the lumen <b>40</b> along the flexible region <b>42</b> and body <b>45</b> of the inner tube <b>44</b> since there are no openings or spaces through the entire wall thickness of the flexible region <b>42</b> by which the irrigating fluid may enter the lumen <b>40</b>. Aspiration efficiency is thusly increased in the angled tissue cutting instrument <b>10</b> in that the suction force in the aspiration passage <b>40</b> is more effectively applied at the aspiration port <b>38</b> without loss of suction along the body <b>45</b> of the flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b>. Irrigation efficiency is also increased in the angled tissue cutting instrument <b>10</b> since irrigating fluid flowing in the irrigation channel between the outer and inner members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is more effectively discharged from the cutting port <b>22</b> since irrigating fluid is not lost along the body <b>45</b> of the flexible inner tubular member by being drawn into the lumen <b>40</b>. The flexible inner tubular member <b>14</b> and, therefore, the angled tissue cutting instrument <b>10</b>, can be fabricated at lower cost due to savings in materials and labor over prior flexible inner tubular members for angled tissue cutting instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">An alternative angled tissue cutting instrument is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> at <b>110</b>. Angled tissue cutting instrument <b>110</b> is similar to angled tissue cutting instrument <b>10</b> except that angled outer tubular member <b>112</b> for angled tissue cutting instrument <b>110</b> has two bends <b>126</b> and flexible inner tubular member <b>114</b> of angled tissue cutting instrument <b>110</b> has two flexible regions <b>142</b> in correspondence with the bends <b>126</b>, respectively. The bends <b>126</b> may have the same or different angles and/or radii of curvature and may extend in the same or different directions at various locations along the outer tubular member <b>112</b>. In the angled tissue cutting instrument <b>110</b>, the proximal bend <b>126</b>A has a greater angle and a greater radius of curvature than the angle and radius of curvature of the distal bend <b>126</b>B. Looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the proximal bend <b>126</b>A extends downwardly while the distal bend <b>126</b>B extends upwardly in the plane of axis <b>119</b>. However, it should be appreciated that the bends <b>126</b>A, <b>126</b>B can extend upwardly, downwardly, or laterally and do not have to be contained in the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Flexible inner tubular member <b>114</b> comprises proximal flexible region <b>142</b>A and distal flexible region <b>142</b>B corresponding to the proximal and distal bends <b>126</b>A and <b>126</b>B, respectively. Each flexible region of the inner tubular member <b>114</b> is constructed in the same manner as the flexible region <b>42</b> and comprises a helically cut length portion of the inner tube <b>144</b> corresponding to the flexible region, a layer or coating of adhesive along the helically cut length portion of the inner tube <b>144</b>, and a heat shrunk sleeve <b>162</b> diametrically shrunk over the adhesively coated helically cut length portion. The flexible inner tubular member <b>114</b> is rotatably disposed within the angled outer tubular member <b>112</b> with the flexible regions <b>142</b>A and <b>142</b>B disposed within the bends <b>126</b>A and <b>126</b>B, respectively, to transmit torque to the cutting configuration <b>136</b> when the flexible inner tubular member <b>114</b> is rotated within the angled outer tubular member <b>112</b>, and the flexible regions <b>142</b>A, <b>142</b>B allow the inner tubular member <b>114</b> to confirm to the angled configuration of the outer tubular member <b>112</b> as it is rotated therein.</p>
