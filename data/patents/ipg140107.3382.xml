<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a stage apparatus, and more particularly, it relates to a stage apparatus moving a sample in a prescribed direction in a horizontal plane by a linear motor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a stage apparatus moving a sample in a prescribed direction in a horizontal plane by a linear motor is known. Such a stage apparatus moving a sample in a prescribed direction in a horizontal plane by a linear motor is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-102279, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-102279, there is disclosed a reticle stage (stage apparatus) including a reticle fine movement stage (movable table) holding a reticle (sample), driven finely in a horizontal plane and a reticle rough movement stage arranged below the reticle fine movement stage. This reticle rough movement stage is driven with a movement amount larger than that of the reticle fine movement stage in a Y-axis direction in the horizontal plane. In the reticle stage according to Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-102279, a pair of linear motors to drive the reticle rough movement stage in the Y-axis direction are provided. The pair of linear motors are arranged outside the reticle rough movement stage to hold the reticle rough movement stage therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-102279, the linear motors to move the reticle (sample) in the Y-axis direction in the horizontal plane are arranged outside the reticle rough movement stage to hold the reticle rough movement stage therebetween, and hence an arrangement space for the linear motors is required outside an arrangement space for the reticle rough movement stage, so that there is such inconvenience that the reticle stage (stage apparatus) increases in size. Therefore, it is difficult to downsize the stage apparatus (reticle stage) in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-102279.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been proposed in order to solve the aforementioned problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide a stage apparatus capable of being downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to attain the aforementioned object, a stage apparatus according to an aspect of the present invention includes a movable table to hold a sample, a levitation unit to operate the movable table at least in the vertical direction, including a levitation unit movable element and a levitation unit stator, and a linear motor to operate the movable table in a first horizontal direction in a horizontal plane, including a linear motor movable element arranged inside the movable table and a linear motor stator arranged inside the movable table.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the stage apparatus according to the aspect of the present invention, as hereinabove described, the linear motor to operate the movable table in the first horizontal direction in the horizontal plane is provided, and the linear motor movable element and the linear motor stator of the linear motor are arranged inside the movable table. Thus, no arrangement space for the linear motor may be provided outside an arrangement space for the movable table, dissimilarly to a case where the linear motor movable element and the linear motor stator are arranged outside the movable table, and hence the outside dimension of the stage apparatus in the horizontal direction can be reduced. Consequently, the stage apparatus can be downsized.</p>

The stage apparatus <b>1</b> is arranged on the upper surface of the anti-vibration table <b>2</b> for a stage apparatus. The stage fixed portion <b>12</b> is an example of the &#x201c;stator supporting member&#x201d;, and the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> are examples of the &#x201c;levitation unit&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The movable table <b>11</b> has a function of holding a mask (photomask) <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to transfer a circuit pattern on the lower surface thereof. The movable table <b>11</b> is configured to be capable of operating in six directions of the direction X in the horizontal plane, the direction Y orthogonal to the direction X in the horizontal plane, the vertical direction (direction Z), a direction about an X axis (&#x3b8;x), a direction about a Y axis (&#x3b8;y), and a direction about a Z axis (&#x3b8;z), as described later. In other words, the movable table <b>11</b> is configured to be capable of being controlled with six degrees of freedom. Thus, the mask <b>16</b> held on the lower surface of the movable table <b>11</b> can be moved with six degrees of freedom. The mask <b>16</b> is an example of the &#x201c;sample&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the movable table <b>11</b> has a horizontal divider <b>111</b> extending in the direction X and a vertical divider <b>112</b> orthogonal to the horizontal divider <b>111</b> at a central portion of the horizontal divider <b>111</b> in the direction X, as viewed from the direction Y.

The flange portions <b>114</b> are examples of the &#x201c;protrusion portion&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The horizontal divider <b>111</b> is in the form of a flat plate arranged horizontally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The horizontal divider <b>111</b> is formed to extend in the direction Y. The vertical divider <b>112</b> is in the form of a flat plate arranged vertically. The vertical divider <b>112</b> is formed to extend in the direction Y. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the horizontal divider <b>111</b> and the vertical divider <b>112</b> are arranged to be orthogonal to each other at the central portion, as viewed from the direction Y. The movable table <b>11</b> is so configured that the center of gravity thereof is located at an intersection portion of the horizontal divider <b>111</b> and the vertical divider <b>112</b>, as described later.</p>

The pair of side wall portions <b>113</b> are formed to extend in the direction Y. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the side wall portions <b>113</b> are formed with a plurality of openings <b>113</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the weight of the side wall portions <b>113</b> can be reduced to reduce the weight of the movable table <b>11</b>. The pair of side wall portions <b>113</b> are provided with inclined portions <b>113</b><i>b </i>whose upper portions are inclined downward and outward on both end portions of the pair of side wall portions <b>113</b> in the direction Y, as viewed from the direction X.</p>

The flange portions <b>114</b> each have such a shape that the vertical height thereof gradually increases from the outside toward a base thereof. In other words, the lower surfaces <b>114</b><i>b </i>of the flange portions <b>114</b> each are formed in the form of an inclined surface inclined obliquely downward from the outside toward the base. Thus, the section stiffness of the flange portions <b>114</b> in the vicinity of the bases can be increased, and hence the flange portions <b>114</b> can be inhibited from warping in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a lower frame <b>115</b> is provided on the lower side of the vertical divider <b>112</b> and the pair of side wall portions <b>113</b>, and an upper frame <b>116</b> is provided on the upper side of the vertical divider <b>112</b> and the pair of side wall portions <b>113</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the movable portion main frame constituted by the horizontal divider <b>111</b>, the vertical divider <b>112</b>, the side wall portions <b>113</b>, and the flange portions <b>114</b> is integrally formed of a ceramic member, whereby the movable portion main frame is formed of a ceramic member having high specific stiffness, and hence the specific stiffness of the overall movable table <b>11</b> can be increased. Thus, the movable table <b>11</b> can be inhibited from being deformed by the thrust of the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> and the linear motor units <b>15</b>, and hence the movable table <b>11</b> can be accurately operated. The lightweight ceramic member is employed, whereby the overall movable table <b>11</b> is reduced in weight, and the movable table <b>11</b> can be operated by smaller thrust. Thus, the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> and the linear motor units <b>15</b> can be downsized, and hence the stage apparatus <b>1</b> can be downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> that is magnetically levitated is provided, whereby air gaps (intervals) between the levitation unit movable elements <b>141</b> and the levitation unit stators <b>142</b> can be increased as compared with a case where air bearings having very small air gaps are employed. Thus, contact of the levitation unit movable elements <b>141</b> with the levitation unit stators <b>142</b> can be avoided so that the movable table <b>11</b> can be operated at high speed, even if the size of the intervals between the levitation unit movable elements <b>141</b> and the levitation unit stators <b>142</b> varies when the movable table <b>11</b> is operated at high speed and high acceleration. Furthermore, no apparatus, plumbing installation, or the like to supply air may be provided, dissimilarly to a case where air bearings are employed, and hence the stage apparatus <b>1</b> can be further downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the four magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> are arranged to surround the center of gravity of the movable table <b>11</b> in plan view, whereby the resultant force (action center) of the thrust of the four magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> can be easily caused to act on the vicinity of the center of gravity of the movable table <b>11</b>, and hence the operating accuracy of the movable table <b>11</b> can be easily improved.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> are mounted on the flange portions <b>114</b> provided to protrude to the outside of the movable table <b>11</b>, whereby the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> can be easily arranged outside the motor placement spaces <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the movable table <b>11</b> where the linear motor units <b>15</b> are arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the flange portions <b>114</b> are so formed that the vertical heights thereof gradually increase from the forward ends toward the bases, whereby the section stiffness of the flange portions <b>114</b> in the vicinity of the bases can be increased, and hence the flange portions <b>114</b> can be inhibited from warping in the vertical direction. Consequently, the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> mounted on the flange portions <b>114</b> can more stably operate the movable table <b>11</b> in the direction Z.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> are configured to be capable of being driven in the direction X in the horizontal plane orthogonal to the direction Y as well as being driven in the vertical direction (direction Z), whereby the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> can operate the movable table <b>11</b> both in the direction X and in the direction Z, and hence a drive unit to operate the movable table <b>11</b> in the direction Z and a drive unit to operate the same in the direction X may not be provided individually. Thus, the linear motor units <b>15</b> and the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> enable six-degree-of-freedom driving in the direction X, the direction Y, the direction Z, the direction about the X axis (&#x3b8;x), the direction about the Y axis (&#x3b8;y), and the direction about the Z axis (&#x3b8;z) while the stage apparatus <b>1</b> is downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the position of the center of gravity of the movable table <b>11</b>, the action center position of the thrust in the direction Y of the linear motor units <b>15</b>, and the action center position of the thrust in the direction X of the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> are positioned at the same height in the vertical direction, whereby the thrust in the direction Y of the linear motor units <b>15</b> can inhibit generation of the moment about the axis in the direction X while the thrust in the direction X of the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> can inhibit generation of the moment about the axis in the direction Y. Thus, it is not necessary to control the thrust in the vertical direction (direction Z) of the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> to maintain the posture of the movable table <b>11</b>, and hence it is not necessary to perform complicated control on the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b>. Consequently, the movable table <b>11</b> can be stably operated in the direction X and the direction Y easily.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the adjustment weight <b>116</b><i>a </i>to finely adjust the position of the center of gravity of the movable table <b>11</b> is provided, and the adjustment weight <b>116</b><i>a </i>is configured to be capable of performing a fine adjustment so that the position of the center of gravity of the movable table <b>11</b>, the action center position of the thrust in the direction Y of the linear motor units <b>15</b>, and the action center position of the thrust in the direction X of the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> are positioned at the same height in the vertical direction. Thus, the adjustment weight <b>116</b><i>a </i>can accurately perform a fine adjustment so that the position of the center of gravity of the movable table <b>11</b>, the action center position of the thrust in the direction Y of the linear motor units <b>15</b>, and the action center position of the thrust in the direction X of the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> are positioned at the same height, and hence the thrust in the direction Y of the linear motor units <b>15</b> can inhibit generation of the moment about the axis in the direction X while the thrust in the direction X of the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> can inhibit generation of the moment about the axis in the direction Y. Consequently, the movable table <b>11</b> can be more stably operated in the direction X and the direction Y.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to the first embodiment, as hereinabove described, the stopper function portions <b>19</b> each limiting the operating range of the movable table <b>11</b> are provided, whereby the stopper function portions <b>19</b> can inhibit contact of the levitation unit movable elements <b>141</b> with the levitation unit stators <b>142</b> and contact of the linear motor movable elements <b>151</b><i>b </i>to <b>154</b><i>b </i>(<b>151</b><i>c </i>to <b>154</b><i>c</i>) with the linear motor stators <b>151</b><i>a </i>to <b>154</b><i>a</i>, and hence the magnetic levitation units <b>14</b> and the linear motor units <b>15</b> can be inhibited from breakage.</p>

The levitation origin auxiliary member <b>201</b> is placed in the vicinity of a central portion of the upper frame <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The pair of upper linear actuators <b>202</b> are mounted on the inner surface (surface in the direction Y<b>2</b>) of a front surface portion <b>123</b> of a stage fixed portion <b>12</b> and the inner surface (surface in the direction Y<b>1</b>) of a rear surface portion <b>124</b> of the stage fixed portion <b>12</b>. Furthermore, the pair of upper linear actuators <b>202</b> are placed in the vicinity of an upper end portion of the front surface portion <b>123</b> of the stage fixed portion <b>12</b> and an upper end portion of the rear surface portion <b>124</b> of the stage fixed portion <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, the operation to move the movable table <b>11</b> to the vicinity of the prescribed levitation origin position in the range of movement with the levitation auxiliary mechanism <b>200</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref> to <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At the time when the stage apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>is started, the movable table <b>11</b> is in a state where the same is placed on stopper stators <b>192</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In this state, the upper bar <b>204</b> and the lower bar <b>205</b> are separated from the levitation origin auxiliary member <b>201</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Then, the pair of upper linear actuators <b>202</b> are driven to operate the upper bar <b>204</b> downward and bring the upper bar <b>204</b> into contact with the upper surface of the levitation origin auxiliary member <b>201</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.

At this time, the output of the lower linear actuators <b>203</b> is made larger than the output of the upper linear actuators <b>202</b> thereby lifting the movable table <b>11</b> upward.
