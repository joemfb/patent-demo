<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical modulators often use one or more Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These devices typically include electro-optic modulators. Such modulators have been implemented in various optical media, including silicon, compound semiconductors, and LiNbO<sub>3</sub>.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inventor has determined that some limitations of conventional modulators may be overcome by using a plurality of controllable optical microcavity resonators, e.g. ring resonators, optically coupled to a waveguide to modulate the phase of an optical carrier signal at each of a plurality of wavelengths. Such an assembly may form the basis of a compact and low power optical modulator that can provide QPSK (quadrature phase-shift keyed) modulation of a plurality of channels in a WDM (wavelength-division multiplexed) communication system. Some described embodiments are expected to be relatively robust to manufacturing variation by providing a quasi-static adjustment of the resonant frequency of each ring resonator to compensate for such variation. Some described embodiments may be formed on common and inexpensive semiconductor substrates, e.g. silicon wafers, using processing tools commonly used in semiconductor processing. Thus some embodiments are expected to be manufacturable for a lower cost than similar systems using other architectures, such as those using MZIs (March-Zehnder Interferometers).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Silicon has a relatively weak electro-optic response as compared to LiNbO<sub>3 </sub>and III-V semiconductors. This small response poses a significant challenge to using Si-based modulators employing a low-voltage silicon MZI. However, the inventor has realized that the electro-optic response of silicon may be sufficient for realization of effective and cost-effective optical modulators based on microcavity resonators. Moreover, low-voltage silicon modulators have the potential to significantly reduce the power consumption of some integrated photonic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an apparatus <b>100</b> is illustrated according to one embodiment, e.g. a WDM QPSK modulator. A 1&#xd7;2 coupler <b>110</b> receives an optical carrier signal <b>120</b> to be modulated, e.g. an unmodulated (CW) laser output having a plurality of WDM channel wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>2</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>3</sub>, . . . &#x3bb;<sub>m</sub>, or equivalently a plurality of WDM channel frequencies &#x192;<sub>1</sub>, &#x192;<sub>2</sub>, &#x192;<sub>3</sub>, . . . &#x192;<sub>m</sub>. In some embodiments the carrier signal <b>120</b> may already be modulated in a manner that is not incompatible with additional modulation applied by the apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier signal <b>120</b> may also include a frequency that is not a member of the set {&#x192;<sub>1</sub>, &#x192;<sub>2</sub>, &#x192;<sub>3</sub>, . . . &#x192;<sub>m</sub>} that has previously been modulated to transmit data.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An optical source <b>125</b> may produce the carrier signal <b>120</b>. The optical source <b>125</b> may include optical component(s), such as for example lasers and combiners, to produce the carrier signal <b>120</b>. In some embodiments the optical source <b>125</b> produces a frequency comb such as exemplified by a comb <b>127</b> with signal components at channel frequencies &#x192;<sub>1</sub>, &#x192;<sub>2</sub>, &#x192;<sub>3</sub>, . . . &#x192;<sub>m</sub>. The frequencies are not limited to any particular values, and may be in any wavelength band used in optical communications, e.g. in the S band (1460 nm-1530 nm), the C band (1530 nm-1565 nm) or the L band (1565 nm-1625 nm). Furthermore, the frequency components of the comb <b>127</b> may be spaced by a WDM grid spacing &#x394;&#x192;, e.g. a regular, about even spacing of the frequency components by a same frequency difference, e.g. about 100 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The coupler <b>110</b> may, e.g., split the carrier signal <b>120</b> about equally in power, directing a first carrier portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>to a first optical waveguide <b>130</b>, e.g. a planar or ridge waveguide. The coupler <b>110</b> directs a second carrier portion <b>120</b><i>b </i>to a second optical waveguide <b>140</b>, e.g. a planar or ridge waveguide. The core regions of the optical waveguides <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are surrounded by a cladding <b>145</b> that may include, e.g., an underlying dielectric material and/or an overlying dielectric material and/or air. In some embodiments a phase shifter <b>180</b> has a portion located in the optical path of the optical waveguide <b>140</b>. In the illustrated embodiment the phase shifter <b>180</b> is configured to impose a net phase shift on the carrier portion <b>120</b><i>b </i>of about &#x3c0;/2, e.g., &#x3c0;/2&#xb1;20% or more generally (&#x3c0;/2&#xb1;10%)+n&#x3c0;, wherein n=0, 1, 2 . . . . An optical combiner <b>170</b> receives the first and second signal portions from the optical waveguides <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> and combines these signal portions into an output signal <b>199</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The apparatus <b>100</b> includes a first set <b>150</b> and a second set <b>160</b> of microcavity resonators, e.g. ring resonators. For convenience the first and second sets <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> may be respectively referred to as ring resonators <b>150</b> and ring resonators <b>160</b>, and a single ring resonator may be referred to a ring resonator <b>150</b> or <b>160</b> when further differentiation is not needed. The ring resonators <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> each resonate at one of a series of resonant frequencies separated by the free spectral range (FSR) of that ring resonator. The resonant frequencies of a particular ring resonator may be determined from the optical properties of the ring core and cladding materials, and the geometry of the particular ring. In various embodiments the frequency range of light of the carrier signal <b>120</b> is typically constrained to be within one FSR period of the ring resonator having the smallest FSR. The FSR is typically inversely proportional to the optical path length of the ring resonator, so a smaller ring diameter will result in a larger FSR of the ring resonators <b>150</b> and <b>160</b>, easing the constraint on the carrier signal <b>120</b> frequency range. Thus, the frequency range of the carrier signal <b>120</b> may typically include only a single resonant frequency of each of the ring resonators <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>. This single resonant frequency may be referred to herein generally as &#x192;<sub>r</sub>. The first set <b>150</b> includes ring resonators <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>150</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>150</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . <b>150</b>-M having corresponding resonant frequencies near &#x192;<sub>1</sub>, &#x192;<sub>2</sub>, &#x192;<sub>3</sub>, . . . &#x192;<sub>m</sub>. The second set <b>160</b> includes ring resonators <b>160</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>160</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>160</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . <b>160</b>-M also having corresponding resonant frequencies near &#x192;<sub>1</sub>, &#x192;<sub>2</sub>, &#x192;<sub>3</sub>, . . . &#x192;<sub>m</sub>. By &#x201c;near&#x201d;, it is meant that the &#x192;<sub>r </sub>of each of the ring resonators <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> may be controlled as described below within a narrow range, which includes a corresponding WDM channel frequency, e.g. one of &#x192;<sub>1</sub>, &#x192;<sub>2</sub>, . . . &#x192;<sub>m</sub>. The range may be, e.g. less than about the grid spacing &#x394;&#x192;. In some embodiments, the range may be no greater than about 10% of &#x394;&#x192;.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments the ring resonators <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> are organized as ring resonator pairs, as illustrated, such that a pair includes a ring resonator from each of the sets <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> having about a same resonant wavelength and about aligned to an axis normal to the waveguides <b>130</b> and <b>140</b>. However, embodiments are not limited to such pairing. In the illustrated embodiment a first pair includes the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> and the ring-resonator <b>160</b>-<b>1</b> having a resonant frequency near &#x192;<sub>1</sub>. A second pair includes the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>2</b> and the ring-resonator <b>160</b>-<b>2</b> having a resonant frequency near &#x192;<sub>2</sub>. A third pair includes the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>3</b> and the ring-resonator <b>160</b>-<b>3</b> having a resonant frequency near &#x192;<sub>3</sub>. An M-th pair includes the ring resonator <b>150</b>-M and ring resonator <b>160</b>-M having a resonant frequency near &#x192;<sub>m</sub>. Embodiments are not limited to any particular number of ring resonators in the first and second ring resonator sets <b>150</b> and <b>160</b>. Furthermore, one or both of the sets <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> may include one or more ring resonators that are not matched by a ring resonator having a same resonant frequency in the other of the sets <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates a sectional view of the core of the waveguide <b>130</b> and a representative ring resonator <b>150</b>. For later reference, the core of the waveguide <b>130</b> and a segment of the optical core of the ring resonator <b>150</b> are shown as being separated by a lateral distance D. The waveguide <b>130</b> and the ring resonator <b>150</b> each have a width W and a height H. While the core of the waveguide <b>130</b> and the segment of the optical core of the ring resonator <b>150</b> are shown each having the same width, embodiments are not limited to such cases. The cores of the waveguide <b>130</b> and the ring resonator <b>150</b> may be formed from a semiconductor, e.g. silicon, over a substrate <b>210</b>, e.g. a silicon wafer. The cladding <b>145</b> may include a dielectric layer <b>220</b> located between the substrate <b>210</b> and the waveguide <b>130</b>, and between the substrate <b>210</b> and the waveguide ring resonator <b>150</b>. The cladding <b>145</b> may also include a dielectric <b>230</b> overlying the dielectric layer <b>220</b>. The dielectric layer <b>220</b> and the dielectric <b>230</b> serve as the cladding for the waveguide <b>130</b> and the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> such that optical signals are substantially confined in and guided by these structures.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A convenient platform on which to form the apparatus <b>100</b> is a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, but embodiments of the invention are not limited thereto. For example, a CVD dielectric layer, e.g. plasma oxide, could be formed on any suitable substrate, and a silicon layer could be formed thereover by any suitable method. Other embodiments may use a substrate formed from, e.g. glass, sapphire or a compound semiconductor. The dielectric <b>230</b> may be a suitable dielectric material, e.g. silicon oxide, silicon nitride, benzocyclobutene (BCB), or air. For the purpose of this disclosure, &#x201c;air&#x201d; includes vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The waveguide <b>130</b> and the ring resonator <b>150</b> may be formed from any conventional or nonconventional optical material system, e.g. silicon, LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, a compound semiconductor such as GaAs or InP, or an electro-optic polymer. Some embodiments described herein are implemented in Si as a nonlimiting example. While embodiments within the scope of the invention are not limited to Si, this material provides some benefits relative to other material systems, e.g. relatively low cost and well-developed manufacturing infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the ring resonators in the set <b>150</b> is optically coupled to the waveguide <b>130</b>. Each of the ring resonators in the set <b>160</b> is optically coupled to the waveguide <b>140</b>. Herein and in the claims, a ring resonator is defined as being optically coupled to a waveguide when that ring resonator is overcoupled or undercoupled to that waveguide, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As appreciated by those skilled in the optical component arts, light propagating within the waveguide <b>130</b> may couple, e.g., via evanescent coupling to the ring resonators of the set <b>150</b>, and light propagating within the waveguide <b>140</b> may couple to the ring resonators of the set <b>160</b>, e.g., via the coupling of evanescent light. By such coupling, a portion of the optical energy propagating in the waveguides <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> couples to the ring resonators <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>. The degree of coupling is dependent on, among other factors, the wavelength of the propagating light. When the optical path length of the microcavity resonator is an integer multiple of the wavelength of the coupled light, a relative maximum coupling may occur, producing a notch in the passband of the waveguide. As discussed further below, this notch response may be exploited for use in a low-power optical modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Herein a ring resonator and a proximate segment of waveguide, e.g. the adjacent segment of the ring resonator <b>150</b> and the waveguide <b>130</b>, are defined as being critically coupled when the coupling between them is about equal to the round-trip loss in the ring resonator. In this case, D=D<sub>c </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). For example, if the round trip loss is about 1 dB, the ring resonator <b>150</b> and the waveguide <b>130</b> are critically coupled when the coupling therebetween is also about 1 dB. In other words, about a 1 dB portion of an optical signal propagating in the waveguide proximate the ring resonator is transferred to the ring resonator by, e.g. evanescent coupling. When D&#x3c;D<sub>c </sub>the ring resonator and the waveguide are overcoupled, e.g. a greater portion of the signal is coupled from the waveguide to the ring resonator than is lost in one round trip of the coupled signal in the ring resonator. Conversely when D&#x3e;D<sub>c </sub>the ring resonator and the waveguide are undercoupled, e.g. the coupling is less than the round-trip loss in the ring resonator. As further provided below, when D is greater than a maximum coupling distance D<sub>max</sub>, the ring resonator and the waveguide may be regarded as uncoupled.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">These aspects are illustrated further by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>, in which the resonant frequency of an arbitrary ring resonator is about &#x192;&#x2032;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> respectively show simplified and nonlimiting amplitude and phase characteristics of a transfer function g<sub>uc</sub>(&#x192;) of a waveguide, e.g. the waveguide <b>130</b>, coupled to an adjacent segment of a ring resonator, e.g. the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>, for the case that the waveguide and ring resonator are undercoupled. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref> respectively show simplified and nonlimiting amplitude and phase characteristics of a transfer function g<sub>oc</sub>(&#x192;) of a waveguide, e.g. the waveguide <b>130</b>, coupled to a ring resonator, e.g. the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>, for the case that the waveguide and ring resonator are overcoupled.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The amplitude characteristics of the transfer functions g<sub>uc </sub>(&#x192;) and g<sub>oc </sub>(&#x192;) are qualitatively similar, each having a local minimum at &#x192;&#x2032; for both the undercoupled case (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and the overcoupled case (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). For the undercoupled case the phase of the transfer function g<sub>uc </sub>(&#x192;) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) increases from &#x3c6;<sub>o </sub>at &#x192;&#x3c;&#x3c;&#x192;&#x2032; to a local maximum &#x3c6;<sub>max </sub>at &#x192;&#x2032;&#x2212;&#x3b4; (where &#x3b4; is a small value, e.g. no greater than about 5% of &#x394;&#x192;), and from a local minimum &#x3c6;<sub>min </sub>at &#x192;&#x2032;+&#x3b4; to &#x3c6;<sub>o </sub>at &#x192;&#x3e;&#x3e;&#x192;&#x2032;.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As discussed further below, when &#x3c6;<sub>max</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c6;<sub>min </sub>is about &#x3c0; radians the coupling between the ring resonator <b>150</b> and the waveguide <b>130</b> may be exploited to produce BPSK (binary phase-shift keyed) modulation on a signal propagating in the waveguide <b>130</b>. In the overcoupled case &#x3c6;<sub>max</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c6;<sub>min </sub>is expected to always meet this condition. In the undercoupled case &#x3c6;<sub>max</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c6;<sub>min </sub>may be least about &#x3c0; when the coupling between the ring resonator and the waveguide is sufficiently strong, e.g. when D&#x2266;D<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Accordingly, herein and in the claims an optical waveguide and a microcavity resonator are &#x201c;optically coupled&#x201d; when they are overcoupled, critically coupled, or undercoupled. The term &#x201c;undercoupled&#x201d; with respect to a ring resonator and a proximate waveguide is defined as meaning that the ring resonator and the waveguide are not overcoupled, but are sufficiently coupled to produce a phase change in the transfer function of the waveguide of at least about &#x3c0; radians. A ring resonator whose core segments are distant enough from a waveguide, e.g. D&#x3e;D<sub>max </sub>such that any phase change of the transfer function produced by the ring resonator is less than about it radians is considered &#x201c;uncoupled&#x201d;.</p>

Those skilled in the art are familiar with forming resistive heater elements.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Now considering <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, illustrated are amplitude and phase characteristics of the transfer function of a waveguide, e.g. the waveguide <b>130</b>, which is undercoupled to a ring resonator, e.g. the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>. The following discussion is presented with reference to the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>. Based on this description, it will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the art that the described principles also may be applied to the other ring resonators. The ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> is configured to switch between a resonant frequency of &#x192;<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;&#x3b4; and &#x192;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b4; in response to application of control signals thereto. For the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>, an amplitude characteristic <b>610</b> and a phase characteristic <b>620</b> are associated with the lower resonant frequency at &#x192;<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;&#x3b4; (i.e., indicated as &#x192;<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), and a different amplitude characteristic <b>630</b> and a different phase characteristic <b>640</b> are associated with the higher resonant frequency at &#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b4; (i.e., indicated as &#x192;<sub>+</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Considering first the case in which the resonant frequency of the ring resonator is &#x192;<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;&#x3b4;, when the optical signal portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>having a frequency of &#x192;<sub>1 </sub>propagates within the waveguide <b>130</b>, the signal is attenuated by the amplitude characteristic <b>610</b> to a value <b>650</b>. The frequency of the optical signal is considered to correspond to the resonant frequency of the ring resonator by virtue of being about equal to the frequency at which the amplitude characteristics <b>610</b> and <b>630</b> intersect, e.g. &#x192;<sub>1</sub>. The phase of the signal is shifted by the phase characteristic <b>620</b> to a value <b>660</b> indicated as &#x3c6;<sub>&#x2212;</sub>. Now when the resonant frequency of the ring resonator is &#x192;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b4;, the signal is again attenuated by the amplitude characteristic <b>630</b> to about the same value <b>650</b>. However, the phase of the signal is shifted to a value <b>670</b> indicated as &#x3c6;<sub>+</sub> by the phase characteristic <b>640</b>. The size of &#x3b4; can be set such that the relative phase shift &#x3c6;<sub>&#x2212;</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c6;<sub>+</sub> is about &#x3c0; radians. Thus the propagating signal may be BPSK modulated by controllably switching the resonant frequency of the ring resonator between &#x192;<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;&#x3b4; and &#x192;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b4;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate amplitude and phase characteristics for an example case in which a waveguide, e.g. the waveguide <b>130</b>, is overcoupled to a controllable ring resonator, e.g. the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> during two different modulation states thereof. An amplitude characteristic <b>710</b> and a phase characteristic <b>720</b> respectively describe the amplitude reduction and phase shift produced by the coupling between the ring resonator and the waveguide when the resonant frequency &#x192;<sub>r </sub>of the ring resonator <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> is &#x192;<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;&#x3b4; (i.e., indicated as &#x192;<sub>&#x2212;</sub>). An amplitude characteristic <b>730</b> and a phase characteristic <b>740</b> respectively describe the amplitude reduction and phase shift produced by the coupling between the ring resonator and the waveguide when &#x192;<sub>r</sub>=&#x192;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b4; (i.e., indicated as &#x192;<sub>+</sub>). For both the amplitude characteristics <b>710</b> and <b>730</b> the propagated signal amplitude is reduced to a value <b>750</b> at the carrier frequency &#x192;<sub>1</sub>. For the case that &#x192;<sub>r</sub>=&#x192;<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;&#x3b4;, the phase shift of an optical carrier, at the frequency &#x192;<sub>1</sub>, is shown by the phase characteristic <b>720</b> as being &#x3c6;<sub>&#x2212;</sub> at reference <b>760</b>. For the case that &#x192;<sub>r</sub>=&#x192;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b4;, the phase shift of an optical carrier, at the frequency &#x192;<sub>1</sub>, is shown by the phase characteristic <b>740</b> as &#x3c6;<sub>max </sub>at reference <b>770</b>. As described previously, the value of &#x3b4; may be selected such that the relative phase shift &#x3c6;<sub>&#x2212;</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c6;<sub>+</sub> for the two different modulation states is about &#x3c0; radians. Thus, the optical carrier signal at carrier frequency &#x192;<sub>1 </sub>and propagating in the waveguide <b>130</b> may be BPSK modulated by such an operation on an over coupled ring resonator.</p>
