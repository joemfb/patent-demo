<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A child's hygienic product comprises a body of hygiene material having an exterior surface simulating a sports ball that is sized to fit the palm of a child's hand. The hygiene material's body has a through hole communicating with the exterior surface at spatially separated regions. A portion of a generally looped shaped cord or band of resiliently stretchable material is positioned within the through-hole, and the portion emerging from the spatially separated regions extends around the outside surface of the hygiene material's body in close proximity thereto. The band is sized to extend around the hand of the child when the hygiene material's body is held by the child to generally secure the hygiene material's body in a position adjacent the child's palm when the child is using the product.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/434,624 filed May 2, 2009, the priority of which is claimed, and the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to hygiene products and particularly to skin-contacting hygiene products for children such as soap, shampoo, combination soap/shampoo, body lotion, and deodorant.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Today, many young boys and girls spend much of their time playing their favorite sports. While they are highly involved and developing skills and agility and strength, they get pretty smelly and are not always interested in hygiene. This, as known to many parents, is particularly true of young boys, and the battle to get kids to take a meaningful bath or shower is one of the most universal experiences of parenthood.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, there are many hygiene products for adults which contain ingredients that are too strong, harsh or unpleasant in smell for children and teenagers. Adult hygiene products are often sized, shaped and scented inappropriately for children and teenagers and may not be easy to handle and use. Boys in particular are not very interested in products which they consider unmasculine or boring adult products.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A hygiene product for children comprises a skin-contacting body of hygiene material having an external surface simulating a sports ball and sized to fit a child's hand, together with a cord or band (hereinafter, collectively &#x201c;band&#x201d;) of material sufficiently reversibly stretchable to enable the band to be slide over the child's knuckles and yet sufficiently secure the ball adjacent the child's palm when the product is being used so that it is not dropped.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The band is preferably a closed loop, a portion of which is embedded within the body of hygiene material. The preferred configuration accordingly provides a band-accommodating through-hole within the body of hygienic material that enables the band to emerge from opposite sides of the body at positions that discourage the band from being pulled through the body during the life of the product. Moreover, any force exerted on the band during its mounting to, and removal from, the child's hand is distributed along the embedded length of the band, thereby minimizing the pressure (i.e., force per unit of area) exerted by the band against the body of hygiene material when the band is being mounted on, secured on or removed from the child's hand.</p>

The hygiene material body <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>F is sized to fit in a child's hand for applying the hygiene material to the child's body.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The preferred hygiene material accordingly contains non-caustic mild skin soothing ingredients for use on a child's body to sooth and not irritate the child's sensitive skin, and contains a mild scent less strong than adult scented hygiene products so that the scent is aromatically soothing and not overpowering to the child's sense of smell. The fragrance is preferably non-flowery scent appealing to a young boy when the product is aimed a that market segment. Preferably, the hygiene material contains a mixture of naturally occurring mild-to-the-skin ingredients (preferably organic) rather than harsh synthetic ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hygiene material is preferably molded in the shape of the simulated sports ball <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>F to impart the desired design topography to the simulated sports ball. The mold is preferably configured to provide a through-hole <b>31</b> through the simulated sports ball's body that communicates with the exterior surface of the body at generally diametrically opposite regions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An elasticized cord loop <b>30</b> passes through the through-hole, and extends around an outside surface of the simulated sports ball in close proximity thereto. The cord loop is sized to pass behind the child's hand when the hygiene material body is placed on or adjacent to the child's palm to generally help secure the hygiene material's body in the child's palm when the child is using the product, and generally prevent the child from dropping the hygiene material.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The cord is sufficiently elastic to permit it to pass over the child's knuckles as the hand is inserted through the space between the hygiene material and cord. The force exerted by the cord against the hygiene material during the insertion is dissipated along the embedded length of the cord, and is therefore less likely to move towards the outer surface of the hygiene material as a result of any forces arising from the passing of the cord over the child's knuckles, particularly in view of the degree of elasticity provided to the cord. The preferred emergence of the loop from diametrically opposite regions of the hygiene material's body maximizes the embedded length of cord over which the force is dissipated. Naturally, a lesser embedded length can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the through-hole may be formed by the cord itself rather than a machining or similar operation. For example, one half of hygiene material's body may be poured into a mold that gives the body its sports ball-simulating exterior surface, the portion of the band to be embedded in the body is then laid on top of the material, and a second mold of material forming the other half of the ball (or a quantity of molded material forming the other half of the ball) can then be brought into contact with the first half of the ball and cord to secure the cord therebetween and to complete formation of the ball.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The through-hole can alternatively be predefined by the mold or molds into which the hygiene material is placed for shaping and appropriate surface topography. For example, two hemispheres of a round ball can be separately molded, with each having a generally curved region extending across its diameter that will form its half of the through hole's wall when joined with a second hemisphere defining the other half of the through-hole wall. The portion of the cord to be embedded is the laid along the generally curved region, and the material forming the second hemisphere is then overlaid to form the completed ball, the two hemisphere being sealed in place by an appropriate binder, heat or other techniques known by manufacturers of such products to be effective for that purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An alternative embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> wherein a band <b>30</b>&#x2032; is utilized instead of a cord. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view of a hygiene product constructed in accordance with the invention wherein the hygiene material's body simulates a basketball, but it should be recognized that any other sports ball could be simulated without departing from the intended scope of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a top plan view of the hygiene product illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the hygiene product illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> taken along <b>15</b>-<b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In this embodiment, a resiliently stretchable band <b>30</b>&#x2032;, preferably formed from a slightly stretchable silicone material, extends through a generally slot-shaped through-hole <b>31</b> formed through the hygiene material's body <b>20</b> in any of the same manners suggested above with respect to the cord. The band <b>30</b>&#x2032; extends around the outside surface of the hygiene body in close proximity to the outside surface of the simulated sports ball. The band is loop-shaped, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and is sized to generally secure the hygiene material against or adjacent to the child's palm when the product is in use. In practice, a silicone band having a 700 mm diameter and a width w (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) of 100 mm is embedded in a round body of hygiene material having a 900 mm diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The band <b>30</b>&#x2032; has at least two advantages over the cord. First, it presents a flat surface against the body of hygiene material in the direction towards which it is pulled as the child's hand is inserted into the space between the hygiene material and band. This further minimizes the pressure ((i.e., force per unit of area) exerted against the hygiene material, further reducing the possibility that it will be pulled through the material during the hand-insertion or hand-removal steps. Second, the tactile sensation to the child is more akin to the strap of a baseball glove, further encouraging the child (especially baseball-worshipping boys) to use the product to get clean. Even better, the child may actually look forward to the bath or shower, knowing that (s)he will get to use the product.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While most sports balls are round, and the preferred placement of diametrically opposite regions from which the band or cord emerges is unambiguous, there are some sports balls such as football and rugby balls that are generally ovoid in shape. Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> which are perspective views of alternative embodiment of a hygiene product constructed in accordance with the invention when the simulated sports ball is generally ovoid. As illustrated in these Figures, the band (or cord) may emerge from diametrically opposite regions about a minor diameter of the ball (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) or from diametrically opposite regions about a major diameter of the ball (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). In both these Figures, the preferred position is shown as being on the largest major diameter and the largest minor diameter, since that positioning results in a centralized grip of the hygiene material by the child, and provides minimal pressure of the band against the hygiene material when the child's hand is inserted into or withdrawn from the space between the band and the soap. Of the two orientations, that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is preferred because (assuming both simulated sports balls are the same size) it provides the child with a smaller (and therefore easier) curved surface to grip while, at the same time, providing maximum embedded length of the band-shaped loop to minimum the band's pressure against the hygiene material when the child's hand is being inserted into or withdrawn from the space between the band and the soap</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-12</figref>, the child's hygiene product <b>10</b>B comprises a simulated sports ball <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>F comprising a skin soothing and moisturizing lotion containing natural skin soothing and moisturizing ingredients molded in the shape of a butterball lotion simulated sports ball <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>F sized to fit in a palm of a boy's hand. While the external surface of the product simulates the desired sports ball, no cord or band is necessary, and the product is accordingly illustrated without that feature.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The simulated sports ball <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>F of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-12</figref> preferably comprises a solid lotions bar or deodorant.</p>
