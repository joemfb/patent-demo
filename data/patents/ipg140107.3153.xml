<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/296,220, filed Jan. 19, 2010, entitled &#x201c;OPTOCOUPLER CIRCUIT FOR GATE DRIVER&#x201d;, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The application generally relates to using an optocoupler in applications having high voltage and/or high power circuits. The application relates more specifically to a system and method for using optocouplers to provide electrical isolation in gate driver circuits or boards in variable speed drives, where large common mode voltage transients occur between the input and output of the optocoupler.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An optocoupler includes a photo light-emitting diode (LED) and a photo-detector, or phototransistor between the LED and photo-detector. The optocoupler can be used for isolating two circuits. When an optocoupler is used in gate driver applications for high voltage and/or high power circuits, the isolating sides of the optocoupler may be exposed to high voltage, common mode transients.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An optocoupler has a common mode immunity rating that may be in the range of tens of kilovolts per microsecond (KV/&#x3bc;s). If common mode voltage transients exceed the common mode immunity rating, the optocoupler may fail. Optocoupler failure may result in the photo LED being switched on or off unintentionally. In sensitive applications, for example, a gate driver of a variable speed drive (VSD), unintentional switching of an optocoupler may result in a destructive shoot-through of the DC link voltage through the gated insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an optocoupler, the photo LED and photo-detector are not uncoupled electrically. Capacitive coupling may occur between the photo LED and the photo-detector. The coupling capacitance may be represented as a capacitor connected between each of the anode and cathode of the photo LED, and the output of the optocoupler. Thus, a large transient in the common mode voltage can result in current flowing to or from the anode or the cathode of the photo LED. The additional current due to common mode voltage transients can cause a photo LED to malfunction, e.g., to unintentionally turn on or off the photo detector.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Intended advantages of the disclosed systems and/or methods satisfy one or more of these needs or provide other advantageous features. Other features and advantages will be made apparent from the present specification. The teachings disclosed extend to those embodiments that fall within the scope of the claims, regardless of whether they accomplish one or more of the aforementioned needs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to an optocoupler circuit. The optocoupler circuit is arranged to minimize accidental turn on or turn off of the photo light-emitting diode (LED). The optocoupler circuit includes a first switch connected in parallel to the photo LED. The anode of the photo LED is connected to the power supply, and the photo LED is activated when the first switch is open. The cathode of the photo LED is connected to ground through a first resistor. The cathode of the photo LED is also connected in series with a second switch, a second capacitor and a second resistor to ground. The first switch and the second switch are arranged to operate in complementary states to prevent the second capacitor from discharging.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is also directed to a gate driver circuit including a complementary switches integrated circuit and an optocoupler circuit. The optocoupler circuit includes a first switch connected in parallel to the photo light-emitting diode (LED). The anode of the photo LED is connected to the power supply, and the photo LED is activated when the first switch is open. The cathode of the photo LED is connected to ground through a first resistor. The cathode of the photo LED is also connected in series with a second switch, a second capacitor and a second resistor. The first switch and the second switch are arranged to operate in complementary states to prevent the second capacitor from discharging.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, an optocoupler circuit includes a switch connected in parallel with a photo LED, the photo LED having an anode and a cathode. The anode is connected to a power supply via a decoupling capacitor. The optocoupler circuit is arranged so that the switch turns on the photo LED when in the open position.

The first switch and second switch operate in complementary states to prevent the cathode connected capacitor from discharging.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One advantage of the embodiments described herein is that optocouplers may be operated beyond their rated common mode immunity range.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another advantage of the embodiments described herein is the replacement of fiber-optic devices with optocouplers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic diagram of an optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> which includes a photo LED <b>20</b>. Optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> may be represented as including parasitic capacitors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> connected between the input section <b>16</b> of optocoupler circuit <b>10</b>, and the output section <b>18</b> of optocoupler circuit <b>10</b>. Line <b>30</b> represents an isolation barrier over which there is no electrical contact.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> may be controlled by a switch (SW<b>1</b>) <b>22</b> connected in parallel with photo LED <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, using switch <b>22</b> to control photo LED <b>20</b> provides immunity and/or protection from common mode transients when switch <b>22</b> is connected in parallel with photo LED <b>20</b>. Optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> includes an anode <b>24</b> of photo LED <b>20</b> connected to a power supply <b>26</b> via a decoupling capacitor <b>28</b> (C<sub>decoupler</sub>). In one embodiment, decoupling capacitor <b>28</b> may have a capacitance of about 0.1 micro-farads (&#x3bc;f). Opening switch <b>22</b> causes current to flow into photo LED <b>20</b> and the series resistor <b>32</b> to ground <b>34</b>, switching photo LED <b>20</b> into an active or &#x201c;on&#x201d; state. Closing switch <b>22</b> causes current to flow through the switch <b>22</b> and the series resistor <b>32</b> (R<sub>series</sub>) to ground <b>34</b>, and shunts current flow away from photo LED <b>20</b>, thus, switching photo LED <b>20</b> to the off state. In one embodiment, series resistor <b>32</b> may have a resistance value of about 169 ohms, although higher or lower resistance values may be used for series resistor <b>32</b>, provided that the current is directed through series resistor <b>32</b> rather than through photo LED <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Any current induced into anode <b>24</b> due to excessive common mode voltage transients are provided a direct path to power supply <b>26</b> and decoupling capacitor <b>28</b>, whether switch <b>22</b> is in either the on or off state. Accidental activation or deactivation of photo LED <b>20</b> is thus prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Any current induced into cathode <b>36</b> due to excessive common mode voltage transients can cause the optocoupler <b>10</b> to malfunction. The optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> may be analyzed under two different circumstances, one where current flows into the cathode <b>36</b> and the other when the current flows out of the cathode <b>36</b> of the photo LED <b>20</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, voltage transients induce current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>from </sub>from cathode <b>36</b> of photo LED <b>20</b>. If switch <b>22</b> is open, photo LED <b>20</b> is in the conductive state and current is flowing through photo LED <b>20</b>. Current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>from </sub>flowing from cathode <b>36</b> through coupling capacitor <b>14</b> can add current to photo LED <b>20</b>, which is the already in the conductive state. Thus, current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>from </sub>flowing from cathode <b>36</b> through coupling capacitor <b>14</b> cannot cause false triggering of optocoupler circuit <b>10</b>. If, however, switch <b>22</b> is in the closed state, current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>from </sub>drawn from cathode <b>36</b> of the photo LED can flow through switch <b>22</b>. Switch <b>22</b> may have resistance in a range of a few hundred milliohms, which is common in electrical switches. Because of the low resistance value of the closed switch <b>22</b>, the current flowing from cathode <b>36</b> has to be large for photo LED <b>20</b> to be activated by I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>from</sub>. In other words, the voltage drop across switch <b>22</b> caused by I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>from </sub>has to be as high as the forward bias voltage V<sub>F </sub>of the photo LED <b>20</b>, in order for photo LED <b>20</b> to be unintentionally activated. The current through parasitic input-output capacitor <b>14</b> has to be extremely high, e.g., in the range of a few amperes, for an optocoupler circuit to false trigger, i.e., for the switch <b>22</b> to drop a voltage as high as V<sub>F </sub>of the photo LED <b>20</b>. Typical values for parasitic input-output capacitance of optocouplers are in the pF range. Thus, the common mode voltage transient may have to be in the range of thousands of KV/&#x3bc;s for an accidental false triggering of photo LED <b>20</b> to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows voltage transients inducing a current I <sub>cathode into </sub>flowing into cathode <b>36</b> of photo LED <b>20</b>. Current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>into </sub>flows an into the series resistor <b>32</b> and adds to the voltage drop across series resistor <b>32</b> to decrease the voltage drop across the photo LED <b>20</b> and may cause photo LED <b>20</b> to turn off. Thus, there may be a tendency for photo LED <b>20</b> in an on state to switch to an off state unintentionally. For example, an increase in voltage drop in a range of a few tenths of a volt across the series resistor <b>32</b> can cause the photo LED to turn off unintentionally. Current through parasitic input-output capacitor <b>14</b> in the range of a few milliamperes can cause this additional voltage drop to occur across series resistor <b>32</b>. A typical value of parasitic input-output capacitance of optocouplers is in a range of a few pico-farads (pF). A relatively small common mode voltage transient, e.g., a few KV/&#x3bc;s, can result in milliamperes of current and cause an accidental turnoff of a turned on photo LED <b>20</b>. The situation of current flowing into cathode <b>36</b> of photo LED <b>20</b> when photo LED is turned on is of concern as relatively small common mode voltage transients can cause the optocoupler <b>10</b> to malfunction. If switch <b>22</b> is closed, current flowing into cathode <b>36</b> of photo LED <b>20</b> can flow through switch <b>22</b> and into decoupling capacitor <b>28</b>. The voltage drop across switch <b>22</b> induced by I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>into </sub>can increase the reverse bias voltage on photo LED <b>20</b>, and hence cannot affect the turned off state of photo LED <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an embodiment of an optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> that provides additional or increased immunity or protection from common mode voltage transients. A second capacitor, or cathode capacitor <b>38</b> (C<sub>Cathode</sub>) is connected to the cathode <b>36</b> of the photo LED <b>20</b>. Capacitor <b>38</b> is wired in series with a second switch <b>40</b> (SW<b>2</b>) and a current limiting resistor <b>42</b> (R<sub>limit</sub>) connected to ground <b>34</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, cathode capacitor <b>38</b> may have a capacitance value of about 0.1 micro-farad (&#x3bc;f), and current limiting resistor <b>42</b> may have a resistance value of about 15 ohm (&#x3a9;). The use of capacitor <b>38</b>, second switch <b>40</b> and current limiting resistor <b>42</b> can prevent unintentional turnoff for an optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> due to common mode voltage transients.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In order to increase common mode immunity of the optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> when photo LED <b>20</b> is on, cathode capacitor <b>38</b> cannot be connected directly between cathode terminal <b>36</b> of the photo LED <b>20</b> and ground <b>34</b>, as it would repeatedly charge and discharge every time the photo LED switches state. Cathode capacitor <b>38</b> is only required when photo LED <b>20</b> is in the on state and switch <b>22</b> is open. Hence cathode capacitor <b>38</b> is connected in series with a switch <b>40</b> that operates complementary to switch <b>22</b>, i.e., switch <b>40</b> is open when switch <b>22</b> is closed (photo LED is off), and switch <b>40</b> is closed when switch <b>22</b> is open (photo LED is on), thereby preventing the capacitor from discharging. Switches <b>22</b>, <b>40</b> may be any type of mechanical or electronic switch. In at least one embodiment switches <b>22</b>, <b>40</b> may be a complementary transistor pair which has a common input and interconnections such that one transistor is on when the other is off, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The additional switched R-C series circuit, i.e., cathode capacitor <b>38</b> and limiting resistor <b>42</b> can be used when switch <b>40</b> is closed. During the first switching event, switch <b>22</b> is in an open position and switch <b>40</b> in a closed position. Cathode capacitor <b>38</b> charges during an initial activation of photo LED <b>20</b>. To limit the peak current that can flow through photo LED <b>20</b> and cathode capacitor <b>38</b> during the initial charge, limiting resistor <b>42</b> is connected in series with cathode capacitor <b>38</b> and ground <b>34</b>. If switches <b>22</b>, <b>40</b> are not break-before-make type switches, then limiting resistor <b>42</b> may have a resistance value selected to limit the peak current through switches <b>22</b>, <b>40</b> to a desired level. The charging of cathode capacitor <b>38</b> initially may result in peak current in the photo LED <b>20</b>, which may cause photo LED <b>20</b> to malfunction or fail. The resistance value of resistor <b>42</b> should be selected to limit the peak current in photo LED <b>20</b> within specified ratings of photo LED <b>20</b>. After cathode capacitor <b>38</b> charges, cathode capacitor <b>38</b> can remain charged. Thereafter, current flow through photo LED <b>20</b> is determined by series resistor <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, cathode capacitor <b>38</b> may be a capacitor with low leakage current.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When switch <b>22</b> is open, a current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>from </sub>flows from power supply <b>26</b>, decoupling capacitor <b>28</b> and cathode capacitor <b>38</b> through the parasitic capacitor <b>14</b>. Current flowing from cathode capacitor <b>38</b> would be minimal as most of the current would be drawn from power supply <b>26</b> and capacitor <b>28</b> through the activated photo LED <b>20</b>, since photo LED <b>20</b> provides a path with the least impedance. The common mode immunity in this case will be unaffected by series R-C circuit <b>44</b>, and optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> will retain high common mode transient immunity ratings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the opposite case, current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>into </sub>is flowing into cathode terminal <b>36</b> from parasitic capacitance <b>14</b>. Optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> includes photo LED <b>20</b> activated by switch <b>22</b> when open, with current flowing into cathode <b>36</b>. Optocoupler circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> had lower immunity from common mode voltage transients when current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>into </sub>flowed into cathode <b>36</b>&#x2014;i.e., any current flowing into cathode <b>36</b> of the photo LED <b>20</b> would have flowed through series resistor <b>32</b> and increased the voltage drop across it, potentially causing photo LED <b>20</b> to turn off. In that case, a common mode voltage transient of a few KV/&#x3bc;s could have cause accidental turnoff of photo LED <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With the addition of series R-C circuit <b>44</b>, current flowing into cathode <b>36</b> of the photo LED has two paths to ground <b>34</b>, one path through series resistor <b>32</b> and another path through series R-C circuit <b>44</b>, i.e., cathode capacitor <b>38</b>, switch <b>40</b> and limiting resistor <b>42</b>. Most of the current flows through series R-C circuit <b>44</b>, the path with lower impedance defined by cathode capacitor <b>38</b>, switch <b>40</b> and limiting resistor <b>42</b>. Series R-C circuit <b>44</b> can have a characteristic impedance that is about 1/100<sup>th </sup>that of series resistor <b>32</b>. Thus, series R-C circuit <b>44</b> connected in parallel with series resistor <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will require a I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>into </sub>current about 100 times greater than the current I<sub>cathode</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>into </sub>for the original circuit <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, in order to generate the same voltage drop to cause a malfunction. Thus, the optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides immunity from common mode voltage transients that are about 100 times greater than the circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. Optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> with series R-C circuit <b>44</b> connected between cathode <b>36</b> and ground <b>34</b> thus provides improved common mode transient immunity, an increase from several KV/&#x3bc;s to several hundreds of KV/&#x3bc;s.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Series R-C circuit <b>44</b> thus provides optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> the ability to function at increased levels of common mode voltage transients.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a gate driver board circuit <b>50</b> for use in a VSD illustrates an exemplary embodiment and implementation of optocoupler circuit <b>10</b> with series R-C circuit <b>44</b>. In circuit <b>50</b>, a complementary switches integrated circuit (IC) <b>52</b>, e.g., &#x3c;1&#x3a9;CMOS 1.8 V to 5.5 V, dual SPST switch, Model No. ADG823, manufactured by Analog Devices, Inc.
