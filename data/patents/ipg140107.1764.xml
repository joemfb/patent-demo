<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Not Applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is in the area of devices that contain and support the male anatomy&#x2014;for example jockstraps, athletic supporters, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The prior art discloses various devices that contain and support the male anatomy. However, none of these patents exhibit the features of the present invention&#x2014;that is, an anatomy support device having a pouch, waistband, and side straps, wherein the top of the pouch, at the front and sides, are attached to the waistband, and at the rear of the top of the pouch, there is an opening hanging down from the waistband, and two side straps are attached to substantially the same place on this opening.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,839 to Weiss discloses a pouch supporter&#x2014;but the physical structure of this supporter differs significantly from the invention, in that Weiss's pouch only encloses the scrotum and not the penis. In addition, Weiss lacks any other supporting structure, such as a waistband or side straps&#x2014;and in fact, Weiss's purpose is to avoid supporting structure other than his single strap that cinches the top of the pouch closed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 1,119,944 to Fritsch; U.S. Pat. No. 3,504,671 to Nelkin; U.S. Pat. No. 5,243,974 to Allen; U.S. Pat. No. 860,584 to Teufel; U.S. Pat. No. 5,237,706 to Nalbandian; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,167 to Ebenal disclose supporters with side straps. However, in all these supporters, the side straps are attached at the bottom of the front panel&#x2014;i.e., the side straps are attached in a way that is significantly different from the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,094,234 to Searcy; U.S. Pat. No. 1,477,187 to Rayne; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,592 to Grizzaffi show supporters with straps that connect the top of the front panel or pouch to the waistband. However, in all these devices, the straps are attached in a manner that is significantly different from that of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Published Application 2007/0180600 (Allemann) shows a pouch for containing the male anatomy. However, Allemann does not disclose a waistband, side straps, or any other support structure. In fact, Allemann's fundamental purpose and objective is to avoid having a waistband, straps, or other support structure, and Allemann states this quite clearly in his disclosure. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,061,840 to Alligator shows a pouch for containing the male anatomy, but does not disclose side straps attached to substantially the same place on the bottom of an opening in the pouch, as in the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention is a support device for the male anatomy, comprising a pouch with an opening at the top for inserting the penis and testicles, a waistband to which the top front of the pouch is attached, and side straps. Each side strap is attached at one end to the waistband, and the side straps are attached at their other ends to substantially the same place on the top rear portion of the pouch.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The side strap attachment configuration of the invention provides the best combination of support and comfort. This is a counterintuitive and surprising result, because ordinarily one would expect that the best stability and support would come from attaching the side straps to the pouch in a manner such that the side straps are spaced apart from each other&#x2014;i.e., such that the side straps grip the top portion of the pouch at more than one place.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, because the top rear portion of the pouch of the invention can hang down somewhat, as opposed to the top front portion of the pouch which is affixed to the waistband, this better accommodates the wearer's anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the anatomy support device from the front perspective. It should be understood that when the ensuing description uses the terms &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d;, that refers to the wearer's left and right. Said another way, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, items on the left side of the view are on the right side from the wearer's perspective, and items on the right side of the view are on the left side from the wearer's perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0034">The device comprises a pouch <b>10</b> having a penile containment chamber <b>11</b>, a left testicle containment chamber <b>12</b>, and a right testicle containment chamber <b>13</b>. These chambers are adapted to contain the penis and testicles of the wearer. A substantial portion of pouch <b>10</b> is attached at the top front thereof to a waistband <b>14</b>, which in use encircles the midsection of the wearer's body. A left side strap <b>15</b> is attached at one end to the waistband and at the other end to the back of the pouch, as will be further described below. A right side strap <b>16</b> is attached at one end to the waistband and at the other end to the back of the pouch. Pouch <b>10</b>, waistband <b>14</b>, and left side strap <b>15</b> together bound a left leg opening <b>17</b>, into which the wearer inserts his left leg when donning the device. Pouch <b>10</b>, waistband <b>14</b>, and right side strap <b>16</b> together bound a right leg opening <b>18</b>, into which the wearer inserts his right leg when donning the device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the anatomy support device from the back or rear perspective. The components of the device are as described above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, it can be seen that waistband <b>14</b> forms a waist opening <b>19</b>, which in use contains the wearer's midsection. The top rear portion of pouch <b>10</b>, that is, the top portion of pouch <b>10</b> which is not attached to waistband <b>14</b>, has a hem <b>20</b> located thereon. It can be seen that the top rear portion of pouch <b>10</b> is open at pouch opening <b>21</b>, thus providing access to the interior of the pouch. Left side strap <b>15</b> and right side strap <b>16</b> are attached to hem <b>20</b> at the rear of pouch opening <b>21</b>, as will be more fully explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a right side view of the anatomy support device. It can be seen that the top rear portion of pouch <b>10</b>, being unattached to waistband <b>14</b>, hangs down somewhat in order to better accommodate the wearer's anatomy&#x2014;the testicles being below the base of the penis in the male anatomy. Right side strap <b>16</b> is attached at substantially the midpoint, front to rear, of waistband <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0037">It can be appreciated from the other views that the left side of the device is substantially the same as the right side&#x2014;that is, the left side view would be the same as the right side view, only &#x201c;flipped&#x201d; so that the pouch would be at the left side of the drawing page.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is another back view of the anatomy support device, showing in greater detail the anchoring of the side straps on the top rear hem of the pouch. Specifically, left side strap <b>15</b> and right side strap <b>16</b> are attached at substantially the same location on the top rear hem of the pouch, at side strap anchor point <b>22</b>. Side strap anchor point <b>22</b> is located at substantially the midpoint, from side to side, of hem <b>20</b>. Moreover, left side strap <b>15</b> and right side strap <b>16</b> are attached at side strap anchor point <b>22</b> in a cross-biased alignment. In other words, left side strap <b>15</b> and right side strap <b>16</b> are attached so that together they form substantially a right angle on the top rear hem of pouch <b>10</b>. Further, left side strap <b>15</b> and right side strap <b>16</b> are attached to the inner part of hem <b>20</b>&#x2014;that is, they are attached on the side of hem <b>20</b> that is proximate to the interior of pouch <b>10</b> when the device is in use on the wearer's body. These aspects promote optimal anchoring of the side straps, and optimal support and comfort for the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0039">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> view, the side straps are attached using stitches <b>23</b>; however, it should be understood that the attachment can be effected using other suitable means, including but not limited to adhesive, plastic or metal fasteners, and the like. Similarly, the front top of pouch <b>10</b>, and the ends of side straps <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> that are not proximate to pouch <b>10</b>, are attached to waistband <b>14</b> using stitches but may also be attached using other suitable means.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0040">Pouch <b>10</b> is preferably constructed of knitted fabric, with no exposed seams on the interior of the pouch for maximum comfort. Waistband <b>14</b> and side straps <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are preferably constructed of a suitably elastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0041">To use the device, the wearer inserts his left and right legs through left leg opening <b>17</b> and right leg opening <b>18</b> respectively, and pulls the device up his legs. When the device is proximate to the wearer's crotch, the wearer inserts his penis and testicles into penile containment chamber <b>11</b>, left testicle containment chamber <b>12</b>, and right testicle containment chamber <b>13</b> respectively, and adjusts waistband <b>14</b> comfortably about his midsection. The wearer's anatomy is thus firmly and comfortably supported during sporting or other activities.</p>
