<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to providing a network-based administration console to manage collective intelligence of administrators.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">&#x201c;Software as a Service&#x201d; (SaaS) is a software delivery model where a software vendor develops a web-native software application hosts and operates (either independently or through a third-party) the application for use by its customers over a computer network, such as the Internet. Typical advantages of SaaS usually include the customers not taking title to the product, no inventory or logistics, no contractual reselling activity, no repair service, and usually no physical goods to install or connect. In the SaaS model, the customers generally do not pay for owning the software itself but instead pay a usage fee for using the product.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some key characteristics of SaaS software generally include the following. First, SaaS generally provides network-based access to, and management of, commercially available (i.e., non-custom) software. Second, activities are generally managed from central locations rather than at each customer's site, thereby enabling customers to access applications remotely via a computer network, such as the Internet. Third, application delivery typically is closer to a one-to-many model (single instance, multi-tenant architecture) than to a one-to-one model, including architecture, pricing, partnering, and management characteristics. And fourth, SaaS provides centralized feature updating, which obviates the need for downloading patches and upgrades.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Management as a Service (MaaS) refers to offering IT Management Services using the SaaS delivery model. The consumers of the &#x2018;Management as a Service&#x2019; are typically IT elements (such as, Server Nodes, Network elements, Storage servers, etc.). In this respect, MaaS differs from SaaS. A MaaS Provider refers to the service vendor, who offers IT Management Services using the SaaS delivery mode. The Maas Provider hosts the management services on a SaaS Platform and provides them remotely to a consumer over a network. A MaaS Tenant refers to the consumer of IT Management Services using the SaaS delivery model. The MaaS Tenant subscribes to the MaaS Provider for the Management services and consumes them remotely.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An approach is provided that configures a management-as-a-service (MaaS) connect process at a MaaS provider. The MaaS connect process is configured based on a request received from a MaaS tenant. The configured MaaS connect process is transmitted to the MaaS tenant. MaaS services are provided from the MaaS provider to the MaaS tenant. These MaaS services interact with the configured MaaS connect process installed at the MaaS tenant.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a first diagram showing steps performed by the MaaS Tenant Administrator, MaaS Connect, MaaS Platform &#x26; MaaS Provider Administrator. Initially, the MaaS Provider maintains a repository of all MaaS Appliances and publishes a catalog of MaaS Services, in a web-site (step <b>400</b>). At step <b>400</b>, the MaaS Platform publishes the on-demand IT Management Service catalog. The repository of several MaaS Appliances (that offer IT Management Services such as, Monitoring Service, Incident Management Service, Service Request Management, etc.) is maintained by the MaaS Provider. The metadata of the MaaS Appliance describe the dependencies and the scripts that configure the MaaS Appliance instance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">A potential MaaS Tenant uses a web-browser to browse for these services and expresses an interest for consuming the IT Management Services offered by the MaaS Provider, by filling a registration form, e.g., using a web-browser (step <b>410</b>). In one embodiment, some of the data inputs described herein maybe the result of user input to online or paper-based forms or the result of other user interfaces. In another embodiment, data inputs captured during a step such as the registration and subscribe step are performed automatically (e.g., by a process running on the client computer system, with the client computer system also referred to herein as the tenant). While registering, the potential MaaS Tenant specifies the desire to subscribe for MaaS Services, some details about the Service Configuration (such as number of servers to be monitored by the Monitoring service, etc.), and the desired subscription duration. At step <b>410</b>, the MaaS Tenant Admin registers and subscribes for IT Management Service using a web-browser. During this step, the tenant browses the IT Management Service catalog and decides to consume services from the MaaS Provider. The decision is culminated by the tenant completing the subscription request form. In addition, the tenant selects the desired services, service-configuration (such as, the number of servers to be monitored by the Monitoring service, etc.), and the desired subscription duration. The tenant also saves the service-request identifier for further use. with the provider.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048">The MaaS Provider initiates the processing of the request from the potential MaaS Tenant at step <b>425</b>. In the meantime, at step <b>420</b>, the MaaS Tenant downloads and executes a MaaS Advisory application. The MaaS Advisory application will evaluate the tenant's IT Environment, connectivity between the MaaS Tenant &#x26; MaaS Provider to recommend the list of services that can be subscribed by the tenant, the preferred SLAs, and licensing scheme for each of the services. During step <b>420</b>, the MaaS Advisory application evaluate the tenant's IT environment &#x26; recommends MaaS Service using MaaS Advisory. First, the MaaS Advisory application is downloaded to the tenant in order to evaluate the Tenant's IT Environment, and connectivity between the MaaS Tenant &#x26; MaaS Provider. Next, the MaaS Advisory application is executed to determine the Tenant's IT Environment and its connectivity to provider environment. During the execution of the MaaS Advisory application, the Tenant's IT Environment is discovered (using capabilities of products such as Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager&#x2122;) to populate a CMDB. In addition, the Tenant's IT Environment is monitored (for a short duration) for system-parameters, network-parameters, and middleware-parameters. The MaaS Advisory application also discovers and monitors the connectivity (and related parameters) for the existing network-connection between the MaaS Tenant &#x26; MaaS Provider. Execution of the MaaS Advisory application also includes a search of the MaaS Service catalog for the service predicate rules and evaluate each service predicate (using the discovered/monitored data) to shortlist the MaaS Service to be recommended for the MaaS Tenant. The service-configuration is determined for each short-listed MaaS Service, by evaluating the service-configuration recommendation rules (maintained with the service-catalog) using the discovered/monitored data. For example, the service-configuration recommendation rule for Monitoring service&#x2014;will compute the number of servers to be monitored, etc. Finally, the MaaS Advisory application evaluates the usage-license recommendation rules (maintained with the service-catalog) to recommend the applicable SLA &#x26; usage-license schemes for each MaaS service recommended.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0051">The MaaS Provider evaluates the details provided by the potential MaaS Tenant, to create a new server partition (AIX-LPAR) in the MaaS Platform. The size of the resource allocated to the LPAR is determined based on the registration details provided by the tenant. A base-profile image is loaded in the newly created LPAR with an operating system (AIX), the health monitoring agents, usage metering agents, an integrated management console, a database instance, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0052">This approach supports multi-tenancy of a hosted application (which was primarily designed for single-tenant purposes). The MaaS Provider creates a separate instance of the application (with dedicated resources) for each client using LPAR virtualization. The MaaS Provider shares the physical resources by dynamically allocating an LPAR to a tenant based on requirements. The shared resources include Hard-disk, CPU, memory, I/O, etc. In one embodiment, the usage of resources allocated to a tenant is continuously monitored. If necessary, these resources can be dynamically increased or decreased as per the real time changes in the tenant's requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0053">Returning to step <b>425</b>, the MaaS Platform handles the new tenant registration. The MaaS Platform evaluates the Tenant's subscription request to determine the size of resources that needs to be allocated for the new tenant, creates a new LPAR (on the System-p/AIX) for the tenant, using a File-Backed-Device; and configure the LPAR with virtual I/O and virtual storage (depending on the Tenant classification&#x2014;such as Platinum. Gold, &#x26; Bronze), and loads a base profile image in the MaaS Tenant's LPAR; this includes the operating system (AIX), the health monitoring agents, usage metering agents, a integrated management console, a database instance, etc. A default set of MaaS Appliances (WPAR images) are loaded on to the newly created MaaS Tenant LPAR, which correspond to a default set of services offered to the MaaS Tenant.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0054">At step <b>430</b>, the MaaS Connect appliance is prepared, by the MaaS Platform, for the new tenant. The results of the execution of the MaaS Advisory application acts as an advisory (input) for the MaaS Tenant, while deciding to consume the services (or subscribe for the services) offered by the MaaS Provider. The MaaS Provider prepares a MaaS Connect for the new MaaS Tenant. The MaaS Connect is available as an Appliance (to be physically installed in the MaaS Tenant environment) or as a Virtual Appliance (to be installed on an existing hardware using virtualization techniques).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0055">The MaaS Connect appliance acts as a gateway for interaction between the MaaS Tenant's IT environment and the MaaS Provider. It is used to establish a secure channel of communication between the MaaS Tenant &#x26; MaaS Provider. It sometime acts as a service-proxy (for some MaaS Service), and supports off-line activity. The MaaS Provider configures the MaaS Connect to uniquely identify the MaaS Tenant and to securely initiate connection to the MaaS Tenant's LPAR from the MaaS Tenant's network. If the MaaS Tenant chose to use the MaaS Connect physical appliance, then prepare the MaaS Connect physical appliance for deployment in the MaaS Tenant premise. If the MaaS Tenant chose to use MaaS Connect virtual appliance, then prepare the MaaS Connect virtual appliance for download, and send the URL, user-id &#x26; password (for securely downloading the MaaS Connect Image) to the Tenant Administrator by eMail.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0056">In preparing the MaaS Connect appliance, the MaaS Platform configures the MaaS Connect appliance to uniquely identify the MaaS Tenant and to securely initiate connection to the MaaS Tenant's LPAR from the MaaS Tenant's network. If the MaaS Tenant chose to use the MaaS Connect physical appliance, then the MaaS Platform prepares the MaaS Connect physical appliance for deployment in the MaaS Tenant premise. On the other hand, if the MaaS Tenant chose to use a MaaS Connect virtual appliance, then the MaaS Platform prepares the MaaS Connect virtual appliance for download and execution in a dedicated machine using a VM Player, copies the MaaS Connect virtual appliance to the download-location, and sends the URL, user-id &#x26; password (for securely downloading the MaaS Connect Image) to the Tenant Administrator via eMail.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0057">At step <b>440</b>, the MaaS Tenant sets up the MaaS Connect gateway by either installing the physical appliance or download the MaaS Connect virtual appliance, using the URL provided in the eMail, using the user-id &#x26; password.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0058">The MaaS Tenant starts the MaaS Connect application, which firstly locally authenticates the user executing the MaaS Connect, using the user-id &#x26; password. Further, MaaS Connect will challenge the tenant-administrator for the service-request id/product-key.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0059">The MaaS Connect application obtains the tenant &#x26; user details&#x2014;for registration validation and prompts the user to provide the new security credentials (digital identity or user-id/password) at first-use. The MaaS Connect sends the MaaS Connect appliance details to the MaaS Provider and the tenant &#x26; user registration details over the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0060">At steps <b>460</b> and <b>470</b>, the MaaS Connect and MaaS Provider establish secure interaction channel between the MaaS Tenant &#x26; MaaS Provider by exchanging the security credentials. MaaS Connect sends the tenant's security credentials to the MaaS Provider and request to cross-certify. Similarly, MaaS Provider sends the security credentials to the MaaS Tenant to cross-certify.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0061">At step <b>480</b>, the MaaS Connect re-runs the MaaS Advisory application to assess the tenant's IT environment and prepare a MaaS Advisory report. The MaaS Advisory report is sent to the MaaS Provider to evaluate the tenant's data and assess the provider-side environment and prepare a draft copy of the MaaS Service Contract.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062">During step <b>480</b>, the MaaS Advisory component of MaaS Connect assesses the tenant's IT environment, and provides a report and advice. The MaaS Advisory discovers and assess the health/capacity of the Tenant IT Environment by scanning the IT environment in the MaaS Tenant Premise using an agent-less discovery application, to determine the IT Elements, Network elements and the topology (this can be achieved by IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager&#x2122;) including the following: (i) server (and its configurations); (ii) desktops; (iii) routers; and network configuration. The MaaS Advisory also takes snap-shot of the health of the IT Environment using the vital-signs of each of the IT/Network elements and prepares a report, summarizing the state of the IT Environment. In addition, the MaaS Advisory discovers and assesses the health/capacity of the connectivity between the MaaS Tenant &#x26; MaaS Provider as well as discovering the network routes between the MaaS Tenant and MaaS Provider, and measuring the snap-shot network performance, for each route. The MaaS Advisory scores the connectivity between MaaS Tenant and MaaS Provider, summarizes and reports the state of connectivity between MaaS Tenant and MaaS Provider. In generating an Advisory for the MaaS Tenant, the MaaS Advisory evaluates the IT Environment in the MaaS Tenant and recommends services that can be consumed by the tenant, assesses the connectivity between the MaaS Tenant and the MaaS Provider and recommends changes in the network configuration to improve the score. The MaaS Advisory sends the reports and recommendations to the MaaS Provider to prepare template MaaS Service Contract. This includes sending the MaaS Tenant IT environment health-report, the MaaS Tenant-MaaS Provider connectivity health-report, the MaaS service recommendations, and the MaaS Tenant connectivity-score improvement recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a second diagram showing steps performed by the MaaS Tenant Administrator, MaaS Connect, MaaS Platform &#x26; MaaS Provider Administrator. At step <b>500</b>, the MaaS Provider chooses the appropriate MaaS Service Contract (e.g., an XForm) template based on the classification of the MaaS Tenant (Platinum, Gold, Silver, &#x26; Bronze). The MaaS Service Contract Form is auto-filled with the list of MaaS Service copied from the MaaS Advisory report. At step <b>505</b>, the Provider Admin prepares the MaaS Service Contract Form. The service-configuration, and SLAs, are also automatically filled. The MaaS Service Contract Form also enlists the common facilities and other general purpose services (such as Storage Services) provided by MaaS Provider. Finally, the MaaS Service Contract Form enlists all the recommended usage-license models based on the desired services, service-configuration and the desired subscription duration. The MaaS Tenant Administrator chooses the appropriate license-model before digitally signing the MaaS Service Contract.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0064">During step <b>505</b>, the Provider Admin prepares a MaaS Service contract. This step involves preparation of the base-contract section as an XForm. A contract template is chosen depending on the classification of the MaaS Tenant (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.). The Provider Admin refines the SLAs based on (a) the server configuration of the MaaS Connect Appliance; and (b) the connectivity score between the MaaS Tenant &#x26; MaaS Provider.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0065">During step <b>510</b>, the MaaS Platform auto-fills the MaaS Service Contract. This step includes auto-filling the IT Management section of the service contract which includes enlisting the MaaS Services that are being provided by the MaaS Provider and the corresponding IT elements (in the MaaS Tenant premise) which can consume the service as well as enlisting the general purpose services (such as Storage Services) that are being provided by the MaaS Provider. Step <b>510</b> also includes auto-filling of the License section of the MaaS Service contract. Here, the usage-license model is suggested based on the information gathered as described above, such as when the MaaS Tenant chose the desired services in step <b>410</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0066">At step <b>515</b>, the MaaS Tenant reviews the MaaS Service Contract online and digitally sign each page in the form&#x2014;base-contract section, IT Management service contract section, common facilities. The MaaS Tenant finally reviews usage-license options, choose the usage-license scheme and the payment modes and digitally sign the license section of the service-contract.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0067">At step <b>520</b>, the MaaS Platform processes the MaaS Service contract received from the MaaS Tenant. The MaaS Platform verifies the digital signature in the base-contract section, and approves and embeds the signature (of MaaS Provider signatory) in the base-contract section. The MaaS Platform verifies the digital signature in the IT Management service contract section, verifies the choice of MaaS services (and the corresponding IT Elements that will consume the service); and verifies the choice of general purpose services (such as Storage Services). The MaaS Platform raises a service-request to provision the requested MaaS Services and operational support for the new Tenant (to the operational support (OSS)), and approves and embeds the digital-signature (of MaaS Provider signatory) in the IT Management Service section of the contract.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0068">At step <b>530</b>, the MaaS Provider Admin verifies the signature in the usage-license section of the contract, raises a service-request to initiate the provisioning of business-support for the new MaaS Tenant (to the business support (BSS)), and approves and embeds the digital-signature (of MaaS Provider signatory) in the license section of the contract.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069">After the MaaS Service contract is established, at various times the tenant may request changes to the subscriptions. At step <b>540</b>, the MaaS Provider handles the service-request raised by the MaaS Tenant to change the subscriptions. The MaaS Provider first verifies the availability of resources in the Tenant's LPAR, to load/change the MaaS Appliance, verifies dependencies in the Tenant's LPAR to load/change the MaaS Appliance. At step <b>550</b>, the MaaS Platform changes the MaaS Service Configuration for the tenant. Step <b>550</b> includes retrieving the relevant MaaS Appliance from the repository and loading them in the Tenant's LPAR, configuring each MaaS Appliance to establish database, network and application connectivity, preparing the upgrades to MaaS Connect in order to cater to the changes in the MaaS Services subscribed by the MaaS Tenant, and notifying the tenant's MaaS Connect to re-configure itself, in order to handle the changes in the MaaS Service subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0070">At step <b>560</b>, the tenant's MaaS Connect upgrades itself by downloading the updated MaaS Connect configuration list from the server, evaluating this MaaS Connect configuration list with the current configuration of MaaS Connect, to determine the change-list, and performing the operations suggested by each change-item in the change-list. These operations might include:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0074">In addition, during step <b>560</b>, the MaaS Connect monitors and reports the status of the changes made in the MaaS Connect back to the MaaS Provider.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0075">At step <b>570</b>, the MaaS Connect upgrades the tenant's IT environment. This step includes preparing the MaaS Tenant IT Environment according to changes in the service-configuration changes, downloading the new service-configuration list from the server, evaluating this service-configuration list, with the existing service-configurations, to determine the service-configuration change-list, and performing the operations suggested by each change-item in the change-list. These operations might include:

<p id="p-0067" num="0079">In addition, during step <b>560</b>, the MaaS Connect monitors and reports the status of the changes made in the tenant's IT Environment back to the MaaS Provider.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart showing initial interaction steps between a MaaS tenant and a MaaS provider. MaaS Provider processing commences at <b>600</b> whereupon, at step <b>605</b>, the MaaS Provider publishes its on-demand IT services catalog available to clients (tenants). MaaS Tenant processing is shown commencing at <b>610</b>, whereupon, at step <b>615</b>, the MaaS Tenant browses the MaaS services catalog. At step <b>620</b>, the MaaS Tenant chooses to consume services offered by the MaaS Provider. The MaaS Tenant notes the selections by filling out a subscription request form. At step <b>625</b>, the MaaS Tenant selects the desired services, service configuration, and subscription duration and this information is communicated to the MaaS Provider as a new tenant registration request. At step <b>630</b>, the MaaS Provider processes the new tenant registration request and, at step <b>635</b>, the MaaS Provider returns a registration identifier to the MaaS Tenant. At step <b>640</b>, the MaaS Tenant receives the registration identifier from the MaaS Provider and saves the identifier for future use. At step <b>645</b>, the MaaS Tenant downloads the MaaS Advisory application and, at predefined process <b>650</b>, the MaaS Tenant downloads and executes the MaaS Advisory application which assesses the tenant's IT environment, assesses network connectivity, and recommends a license and a SLA (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and corresponding text for processing details).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0081">Returning to MaaS Provider processing, after returning the registration identifier to the MaaS Tenant, at step <b>665</b>, the MaaS Provider evaluates the tenant's subscription request. At step <b>670</b>, the MaaS Provider creates a new tenant LPAR, and at step <b>675</b>, the MaaS Provider loads a base profile for the MaaS tenant into the created LPAR. At predefined process <b>680</b>, the MaaS Provider prepares the MaaS Connect appliance for the new MaaS Tenant (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and corresponding text for processing details).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart showing steps taken by tenant administration during MaaS advisory processing. This processing is called from predefined process <b>650</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, processing commences at <b>700</b> whereupon, at step <b>710</b> the MaaS Advisory application discovers the tenant's IT environment (using capabilities of products such as Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager&#x2122;) to populate a CMDB. At step <b>720</b>, the MaaS Advisory application monitors the Tenant's IT environment (for a short duration) for system-parameters, network-parameters, and middleware-parameters. At step <b>730</b>, the MaaS Advisory application discovers and monitors the connectivity (and related parameters) for the existing network-connection between the MaaS Tenant and the MaaS Provider. At step <b>740</b>, the MaaS Advisory application searches the MaaS Service catalog for the service predicate rules and evaluate each service predicate (using the discovered/monitored data) to shortlist the MaaS Service to be recommended for the MaaS Tenant. At step <b>750</b>, the MaaS Advisory application determines the service-configuration for each short-listed MaaS Service, by evaluating the service-configuration recommendation rules (maintained with the service-catalog) using the discovered/monitored data. Finally, at step <b>760</b>, the MaaS Advisory application evaluates the usage-license recommendation rules (maintained with the service-catalog) to recommend the applicable SLA &#x26; usage-license schemes for each MaaS service recommended. Processing by the MaaS Advisory application thereafter ends at <b>795</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart showing steps taken to prepare the MaaS Connect for a new tenant. Processing commences at <b>800</b> whereupon, at step <b>810</b>, the MaaS Provider configures the MaaS Connect appliance to uniquely identify the MaaS Tenant and to securely initiate connection to the MaaS Tenant's LPAR from the MaaS Tenant's network. A decision is made as to whether a physical or virtual MaaS Connect appliance is being used. If a physical MaaS Connect appliance is being used, then decision <b>820</b> branches to the &#x201c;physical&#x201d; branch whereupon, at step <b>830</b>, the MaaS Provider prepares the MaaS Connect physical appliance for deployment in the MaaS Tenant premise. On the other hand, if a virtual MaaS Connect appliance is being used, then decision <b>820</b> branches to the &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; branch, whereupon, at step <b>840</b>, the MaaS Provider prepares the MaaS Connect virtual appliance for download and execution in a dedicated machine using a VM Player. At step <b>850</b>, the MaaS Provider copies the MaaS Connect virtual appliance to the download-location, and at step <b>860</b>, the MaaS Provider sends the URL, user-id and password (for securely downloading the MaaS Connect Image) to the Tenant Administrator via eMail.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart showing steps taken to establish service-contract between the provider and tenant and to setup the MaaS Connect gateway. Processing commences at <b>900</b> whereupon a decision is made as to whether a virtual MaaS Connect appliance is being used (decision <b>910</b>). If a virtual MaaS Connect appliance is being used, then decision <b>910</b> branches to the &#x201c;yes&#x201d; branch whereupon, at step <b>915</b>, the MaaS Connect appliance is downloaded using the URL provided by the MaaS Provider (e.g., in an email sent to the MaaS Tenant) and the MaaS Tenant uses the previously provided user identifier and password. On the other hand, if a virtual MaaS Connect appliance is not being used, then decision <b>910</b> branches to the &#x201c;no&#x201d; branch bypassing step <b>915</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0085">At <b>920</b>, the MaaS Connect appliance establishes a secure connection with the MaaS Platform using the steps shown. At step <b>925</b>, the MaaS Connect appliance authenticates the user using the user identifier and password supplied by the user (the user identifier and password being previously provided to the user by the MaaS Provider when the MaaS tenant registered for the services). At step <b>930</b>, the tenant is prompted (challenged) for the service request identifier and/or the product key corresponding to the subscribed services.

<p id="p-0092" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is a diagram depicting a sample application where the MaaS Platform initial includes two LPARs. In this specific example, server monitoring is provided as a service to the tenant. The provider sets up the MaaS Platform which consists of a cluster of p-series machines. The base operating system used might be running AIX&#x2122; operating system as it has several powerful features which support virtualization. One of these features amongst these is the support for the creation of LPARs (Logical Partitions). Each LPAR behaves as a separate virtual server running its own copy of AIX on it. The LPAR running the AIX as base OS, and the application stack on top of it is essentially a FBD (File Backed Device) and an image of the same can be stored in a file. Each LPAR is dedicated to a tenant and is allocated resources as per the needs of the tenant. These resources can be dynamically allocated or de-allocated. The creation of a LPAR is very rapid and it takes only a couple of minutes to create a new LPAR. All the LPARs are managed using the VIOS (Virtual Input-output server). The VIOS itself runs on a separate LPAR.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0105">The MaaS Platform initially comprise of 2 LPARs (LPAR <b>1405</b> and LPAR <b>1410</b>) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. LPAR <b>1405</b> is dedicated for the Virtual Input Output Server (VIOS) and the other is dedicated for MaaS Platform Management. The MaaS Platform Management LPAR also stores a repository of MaaS Appliance. Each MaaS Appliance is a workload-partition (WPAR) image which can be deployed in the tenant's LPAR on-demand. When a new tenant subscribes, the MaaS Platform creates a dedicated LPAR for it, allocating resources on the basis of the tenant's requirements and installs a base profile. The base-profile comprise of the operating-system, the agents for monitoring the health, metering etc. Following this, based on the tenant's subscription, the appropriate MaaS Appliance is retrieved from the repository and loaded onto the newly created LPAR.</p>

The HUB-TEMS is the component which is responsible for actually collecting the data and storing it in the TDW. The TEPS connects to this TEMS in order to store the data in a presentable form, and connects to a TDW of its own.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0108">Once MaaS Appliance <b>1465</b> is provisioned, the next step is to provide a connection between MaaS Provider <b>1450</b> and MaaS Tenant <b>1455</b>.

The MaaS Appliance includes operating system <b>1485</b> (such as a Linux&#x2122; operating system) as the base Operating System, with Remote TEMS <b>1490</b> installed. Remote TEMS <b>1490</b> is configured to connect to the appropriate Hub TEMS. Tivoli Monitoring Agents are remotely deployed on each client server <b>1495</b> that need to be monitored through this Remote TEMS. These agents collect monitoring data and send it to the Remote TEMS which then forwards it to the Hub TEMS.
