<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In busy or noisy environments, e.g. where numerous people are talking, it is sometimes very difficult to determine whose cell phone is ringing as people often have the same or similar ring tone profiles. A further issue is that people tend to automatically shut out common sounds as background noise. This sometimes can cause people to miss their own phone ringing unless if is unique enough to overcome the muffling effect of background noise.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the specification provides a method for generating a subliminal alert at a computing device comprising a processing unit interconnected with a memory and a speaker, the method comprising: selecting a first audio file comprising a subliminal alert, the first audio file enabled for processing by the processing unit to control the speaker, the first audio file is at least one of: a subliminally audible length; a subliminally audible volume; and chosen based on previous conditioning of a user to the first audio file; and associating the first audio file with at least one alert condition, such that when the alert condition is met, the processing unit controls the speaker to play the first audio file thereby providing the subliminal alert.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first audio file can comprise a recording of a name associated with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method can further comprise selecting a second audio file associated with an audible alert, the second audio file enabled for processing by the processing unit to control the speaker; and combining the first audio file and the second audio file to produce an audio notification file such that when the audio notification file is processed by the processing unit to control the speaker, the audible alert is provided along with the subliminal alert. The combining can comprise auditory masking of the first audio file by the second audio file. The combining can comprise temporal masking of the first audio file by the second audio file, the first audio file played one of before or after the second audio file in the audio notification file. The combining can comprise providing the first audio file in a broken sound bite sequence, whereby the first audio file is broken into a plurality of segments provided in the audio notification file, each of the plurality of segments separated by a respective period of time. A subset of the plurality of segments can be provided in the audio notification file causing subliminal word completion in the user. The second audio file can be louder than the first audio file when the audio notification file is played at the speaker.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a communication device <b>101</b> for generating a subliminal alert, according to non-limiting implementations. Communication device <b>101</b>, which will also be referred to hereafter as device <b>101</b>, comprises a processing unit <b>122</b>, an optional communication interface <b>124</b> (alternatively referred to hereafter as interface <b>124</b>) and a memory device <b>126</b> (alternatively referred to hereafter as memory <b>126</b>), for example via a computing bus (not depicted). Communication device <b>101</b> can optionally comprise an input device <b>127</b> and/or a display device <b>128</b>. Alternatively, input device <b>127</b> and/or display device <b>128</b> can be external to communication device <b>101</b>, though interconnected with processing unit <b>122</b> via any suitable connection. Device <b>101</b> further comprises a speaker <b>129</b>. Furthermore, in some implementations processing unit <b>122</b> is optionally interconnected with a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>123</b>; in some of these implementations, processing unit <b>122</b> and DSP <b>123</b> can be combined in a single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Device <b>101</b> further comprises an application <b>136</b> for generating a subliminal alert from at least a first audio file <b>140</b> stored in memory <b>126</b>. First audio file <b>140</b> will also be referred to hereafter as file <b>140</b>. Application <b>136</b> can be stored in memory <b>126</b> and processed by processing unit <b>122</b>. In particular the subliminal alert can be provided by playing file <b>140</b> when at least one alert condition <b>137</b> is met, the at least one alert condition associated with file <b>140</b>. In some implementations, as explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>, memory <b>126</b> further stores at least a second audio file <b>142</b> which can be combined with file <b>140</b>, for example via DSP <b>123</b> to produce an audio notification file <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is appreciated that file <b>140</b> comprises a subliminal alert. It is further appreciated that file <b>140</b> is enabled for processing by processing unit <b>122</b> to control speaker <b>129</b>. It is yet further appreciated that file <b>140</b> is at least one of:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">a subliminally audible length;</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">a subliminally audible volume; and</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">chosen based on previous conditioning of a user to file <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, a subliminally audible length can comprise a length of time a sound can be played so that is subliminally perceptible to a human. It is appreciated that human brains are generally enabled to complete incomplete things such as incomplete images and sounds. For example, a circle having a gap in its border can be processed by the brain as a complete circle. A similar effect occurs with sounds, especially when a person is conditioned to a sound, such as the sound of identifier associated with the person, such as their name; specifically, a person's brain is able to identify and process a name even if only a part of the name is provided and/or if the name is broken up by purposely placing gaps or spacing in the name. While the incomplete and/or broken up name is hence subliminally identifiable to a conditioned person, the incomplete and/or broken up name is less likely to be perceived by others who are not conditioned to respond to the sound of the some else's name.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Similarly, a subliminally audible volume can comprise a volume that a person conditioned to a given sound file, such as a sound file comprising their name, is subliminally perceptible. This is similar to the cocktail party effect where a person can hear their name in an otherwise noisy environment as they are conditioned to hearing their name.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While these examples are specific to a person's name, it is appreciated that file <b>140</b> can comprise any sound chosen based on previous conditioning of a user to file <b>140</b>. For example, file <b>140</b> could include but is not limited to a spouse's name, a child's name, a relative's name, a pet's name, a friend's name, a job title, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further it is appreciated that file <b>140</b> can be in the voice of a person to which the user of device <b>101</b> is conditioned. For example, a new mother can distinguish her infant's crying from that of other babies within three days, and some fathers can make this distinction as well. Similarly, a person is conditioned to pick the sound of a spouse and/or children from a crowd. Hence, file <b>140</b> can be in the voice of a known person, including but not limited to a spouse, a child, a baby (crying or not), a relative, a friend or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Similarly, the sound of a car backfiring can cause someone to take cover who grew up in an area where gun sots are common, as their conditioned reactive instinct can treat the sound the same as that of a gun shot. Hence, file <b>140</b> can comprise any suitable sound to which the user of device <b>101</b> is conditioned.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is yet further appreciated that file <b>142</b> can be provisioned on device <b>101</b>, however in other implementations file <b>142</b> is generated at device <b>101</b> via a microphone (not depicted), processing unit <b>122</b> and/or DSP <b>123</b>. In these implementations, processing unit <b>122</b> and/or DSP <b>123</b> is enabled to record sounds via the microphone and produce a suitable subliminal alert from the recorded sounds, for example by adjusting the frequencies, length, volume, or the like of the recorded sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, device <b>101</b> comprises any suitable communication and/or computing device for processing application <b>136</b> and/or playing file <b>140</b>, including but not limited to any suitable combination of personal computing devices, laptop computing devices, portable computing devices, mobile electronic devices, PDAs (personal digital assistants), cellphones, smartphones, an alarm device, a playback device and the like.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">DSP <b>123</b>, when present, comprises any suitable digital signal processor, or combination of digital signal processors. In particular, DSP <b>123</b> is enabled to combine file <b>140</b> with at least a second audio file <b>142</b> to produce an audio notification file <b>144</b>, as will be described below. Second audio file <b>142</b> will also be referred to hereafter as file <b>142</b>. Similarly, audio notification file <b>144</b> will also be referred to hereafter as file <b>144</b>.</p>

In some implementations, interface <b>124</b> can be enabled to communicate with remote computing devices (e.g. servers, other computing devices etc.), via any suitable communication network according to any suitable protocol, including but not limited to packet based protocols, Internet protocols, analog protocols, PSTN (public switched telephone network) protocols, WiFi protocols, WiMax protocols and the like, and/or a combination. Other suitable communication interfaces and/or protocols are within the scope of present implementations.</p>

Other suitable memory devices are within the scope of present implementations. In particular, memory device <b>126</b> can be enabled to store application <b>136</b>, first audio file <b>140</b>, second audio file <b>142</b>, audio notification file <b>144</b> and data indicative of alert condition <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Input device <b>127</b> is generally enabled to receive input data, and can comprise any suitable combination of input devices, including but not limited to a keyboard, a keypad, a pointing device, a mouse, a track wheel, a trackball, a touchpad, a touch screen and the like. Other suitable input devices are within the scope of present implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Display device <b>128</b> comprises circuitry <b>129</b> for generating representations of data, for example a representation <b>130</b> of application <b>136</b>. Display device <b>128</b> can include any suitable one of or combination of CRT (cathode ray tube) and/or flat panel displays (e.g. LCD (liquid crystal display), plasma, OLED (organic light emitting diode), capacitive or resistive touchscreens, and the like). Circuitry <b>129</b> can include any suitable combination of circuitry for controlling the CRT and/or flat panel displays etc., including but not limited to display buffers, transistors, electron beam controllers, LCD cells, plasmas cells, phosphors etc. In particular, display device <b>128</b> and circuitry <b>129</b> can be controlled by processing unit <b>122</b> to generate representation <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Speaker <b>129</b> is generally enabled to play file <b>140</b> and can be any suitable speaker for playing file <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which depicts a method <b>200</b> for generating an audio notification file. In order to assist in the explanation of method <b>200</b>, it will be assumed that method <b>200</b> is performed using communication device <b>101</b>. Furthermore, the following discussion of method <b>200</b> will lead to a further understanding of communication device <b>101</b> and its various components. However, it is to be appreciated that communication device <b>101</b> and/or method <b>200</b> can be varied, and need not work exactly as discussed herein in conjunction with each other, and that such variations are within the scope of present implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>201</b>, file <b>140</b> comprising a subliminal alert is selected. At block <b>213</b>, file <b>140</b> is associated with alert condition <b>137</b>. For example, alert condition can comprise a condition where an alert is to be played, such as receiving a telephone call, a message, an e-mail, a text message, an SMS (Short Message Service) message, an alarm, a reminder or the like. Indeed, it is appreciated that any suitable alert condition where an alert is to be provided when the condition is met is with the scope of present implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At block <b>215</b> it is determined whether alert condition <b>137</b> is met. If not, block <b>215</b> repeats until alert condition <b>137</b> is met. When alert condition <b>137</b> is met, processing unit <b>122</b> controls speaker <b>129</b> to play file <b>140</b> at block <b>217</b> thereby providing the subliminal alert.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hence, via file <b>140</b> and method <b>200</b>, subliminal alerts can be provided at device <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> which depicts a method <b>300</b> for generating an audio notification file for a computing device comprising a processing unit interconnected with a memory and a speaker. In order to assist in the explanation of method <b>300</b>, it will be assumed that method <b>300</b> is performed using communication device <b>101</b>. Furthermore, the following discussion of method <b>300</b> will lead to a further understanding of communication device <b>101</b> and its various components. However, it is to be appreciated that communication device <b>101</b> and/or method <b>300</b> can be varied, and need not work exactly as discussed herein in conjunction with each other, and that such variations are within the scope of present implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particular, method <b>300</b> comprises a method of combining file <b>140</b> with file <b>142</b> to produce file <b>144</b>, as will be described hereafter. Further, it is appreciated that method <b>300</b> can be performed in processing unit <b>122</b> and/or DSP <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is further appreciated that method <b>300</b> is similar to method <b>200</b>, with like elements having like number, however preceded by a &#x201c;3&#x201d; rather than a &#x201c;2&#x201d;. For example, block <b>301</b> is similar to block <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, method <b>300</b> further comprises block <b>305</b> wherein file <b>142</b> is selected, file <b>142</b> comprising an audible alert. It is further appreciated that file <b>142</b> can comprise any suitable file for providing an audible alert, such as an alert for a phone call, an e-mail, a text message, and SMS message and the like. It is further appreciated that file <b>142</b> can comprise an audible alert provisioned on computing device <b>142</b>; indeed, it is appreciated that file <b>142</b> can be similar to other audible alert files on other devices similar to device <b>101</b> such that in a group setting the other devices can be playing audible alerts similar to the audible alert in file <b>142</b>. In particular non-limiting implementations, file <b>142</b> comprises a ring tone.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Hence, to distinguish the audible alert in file <b>142</b> from all the other audible alerts, at block <b>305</b>, file <b>140</b> is combined with file <b>142</b> to produce audio notification file <b>144</b> such that when audio notification file <b>144</b> is processed by processing unit <b>122</b> to control speaker <b>127</b>, the audible alert in file <b>142</b> is provided along with the subliminal alert in file <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At block <b>313</b>, similar to block <b>213</b>, audio notification file <b>144</b> is associated with alert condition <b>137</b> such that when alert condition <b>137</b> is met at block <b>315</b>, processing unit <b>122</b> controls speaker <b>129</b> to play audio notification file <b>144</b> at block <b>317</b> thereby providing the audible alert along with the subliminal alert.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In particular non-limiting implementations, file <b>140</b> comprises a recording of a name associated with a user of device <b>101</b>, such the user has been conditioned to file <b>140</b>. Such implementations take advantage of the &#x201c;cocktail effect&#x201d; where a person can focus listening attention on a single talker among a mixture of conversations and background noises, ignoring other conversations and background noises. Hence, as the user of device <b>101</b> is conditioned to hearing his/her name, he/she is able to distinguish audio notification file <b>144</b> in a noisy environment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is appreciated that file <b>140</b> can comprise any suitable sound etc. to which the user of device <b>101</b> has been conditioned, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, file <b>140</b> and files <b>142</b> are such that when played they are perceived as two different sample items instead of one. For example, respective frequencies in files <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> can be such that the respective frequencies affect different parts of a user's ear. It is further appreciated that the difference between the frequencies can be different for different frequency ranges. For example, the auditory bandwidth perceived by a listener is generally understood to change with frequency, hence frequencies in files <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> can be at least an auditory bandwidth apart to ensure that files <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are heard as different sample items when played at speaker <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is further understood that as most humans have two working ears, the user of device <b>101</b> (assuming two working ears), can better predict the location of device <b>101</b> when file <b>144</b> is played. This results in the following alerting experience; the user hears a ring tone, his/her name (or other sound bite to which he/she is conditioned) and gets an idea of the special location of the sound of his/her name and thus both the location of device <b>101</b> and that device <b>101</b> is playing an alert.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Such effects can generally be referred to as auditory masking, wherein file <b>140</b> is masked by file <b>142</b> in file <b>144</b>. Various types of auditory masking are within the scope of present implementations as will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some implementations, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (substantially similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with like elements having like numbers), file <b>144</b> comprises files <b>142</b>, <b>140</b>, with file <b>140</b> being placed in file <b>142</b> by DSP <b>123</b>. This results in file <b>142</b> being played and file <b>140</b> being played while file <b>142</b> is playing, e.g. the user's name is played somewhere in a ringtone.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some implementations file <b>142</b> is generally provided at a louder volume and/or intensity than file <b>140</b> when audio notification file <b>144</b> is played at speaker <b>129</b>. The relative and/or absolute intensity of each file <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> can be changed accordingly by DSP <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, the combining at block <b>305</b> of method <b>300</b> comprises temporal masking of file <b>140</b> by file <b>142</b>, file <b>142</b> being provided one of before or after file <b>142</b> in audio notification file <b>144</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (substantially similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with like elements having like numbers).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In yet further implementations, the combining at block <b>305</b> comprises providing file <b>142</b> in a broken sound bite sequence, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (substantially similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with like elements having like numbers). For example, file <b>140</b> is broken into a plurality of segments <b>140</b><i>a</i>, <b>140</b><i>b</i>, <b>140</b><i>c </i>. . . <b>140</b><i>n </i>provided in audio notification file <b>144</b>, each of plurality of segments <b>140</b><i>a</i>, <b>140</b><i>b</i>, <b>140</b><i>c </i>. . . <b>140</b><i>n </i>separated by at least a respective, period of time t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, etc. It is appreciated that the number of segments <b>140</b><i>a</i>, <b>140</b><i>b</i>, <b>140</b><i>c </i>. . . <b>140</b><i>n </i>can be any suitable number. Further, each respective period of time t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, etc. can be the same or different as desired and can each be of any suitable length.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In yet further implementations, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (substantially similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with like elements having like numbers), only a subset of the plurality of segments <b>140</b><i>a</i>, <b>140</b><i>b</i>, <b>140</b><i>c </i>. . . <b>140</b><i>n </i>are provided in audio notification file <b>144</b> causing subliminal word completion in a user of device <b>101</b>. For example only the first few segments <b>142</b><i>a</i>, <b>142</b><i>b </i>can be provided. In some implementations, only the first segment <b>142</b><i>a </i>can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">While in depicted non-limiting example implementations, specific types of masking are referred to, it is appreciated that any suitable type of masking is within the scope of present implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is further appreciated that methods <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> can be combined. For example, a file <b>140</b> can be associated with at least one alert condition and audio notification file <b>144</b> can be associated with at least a second alert condition.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is yet further appreciated that while files <b>140</b>, <b>144</b> are described as being generated at least in part at device <b>101</b>, in other implementations, files <b>140</b>, <b>144</b> can be generated at another computing device and transferred to device <b>101</b> for associating with an alert condition. In other words, subliminal ring tones can be at least one of provisioned at device <b>101</b> and/or transmitted to device <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some implementations, the functionality of device <b>101</b> can be implemented using pre-programmed hardware or firmware elements (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), etc.), or other related components. In other implementations, the functionality of device <b>101</b> can be achieved using a computing apparatus that has access to a code memory (not shown) which stores computer-readable program code for operation of the computing apparatus. The computer-readable program code could be stored on a computer readable storage medium which is fixed, tangible and readable directly by these components, (e.g., removable diskette, CD-ROM, ROM, fixed disk, USB drive). Furthermore, it is appreciated that the computer-readable program can be stored as a computer program product comprising a computer usable medium. Further, a persistent storage device can comprise the computer readable program code. It is yet further appreciated that the computer-readable program code and/or computer usable medium can comprise a non-transitory computer-readable program code and/or non-transitory computer usable medium. Alternatively, the computer-readable program code could be stored remotely but transmittable to these components via a modem or other interface device connected to a network (including, without limitation, the Internet) over a transmission medium. The transmission medium can be either a non-mobile medium (e.g., optical and/or digital and/or analog communications lines) or a mobile medium (e.g., microwave, infrared, free-space optical or other transmission schemes) or a combination thereof.</p>
