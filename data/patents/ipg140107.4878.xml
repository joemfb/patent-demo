<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2008-110747, filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Apr. 21, 2008, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a recording system, a transmission apparatus, a recording apparatus, a recording control method, and a recording medium storing a program for recording content data transmitted from a transmission source on a transmission-destination side.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the widespread use of a data communication network, the use of a so-called home network for realizing communication between devices via a network of electric appliances, computers, and peripherals is increasing at home. Data processing functions of connected devices are shared by communication via a home network and content is exchanged between the devices via the home network, whereby convenience and comfortable use is provided to users.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, a utilization form for recording content stored in a content providing server in another device connected via a home network of various home electronic devices is available. For example, software data (hereinafter, referred to as content), such as audio data such as music data, image data such as movies, game programs, and various application programs, can be stored, as digital data, on recording media, e.g., a digital versatile disc (DVD), a mini disc (MD), and a compact disc (CD). In addition, a Blu-ray Disc&#xae; (hereinafter, referred to as a BD) for realizing high-density recording with the blue laser is put on the market. Digital content is stored on these various information recording media (recording media).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing processing for recording content data transmitted from a transmission source on a transmission-destination side. For example, the transmission source may be a set top box (STB), referred to as a personal video recorder (PVR), having a function for recording broadcasted videos in a hard disk drive (HDD). The transmission destination may be, for example, a recorder having an HDD and a BD drive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method for &#x201c;copying&#x201d; content stored in a source device (transmission source) in a synchronization device (transmission destination) and a method for &#x201c;moving&#x201d; the content from the source device to the synchronization device so that the content is not left in the source device are available as content transmission methods.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A procedure of a case of accurately executing the &#x201c;move&#x201d; operation between two devices, namely, the source device and the synchronization device, will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At STEP S<b>101</b>, the source device specifies a recording destination medium of the synchronization device. In this example, the source device specifies a BD as the recording destination medium.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">At STEP S<b>102</b>, the synchronization device confirms that the BD is inserted thereto before returning a status indicating &#x201c;ready&#x201d; to the source device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">At STEP S<b>103</b>, the source device confirms that the synchronization device is &#x201c;ready&#x201d; and starts transmitting content.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At STEP S<b>104</b>, the synchronization device records the content transmitted from the source device in the HDD. The synchronization device temporarily records the content in the HDD since the recording speed of the HDD is higher than that of the BD. For example, if 1-hour content of 6750 Mbytes encoded at 15 Mbps is recorded at a speed of 30 Mbps, transfer of the content to the HDD is finished in 540 seconds (here, it is assumed that the maximum transfer speed between the devices is equal to 100 Mbps although the recording speed of the HDD is higher than 100 Mbps).
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>15 (Mbps)&#xd7;3600 (seconds)/8=6750 (Mbytes)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>6750 (Mbytes)&#xd7;8/100 (Mbps)=540 (seconds)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since the source device has finished executing actual processing, a user can use the source device for a different purpose. However, deletion of the moved content from the source device is not allowed until the source device recognizes termination of the recording processing executed in the synchronization device.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, when content in a different format is recorded on a recording medium compliant with a standard format, processing, such as transcoding, is performed on a recording-device side. In such a case, a synchronization device on a transmission-destination side generally records the content in an HDD serving as an intermediate buffer to increase the transfer speed between the devices on the transmission-source side and the transmission-destination side and to execute transcoding processing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, since a completion signal is not output to the source device on the transmission-source side until completion of recording of content data on a recording medium, the source device is not ready to execute other kinds of processing during this period, which is significantly inefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, when an available space of a recording medium of the synchronization device on the transmission-destination side is insufficient or when the content data is recorded on another recording medium, an exchange of the recording media prevents the content data to be continuously received.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In view of such a circumstance, embodiments of the present invention provide a recording system, a transmission apparatus, a recording apparatus, a recording control method, and a program for efficiently recording content data transmitted from a transmission source on a transmission-designation side.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a recording system includes a transmission apparatus having a storage unit configured to store content data, a generating unit configured to generate recording destination information specifying a recording destination of the content data, and a transmission control unit configured to transmit the recording destination information and the content data, and a recording apparatus having a first recording unit configured to record content data, a second recording unit configured to record content data on a recording medium at a recording speed lower than that of the first recording unit, and a recording control unit configured to receive the recording destination information from the transmission apparatus and control the first recording unit and the second recording unit on the basis of the recording destination information. The transmission control unit continuously transmits a plurality of pieces of recording destination information each specifying a recording destination and a plurality of pieces of content data to the recording apparatus. The recording control unit records, when the recording destination specified by the recording destination information is a recording medium, the content data and the recording destination information in the first recording unit, and records the content data on the recording medium on the basis of the recording destination information recorded in the first recording unit.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a transmission apparatus includes a storage unit configured to store content data, a generating unit configured to generate recording destination information specifying a recording destination of the content data, and a transmission control unit configured to transmit the recording destination information and the content data. The transmission control unit continuously transmits a plurality of pieces of recording destination information and a plurality of pieces of content data to a transmission destination.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to still another embodiment of the present invention, a recording apparatus includes a first recording unit configured to record content data, a second recording unit configured to record content data on a recording medium at a recording speed lower than that of the first recording unit, and a control unit configured to receive recording destination information specifying a recording destination of the content data from a transmission source and control the first recording unit and the second recording unit on the basis of the recording destination information. The control unit records, when the recording destination specified by the recording destination information is a recording medium, the content data and the recording destination information in the first recording unit, and records the content data on the recording medium on the basis of the recording destination information recorded in the first recording unit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a further embodiment of the present invention, a recording control method includes the steps of continuously receiving a plurality of pieces of recording destination information each specifying a recording destination and a plurality of pieces of content data from a transmission apparatus, recording the plurality of pieces of continuously received content data and the plurality of pieces of continuously received recording destination information in a recording unit, and recording, when the recording destination specified by the recording destination information is a recording medium, the content data on the recording medium on the basis of the recording destination information recorded in the recording unit.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a still further embodiment of the present invention, a recording medium storing a program causes a computer to execute a method including the steps of continuously receiving a plurality of pieces of recording destination information each specifying a recording destination and a plurality of pieces of content data from a transmission apparatus, recording the plurality of pieces of continuously received content data and the plurality of pieces of continuously received recording destination information in a recording unit, and recording, when the recording destination specified by the recording destination information is a recording medium, the content data on the recording medium on the basis of the recording destination information recorded in the recording unit.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the embodiments of the present invention, recording destination information and content data are recorded in a first recording unit having a higher recording speed and the content data is then recorded on a recording medium on the basis of the recording destination information, whereby the content data can be efficiently recorded on the recording medium and a plurality of pieces of content data can be continuously received from a transmission source.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Specific embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. A recording system according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a transmission apparatus on a transmission-source side and a recording apparatus on a transmission-destination side. When recording destination information, which is continuously transmitted with a plurality of pieces of content data from the transmission apparatus to the recording apparatus, specifies a recording medium, such as a digital versatile disc (DVD) and a Blu-ray Disc&#xae;, as a recording destination, the recording apparatus records the content data on the recording medium after temporarily recording the content data and the recording destination information on a storage unit, such as a hard disk drive (HDD).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, a set top box (STB), referred to as a personal video recorder (PVR), having a function for recording broadcasted videos in a hard disk drive (HDD) and a recorder having an HDD drive and a BD drive, or a STB and a personal computer (PC), or a server and a PC may be used as a source device on the transmission-source side and a synchronization device on the transmission-destination side, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An STB and a recorder will be described below as an example of a configuration of a recording system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a configuration of a receiver <b>10</b> for receiving digital broadcasting content. The receiver <b>10</b> is widely used at home as a so-called STB, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A central processing unit (CPU) <b>11</b> serves as a main controller to collectively control components connected to each other through a bus <b>20</b>. Each component will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The CPU <b>11</b> is a main controller for controlling operations of the receiver <b>10</b>. For example, the CPU <b>11</b> processes station selection control information and program information that are transmitted thereto through the bus <b>20</b>. More specifically, the CPU <b>11</b> controls, on the basis of contents of a digital copy control descriptor for describing information regarding copyright protection of the digital broadcasting content and a content utilization descriptor, processing for outputting the received broadcasting content realtime, processing for outputting the reproduced broadcasting content, and processing for scheduled recording of the received broadcasting content to protect the copyright of the content. The CPU <b>11</b> also copies or moves content recorded in an HDD <b>17</b> in accordance with, for example, a copy restriction defined by a digital copy control descriptor that is multiplexed in a transport stream. In addition, the CPU <b>11</b> generates recording destination information that indicates a copy destination or a move destination as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A random access memory (RAM) <b>12</b> may be a writable volatile memory that is used for loading program codes to be executed by the CPU <b>11</b> and for writing work data of the executed program codes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A read only memory (ROM) <b>13</b> is a read only memory for permanently storing a self-diagnostic program and/or an initialization program to be executed at the time of power-on of the receiver <b>10</b> and micro codes for operations of hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A network controller <b>14</b> is a communication controller for realizing communication between the receiver <b>10</b> and an external device via a network.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) 1394 interface (I/F) <b>15</b> is a high-speed serial interface capable of realizing transmission/reception of data of several hundreds Mbps. IEEE 1394-compliant external devices connected in a daisy chain form or a tree form can be connected to the IEEE 1394 port.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this embodiment, for example, universal plug and play (UPnP) can be used as a specification for connecting devices, such as home PCs and peripheral devices, via a network and providing functions to each other. The UPnP is used by the network controller <b>14</b> or the IEEE 1394 interface <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The UPnP is a specification in view of utilization of the transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP). The UPnP is based on three protocols, namely, the auto IP, the multicast DNS, and the simple service discover protocol (SSDP). The UPnP is a combination of the IP technology that is an Internet standard technology and the XML.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In UPnP content transmission, devices are categorized into a media server for providing content data and a control point functioning as a control terminal device. The media server corresponds to a so-called server of a network system. In this embodiment, the media server corresponds to the receiver <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The HDD <b>17</b> is an external storage device for storing programs and data in a predetermined file format. The HDD <b>17</b> has a relatively large capacity of several hundreds gigabytes. The HDD <b>17</b> is connected to the bus <b>20</b> through an HDD interface <b>16</b>. In this embodiment, the HDD <b>17</b> is utilized to store received broadcasting content. The content recorded in the HDD <b>17</b> is appropriately read out, reproduced, copied, or moved under control of the CPU <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A card interface <b>18</b> realizes a bus protocol between a card device, such as a PC card inserted into a card slot <b>19</b>, and the bus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A broadcasting receiving function will now be described. Broadcast waves of digital broadcasting content received by an antenna are supplied to a tuner <b>51</b>. The broadcast waves are not limited particularly and may be cable broadcast waves or terrestrial broadcast waves.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A tuner <b>51</b> performs turning of a broadcast wave of a predetermined channel (channel selection) in accordance with an instruction issued from the CPU <b>11</b> and outputs received data to a demodulator <b>52</b> at a subsequent stage. The demodulator <b>52</b> demodulates the digitally modulated received data.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The demodulated digital data may be, for example, a transport stream resulting from multiplexing of AV data compressed according to the MPEG2 standard and program information. The AV data includes video and audio information constituting a broadcasted program and subtitle data. The program information is a data accompanying this broadcasted program. The program information is written in a section format, such as PSI and SI, and is used in an electronic program guide and a scheduled recording of a program.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A TS decoder <b>53</b> interprets the transport stream, divides the transport stream into the AV data compressed according to the MPEG2 standard and the program information, and outputs the AV data and the program information to an AV decoder <b>54</b> and the CPU <b>11</b> through the bus <b>20</b>, respectively. The TS decoder <b>53</b> may include a work data storage memory (RAM) <b>53</b>A therein.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Upon receiving the realtime AV data compressed according to the MPEG2 standard from the TS decoder <b>53</b>, the AV decoder <b>54</b> divides the AV data into compressed video data and compressed audio data. The AV decoder <b>54</b> decompresses the video data according to the MPEG2 standard to reproduce an original video signal. The AV decoder <b>54</b> decodes the audio data according to the pulse code modulation (PCM) and combines the decoded audio data with additional sounds to reproduce an audio signal. The AV decoder <b>54</b> may include a work data storage memory (RAM) <b>54</b>A therein. The reproduced video signal is output to and displayed on a display <b>61</b> through a multiplexer (MUX) <b>55</b>B. The reproduced audio signal is output to a speaker <b>62</b> through a multiplexer (MUX) <b>55</b>A. Alternatively, the compressed video data and the compressed audio data may be transferred to and temporarily stored in the HDD <b>17</b> through the bus <b>20</b> without decompression and may be decompressed by the AV decoder <b>54</b> thereafter to be reproduced and output.</p>

The U/I controller <b>57</b> has, for example, operation buttons/switches used by a user to perform direct manual operations and a function for receiving a remote operation from a remote control using infrared (IR) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The receiver <b>10</b> performs, for example, an operation for scheduled recording in accordance with a command input by a user through the U/I controller <b>57</b> and stores content in the HDD <b>17</b>. The receiver <b>10</b> also transmits the content stored in the HDD <b>17</b> to another device, such as a recording device, through the network controller <b>14</b> or the IEEE 1394 interface <b>15</b> in a manner described below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing an example of a configuration of a recording apparatus <b>30</b>. The recording apparatus <b>30</b> is widely used at home as a recorder, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The HDD <b>36</b> stores content supplied thereto through the bus <b>35</b>. The HDD <b>36</b> also serves as an intermediate buffer to store content and recording destination information under control of the CPU <b>31</b> at the time of recording of the content on a recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A drive <b>37</b> drives inserted optical discs, such as a digital versatile disc (DVD) <b>38</b> and a Blu-ray Disc&#xae; (BD) <b>39</b>. The drive <b>37</b> also drives a memory card <b>40</b> inserted into a slot formed in a casing of the recording apparatus <b>30</b>. With such a configuration, the drive <b>37</b> records data supplied through the bus <b>35</b> on these recording media. The drive <b>37</b> also reads out data recorded on these recording media and outputs the data to the bus <b>35</b>. For example, when copying of content recorded in the HDD <b>36</b> to the DVD <b>38</b> is instructed, the drive <b>37</b> records the content supplied from the HDD <b>36</b> through the bus <b>35</b> on the DVD <b>38</b>. More specifically, the CPU <b>31</b> executes transcoding to make the format of the content compliant with the format of the DVD <b>38</b> or the BD <b>39</b> before recording the content on the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A communication unit <b>41</b> communicates with external devices connected thereto through, for example, an institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) 1394 cable and receives content from the external devices through the bus <b>35</b>.</p>

Since the broadcasting receiving function of the recording apparatus <b>30</b> is the same as that of the receiver <b>10</b>, a description thereof is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Transmission of content between the above-described receiver <b>10</b> and the recording apparatus <b>30</b> will now be described.</p>

On the basis of the input operation, recording destination information is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The CPU <b>11</b> restricts transmission methods of content recorded in the HDD <b>17</b> in accordance with a copy restriction defined by, for example, a digital copy control descriptor.

The CPU <b>11</b> also acquires recordable medium type information from the recording apparatus <b>30</b> in a manner described below and displays only types of recordable media in a selectable manner.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The control point (control device) can control each UPnP device connected to a network. Functions of the control point may be included in the media server. The functions of the control point may be included in all of devices constituting the network or may be included in given devices constituting the network. In this example, the functions of the control point are included in the receiver <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The functions of the control point are mainly categorized into two kinds, namely, an action and a query. The action is executed in a method defined by action information of a service description. By executing the action, the control point can operate a target. The query is used to extract values of device information of the service description. A transport protocol called SOAP is utilized in execution of the action or the query. The XML is used to represent the SOAP.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The media server has a function called a contents directory service (CDS). The media server notifies the control point of kinds of content stored in the media server. The CDS has two abstracted objects, namely, a container and an item. The container and the item correspond to a folder and a file of Windows&#xae;, respectively, which is an operating system provided by Microsoft corporation.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At STEP S<b>55</b>, after completion of transmission of content of one title, the receiver <b>10</b> notifies the recording apparatus <b>30</b> of the termination of the transmission of the content (&#x201c;StopPost&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">At STEP S<b>56</b>, upon receiving the &#x201c;StopPost&#x201d;, the recording apparatus <b>30</b> transmits a completion signal to the receiver <b>10</b>. In the case of copying, transmission of the completion signal may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In such a protocol, content is uploaded to the recording apparatus <b>30</b> from the receiver <b>10</b> (control point). In particular, at STEP S<b>48</b>, the recording apparatus <b>30</b> returns a variable of &#x201c;currentMediaType=all&#x201d;, whereby the receiver <b>10</b> can recognize that the recording apparatus <b>30</b> has a function for storing the recording destination information. Accordingly, the receiver <b>10</b> can specify a plurality of recording medium types in &#x201c;CreateObjectAction&#x201d; or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The source device generally checks an inserted medium before transmission in the related art. However, according to the embodiment, the recording apparatus <b>30</b> stores a plurality of pieces of recording destination information in association with the plurality of pieces of content, whereby transmission of a plurality of pieces of content can be performed at a high speed. In addition, the recording medium can be ejected during the processing and shortage of an available space can be coped with.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The recording apparatus <b>30</b> outputs a completion signal in response to completion of recording of each content in the HDD <b>36</b>, whereby the receiver <b>10</b> can start transmission of the next content without waiting for completion of writing of the content on a recording medium when a plurality of pieces of content are recorded on different types of recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In addition, since the receiver <b>10</b> can transmit a plurality of pieces of content in a short period, the receiver <b>10</b> can start a next operation rapidly, which is significantly convenient to users.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Although the embodiments have been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments and can be variously modified on the basis of the technical concept of the present invention.</p>
