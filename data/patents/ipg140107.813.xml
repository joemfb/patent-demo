<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention herein relates to a round baler having endless bale forming means routed over at least one roll on each of three or more arms rotating about one or more axes. The rolls of adjacent arms have a distance between each other bridged by a span of the bale forming means, against which span material to be baled is pressed by a feeder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">European Patent Document EP 1 264 532 A1 discloses a round baler of the non-stop type, which has three arms rotating about a common axis and having rolls at their free ends. A loop is formed between rolls of adjacent arms by crop coming from a pick-up. Either a feeder moves a bale along the baler and returns to a start position or it hands over the started bale to a second conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">European Patent Document EP 1 836 890 shows another non-stop round baler with three arms, which are journaled for a pivoting movement on three different axes. Loops are created by incoming crop in flexible bale forming means in an area between adjacent rolls on the arms. During its formation the bale is located on three different carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus the problem to be solved with respect to the prior art balers is seen in either the difficulty to return the feeder fast enough to the start position or in the transition between the formation of a bale core and the bale in a growing loop.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A bale core is created by pressing the material against the short and less flexible span of bale forming means between the rolls of the same arm and therefore provides for a small size cavity, in which material gets immediately in contact with the bale forming means and starts rotation. The short span gives less freedom to the bale and thus bale starting is easier to control. On such an arm two or more rolls may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The advantage of a feeder being moveable with respect to the location of arms resides in the fact, that such a feeder can be brought into the best position for feeding crop into an auxiliary bale chamber. It is not necessary to wait until the affected arms have reached their optimal position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Interaction between the conveyor and components located downstream and upstream of it will result in best crop flow, if the structural relationship between them is not changed during the move, which is achieved, by locating all such components on a common carrier or frame.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to provide for a good bale core start, the initial bale chamber may be kept small by providing one or more guides at a portion of the conveyor circumference, which delimit(s) the bale chamber partly. Such guide(s) may be located in the 1st or 4th quadrant (depending on the sense of rotation), since they are facing the bale forming means. They may be formed as a grid, sheet metal, strippers, or the like. The guide(s) may run under an acute angle to the surface of the bale forming means to facilitate bale starting.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The feeder/conveyor will operate more sophisticatedly if it can assume further functions, like cutting the goods into pieces or conditioning them. An overload situation can be avoided or a plug or obstruction can be removed, if a moveable wall portion is provided, that can be operated by springs, motors, etc. Depending on the sense of rotation the wall portion may be a bottom or top sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to release or prevent stress on the arms, the rolls are mounted moveably on the arms, such that they can follow a given track or guide, where the forces are assumed. Movability can be achieved by a pivot movement or a translatory movement of a brace, carrier or the like with the rolls. The contour of the side walls may form the shape of the roll path.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Controlling the density of a bale, speeding up its ejection, and giving enough time to start forming a bale core is enhanced by controlling the speed and position of the arms. Such control may happen in a closed or open loop and be influenced by signals received from machine sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Starting bale forming is more efficient, if the bale core is in contact with moving parts, like the tips of carriers on the conveyor, which may protrude through the guide. The extent of the protrusion may vary and be adjusted by a movement of the guide.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another conveyor returning lost goods to the stream of goods/crop to be baled may be provided at various places in the round baler, but especially underneath the bale chamber(s). Such a conveyor may be formed as a band, an auger, a blower, an oscillating pan, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to bring and keep the arms into the position needed to create the bale chambers, a transmission is provided, in which drive shafts may be locked in a non-driven state, wherein such lock may be created by a brake, a mechanical positive lock or valves, if drive happens by individual hydraulic motors. The drive shafts may also move, e.g. rotate, if they are connected to an input shaft by a clutch, which may be of any type, or again by a hydraulic or electric motor. As an alternative a planetary gear may be used to drive the shafts and/or all shafts could be in a constant move even if with different speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the running direction of the bale forming means is chosen such, that the tension in the main bale chamber is higher than in the auxiliary bale chamber, bale core building is easier and density in the completed bale is higher.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a round baler <b>10</b> with a chassis <b>12</b>, side walls <b>14</b>, an arm-and-roller assembly <b>16</b> and flexible bale forming means <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The round baler <b>10</b> is shown as a pull type round baler, to be coupled to a pulling vehicle, such as a tractor, but can be part of a self-propelled vehicle as well. Such a round baler <b>10</b> is used to produce bales <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of straw, hay, alfalfa, etc., in a main bale chamber <b>24</b> and in an auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b>, which bales <b>20</b> are tied or wrapped before they are ejected and dumped to the ground. This type of a round baler <b>10</b> is formed as a so-called non-stop round baler, i.e. the round baler <b>10</b> is picking up and baling material and unloading a bale <b>20</b> without interrupting the advancement over the field. Other materials may be cotton, garbage, fabric, branches of wood, etc., which may be baled, while the round baler <b>10</b> is stationary and where a pick-up assembly <b>46</b> is fed differently.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The chassis <b>12</b> has a frame <b>28</b> supported on an axle <b>30</b>, having a vertical structure <b>32</b> and bearing a tongue <b>34</b> to connect the round baler <b>10</b> to a tractor or the like. The axle <b>30</b> is equipped with wheels <b>35</b> to support the round baler <b>10</b> on the ground. The wheels <b>35</b> may be single wheels or wheels on an axle <b>30</b> formed as a tandem axle (not shown). The chassis <b>12</b>/structure <b>32</b> may be provided with side shields <b>36</b> to cover the functional elements of the round baler <b>10</b> for safety reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The structure <b>32</b> among other things carries rotatably a lower front roll <b>38</b>, an upper front roll <b>40</b>, a moveable roll <b>42</b>, an upper rear roll <b>44</b>, the pick-up assembly <b>46</b> and a feeder <b>47</b> with a conveyor <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a side view the side walls <b>14</b> are substantially of a rectangular shape with rounded corner portions. The size and form of the side walls <b>14</b> is determined by the maximum size of the bales <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> formed in the auxiliary and main chambers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. The bottom edge of the side walls <b>14</b> follows a saddle roof with an elevated portion in the center and is vertically distant from the top of conveyor <b>48</b>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the side walls <b>14</b> are fixed to the structure <b>32</b> in a center area by means of an axle <b>52</b>. In order to withstand the pressing forces in the bale chambers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> the side walls <b>14</b> are reinforced against bending in a known manner by means of stiffener plates and bars (not shown). In addition abutments <b>146</b> are provided, which act between different portions of the side walls <b>14</b> and the structure <b>32</b> to counteract the pressure inside the bale chambers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. Such abutments are moveable to free the path of the arms <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> during their rotation. The axles <b>52</b> may be provided with a hydraulic cylinder or the like to move the side walls <b>14</b> laterally, over a small distance, to decrease the friction between the bales <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and the side walls <b>14</b> during ejection of the bale <b>20</b> or over bigger distances to increase the width of the bale chamber <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> during the bale forming process. The diameter and the cross section of the axle <b>52</b> depend on the structure of the arm-and-roller-assembly <b>16</b>, which is rotating about the axles <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The arm-and-roller-assembly <b>16</b> comprises a first arm <b>54</b>, a second arm <b>56</b> and a third arm <b>58</b>, each provided with a pair of parallel rollers <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a </i>at their radially outer end area. It further comprises a first drive wheel <b>54</b><i>b</i>, a second drive wheel <b>56</b><i>b </i>and a third drive wheel <b>58</b><i>b </i>assigned and connected to the respective arms <b>54</b> to <b>58</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each arm <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> is formed of two parts <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, which are moveable with respect to each other and the relative position between which can be adjusted automatically in that the rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>58</b><i>a </i>follow the contour of the side walls <b>14</b> or a track on this contour or are moved on such or a similar path by means of a motor <b>64</b>, such as a hydraulic motor or alternatively an electric motor. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> and <b>9</b> to <b>12</b> the parts are connected to each other in a pivoting fashion, allowing a pivoting movement between the outer part <b>62</b> and inner part <b>60</b> in a substantially radial direction. Both parts <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are hinged to each other in a joint the pivot axis of which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the axle <b>52</b>, whereas the parts <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are of about the same length. Reference is also made to European Patent Document EP 1 264 532. In a alternative arrangement (not shown) both parts <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are telescopically arranged so that they can be extended and retracted in a radial direction by a motor or mechanical guidance. One set of first, second and third arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> is provided on each side of the round baler <b>10</b> in the space between the side walls <b>14</b> and the structure <b>32</b>. The arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> of each set are connected among each other through a brace <b>65</b> which rotatably receives the respective rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<b>58</b><i>a </i>or which holds a carrier on which these rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<b>58</b><i>a </i>are mounted. Preferably the rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<b>58</b><i>a </i>can assume different positions versus the arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> to follow the periphery of the side walls <b>14</b>, but their longitudinal axes are always parallel to axles <b>52</b>. The inner part <b>60</b> of each arm <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> is journaled on the axle <b>52</b> directly or indirectly for a rotation thereabout. For that purpose each inner part <b>60</b> is rigidly connected to one of the drive wheels <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<b>58</b><i>b</i>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> all driven wheels <b>54</b><i>b </i>to <b>58</b><i>b </i>are journaled concentrically, whereas the drive wheel <b>54</b><i>b </i>of the first arm <b>54</b> is axially outermost and the drive wheel <b>58</b><i>b </i>of the third arm <b>58</b> is the axially innermost.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each of the drive wheels <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<b>58</b><i>b </i>is assigned to a drive shaft <b>68</b><i>a </i>to <b>68</b><i>c</i>, which drive shafts <b>68</b><i>a </i>to <b>68</b><i>c </i>can be driven independently of each other, by means of a hydraulic or electric motor (not shown) for example, or via a mechanical transmission and clutches as will be described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Each drive wheel <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<b>58</b><i>b </i>is also surrounded by a driving means <b>70</b> surrounding also drive wheels <b>69</b><i>a </i>to <b>69</b><i>c </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) on each of the drive shafts <b>68</b><i>a </i>to <b>68</b><i>c </i>and being engaged with both. If the drive wheels <b>54</b><i>b </i>to <b>58</b><i>b </i>and the drive wheels <b>69</b><i>a </i>to <b>69</b><i>c </i>are formed as sprockets, the driving means <b>70</b> are chains; if they are formed as sheaves, the driving means <b>70</b> are belts. Each drive wheel <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<b>58</b><i>b </i>is operated such, that it can bring the respective arm <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> into a certain position and keep it in said position until a change is necessary. As it becomes apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> and <b>9</b> to <b>12</b> the arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> while remaining in the same sequence rotate about axles <b>52</b> during one full baling cycle, whereas the distance between and the operational length of the individual arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> changes through the cycle. In order to avoid a bending and/or torsion of the arm-and-roll-assembly <b>16</b> comprising the respective arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> and the braces <b>65</b> a respective drive wheel <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<b>58</b><i>b </i>is provided preferably on both sides of the round baler <b>10</b>. Control of drive shafts <b>68</b><i>a </i>to <b>68</b><i>c </i>will be described in more detail further below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flexible bale forming means <b>18</b> is formed in this embodiment by multiple belts arranged side-by-side and starting with the lower front roll <b>38</b> are trained over the front roll <b>38</b>, two idler rolls <b>39</b> and <b>41</b>, upper front roll <b>40</b>, moveable roll <b>42</b>, an idler roll <b>43</b> close to the upper front roll <b>40</b>, upper rear roll <b>44</b> and finally rolls <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>54</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively a chain-and-slat-assembly could be used instead as well as a belt extending over the full span between the side walls <b>14</b>. The flexible bale forming means <b>18</b> are well known and fixed in length and width, although they may lengthen slightly under the tension applied. In case of several bale forming means <b>18</b> their number corresponds to the distance between the side walls <b>14</b> and can be varied if said distance is changed. The bias in the bale forming means <b>18</b> is maintained by means of force applied by a spring <b>72</b> or the like on the moveable roll <b>42</b> and/or on one of the idler rolls <b>39</b>, <b>41</b>. The moveable roll <b>42</b> or idler rolls <b>39</b> or <b>41</b> may be carried on a pivotable arm (not shown) or in a sliding carriage (not shown) against the bias of said spring <b>72</b>. At least one of the rolls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>a </i>is driven and preferably it is one of the stationary rolls <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, whereas rubber sleeves of smaller width and with grooves may be used between the rolls <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> and the bale forming means <b>18</b> to increase the drive friction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Having two rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a </i>on each arm <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> provides for a better routing of the flexible bale forming means <b>18</b> and the ability to create a bigger distance between the bale chambers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. It would be possible to have three rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a </i>on each arm offset to each other to create some friction and thus tension in the bale forming means <b>18</b>. Depending on the travel direction of the flexible bale forming means <b>18</b>, such friction may increase the tension in the bale forming means <b>18</b> downstream of it and decrease the friction upstream of it. This enables to reduce the tension in the bale forming means <b>18</b> in the auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b>, which assists in starting a bale, and to increase the tension of the bale forming means <b>18</b> in the main bale chamber <b>24</b>, which provides for a higher density of the final bale <b>20</b>. The friction may be adjusted by means of motors, screws, etc. The direction of the bale forming means is as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the arm-and-roller-assembly <b>16</b> enables the formation of a main bale chamber <b>24</b> and an auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b>, whereas the main bale chamber <b>24</b> is the rear one, in which the bale <b>20</b> is completed. The main bale chamber <b>24</b> is substantially enclosed by a loop of the flexible bale forming means <b>18</b> formed between the adjacent rolls <b>58</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the third and the second arm <b>58</b>, <b>56</b> while the auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b> is substantially enclosed by a loop of the flexible bale forming means <b>18</b> formed between the adjacent rolls <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the second and the first arm <b>56</b>, <b>54</b>. Since arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> rotate counterclockwise when looking to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> during the formation of a bale <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, the description so far referred to a situation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>; in a subsequent bale forming cycle the auxiliary bale <b>22</b> would be formed in a loop created between rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a </i>of first and third arms <b>54</b> and <b>58</b>, since the entire set of arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> will be offset by one arm per cycle. The size of said loops depends on the position of the arms <b>54</b> to <b>58</b>, whereas within limits the size of each single loop can be varied by adjusting the position and the length of the involved arms <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> or <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. It is visible from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that the loops stay within the periphery of the side walls <b>14</b> but could assume a size up to it. As is apparent from the sequence given in the order of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, each auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b> turns into a main bale chamber <b>24</b> as soon as it is moved far enough to the rear, so that a second loop may be formed above conveyor <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The pick-up assembly <b>46</b> is of a conventional design with elastic tines rotating in vertical planes to lift crop from the ground and deliver it rearward into the conveyor <b>48</b>. The pick-up assembly <b>46</b> may be wider than the distance between the side walls <b>14</b> and have converging augers to deliver said crop towards a center area, as it is known in the prior art and not shown thus.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Conveyor <b>48</b> is located between the pick-up assembly <b>46</b> and the wheels <b>35</b>. It is located underneath the front portion of the side walls <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Conveyor <b>48</b> is of the rotary feeder type and has a rotor <b>100</b>, whereas its axis runs horizontally transverse to the flow of crop. Rotor <b>100</b> is circumferentially provided with radially extending curved carriers <b>102</b>, which interact with one or more guides <b>104</b>, usually well known as strippers. Conveyor <b>48</b> is provided with a cutting unit <b>106</b> cooperating with the carriers <b>102</b> in order to cut the incoming crop into short pieces. Such cutting unit <b>106</b> is of the widely known type and may be made non-operational to leave the crop uncut, may be provided with an overload mechanism, may change the number of active knives etc. Conveyor <b>48</b> has an outlet <b>92</b> with a moveable wall portion <b>108</b>, which wall portion <b>108</b> is attached to the chassis <b>12</b> of the pick-up assembly <b>46</b> in any of the known kinds, i.e. merely pivotable, pivotable against the force of a spring, moveable in a track, etc. In the embodiment shown the wall portion <b>108</b> is pivoted by means of a motor <b>110</b>, which at one side is held by the chassis <b>12</b> or the pick-up assembly <b>46</b> and at the other side connects to the wall portion <b>108</b>. The guide <b>104</b> is provided with slots or gaps (not shown) through which the tips of the carriers <b>102</b> reach. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and as it will be described in more details later, a core of a bale <b>22</b> is formed in a cavity between the conveyor <b>48</b>, a deflector assembly <b>114</b> and the bale forming means <b>18</b>, whereas in this situation the core is in contact with conveyor <b>48</b> and kept rotating by means of the tips of the carriers <b>102</b> and the bale forming means <b>18</b>. The cavity is the beginning of the auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The deflector assembly <b>114</b> contains a preferably driven roll and a scraper to avoid wrapping of crop around the roll. The deflector assembly <b>114</b> is located at the outlet <b>92</b> of conveyor <b>48</b> and in the path to the auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b>. The deflector assembly <b>114</b> extends parallel to the rotor <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As can seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> a filler plate assembly <b>74</b> is provided on each side of the round baler <b>10</b> between the lower edge of the side walls <b>14</b> and the feeder <b>47</b> to avoid that material, like leafs or brittle straw, escapes from the respective bale chamber <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> through this gap or on the path between the conveyor <b>48</b> and the bale chambers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. Each filler plate assembly <b>74</b> comprises filler plates <b>76</b> at various locations, and is moveable between a position closing said gap and a position in which it is moved out of the path of the respective rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>58</b><i>a</i>. Movement may be achieved either through slanted surfaces at the leading end, so that the approaching roll <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a </i>moves the filler plate <b>76</b> away. Or it may be achieved by an actuator like a motor, a linkage or the like, moving the filler plate <b>76</b> in a track or about an axis. Each filler plate <b>76</b> may consist of several portions which are moved subsequently away from the gap depending on the position of the respective roll <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a</i>. Portions of the filler plate <b>76</b> may be moved in a cycle along the side walls <b>14</b> in order to cover always the gap between conveyor <b>48</b> and the side walls <b>14</b>. For this purpose one set of portions of the filler plate <b>76</b> may be attached to the side wall <b>14</b> about a horizontal axis <b>84</b> to pivot away, when another portion moves along the side walls <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The position and&#x2014;if not controlled mechanically by tracks or the like&#x2014;also the operational length of the arms <b>54</b> to <b>58</b>, i.e. in this embodiment the inclination between the inner and outer parts <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> is controlled by means of a control circuit <b>78</b> having a controller <b>80</b> and sensors <b>82</b> and acting on the drive wheels <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>and any motors used in the round baler <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The controller <b>80</b> is preferably in the form of a software operated computer located on the round baler <b>10</b> or on the pulling vehicle and is producing output signals according to a given program.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sensors <b>82</b> may be provided to measure the position and if needed the radial extension of each arm <b>54</b>-<b>58</b>. Other values may be gathered as well, like the condition and amount of the crop or any kind of goods, the position of the moveable roll <b>42</b> or one of the idler rolls <b>39</b>, <b>41</b>, the position of the round baler <b>10</b> on the field, the status of the tying or wrapping cycle, the diameter of the bales <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> on each side, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The round baler <b>10</b> is furthermore provided with a conveyor <b>116</b>, a wrapping apparatus <b>118</b> and an unloading mechanism <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The conveyor <b>116</b> is formed as a closed band routed around two rolls, of which at least one is driven such, that the upper run of the band moves towards the conveyor <b>48</b>. The upper surface of the conveyor <b>116</b> extends more or less parallel to the lower edge of the side walls <b>14</b> and is oriented horizontally or slightly inclined from the rear to the front. The conveyor <b>116</b> has a distance to the path of the rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a</i>, which is sufficient to carry small crop without any interference. It is the purpose of the conveyor <b>116</b> to catch brittle crop leaving the main bale chamber <b>24</b> and return it to conveyor <b>48</b>. For that purpose, wall portion <b>108</b> leaves a gap towards deflector assembly <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The wrapping apparatus <b>118</b> is provided to feed net and/or plastic (not shown) into the area between the flexible bale forming means <b>18</b> and the main bale <b>20</b> in the main bale chamber <b>24</b>, when the main bale <b>20</b> is completed. As it is known from wrapping apparatuses in the art, such a wrapping apparatus <b>118</b> comprises one or more rolls of wrapping material in a housing, a feeding mechanism, like a so-called duckbill, a braking device and a cutting device. The wrapping apparatus <b>118</b> is located in the rear lower area of the round baler <b>10</b> behind the conveyor <b>118</b> and underneath the rear portion of the sidewalls <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The unloading mechanism <b>120</b> has a ramp <b>122</b> pivoting about a horizontal transverse axis <b>124</b>, whereas the position of the ramp <b>122</b> is controlled by the weight of an unloaded bale <b>20</b> acting against a spring force, or by motors&#x2014;none of them being shown. The ramp <b>122</b> will be in a lower position, in which its rear end touches or almost touches the ground in order to let a bale <b>20</b> roll out of the main bale chamber <b>26</b>, and it will be in a raised position during the formation of a bale <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While it is not shown in the drawing, a tying mechanism for twine may be provided at the open side of the main bale chamber <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The output signals generated by the controller <b>80</b> among others provide for a movement of the arms <b>54</b>-<b>58</b> and their parts <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> such, that the rollers <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<b>58</b><i>a </i>at their end follow the sequence given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>.

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Empty Bale Chambers&#x2014;Not Shown</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">First arm <b>54</b> is in a front medium high position, rolls <b>56</b><i>a </i>of second arm <b>56</b> are on both sides of the front lower corner and third arm <b>58</b> is in a lower position at about the middle of the length of the side walls <b>14</b>. Bale forming means <b>18</b> extend over their rolls <b>54</b><i>a </i>to <b>58</b><i>a </i>to form sort of a rectangle in which a front section extends above and close to the upper surface of conveyor <b>48</b>. In this stage at least the moveable roll <b>42</b> is in an rightmost position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the spring <b>72</b> is under little bias. The bale forming means <b>18</b> do not provide a loop between the rolls <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>a </i>of the second and the third arm <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> but a substantially straight span, which is deflected upwardly by deflector assembly <b>114</b></p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Auxiliary Bale Chamber Gets Filled&#x2014;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>1</b>:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the presence of a bale <b>20</b> in the main bale chamber <b>24</b> should be ignored, since the following description deals with making a very first bale core in the auxiliary bale chamber <b>26</b>, which is the same irrespective of the presence of a main bale <b>20</b> or not.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Crop is collected by the pick-up assembly <b>46</b> and fed rearward to the conveyor <b>48</b>, where it is cut into short pieces, if the cutting unit <b>106</b> is in its operational position; otherwise it is only forwarded undershot by the rotor <b>100</b>. Wall portion <b>108</b> of the conveyor <b>48</b> is in its upward position and extends towards the deflector assembly <b>114</b>. Crop is guided upward through outlet <b>92</b> towards the bale forming means <b>18</b>, thereby passing the deflector assembly <b>114</b>. The crop will hit the bale forming means <b>18</b> at the span bridging the distance between the front and the rear roll <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the second arm <b>56</b> to create a small loop in which crop is accumulated and formed to a cylindrical core of a bale <b>22</b>. Obviously the size of this loop between the rolls <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the same arm <b>56</b> is limited and for that purpose second arm <b>56</b> is moved to the rear to let bale forming means <b>18</b> create a bigger loop between the rear roll <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the first arm <b>54</b> and the front roll <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the second arm <b>56</b>; such bigger loop is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that an auxiliary bale <b>22</b> may reach its maximum size spanning the full height of the side walls <b>14</b>, while all arms <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> remain substantially in their position. Until the auxiliary bale <b>22</b> grows to the maximum size, it rests on the rear roll <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the second arm <b>56</b> and on the front roll <b>58</b><i>a </i>of the third arm <b>58</b>, all being located in the front half of the side walls <b>14</b>. Once an auxiliary bale <b>22</b> reached the wanted size and goods/crop is furthermore delivered second arm <b>56</b> is moved downwards and rearwards, whereas its rear roll <b>56</b><i>a </i>moves upwardly, which causes the auxiliary bale <b>22</b> to tilt towards the main bale chamber <b>24</b>&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this situation a span of the bale forming means <b>18</b> bridging both rolls <b>56</b><i>a </i>of arm <b>56</b> covers the distances between the deflector assembly <b>114</b> and the guides <b>104</b>, to close a triangular cavity in outlet <b>92</b>, where crop may accumulate, get compacted and starts rolling under the impact of the carriers <b>102</b> and the surface of the bale forming means <b>18</b>. While the auxiliary bale <b>22</b> is growing&#x2014;see FIG. <b>5</b>&#x2014;the main bale <b>20</b> in the main bale chamber <b>24</b> gets wrapped by means of the wrapping apparatus <b>118</b>. As soon as the main bale <b>20</b> is wrapped or tied third arm <b>58</b> is raised above the main bale <b>20</b> to open the main bale chamber <b>24</b> and unload the main bale <b>20</b> via ramp <b>122</b>, which is pushed down (not shown) by the weight of it&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

In this concept at least three parallel drive lines are provided in a gear box <b>126</b>, whereas all drivelines are driven via a spur gear transmission <b>128</b> such, that per drive line one input shaft <b>130</b> is driven constantly from a main input shaft <b>132</b>, which itself is driven by the pulling vehicle and which is connected in this embodiment via a bevel gear. Each input shaft <b>130</b> is connected to a clutch <b>134</b>, which may be a hydraulically or electrically operated disc, multiple disc or band clutch. On the output side of the clutch <b>134</b> is provided a drive shaft <b>68</b><i>a </i>to <b>68</b><i>c</i>, to which is assigned a brake <b>136</b>, which again may be of the disk or band type and which also is activated/deactivated and closed/opened hydraulically or electrically. A non-shown control assures, that in each drive line clutch <b>134</b> is closed, when brake <b>136</b> is open or vice versa. Accordingly shafts <b>68</b><i>a </i>to <b>68</b><i>c </i>will either be driven or locked against rotation to keep the respective arm <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in its respective position. Instead of main input shaft <b>132</b> and a spur gear transmission <b>128</b> a non-shown hydraulic or electric motor could be used per input shaft <b>130</b>. In this case&#x2014;depending on the used hydraulic or electric circuit&#x2014;no clutch <b>134</b> and brake <b>136</b> may be required. Furthermore, the speed to move arms <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be adjusted to the given operation mode of the arms e.g. an arm <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> moving to unload a finished bale may be moved faster than an arm controlling the growth of an auxiliary bale <b>22</b>. Alternatively one or more planetary gears may be used to drive input shafts <b>130</b> or drive shafts <b>68</b><i>a </i>to <b>68</b><i>c</i>, which either of its elements. Depending on the baling process all arms <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> could be kept rotating all the time, although&#x2014;if need be&#x2014;at different speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When ever the rolls <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<b>58</b><i>a </i>are moved through the gap between the lower edge of the side walls <b>14</b> and the top surface of the feeder <b>47</b> the filler plates <b>76</b> are moved away to free the track.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 12</figref>, differs from that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> insofar, as the pick-up assembly <b>46</b>, the feeder <b>47</b>, the deflector assembly <b>114</b> and the conveyor <b>116</b> form a single unit <b>98</b>, which can be moved along the longitudinal direction of the round baler <b>10</b>. Said unit <b>98</b> comprises a frame <b>138</b> and rails <b>140</b>, whereas the frame <b>138</b> holds the pick-up assembly <b>46</b>, the feeder <b>47</b>, the deflector assembly <b>114</b> and the conveyor <b>116</b>. The rails <b>140</b> are connected to chassis <b>12</b> and extend horizontally in an area between the wheels <b>35</b>. The frame <b>138</b> is received in or on the rails <b>140</b> by means of rollers <b>142</b> and is moved by means of a motor <b>144</b>. Said motor <b>144</b> may be a hydraulic or electric motor and is connected to the chassis <b>12</b> at one side and to the frame <b>138</b> at the other side. Control of the motor <b>144</b> again happens via control circuit <b>78</b> and controller <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The following description deals only with the difference to the function of the first embodiment, which happens shortly after a bale core is formed, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 10</figref>. As is apparent by a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 11</figref>, moving unit <b>98</b> during the formation of a bale core to the front allows the formation of a considerable loop between rear roll <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the first arm <b>54</b> and front roll <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the second and third arm <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> already, before second arm <b>56</b> has moved with the main bale <b>20</b> completely to the rear. This allows a higher baling speed, since the auxiliary bale <b>22</b> may grow faster and earlier. While the second and third arms <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> together with the main bale <b>20</b> move towards the rear into a position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, unit <b>98</b> and with it outlet <b>92</b> move with the arm and roller assembly <b>16</b> to the rear as well.</p>
