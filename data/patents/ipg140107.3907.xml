<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention refers to an audio module for a video surveillance system, a video surveillance system and a method for keeping a plurality of locations under surveillance. More specifically the invention refers to an audio module for a video surveillance system with a display screen which is organised in a plurality of cameos, whereby the audio module comprises a plurality of input channels for audio-in-signals individually referring to the cameos, an allocation table allocating the audio-in-signals to the cameos and output channels for audio-out-signals.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Video surveillance systems are widely used to monitor critical locations of public or private buildings or institutes like private homes, museums, prisons, factories, hazardous areas and so on from one or more central surveillance rooms. Commonly, the surveillance rooms are equipped with a plurality of monitors each displaying one of the critical locations or a mosaic display, which is divided in a plurality of cameos, whereby each cameo displays one of the critical locations. Additionally audio signals corresponding to the images displayed on the single monitors or cameos can be played.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Document WO 99/59340 discloses an observation system with a plurality of observation cameras and an observation monitor unit which displays the images from the observation cameras in a plurality of cameos. In case of an occurrence a further cameo is superimposed on the observation monitor showing a recorded video stream in connection with the occurrence. This document comprises no disclosure about a processing of audio signals in connection with the images displayed on the monitor or cameos.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Document WO 00/68908 describes a surveillance system, which also comprises a plurality of cameras and a central station with a plurality of monitors for displaying the images captured by the cameras. Additionally the surveillance system includes detector devices for providing a signal when movement in the monitored areas is detected. The signals may be generated in the central control room as an audible alarm. This document is assumed to represent the closest prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Audio-signal generating and forming is a wide technical field which is especially often used in the entertainment industry. Known concepts are stereophonic sounds to create a pleasant and natural impression of sound heard from various directions as in natural hearings. Also surround sound is known as a concept of expanding the spatial imaging of audio playback.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">From the abstract of the document Patent Abstracts of Japan, publication number 2004023180 A with the title &#x201c;voice transmission apparatus, voice transmission method and program&#x201d; it might be concluded that this document discloses a concept whereby in a first step a speaking person is imaged with a camera, in a second step the face direction of the speaking person is derived via image processing and in a third step the camera is turned in the direction of a person in the face direction (=listening person) of the speaking person. Additionally the voice of the speaking person is transmitted to the listening person in form of a wireless audio signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is concerned with an audio module for a video surveillance system with the features of claim <b>1</b>, a surveillance system with the features of claim <b>10</b> and a method of keeping a plurality of locations under surveillance with the features of claim <b>14</b>. The dependent claims refer to preferred and/or advantageous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The audio module according to the invention is preferably realised as a programmable processing unit, especially as a DSP (digital signal processor), micro-controller, personal computer, or as a non-programmable digital signal processing hardware (for example IC or ASIC) or the like. The audio module is adapted to be used with a video surveillance system as known by the person skilled in the art and especially as described in the introducing portion. The surveillance system comprises a display screen which is organised and/or divided in several overlapping and/or non-overlapping cameos or tiles.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The audio module comprises input channels for audio-in-signals, whereby the input channels are preferably realised as mono channels for receiving mono audio-in-signals. An allocation table is provided for allocating the audio-in-signals to the cameos or tiles of the display screen, especially to (virtual) positions of the cameos or tiles in an aural space. The allocation table is preferably embodied as a programmed or programmable table. As an alternative the allocation table is realised as wired connections. Furthermore the audio module comprises output channels for audio-out-signals. One or more amplifier are optionally provided for amplifying the audio-out-signals. As an alternative the audio-out-signals are realised as a binary data-stream which is converted in an analogue audio-stream and amplified subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention the audio module comprises audio positioning means which are realised to generate the audio-out-signals as stereophonic and/or surround sound signals preferably with directional information on the basis of the audio-in signals and the allocation table. In other words the plurality of separate audio-in-signals are combined and/or merged and/or converted into the audio-out-signals, whereby the audio-out-signals are realised as stereophonic and/or surround sound signals which comprise directional information on the basis of the allocation table. Preferably the number of channels of the audio-out-signals is smaller than the number of input channels.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Video surveillance systems as known from the state of the art provide display screens or video walls which allow a single guard to oversee many cameras from a central surveillance room. The monitoring of the video walls is normally quite boring so that the attention of the guard decreases in time. In order to draw the attention of the guard to a special occurrence it is known to play an audible signal. But the audible signal itself does not provide a hint where to look on the video wall, so that the guard has to look around and search for the image of the camera causing the alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The underlying idea of the present invention is to add direction to the audible signals or more commonly spoken to the sound of a video surveillance system in order to help the guard finding the camera or the like which should attract his attention. Thus the invention improves the working condition of the guard and therefore contributes to the economy of the security and surveillance function The direction from which the sound appears to come preferably corresponds to the position of the associated video on the video wall.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment of the invention the audio-signals are realised to place at least one virtual audio source, which emits a single audio-in-signal, so that the virtual audio source indicates the direction to the allocated or associated cameo or tile. Preferably the audio-out-signal is realised as a panoramic and/or 3D surround sound signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For the purpose of definition a panoramic sound signal is a sound signal with a panoramic audio control so that the audio signal may be panned. To pan an audio-signal means preferably to shift its position and/or the position of its virtual source between extremes which are available in the audio rendering system. E.g. in a stereo or stereophonic system the audio signal or its virtual source is located between extreme left and extreme right. In a 4-channel system the left/right and front/rear ratios provide a placement of the audio signal and/or virtual sound source in a 360 degree horizontal circle at the height of the loudspeakers. A 3D-Sound surround system is capable of making the audio-signal and/or the virtual sound source to appear to be anywhere, both direction and distance, including the vertical dimension. Known surround sound formats like DVD_A, SACD, ambisonics, quadraphonic, Dolby 5.1 surround sound, DTS and MP3 surround may be used. Also techniques involving psycho-acoustic sound localization methods to simulate a 3D sound field using headphones or &#x201c;audio holograms&#x201d; on the basis of Huygens's principle can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment at least one audio-in-signal is realised as a stereo (stereophonic)&#x2014;signal, which is associated with one of the cameos. Left and right channel of the stereo-signal are placed especially as virtual audio sources in different locations of the overall sound image and/or aural space by means of the audio-out-signal, preferably so that the channels or virtual sources indicate the direction to the allocated cameo.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further embodiment the audio module comprises means for selectively activating and/or deactivating the audio-in-signals and/or means for setting the relative loudness of one and/or up to each of the audio-in signals in the audio-out-signals. These means allow to suppress audio-in-signals preferably completely or partly in order to attract the guard's attention on a selected non-suppressed relevant audio-in-signal. In one realisation all audio-in-signals are deactivated&#x2014;for example in a surveillance mode of the surveillance system. In case of an occurrence a single audio-in-signal is selectively activated and the audio-in-signal will be played on the audio rendering system of the surveillance system indicating the direction to the cameo or tile associated with the activated audio-in-signal. The activation process is preferably triggered by a detector signal, for example of a motion detector, door detector, window detector, PIR detector or by digital image processing algorithms. The activated audio-in-signal is preferably the signal of a microphone associated with the surveillance camera monitoring the location in which a trigger event occurred and/or an artificial alerting sound.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further preferred embodiment the audio module comprises an information interface for receiving the allocation table and/or a memory for the allocation table. Preferably the audio module further comprises means for receiving and/or storing a display screen and/or an audio rendering system configuration. In this embodiment the audio module comprises interfaces or memories for receiving or storing respectively information about the configuration of the surveillance system to which the audio module is adapted to. With the information about the configuration of the display screen and the rendering system as well as the allocation table the audio module is able to generate the audio-out-signal with positional information so that by playing the audio-out-signal on the rendering system the attention of the guard will be attracted to the cameo or tile of the display screen which shows a relevant information.</p>
