<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to management of a data center. More specifically, the invention relates to assessing the operating parameters of a data center, and autonomic selection and implementation of one or more policies for management of the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is recognized that computer data centers are managed according to guidelines as established and managed by a system administrator. The need to manage data centers extends beyond the administration of individual software environments, as such data centers frequently integrate several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An autonomic computing system is a tool that enables the data center to manage itself with objectives established by the system administrator. The essence of autonomic computing is self-management, with the intent to free system administrators from details of system operation and maintenance. In general, autonomic systems configure themselves automatically in accordance with high-level policies representing objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an autonomic computing system, autonomic elements manage their internal behavior and their relationships with other autonomic elements in accordance with policies that administrators or others elements have established. An autonomic element will typically consist of one or more managed elements coupled with a single autonomic manager that controls and represents them. In one embodiment, the managed element may be in the form of a product in a non-autonomic system, although it can be adapted to be controlled and managed by the autonomic manager. More specifically, the managed element may be a hardware resource, such as storage, a processor, a printer, a software resource, etc. The autonomic manager distinguishes the autonomic element from its non-autonomic counter-part. By monitoring the managed element and its external environment, and constructing and executing plans based on an analysis of this information, the autonomic manager will relieve system administrators of the responsibility of directly managing the managed element(s).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, there are limitations associated with the prior art tools for managing data centers. More specifically, the prior art is limited to rules that are configured for specific data centers. Based upon this limitation, the rules need to be updated by a system administrator for different data centers based upon the tools available at the specific data center. Accordingly, there is a need for a self-adapting policy management system for a data center that further reduces the role of the system administrator.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention comprises a method, system, and article for autonomic management of a data center.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect of the invention, a system is provided with a data center having at least one computer system and an associated component, and more specifically with a tool to autonomically manage the data center. The tool is provided with a discovery module to collect data from the data center. The collected data is then employed as input to identify a data center policy in the form of a selection policy and/or an adaptation policy. The discovery module detects and catalogs capabilities of elements of the data center based upon the collected data. The tool is also provided with a policy adaptation rule to dynamically select one or more of the policies, from a policy directory, wherein the selected policy supports the cataloged capabilities of the data center. In addition, a manager is provided in communication with the tool, with the functionality of the manager to apply at least one of the selected policies to manage the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the invention, a computer implemented method is provided for autonomic management of a data center, with the data center housing at least one computer system and an associated component. Data is collection from the data center, and used as input for identifying a data center policy, including a selection policy and/or an adaptation policy. A set of capabilities of elements of the data center are detected and cataloged from the collected data. Thereafter, at least one policy from a policy directory that supports the cataloged capabilities of the data center is dynamically selected. At least one selected policy is applied to manage the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect of the invention, an article is provided with a data center to house at least one computer system and an associated component. The article also includes a computer-readable carrier including computer program instructions configured to autonomically manage the data center. Instructions are provided to collect data from the data center, and to identify a data center policy in the form of a selection policy or an adaptation policy. In addition, instructions are provided to detect and catalog a set of capabilities of elements of the data center from the collected data, and to dynamically select at least one policy from a policy directory. The select policy should support the cataloged capabilities of the data center. Instructions are also provided to apply the selected policy to manage the data center.</p>

One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. The following description is intended only by way of example, and simply illustrates certain selected embodiments of devices, systems, and processes that are consistent with the invention as claimed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A method and system are provided to autonomize dynamic adaptation of the policy behavior of a data center based upon the features supported by the physical components of the data center. More specifically, policy behavior adaptation is based upon one or more levels of automation, available types of data, and the tools of the data center. A discovery tool is employed to gather data pertaining to available avenues for policy execution. Policy rules modify the way the policy is to be executed at run time based upon the specific data center the policy is managing. Accordingly, the policy behavior adaptation together with the policy rule modification eliminates the need to rewrite management rules when the functionality and/or the physical modules of the data center change.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Details</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following description of the embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and which shows by way of illustration the specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized because structural changes may be made without departing form the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The level of automation and applicable policies of a data center vary among different data centers. More specifically, the automation and policies of the data center are different based upon the tools and resources available at the specific data center. The tools and resources available may vary from time to time based upon current tasks, priorities, and/or the health and status of hardware and software modules. In one embodiment, the policies for each data center are configured to ensure that the data of the specific data center is operating at a level to provide optimal performance. More specifically, if a particular automation tool is not available, the policy rules should take appropriate action to take the action at the right level. At the same time, if a sophisticated tool is available, autonomic operations are employed to the lowest granular level of action available.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow diagram (<b>100</b>) illustrating the components employed to determine applicable policies for autonomic operation of a data center. As such, a discovery module (<b>104</b>) is provided in communication with a data center (<b>102</b>). More specifically, the discovery module (<b>104</b>) identifies the specific capabilities of the hardware and software modules that may impact policy execution. In one embodiment, a hardware capability may include the availabilities of a sleep mode or a hibernation mode for a central processing unit in the data center. The discovery module also provides notification of a current dynamic state of the data center, including a policy breach. In one embodiment, the discovery module may re-instate the element affected by the policy breach as part of the breach detection. The specific capabilities of the data center components as discovered by the discovery module (<b>104</b>) will dictate the policies that will be executed for autonomic management of the data center (<b>102</b>). Accordingly, the discovery module (<b>104</b>) detects and catalogs one or more sets of capabilities of the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The data detected by the discovery module is outputted in the flow system (<b>106</b>), and is used as input for the policy activation rules (<b>108</b>). There are actually three factors that are employed as input to the policy activation rules (<b>108</b>), including the discovered data center capabilities (<b>106</b>), the features and configuration of the data center (<b>110</b>) and a set of master operational policies retained in a policy directory for one or more data centers (<b>112</b>). In one embodiment, the features and configuration of the data center (<b>110</b>) is a database having a model upon which policy activation rules for the data center are stored. Similarly, in one embodiment, the policy adaptation rules is a set of domain specific rules that relate the system configuration and its associated functions to the policies. In one embodiment, a particular resource may only subscribe to certain policies. Not all policies in the master directory will apply to every resource in the data center. Based upon the input from the three sources (<b>106</b>), (<b>110</b>), and (<b>112</b>), one or more applicable policies with data center centric behavior(s) is selected (<b>114</b>). In one embodiment, the selection at step (<b>114</b>) is a file output based upon the intersection of the data from the three input sources. Accordingly, one or more set of policies for system administration of the data center is selected based upon a set of master policies retained in the policy directory as well as the specific configuration and capabilities of the data center being evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, policy adaptation rules are employed to select one or more applicable policies for administration of the data center. In one embodiment, each policy adaptation rule representation has meta data tags with each tag to represent a set of pre-requisite metrics and impact, quality of service metrics, and post impact data. The pre-requisite(s) represent a data center function and whether or not it is present, a data center component and whether or not it is present, and a state of the environment. The quality of service attribute(s) include but are not limited to the presence or absence of a specific function, a resolution value, performance numbers, etc. In one embodiment, the quality of service attribute(s) represents that quality of service specified either by the user of the system profile, such as a set of service level requirements typically specified for a particular data center installation. Finally, the post impact attribute pertains to enabling one or more new policies in terms of new functions that may be enabled, additional data that may be available, etc. all of which may be available as a result of enabling another policy. One or more applicable policies are returned for the data center as a set of policies that are relevant to the current state and configuration of the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart (<b>200</b>) illustrating the flow of logic that is employed for selection of policies and rules for autonomic operation of a data center. As shown, system data is collected (<b>202</b>), and quality of service data is also collected (<b>204</b>). System data collected at step (<b>202</b>) pertains to configuration of the subject data center, and quality of service data collected at step (<b>204</b>) pertains to the level of monitoring the data center based upon instrumentation, detectors, sensors, etc. that are available. More specifically, the quality of service data pertains to how accurately variables of the control center can be measured and controlled. Once the data has been collected at steps (<b>202</b>) and (<b>204</b>), the general operating policies for one or more data centers is processed and compiled in a master policy list (<b>206</b>) to select policies appropriate for the subject data center.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As noted above, a policy directory is provided with a set of policies. Different policies may be appropriate for different data centers, based upon their respective configurations and tools. In one embodiment, not all policies in the policy directory are appropriate or relevant for different individual data centers, based upon the configuration of the hardware and software of the individual data centers. Following the collection and processing, it is determined if there are any policies from the selection of policies in the policy directory that may be applicable to the data center based upon the collected data (<b>208</b>). A positive response to the determination at step (<b>208</b>) is followed by an assignment of the quantity of applicable policies from the policy list to be assigned to the variable N<sub>Total </sub>(<b>210</b>). Each of the applicable policies is then evaluated for selection for management and operation of the data center. A counting variable N is assigned to the integer one (<b>212</b>), and Policy<sub>N </sub>in the list of applicable policies is selected for review (<b>214</b>). For Policy<sub>N </sub>it is determined if all of the policy pre-requisites have been met (<b>216</b>). More specifically, the determination at step (<b>216</b>) is a pre-condition to determine if the policy representation from the data center has been satisfied so that the subject master policy can function within the parameters of the data center. In one embodiment, a broader application is appropriate where based on certain meta data or meta rules, a subset of master policies is chosen for a specific data center at a specific time. A positive response to the determination at step (<b>216</b>) is following by selecting the master policy for implementation for management of the data center, together with any new functions that may be enabled as a result of enabling the selected policy for the data center (<b>218</b>). Following step (<b>218</b>) or a negative response to the determination at step (<b>216</b>), the variable N is incremented (<b>220</b>), followed by a determination as to whether there are any policies from the list of applicable policies that remain subject to review (<b>222</b>). A negative response to the determination at step (<b>222</b>) is followed by a return to step (<b>208</b>). Conversely, a positive response to the determination at step (<b>222</b>) or following a negative response to the determination at step (<b>208</b>), an output of a list of applicable policies for the data center is generated (<b>224</b>). At the same time, an output of the expected quality of level of monitoring of the data center is generated (<b>226</b>). Accordingly, one or more policies for monitoring the data center are created, together with a set of quality of service parameters for the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the selection and invocation of data center monitoring policies is conducted at periodic intervals. This enables the policies to adapt to the operation of the data center, and for the data center to adapt to the applicable policies. More specifically, based upon the automation of the policy application, the data center management functions in an autonomic manner.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc. The invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram (<b>300</b>) illustrating a computer system with one or more modules to facilitate autonomic management of a data center. The illustration shows a computer system (<b>302</b>) with a processor unit (<b>304</b>) coupled to memory (<b>306</b>) by a bus structure (<b>310</b>). Although only one processor unit is shown, in one embodiment, the computer system (<b>302</b>) may include more processor units in an expanded design. The computer system (<b>302</b>) is in communication with a data repository (<b>320</b>) and a data center (<b>330</b>). In one embodiment, the data center (<b>330</b>) includes at a minimum at least one computer system (<b>332</b>) and at least one associated component (<b>334</b>). A systems management tool (<b>340</b>) is provided local to the system (<b>302</b>) and in communication with the data center (<b>330</b>). The tool (<b>340</b>) provides the functionality for the autonomic operation and management of the data center. More specifically, the tool (<b>340</b>) includes a discovery module (<b>342</b>) to collect data from the data center (<b>330</b>). The collected data is used as input to identify a data center policy, including a selection policy and/or an adaptation policy. The discovery module (<b>342</b>) functions to both detect and catalog a set of capabilities of the elements of the data center (<b>330</b>) as ascertained from the collected data. In addition, the tool (<b>340</b>) includes a policy adaptation rule (<b>344</b>) to dynamically select and/or adapt at least one policy for management of the data center from a set of master policies retained in a policy directory. In one embodiment, the policy adaptation rule is self-adapting in response to a configuration change of the data center. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the policy adaptation rule includes meta data for representation of a pre-requisite metric, a quality of service metric, and a post impact metric, wherein the pre-requisite metric is a service level requirement for the data center, the quality of service metric value represents availability in the data center of a specific function, an associated resolution value, and a performance number, and a post impact metric is a function that may be enabled in the data center and additional data may be available with activation of the subject selected policy. The selected policy should support the capabilities of the data center, as cataloged. In addition, a manger (<b>350</b>) is provided local to the system (<b>302</b>) an in communication with both the data center (<b>330</b>) and the systems management tool (<b>340</b>).

In one embodiment, the system (<b>302</b>) may be local to the data center (<b>330</b>) or in communication with the data center (<b>330</b>) from a remote location. Similarly, in one embodiment, the tool (<b>340</b>), discovery module (<b>342</b>), and manager (<b>350</b>) may each reside as hardware tools external to memory (<b>306</b>), or they may be implemented as a combination of hardware and software. Similarly, in one embodiment, the tool (<b>340</b>), discovery module (<b>342</b>), and manager (<b>350</b>) may be combined into a single functional item that incorporate the functionality of the separate items. Furthermore, as shown herein, each of the tools (<b>340</b>), discovery module (<b>342</b>), and manager (<b>350</b>) are local to one system (<b>302</b>). However, in one embodiment, they may be collectively or individually distributed across a network and function as a unit to embody the functionality of individual units. Accordingly, the tool (<b>340</b>), discovery module (<b>342</b>), and manager (<b>350</b>) may be implemented as software tools, hardware tools, or a combination of software and hardware tools for managing the functionality of the planner in a distributed manner.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantages Over the Prior Art</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The tools provided for management of the data center support a self adapting policy management system for a data center through dynamically adapting policy behavior based upon the functionality and operating parameters of the subject data center. The policies are dynamically modified based upon the data center eco system. More specifically, it is another level of dynamic autonomic application with autonomic management that is autonomized. Dynamic adaptation of the policies leads to optimal policy execution and more accurate control of the data center. More specifically, a set of management policies is selected based upon features supported by the components of the data center, level of automation, available types of data, and tools of the data center. The policy meta rules control the quality and resolution of policy management actions for the specific data center. Accordingly, this invention teaches a way of dynamically controlling selective application as well adapting the parameters or quality of service too.</p>
