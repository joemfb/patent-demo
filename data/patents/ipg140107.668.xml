<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to exhaust treatment systems and, more particularly, to engine off ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) selective catalytic reduction (SCR) nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) adsorption systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst may be used to reduce emissions in an engine. In an SCR process, nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) reacts with a reductant that is injected by a dosing system into an exhaust stream. The reductant is adsorbed onto the SCR catalyst. The injected dosing agent (e.g., urea) decomposes to form ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). The NH<sub>3 </sub>is the reductant utilized to react with the NO<sub>x</sub>, reducing it to nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The SCR process typically requires relatively high exhaust temperatures (e.g., greater than 200&#xb0; C.). At cold start and at low load operating conditions, engines may generate exhaust with cool exhaust temperatures (e.g., below 200&#xb0; C.). Accordingly, during a cold start phase the highest temperature of the SCR catalyst may be lower than the temperature required to make the SCR catalyst active in reducing NO<sub>x </sub>emission.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An exhaust treatment system for an engine includes a selective catalyst reduction (SCR) treatment module that controls a valve and an air pump to deliver air to an SCR catalyst in response to the engine turning off. An SCR loading module controls the valve and the air pump to deliver air to an exhaust manifold and controls a dosing system to deliver a dosing agent upstream of the SCR catalyst when a temperature of the SCR catalyst is less than a temperature threshold and the SCR catalyst is not saturated with ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other features, a method of operating an exhaust treatment system for an engine includes controlling a valve and an air pump to deliver air to an SCR catalyst in response to the engine turning off. The method includes controlling the valve and the air pump to deliver air to an exhaust manifold. The method includes controlling a dosing system to deliver a dosing agent upstream of the SCR catalyst when a temperature of the SCR catalyst is less than a temperature threshold and the SCR catalyst is not saturated with ammonia.</p>

The term module may include memory (shared, dedicated, or group) that stores code executed by the processor.</p>

The term shared, as used above, means that some or all code from multiple modules may be executed using a single (shared) processor.

In addition, some or all code from a single module may be stored using a group of memories.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An exhaust treatment system according to the present disclosure includes an air pump with an air valve, a three-way catalyst (TWC) with palladium-containing perovskite-based and/or platinum containing alumina-based catalysts, a dosing injector, a temperature sensor, and a NO<sub>x </sub>sensor disposed upstream from a selective catalyst reduction (SCR) catalyst. During an engine start-up period, the TWC converts NO to NO<sub>2 </sub>at a temperature less than the reduction temperature. The SCR catalyst is not able to effectively reduce the NO<sub>2 </sub>into N<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O during the engine start-up period. Instead, the SCR catalyst stores NO<sub>2 </sub>during the engine start-up period. Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) reduces the NO<sub>2 </sub>to nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) after the reduction temperature is exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The SCR catalyst may store more NH<sub>3 </sub>at a predetermined storage temperature than at the reduction temperature. The predetermined storage temperature is less than the reduction temperature. For example, the reduction temperature may be about 200&#xb0; C., and the predetermined storage temperature may be about 150&#xb0; C. When the engine is shut down, the air valve diverts ambient air from the air pump to the SCR catalyst. When the SCR catalyst cools to less than the predetermined storage temperature, the air valve diverts the ambient air through the engine exhaust. The engine, the TWC, and an exhaust manifold heat the ambient air. The heated air has a temperature at least as high as the reduction temperature. The air pump delivers the heated air and dosing agent from the dosing injector to the SCR catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The dosing agent decomposes in the heated air to become two molecules of NH<sub>3 </sub>for every molecule of the dosing agent in the presence of water. The SCR catalyst adsorbs the NH<sub>3</sub>. When the SCR catalyst is saturated with NH<sub>3</sub>, the air pump turns off. The NH<sub>3 </sub>stored on the SCR catalyst increases the capacity of the SCR catalyst to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>after a cold start. Accordingly, the storage of NH<sub>3 </sub>on the SCR catalyst provides improved emissions without using additional fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example of a vehicle system <b>10</b> including an exhaust treatment system according to the present disclosure is shown. Air is provided to an engine <b>14</b> through an air intake system <b>16</b>. A fuel delivery system <b>18</b> provides fuel to the engine <b>14</b>. Exhaust is produced through the combustion process and is expelled from the engine <b>14</b> into an exhaust manifold <b>20</b>. The exhaust treatment system <b>12</b> receives the exhaust from the engine <b>14</b> through the exhaust manifold <b>20</b> and treats the exhaust to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>before the exhaust is released into the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A control module <b>22</b> communicates with an engine on/off sensor <b>24</b>. The engine on/off sensor <b>24</b> may be any device indicating a difference in a signal when the engine <b>14</b> is on or off. For example only, the engine on/off sensor <b>24</b> may be an ignition voltage shut off sensor or an engine speed sensor. The control module <b>22</b> determines when the engine <b>14</b> is off based on the signal from the engine on/off sensor <b>24</b>. The control module <b>22</b> operates the exhaust treatment system <b>12</b> based on the engine on/off sensor <b>24</b> and one or more other sensors within the exhaust treatment system <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The exhaust treatment system <b>12</b> includes a three-way catalyst (TWC) <b>26</b> and a first selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst <b>28</b>. The TWC <b>26</b> oxidizes hydrocarbons in the exhaust upstream of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The TWC <b>26</b> enhances NO<sub>x </sub>adsorption efficiency at low temperatures by partially converting NO contained in the exhaust into NO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A dosing system <b>32</b> with a dosing valve <b>34</b> and a dosing injector <b>36</b> is provided upstream of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The dosing injector <b>36</b> injects the dosing agent into the exhaust stream. An air pump <b>38</b> with an air valve <b>40</b> is arranged such that the air valve <b>40</b> allows the air to be provided into the exhaust manifold <b>20</b> or between the dosing system <b>32</b> and the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The dosing system <b>32</b> adds the dosing agent to the exhaust stream. The heated air decomposes the dosing agent into NH<sub>3</sub>. The NH<sub>3 </sub>adsorbs onto the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A first NO<sub>x </sub>sensor <b>30</b> is provided upstream of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> and downstream of the TWC <b>26</b>. The first NO<sub>x </sub>sensor <b>30</b> is immediately upstream of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> and provides a NO<sub>x </sub>signal to the control module <b>22</b>. A first SCR temperature sensor <b>42</b> is immediately upstream of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> and provides a temperature signal to the control module <b>22</b>. The temperature signal indicates a temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> removes nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) in the exhaust through a chemical reaction between the exhaust, the reductant, and a catalyst on the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The heated air causes the dosing agent to decompose into NH<sub>3 </sub>and hydro-cyanic acid (HNCO). The HNCO further decomposes (e.g., hydrolizes) in the presence of the reduction temperature into water and NH<sub>3</sub>. The NH<sub>3 </sub>adsorbs onto the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The adsorbed NH<sub>3 </sub>reacts with NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust to form H<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub>. The first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> may effectively convert NO<sub>x </sub>into H<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2 </sub>at a reduction temperature. The reduction temperature may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> composition and density, sizes of the canisters for the TWC <b>26</b>, and/or fuel composition. The reduction temperature may be, for example only, about 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> may store more NH<sub>3 </sub>as the temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is lowered. After the engine <b>14</b> turns off, the control module <b>22</b> activates an air pump <b>38</b> and opens the air valve <b>40</b>. The air pump <b>38</b> provides ambient air to the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>, lowering the temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is less than the predetermined storage temperature, the control module <b>22</b> directs the air valve <b>40</b> and the air pump <b>38</b> to provide ambient air through the exhaust manifold <b>20</b> to the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The ambient air is heated by air from the engine <b>14</b> and the exhaust manifold <b>20</b>. The heated air has a temperature greater than the reduction temperature. The control module <b>22</b> directs the dosing system <b>32</b> to provide the dosing agent to the heated air. The heated air is hot enough to allow the dosing agent to decompose into NH<sub>3 </sub>and HNCO, and to allow the HNCO in the presence of water to further decompose into NH<sub>3 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>. The NH<sub>3 </sub>is absorbed by the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>, increasing the capacity of the SCR catalyst to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>after a cold start. The air pump <b>38</b> stops providing the heated air and the dosing system <b>32</b> stops providing the dosing agent when the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is saturated with NH<sub>3 </sub>and/or the dosing agent does not decompose.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">After the cold start, the stored NH<sub>3 </sub>allows more NO<sub>2 </sub>storage on the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. When the reduction temperature is met, the stored NH<sub>3 </sub>and the stored NO<sub>x </sub>may be reduced to N<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O. It may be appreciated that a plurality (e.g., n) of SCR catalysts in series may also be used. An nth SCR catalyst <b>44</b> with an nth NO<sub>x </sub>sensor <b>46</b> and an nth SCR temperature sensor <b>48</b> is shown. The nth NO<sub>x </sub>sensor <b>46</b> and the nth SCR temperature sensor <b>48</b> communicate with the control module <b>22</b>. When the engine <b>14</b> is on, the nth SCR catalyst <b>44</b> has a lower temperature than the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. When the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> has a temperature less than the predetermined temperature, the nth SCR catalyst <b>44</b> may store NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The NO<sub>x </sub>signals received from the NO<sub>x </sub>sensors <b>30</b> and <b>46</b> may indirectly indicate the concentration of the NH<sub>3 </sub>in the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. For example, because the amount of the dosing agent injected (and other measured values such as the NO<sub>x </sub>sensed before and after the SCR <b>28</b>) is known, the concentration of the NH<sub>3 </sub>in the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> may be determined. For example only, the concentration of the NH<sub>3 </sub>may be modeled or estimated based on the amount of the dosing agent injected and the signals provided by the NO<sub>x </sub>sensors <b>30</b> and <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a functional block diagram of an example control module <b>22</b> is shown. The control module <b>22</b> includes an engine off determination module <b>50</b>, an SCR treatment module <b>52</b>, an SCR loading module <b>54</b>, a decomposition determination module <b>56</b>, an air control module <b>58</b>, and a dosing control module <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The engine off determination module <b>50</b> generates an engine off indicator based on an engine on/off signal from the engine on/off sensor <b>24</b>. The engine off indicator indicates when the engine <b>14</b> turns off. When the engine <b>14</b> turns off, the engine off determination module <b>50</b> generates the engine off indicator. The engine off determination module <b>50</b> provides the engine off indicator to the SCR treatment module <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The SCR treatment module <b>52</b> generates a storage temperature indicator based on a temperature signal from the first SCR temperature sensor <b>42</b> and the predetermined storage temperature. When the engine <b>14</b> is off, the SCR treatment module <b>52</b> generates a storage temperature indicator based on the temperature signal and the predetermined storage temperature. The storage temperature indicator indicates whether the temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is less than the predetermined storage temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The SCR loading module <b>54</b> generates an NH<sub>3 </sub>saturation indicator based in part on the NO<sub>x </sub>signals. For example, as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the NO<sub>x </sub>signals in combination with the amount of dosing agent injected and/or other variables may indicate the NH<sub>3 </sub>present in the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The NH<sub>3 </sub>saturation indicator indicates the saturation of the reductant onto the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. The SCR loading module <b>54</b> may compare the NH<sub>3 </sub>present in the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> to a saturation value. The saturation value may correspond to the NH<sub>3 </sub>present in the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>, which is saturated. The saturation value depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> composition, density, and size.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The decomposition determination module <b>56</b> generates a decomposition indicator based on a plurality of the NO<sub>x </sub>signals. The decomposition indicator indicates whether the dosing agent is decomposing into NH<sub>3 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>. The decomposition determination module <b>56</b> compares a plurality of NO<sub>x </sub>signals over a predetermined time period to determine whether the dosing agent is decomposing. For example, the decomposition determination module <b>56</b> may determine that the reductant does is not decomposing when there is no increase of NH<sub>3 </sub>after the dosing agent is added.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The air control module <b>58</b> controls the air pump <b>38</b> and the air valve <b>40</b> based on the storage temperature indicator, the NH<sub>3 </sub>saturation indicator, and the decomposition indicator. The air control module <b>58</b> activates the air pump <b>38</b> and directs the air valve <b>40</b> to deliver ambient air to the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> when the storage temperature indicator indicates that the temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is greater than the predetermined storage temperature. The air control module <b>58</b> activates the air pump <b>38</b> and directs the air valve <b>40</b> to deliver engine air into the exhaust when the storage temperature indicator indicates that the temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is less than the predetermined storage temperature. The air control module <b>58</b> turns off the air pump <b>38</b> when the decomposition indicator indicates the reductant is not reduced and/or the NH<sub>3 </sub>saturation indicator indicates the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is saturated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dosing control module <b>60</b> controls the dosing system <b>32</b> based on the NH<sub>3 </sub>saturation indicator and the decomposition indicator. The dosing control module <b>60</b> commands delivery of the dosing agent when the decomposition indicator indicates that the dosing agent is reduced and the NH<sub>3 </sub>saturation indicator indicates that the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is not saturated. For example, the dosing control module <b>60</b> may activate the dosing system when the dosing agent decomposes and the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is not saturated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, flow chart depicting an example method <b>100</b> of operating the exhaust treatment system <b>12</b> is shown. The method <b>100</b> begins at <b>102</b>. At <b>104</b>, the method <b>100</b> determines whether the engine <b>14</b> is off. If no, the method <b>100</b> ends at <b>118</b>. If yes, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to <b>106</b>. At <b>106</b>, the method <b>100</b> determines whether the temperature of the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is less then the predetermined storage temperature. If no, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to <b>108</b>. If yes, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to <b>110</b>. At <b>108</b>, the method <b>100</b> activates the air pump <b>38</b> and the air valve delivers ambient air to the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b>. At <b>110</b>, the method <b>100</b> determines whether the first SCR catalyst <b>28</b> is saturated with NH<sub>3</sub>. If yes, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to <b>116</b>. If no, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to <b>112</b>. At <b>112</b>, the method <b>100</b> diverts air from the air pump <b>38</b> to the engine exhaust and injects the dosing agent into the exhaust. At <b>114</b>, the method <b>100</b> determines whether the dosing agent is decomposing. If no, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to <b>116</b>. If yes, the method <b>100</b> returns to <b>110</b>. At <b>116</b>, the method <b>100</b> turns the air pump off and ends at <b>118</b>.</p>
