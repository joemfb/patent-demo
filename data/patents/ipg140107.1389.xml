<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to the field of illumination. More specifically, the invention relates to the field of providing lighting using light emitting diodes to replace more conventional lighting systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are many devices used to retrofit conventional lighting fixtures, such as fluorescent lighting fixtures. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a conventional fluorescent lamp assembly <b>100</b> that exists in numerous buildings. The lamp assembly <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> and two parallel fluorescent lamp bulbs <b>104</b>. Also included in the housing <b>102</b> is a rectangular protruding ballast cover <b>106</b>. The cover <b>106</b> (which is removable) includes not only the ballast, but also the associated electronics equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows another conventional fluorescent lamp arrangement <b>200</b> commonly found in buildings and other structures. The lamp arrangement <b>200</b> includes a housing <b>202</b> that contains four fluorescent bulbs <b>204</b>. There is also a centrally located rectangular metal cover <b>206</b>, which houses the ballast equipment and associated electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These lamp assemblies may be updated in a variety of fashions, but are generally retrofit using non-fluorescent bulbs, such as bulbs having a similar size and shape of a fluorescent bulb. For example, a conventional lamp assembly may be retrofit by replacing a fluorescent tube with an LED-based tube of similar shape and size. However, although such a retrofit removes the drawbacks associated with the fluorescent tube, it does little to provide additional advantages or benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other problems exist with respect to conventional lighting fixture retrofitting systems and procedures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A system and method for retrofitting conventional lighting fixtures, such as retrofitting lighting fixtures using LED illumination systems that maximize the benefits of LEDs, is described. In some embodiments, the system includes a mount, or mounting component, and a printed circuit board that includes multiple light emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the mount includes two or more angled faces in which printed circuit boards having multiple LEDs are attached, in order to provide a desired spread of illumination below a lighting fixture, among other benefits.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described herein, in some embodiments, a system and method for incorporating LEDs into existing lighting environments is described.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-C</figref> show a lighting assembly <b>300</b> that is configured to be mounted into numerous existing fluorescent fixtures for retrofitting purposes. Looking first at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, we see a mounting component or mount <b>302</b>, which may be constructed of sheet metal. Mount <b>302</b> is used to support a first elongated printed circuit board (PCB) <b>304</b> of LEDs and a second elongated PCB <b>306</b> of LEDs. As described in more detail herein, the boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> may be constructed of multiple smaller LED boards that are connected together using PCB connector blocks. Thus, each of the two elongated boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are, in some embodiments, formed of smaller boards.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The two elongated boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are mounted atop the mount <b>302</b> using non-conductive PCB spacer fasteners <b>308</b>. The spacer fasteners <b>308</b> support each of the elongated PCB boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> at a slight distance above upper angled surfaces of the mount <b>302</b>. The fasteners <b>308</b> may be constructed using flame-retardant nylon. The structural details regarding these fasteners <b>308</b> are discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Multiple LEDs <b>310</b> are included on each of the boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the selected LEDs are six ohm, 3.5 volt, 20 milliamp, 92% efficient, LEDs, with suitable LED dies. These dies may be commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> also depicts certain configurations, or groupings, of multiple LEDs <b>310</b> on boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the boards <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> may include a first group of LEDs <b>310</b><i>a </i>as well as a second group of LEDs <b>310</b><i>b</i>. In some cases, the LEDs are broken into groups of six LEDs for a variety of reasons, such as for separate operational purposes. One skilled in the art will recognize, however, that various different sizes of groups could be used to accomplish different purposes. It should also be understood that although only two groups (<b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b</i>) have been identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the rest of the remaining LEDs could also be broken out in to a variety of groupings to accomplish dimming, directional lighting, contrasted lighting arrangements or patterns and/or other desired light-controlling objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the first board <b>304</b> and second board <b>306</b> extend from a first end <b>314</b> to a second end <b>316</b> of the mount <b>302</b>. At the first end <b>314</b>, the mount <b>302</b> includes a pair of power supply terminals <b>312</b> shown at both ends of each of boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>. These terminals <b>312</b> may be electrically connected to a variety of power sources, such as AC primary power, emergency AC backup power, and/or DC battery backup power, using wires or other conductor pair arrangements. The LEDs <b>300</b>, including LEDs groups <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b</i>, may be controlled using circuitry existing on the back of the boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>. Further details regarding various circuitry arrangements are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described herein, in some embodiments, the mount <b>302</b> is configured to include two or more angled faces onto which the board <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are attached. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the mount <b>302</b>. The mount <b>302</b> includes an angled face <b>318</b> on a first side, and another angled face <b>320</b> on the opposite side. Above face <b>318</b>, a leveled off face <b>322</b> exists at an angle &#x3b1; relative to horizontal. In some embodiments, angle &#x3b1; falls within the range of 15 degrees, plus or minus 10 degrees. In some embodiments, angle &#x3b1; falls within the range of 15 degrees, plus or minus 5 degrees. In some embodiments, angle &#x3b1; falls within the range of 15 degrees, plus or minus 3 degrees. In some embodiments, angle &#x3b1; falls within the range of 15 degrees, plus or minus 1.5 degrees. In some embodiments, such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, angle &#x3b1; is about or approximately 15 degrees. Having such ranges, the mount <b>302</b> provides a desired spread of illumination emitted by the LEDs based on an average ceiling height. Therefore, different angles may be more desirable, depending on ceiling height and/or other parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The opposite side of the mount <b>302</b> is symmetrical in that immediately above face <b>320</b> is a face <b>324</b> that is also at angle &#x3b1; relative to horizontal. At the bottom of mount <b>302</b> there are two opposing flanges <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> which extend out horizontally and rest atop the inside housing of a fixture being retrofitted. The mount <b>302</b> may be fastened inside a housing of the fixture by self-tapping fasteners (not shown) that are screwed through holes <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> bored through the flanges <b>326</b> and <b>328</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> each rest atop a platform portion <b>334</b> provided on each of fasteners <b>308</b>. These platform portions <b>334</b> are on top of a body portion <b>336</b> of each fastener <b>308</b>. The top portions <b>333</b> of each fastener can be forced through holes formed in the end of each sub-board (e.g., boards <b>354</b>, <b>356</b>, <b>358</b>, and <b>360</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). On the bottom of each fastener <b>308</b> is an insertable snap-lock tab <b>338</b>, which may be inserted through a hole made through the angled faces <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>. This secures each fastener <b>308</b> to the top of the mount <b>302</b> in an upright position as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described herein, the angle &#x3b1; of faces <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> of the mount <b>302</b> facilitates a desired illumination spread when the assembly is mounted into an existing fixture. In some embodiments, the assembly <b>300</b> may facilitate a real-time or current adjustment of the faces <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> with respect to one another. The mount <b>302</b> may include a pivot component <b>340</b> configured to enable an adjustment of angle &#x3b1; during a retrofit of a fixture. That is, in some embodiments, the mount <b>302</b> may be adjustable before, during, and/or after a retrofit into an existing fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows an underside view of the mount <b>302</b>. In this view an undersurface <b>344</b> exposes three devices&#x2014;an emergency battery <b>348</b>, an emergency power supply <b>350</b>, and a main power supply <b>352</b>. The devices (<b>348</b>, <b>350</b>, and <b>352</b>) can be fastened to the underside of the mount <b>302</b> using adhesives, fasteners, and/or other attachment components. Main power supply <b>352</b>, such as a universal AC input, is used to tap into an existing power source in a building or other structure. Under normal operation, this device receives power from a power source in the building, and then supplies power to the LEDs <b>310</b>&#x2014;so long as there is power to the building. In cases when the primary power to the building is lost, and assuming that the building is the sort that has an emergency backup AC power source, emergency backup power supply <b>350</b> may be used to supply AC power to the LEDs, such as to a reduced number of the LEDs <b>310</b>. In cases where all AC sources are not available, battery <b>348</b> and associated DC power supply <b>350</b> will be brought into action and used to illuminate a reduced number of operational LEDs on the mount <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Depending on the circumstances, there are numerous ways that the emergency lighting could be accomplished. In some embodiments, all of the LEDs <b>310</b> are active when the device is receiving power from the primary AC source (via power supply <b>352</b>). Alternatively, a small number of the LEDs <b>310</b> will not be illuminated when the device is receiving the primary source of AC from the building. That is, only <b>310</b>A and <b>310</b>B could be configured to not illuminate when the primary source of AC power is available from the building. This smaller &#x201c;emergency&#x201d; group of LEDs would only illuminate when the primary source of AC is not available. For example, 80% of LEDs may be included in the primary group, and 20% may be included in the backup group. In this example, the 20% of the LEDs are not used in normal operation, and are only illuminated when there is a total power failure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, all of the LEDs <b>310</b> could be used in normal operation. Then, upon a total AC power failure, emergency power supply <b>350</b> and possibly battery <b>348</b> could be used to activate the limited emergency group (some of the same LEDs used during normal operation) for the emergency purposes. For example, both of groups <b>310</b>A and <b>310</b>B (twelve LEDs total) may be the LEDs illuminated during the emergency.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described herein, a variety of circuitry arrangements may be utilized when illuminating LEDs on the boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> of the retrofit lighting assembly <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-C</figref> show various embodiments for the circuitry used to deliver and control power to the LEDs. This circuitry would be included on the reverse side of the PCBs.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, multiple LED strings are placed into parallel arrays, each string including four LEDs <b>402</b><i>a </i>and having a resistor <b>404</b>A. The use of the resistor <b>404</b>A provides a constant brightness arrangement in which the overall device will not be dimmable. Additionally, this arrangement may not support the selecting illumination of different groups of LEDs. Thus, although suitable for operation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> depicts a basic, cost-effective circuitry arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> depicts a six LED arrangement <b>402</b>B, which is supported by a linear driver <b>404</b><i>b</i>. These devices allow for the delivery of the necessary current for driving LEDs <b>402</b><i>b</i>, and may be more efficient with respect to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> depicts a circuitry arrangement that facilitates the dimming of the lighting assembly. To do this, it includes a communications microprocessor <b>404</b><i>c </i>and a smart multichannel linear LED driver <b>406</b><i>c</i>. The power administered through driver <b>406</b><i>c </i>is controlled using the communications microprocessor <b>404</b><i>c</i>, and may be fully networked.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">This arrangement includes a primary side <b>401</b><i>c</i>, and an emergency side <b>403</b><i>c</i>. For the primary side <b>401</b><i>c</i>, the communications processor <b>404</b><i>c </i>is used to control a smart multichannel linear driver <b>406</b><i>c </i>to operate the primary group of LEDs <b>310</b>. This primary group may include of all of the LEDs <b>310</b>, or only the LEDs <b>310</b> not included in the smaller groups <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b</i>. Regardless, the linear driver <b>406</b><i>c </i>receives a communicated signal from communications processor <b>404</b><i>c </i>to turn the primary set of LEDs on or off. These LEDs would be &#x201c;on&#x201d; when the primary source of AC power is available. The communications processor <b>404</b><i>c </i>may also communicate with a network gateway <b>414</b><i>c</i>, which may be patched into a network <b>412</b><i>c </i>(e.g., the internet or an intranet arrangement). Thus, the LEDs <b>310</b> are able to be turned on or off via a personal computer, wireless device or any other networkable device.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the emergency side <b>403</b><i>c </i>of the system, lighting of a reduced number of LEDs will occur in the event that the primary source of AC power in the building is down, and the AC emergency backup system or the DC battery backup are utilized. When these secondary sources of power are utilized, communications processor <b>408</b><i>c </i>activates driver circuit <b>410</b><i>c </i>to drive the emergency group or groups of LEDs (e.g. <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b</i>). Since communications processor <b>408</b><i>c </i>is accessible through gateway <b>414</b><i>c</i>, it is totally networkable. Thus, when desired, LED groups <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b </i>can be independently activated (or not) over the network <b>412</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, groups <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b </i>are not also included in the primary circuit <b>401</b><i>c</i>. The two sides <b>401</b><i>c </i>and <b>403</b><i>c </i>are completely independent, and the LED groups <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b </i>will only be activated in the event of an emergency. In an alternative embodiment, groups <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b </i>are also included on the primary side <b>401</b>C of the circuit, and may be illuminated not only in backup situations, but also when AC primary power is available.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the circuitry arrangement may be configured to provide independent control of the left and right strings of LEDs or combination of LED strings, allowing one to be turned off while one remains illuminated, or to have both LED strings &#x201c;ON&#x201d; or &#x201c;OFF&#x201d;. Incorporating a dimmer-switch board, the circuitry arrangement facilitates such a bi-level dimming capability of each elongated LED board and provides a light output at the levels of 0%, 50%, and/or 100%. When power is cycled to the elongated LED board, within a short amount of time this change may be detected by a power loss detection circuit on the dimmer-switch board, which sees this change as a signal to alternate the dimming state of the elongated LED board from both LED strings &#x201c;ON&#x201d; or both strings &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; to one string &#x201c;ON&#x201d; and one string &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; (delivering 50% light output). When power is turned off for longer than a predetermined length of time, the dimmer-switch board will reset its dimming state such that 100% of the LED strings will be on the next time the elongated LED board is powered on. Because the individual elongated LED boards can be controlled on a per strip basis, the number of dimming steps can be expanded per application.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the circuitry arrangement may be configured to facilitate switching the reception of power from the electric grid to a battery backup during peak electrical usage hours, thereby removing the electrical load that the elongated LED board would typically put onto the electric grid. The system will be able to switch back to being powered from the electrical grid after peak usage hours. The battery backup will automatically charge during predetermined low usage hours and will also run on a staggered or random charging schedule during these low usage hours to avoid all of the lighting systems trying to charge simultaneously, which may place an undesirable heavy load onto the electric grid. The battery backed up elongated LED boards may also switch back onto the electrical grid on a staggered or random schedule to further avoid putting an undesirable heavy load onto the electric grid. The nighttime energy harvesting system may be able to automatically compensate for daylight savings and other time change occurrences via an onboard RTC (real time clock) chip that will keep track of the time and date, or by a manual adjustment via an external control mechanism, among other things. The nighttime energy harvesting system will also have an emergency power save feature that will switch the elongated LED board back onto the electrical grid regardless of the time of day if the battery backup reaches a certain percentage below &#x201c;fully charged&#x201d;. This feature thereby ensures that, in case of emergency, the elongated LED board will still have a reserve of power to energize itself for a period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described herein, the elongated boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> may be formed of multiple PC boards. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-G</figref> depict various configurations in which smaller PC boards (e.g., boards <b>354</b>, <b>356</b>, <b>358</b>, and <b>360</b>) may be connected together to comprise two elongated boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, in order to connect two smaller boards to one another, a connector board <b>502</b> is used to both physically join the two abutting ends, such as ends <b>504</b> and <b>506</b> of boards <b>354</b> and <b>356</b>, respectively. On each of ends <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>, pin receiving holes <b>508</b> and <b>512</b> are shown associated with traces <b>510</b> and <b>514</b>. Traces <b>510</b> and <b>514</b> extend to the end of the boards <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>. Alternatively, traces <b>510</b> and <b>514</b> may not be required, depending on the extent of the traces (e.g., traces <b>516</b>) on the connector board <b>502</b>. For example, when traces <b>516</b> on the connector board <b>502</b> are long enough to reach the pin receiving holes <b>508</b> and <b>512</b> on boards <b>354</b> and <b>356</b>, the traces <b>510</b> and <b>514</b> will not be required.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the connector board <b>502</b> includes a base portion <b>522</b> and a female receptacle <b>518</b>. Female receptacle <b>518</b> is a well-known device, which includes pins and receives a plug connector, such as plug connector <b>530</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> depicts an engagement side <b>522</b> of bottom portion <b>520</b> of the connector board <b>502</b>. On the engagement side <b>522</b>, each of pin receiving holes <b>508</b> and <b>512</b> are interconnected by a plurality of parallel traces <b>516</b>. These traces <b>516</b> will be used to electrically and signally connect the blurred ends to each other, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> depicts an interconnect board <b>520</b> that has been used to punch together two board ends <b>504</b> and <b>506</b> using pins <b>536</b>. Pins <b>536</b> are used to conduct electrical power, transmit communications signals, and physically secure the boards <b>354</b> and <b>356</b> to each other such that the connection of all the smaller boards comprises the two elongated boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>. As depicted, the female receptacle <b>518</b> extends downward after the interconnector board <b>520</b> has been pinned to each PCB end. Thus, a plug connector <b>530</b> can be inserted and secured in the receptacle <b>518</b> to make the necessary electrical connections.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> depicts the interconnecting member <b>502</b> installed on the underside of board ends <b>354</b> and <b>356</b>, showing the female receptacle <b>518</b> and the connecting pin heads <b>537</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, the plug <b>530</b> has not yet been inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> depicts an alternative tracing arrangement for the connector <b>502</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the traces <b>550</b> are on the same side of the connector board as the female receptacle <b>518</b>. These traces are angled outward to meet up with the pin heads <b>537</b> upon installation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thus, in some embodiments, the small PC boards are connected with a variety of mechanisms to fix the boards to one another, to transfer electric current to one another, to communicate with one another, and so on. For example, utilizing the connections described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5F</figref>, two connected PC boards may rotate with respect to one another, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described herein, the mount <b>302</b> and attached PC boards <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are configured to be installed into existing lighting fixtures, such as fluorescent tube lighting fixtures, in order to retrofit the lighting fixtures with an LED-based illumination system that provides desirable illumination patterns, among other benefits. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an installation of the retrofit device on mount <b>302</b> in an existing fluorescent housing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a dual-installation where two retrofit devices are used to convert a four-bulb fluorescent light arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, in order to retrofit the lighting assembly <b>300</b> into an existing housing, such as fluorescent lamp housings <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>, the following steps may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After shutting off power to the unit, the existing ballast equipment and the cover (e.g., cover <b>106</b>) are removed, along with any remaining bulbs. However, in some cases ballast removal may not be necessary because of where the mount <b>302</b> is to be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With respect to the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, after the ballast and cover have been stripped from the unit, a single retrofit lighting assembly <b>300</b> is fastened into the space formerly occupied by the ballast equipment, and fasteners (e.g., screws, not shown) can be secured into the back of the housing through attachment holes <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With respect to the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, since the ballast arrangement and cover <b>206</b> are located in the center of the housing and do not have to be removed, two separate duplicate versions <b>702</b> of the lighting assembly <b>300</b> can be fixed into the back of the housing as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Once the lighting assemblies <b>300</b> have been installed, electrical connections are made. For example, connections are made from the building primary AC source and building emergency power supplies into power sources <b>352</b> and <b>350</b>, respectively, and from each of the power sources <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, and battery <b>348</b> into the PCB circuitry. Also, battery <b>348</b> may be electrically connected to the primary AC source so that it can remain charged. Once installed and electrically connected, the new retrofit devices (<b>600</b> or <b>700</b>) are ready for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Many different arrangements of the various components depicted, as well as components not shown, are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention have been described with the intent to be illustrative rather than restrictive. Alternative embodiments will become apparent to those skilled in the art that do not depart from its scope. A skilled artisan may develop alternative means of implementing the aforementioned improvements without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations and are contemplated within the scope of the claims.
