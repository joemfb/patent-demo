<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a positioning device and an electronic device thereof and, more particularly, to an angle positioning device of a rotation shaft and an electronic device thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Foldable electronic devices are commonly used in electronic equipment. In a dual display screen laptop, for example, the angle between the cover piece and the body piece of the dual display screens is approximately 250 to 270 degrees (forming an inverted V-shape), which allows two users to view the screen from opposite sides. This facilitates the process of presentation or participation in a computer game by two players.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, if there is no angle positioning device on the rotation shaft to maintain the angle between the cover piece and the body piece at 250 to 270 degrees, the weight of the cover piece and the body piece can easily cause the parts to slide downwards, thus causing the angle to deviate and the inverted V-shape to no longer be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is necessary to provide a rotation shaft angle positioning device for a foldable electronic device in order to resolve the aforementioned problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the present invention is to provide a rotation shaft angle positioning device for a foldable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide an electronic device comprising a rotation shaft angle positioning device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above mentioned objects, the present invention provides a foldable electronic device consisting of a cover piece, a body piece, and a rotation shaft angle positioning device. A pivot angle is formed between the cover piece and the body piece. The rotation shaft angle positioning device comprises a first pivot portion and a second pivot portion. The first pivot portion comprises a first face and a second face. The first face comprises a positioning portion, a first ramp and a second ramp divided by the positioning portion. The second face comprises a returning portion, a third ramp and a fourth ramp divided by the returning portion. The second pivot portion can move along the first ramp, the second ramp, the third ramp, and the fourth ramp. When the second pivot portion moves from the first ramp to the second ramp, the pivot angle is increased. When the second pivot portion moves from the third ramp to the fourth ramp, the pivot angle is decreased. When the pivot portion moves from the first ramp to the positioning portion, the pivot angle cannot be decreased. The second pivot portion can move from the third ramp through the returning portion to return to the first ramp.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the second pivot portion comprises: a pivot mechanism pivotally connected to the first pivot portion; a driving unit pivotally connected to the pivot mechanism and comprising a hook portion; with the hook portion moving along the first ramp, the second ramp, the third ramp, and the fourth ramp; a converging portion used to move the hook portion from the second ramp to the third ramp; and a spring unit connected to the driving unit. The spring unit provides the driving unit with the force needed to press the hook portion on the first ramp, the second ramp, the third ramp, and the fourth ramp, and also the force needed to move the hook portion from the fourth ramp to the first ramp.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the present embodiment, the second face has a curved surface and is adjacent to the first face. The second face comprises a returning portion <b>31</b>, a third ramp <b>32</b>, and a fourth ramp <b>34</b>. The third ramp <b>32</b> and the fourth ramp <b>34</b> of the second face are divided by the returning portion <b>31</b>. The third ramp <b>32</b> is relatively radially inward of the second ramp <b>28</b> such that the third ramp <b>32</b> forms a groove, and the fourth ramp <b>34</b> is not relatively radially inward of the first ramp <b>26</b>. In the present invention, the first ramp <b>26</b> and the fourth ramp <b>34</b> are on the same surface. Please note that the first ramp <b>26</b> can also be relatively radially inward of the fourth ramp <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second pivot portion <b>40</b> comprises a pivot mechanism <b>42</b>, a driving unit <b>44</b>, and a spring unit. The pivot mechanism <b>42</b> is pivotally connected to the first pivot portion <b>10</b>. In the present embodiment, the pivot mechanism <b>42</b> is connected to the cover piece <b>92</b>. Therefore, when the user rotates the cover piece <b>92</b>, it will also cause the pivot mechanism <b>42</b> to move. One end of the driving unit <b>44</b> is pivotally connected to the pivot mechanism <b>42</b> about the driving axis RA, and the other end of the driving unit <b>44</b> comprises the hook portion <b>442</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The hook portion <b>442</b> can move along the first ramp <b>26</b>, the second ramp <b>28</b>, the third ramp <b>32</b>, and the fourth ramp <b>34</b>. The pivot angle &#x3b8; gradually increases as the hook portion <b>442</b> moves from the first ramp <b>26</b> to the second ramp <b>28</b>. The pivot angle &#x3b8; gradually decreases as the hook portion <b>442</b> moves from the third ramp <b>32</b> to the fourth ramp <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The spring unit is connected to the driving unit <b>44</b>. The spring unit allows the hook portion <b>442</b> of the driving unit <b>44</b> to exert force in a specific direction. In the present embodiment, the spring unit comprises a first spring piece <b>52</b> and a second spring piece <b>54</b>. The first spring piece <b>52</b> provides the force needed to press the hook portion <b>442</b> of the driving unit <b>44</b> against the shaft <b>14</b> and the first ramp <b>26</b>, the second ramp <b>28</b>, the third ramp <b>32</b>, and the fourth ramp <b>34</b>. The second spring piece <b>54</b> provides the force required to move the hook portion <b>442</b> of the driving unit <b>44</b> in an opposite axial direction along the driving axis RA towards the lower surface <b>16</b> and from the fourth ramp <b>34</b> to the first ramp <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present embodiment, the first spring piece <b>52</b> is a torsion spring, and the second spring piece <b>54</b> is a compression spring. The direction of the force applied by the first spring piece <b>52</b> and the second spring piece <b>54</b> is substantially perpendicular.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the hook portion <b>442</b> moves from the first ramp <b>26</b> to the positioning portion <b>22</b>, a &#x201c;set position&#x201d; or &#x201c;locking position&#x201d; is attained. At this position, the pivot angle &#x3b8; cannot be decreased, so the cover piece <b>92</b> is in a position which cannot be rotated. Thus, the objective of providing a rotation shaft angle positioning device <b>1</b> is achieved. In the present embodiment, when the rotation shaft angle positioning device <b>1</b> is at the set position, the pivot angle &#x3b8; lies between 250 to 270 degrees. However, the pivot angle &#x3b8; can be designed according to user requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the hook portion <b>442</b> moves from the third ramp <b>32</b> to the returning portion <b>31</b>, a &#x201c;returning position&#x201d; is attained. At the &#x201c;returning position&#x201d; in the present embodiment, the pivot angle &#x3b8; lies between 180 to 240 degrees. However, the pivot angle &#x3b8; is not limited to this range. The hook portion <b>442</b> can move along the third ramp <b>32</b>. As the hook portion <b>442</b> moves past the returning portion <b>31</b>, the hook portion <b>442</b> will land on the fourth ramp <b>34</b>. Next, the second spring piece <b>54</b> aids the hook portion <b>442</b> to move from the fourth ramp <b>34</b> back to the first ramp <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The subsequent section will describe the actual movement of the rotation shaft angle positioning device <b>1</b> in different stages. In the following embodiment, the pivot angle &#x3b8; of the set position is set at 250 degrees, and the pivot angle &#x3b8; of the returning position is set at 200 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">(1) Hook Portion <b>442</b> Located at First Ramp <b>26</b></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the user opens the foldable electronic device <b>90</b> from a pivot angle &#x3b8; of 0 degrees (completely closed) to less than 250 degrees, the pivot mechanism <b>42</b> and the driving unit <b>44</b> will rotate simultaneously, and the hook portion <b>442</b> of the driving unit <b>44</b> will slide along the first ramp <b>26</b> of the first face.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At this stage, the hook portion <b>442</b> has not yet moved into the positioning portion <b>22</b>. Therefore, the cover piece <b>92</b> and the body piece <b>94</b> of the foldable electronic device <b>90</b> are not in a set position.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">(2) Hook Portion <b>442</b> Located at Positioning Portion <b>22</b></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which shows the hook portion <b>442</b> of a rotation angle positioning device <b>1</b> locating at the positioning portion <b>22</b>. Assuming the user continues to open the cover piece <b>92</b> of the foldable electronic device <b>90</b> as mentioned in stage (1), the pivot angle &#x3b8; will reach 250 degrees. At this instant, the hook portion <b>442</b> arrives at a protruding shape of the positioning portion <b>22</b>, and the shape of the positioning portion <b>22</b> causes the hook portion <b>442</b> to lift slightly and move into the intersection between the positioning portion <b>22</b> and the second ramp <b>28</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). A set position is attained when the rotation shaft angle positioning device <b>1</b> is in this configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Under this situation, the positioning portion <b>22</b> restricts the movement of the hook portion <b>442</b>. As a result, the user cannot rotate the cover piece <b>92</b> in the reverse direction. Therefore, the foldable electronic device <b>90</b> can be stably mounted onto a flat surface (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the user wants to unlock the position of the rotation shaft angle positioning device <b>1</b>, the cover piece <b>92</b> must be continuously opened to increase the pivot angle &#x3b8;. Under this circumstance, the hook portion <b>442</b> moves along the second ramp <b>28</b> in the direction of the arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When the hook portion <b>442</b> moves to the slanted surface of the converging portion <b>24</b>, the hook portion <b>442</b> will be guided by the converging portion <b>24</b>, causing the hook portion <b>442</b> to move from the second ramp <b>28</b> along the converging portion <b>24</b> in an axial direction along the driving axis RA towards the third ramp <b>32</b>. In the present embodiment, the hook portion <b>442</b> moves along the converging portion <b>24</b> when the pivot angle &#x3b8; is between 250 and 270 degrees.</p>
