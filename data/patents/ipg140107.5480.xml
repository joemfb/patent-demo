<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a coupon-point system <b>100</b> (coupon-service system) to implement coupon-based semiconductor services. The coupon-point system <b>100</b> includes a coupon generator <b>102</b>. The coupon generator <b>102</b> is designed to generate a coupon for a semiconductor manufacturing service (semiconductor service) such as a semiconductor foundry service associated with a semiconductor foundry. Such generated a coupon is defined by a plurality of coupon attributes such as a set of exemplary coupon attributes <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The coupon attributes <b>200</b> include a point <b>202</b> to represent coupon value. For example, a coupon of 10 points may represent a semiconductor service of one thousand dollars. The coupon attributes <b>200</b> include a duration <b>204</b> to describe life time of the coupon, during which the coupon is effective for semiconductor services. For example, the duration <b>204</b> may be defined as no time limitation so that the coupon can be used any time. The duration <b>204</b> may be alternatively defined to be expired at a particular deadline, or only effective through a particular period of time such as six months or one year from the first use of the coupon. The coupon attributes <b>200</b> further includes an association <b>206</b> to describe the association between the coupon and semiconductor services. In one embodiment, the coupon may be associated with a particular product, a particular technology, and/or a particular customer. These associations limit the coupon to be only usable for the associated product, the associated technology, and/or the associated customer. For example, if the coupon is defined to be associated with mask services, then it can not be used for wafer services. In another example, if the coupon is defined to be associated with 90 nanometer technology node and 300 mm wafer, then the coupon is only usable for the semiconductor service associated with 90 nanometer technology node and 300 mm wafer. In another example, if the coupon is associated with customer A, then the coupon can not be used by customers other than customer A. If a coupon is associated with CyberShuttle service, then the coupon can not be used for Design for manufacturing (DFM) or lithography process check (LPC) service. The coupon attributes, including point <b>202</b>, duration <b>204</b>, and association <b>206</b>, may be subject to modification during the coupon's lifetime by a semiconductor service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The coupon-point system <b>100</b> includes a coupon maintainer <b>104</b>. The coupon maintainer <b>104</b> functions for maintaining a coupon through its lifetime. The coupon maintainer <b>104</b> is designed to respond to a plurality of coupon actions and manage thereof. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, exemplary coupon actions <b>300</b> is illustrated.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The coupon-point system <b>100</b> may further include a coupon-service module <b>110</b> designed for managing semiconductor services. The semiconductor services may be categorized as standard semiconductor services, optional semiconductor services, and alliance semiconductor services. The standard semiconductor services are default services provided by the semiconductor manufacturer as a part of semiconductor products such as wafer products or mask products. The alliance program semiconductor services are provided by partners of the semiconductor manufacturer. A customer may need to establish contract directly with the service partners. The optional semiconductor services are not required but available services provided by the semiconductor manufacturer and are optional to the customer. The optional semiconductor service may include CyberShuttle, Design for manufacturing (DFM), lithography process check (LPC), Fab support service, assembly and test service, eFoundry service, turnkey manufacturing service, or a combination thereof. For example, an optional semiconductor service may be a special request from a customer to turn a normal wafer lot into a hot lot to speed its fabrication and shorten the cycle time in semiconductor Fab, which will cost the semiconductor manufacturer extra effort. In another example, an optional semiconductor service may be an extra on-line test of a wafer lot requested by the customer for engineering purpose. The coupon-service module <b>110</b> may filter out the standard services and alliance program services, and redirect them to proper semiconductor entity such as a service provider. The coupon-service module <b>110</b> may function to particularly open an optional semiconductor service to a specified product, enable coupon circulation in the optional semiconductor service, and maintain the optional semiconductor service through its lifetime. An optional semiconductor service may include a plurality of attributes changeable and traceable through the lifetime of the optional semiconductor service. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an exemplary service attributes <b>400</b> includes service name <b>402</b>, service category <b>404</b> (may include information such as what semiconductor service, to which product type, and which customer product), service volume <b>406</b> (a volume of semiconductor product to be served), special requirement <b>408</b> applied to the service, service point <b>410</b> (cost of the service evaluated in terms of coupon point), service status <b>412</b> (including service in progress, service on hold, and service closed), and service history <b>414</b>. Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a service action applicable to the semiconductor service and operable by the coupon-service module <b>110</b> may include generating a semiconductor service <b>502</b>, tracking the semiconductor service <b>504</b>, modifying the semiconductor service <b>506</b>, closing the semiconductor service <b>508</b>, analyzing the semiconductor service <b>510</b>, or combinations thereof. For example, when a semiconductor service is completed, a proper semiconductor service action may be closing the semiconductor service. In the closing action, the coupon-service module <b>110</b> may put the semiconductor service in a closed status such that no further action can be applied thereto but all related service data may be saved for future analysis or other use. In another example, a semiconductor service action is analyzing one or more semiconductor services including services in progress and services closed. The analysis may result in or lead to service evaluation, service improvement, and service feedback to customers. The coupon-service module <b>110</b> may alternatively be a portion of a semiconductor manufacturer distributed in several semiconductor manufacturing entities integral to the coupon-point system <b>100</b>.</p>

The network <b>618</b> may be a single network, or may be a variety of different networks, such as an intranet and the Internet, and may include both wireline and wireless communication channels.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the present example, the entity <b>602</b> represents a service system for service collaboration and provision, the entity <b>604</b> represents a customer, the entity <b>606</b> represents an engineer, the entity <b>608</b> represents a mask workshop, the entity <b>610</b> represents a wafer fabrication (fab) facility, the entity <b>612</b> represents an integrated circuit (IC) design module, and the entity <b>614</b> represents another virtual fab (e.g., a virtual fab belonging to a subsidiary or a business partner). Each entity may interact with other entities, and may provide services to and/or receive services from the other entities.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For purposes of illustration, each entity <b>602</b>-<b>614</b> may be referred to as an internal entity (e.g., an engineer, a mask workshop, a wafer fab, and an IC design module, etc.) that forms a portion of the virtual fab <b>600</b>, or may be referred to as an external entity (e.g., a customer) that interacts with the virtual fab <b>600</b>. It is understood that the entities <b>602</b>-<b>614</b> may be concentrated at a single location, or may be distributed, and that some entities may be incorporated into other entities.

In the present example, wafer manufacturing includes receiving a customer's IC order and the associated operations needed to produce the ordered ICs and send them to the customer, such as design, fabrication, testing, and shipping of the ICs.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Services provided by the virtual fab <b>600</b> may enable collaboration and information access in such areas as design, engineering, logistics, and material control. The services also includes semiconductor manufacturing services. In the design area, the customer <b>604</b> may be given access to information and tools related to the design of their product, via the service system <b>602</b>. The tools may enable the customer <b>604</b> to perform yield enhancement analyses, layout information, service evaluation, and obtain similar information.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a simplified flowchart of an embodiment of a method <b>700</b> for generating a coupon to be used in one or more semiconductor services. The method <b>700</b> may be performed by the coupon generator <b>102</b> with coordination of other entities including the coupon controller, the coupon database <b>108</b>, and the coupon-service module <b>110</b>. The method <b>700</b> begins at step <b>702</b> by taking a request for a new coupon. The request may be initiated by a customer, a service provider, the coupon-service module <b>110</b>, or a virtual fab. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the coupon request may include directly buying a coupon <b>802</b> by the customer <b>122</b> or through the coupon-service module <b>110</b>; earning a coupon from a wafer purchase <b>804</b> initiated by the service provider or the service system <b>602</b>; earning a coupon from a mask purchase <b>806</b> initiated by the service provider or the coupon-service module <b>110</b>; sending a coupon gift <b>808</b> initiated by the service provider; or acquiring a benefit coupon through a prepaid mask or wafer purchase <b>810</b> by the service provider or the virtual fab. Step <b>702</b> may further include other actions such as initial screening to evaluate if the request acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method <b>700</b> then resumes to step <b>704</b> by processing the request to generate a coupon. For example, the coupon generator <b>102</b> extracts data from the coupon request and may further communicate with the requester (such as the customer) to acquire a plurality of coupon attributes such as the coupon attributes including point <b>202</b>, duration <b>204</b>, and association <b>206</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Then a new coupon is defined with the associated attributes and generated thereafter. The coupon database <b>108</b> is updated accordingly, for example, the new coupon and the associated data are added to the coupon database <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The method <b>700</b> then resumes to step <b>706</b> by distributing information regarding the generated coupon, which includes informing the customer of the generated coupon, updating relevant databases with the generated coupon, initiating relevant entities for subsequent actions. The relevant entities may include the service provider the coupon-service module <b>110</b>, and/or the semiconductor manufacturer <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a simplified flowchart of an embodiment of a method for implementing a coupon action associated with a semiconductor service. The method <b>900</b> can be implemented by the coupon maintainer <b>104</b> with coordination of other entities including the coupon controller <b>106</b>, the coupon database <b>108</b>, the coupon generator <b>102</b>, and the coupon-service module <b>110</b>. The method <b>900</b> begins by taking a coupon action request at step <b>902</b>. The coupon action request may be initiated by a customer, a service provider, the coupon-service module <b>110</b>, or a virtual fab. The coupon action request may be selected from the group <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> including buying a semiconductor service <b>302</b> by the customer; transferring a coupon <b>304</b> such as transferring a coupon such that it is associated with a different semiconductor technology; checking status <b>306</b> of the coupon; and modifying <b>308</b> a coupon attribute. The coupon action request may be initiated by the customer, the service provider, the coupon-service module <b>110</b>, or the semiconductor manufacturer <b>124</b>. Step <b>902</b> may further include other operations such as initial screening to evaluate if the service action request is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method <b>900</b> then resumes to process the coupon action request at step <b>904</b> which includes but not limited to extracting action information, providing relevant coupon information, and/or modifying the attributes of the coupon. For example, to respond to a request of buying a semiconductor service, the coupon may be modified to have a less point value after offsetting the point of the requested semiconductor service. The coupon database <b>108</b> is updated accordingly such as the coupon attributes in the coupon database <b>108</b> are revised.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The method <b>900</b> then resumes to distribute information regarding the requested coupon action at step <b>906</b>, which includes informing the semiconductor manufacturer to physically implement the semiconductor service and providing the relevant entities of the current coupon status.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a simplified flowchart of an embodiment of a method <b>950</b> for implementing a coupon based semiconductor service.

The method <b>950</b> begins by taking a semiconductor service request by a customer at step <b>952</b>. The customer needs to provide information to enable the semiconductor service. For example, the customer may provide attribute information of the requested semiconductor service. The semiconductor service may include CyberShuttle, design for manufacturing (DFM), lithography process check (LPC), fab support service, assembly and test service, eFoundry service, turnkey manufacturing service, or a combination thereof. Step <b>952</b> may include extracting information from the semiconductor service request and/or further interaction with the customer to tune the semiconductor service request.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At step <b>954</b>, the requested semiconductor service is screened to determine if it is an optional semiconductor service. If not, the method <b>950</b> proceeds to the next step by redirecting the requester to other proper service module at step <b>956</b>. Otherwise, the method proceeds to the next step by processing the service request to acquire the associated parameters at step <b>958</b>, which includes the service attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>960</b>, the method <b>950</b> processes a coupon transaction such as using an existing coupon to buy the semiconductor service, buying a coupon and then buying the semiconductor service using the coupon, or asking a gift coupon and then buying the semiconductor service using the gift coupon. The coupon transaction may further include generating a coupon, and/or maintaining the coupon selected from the coupon actions <b>800</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The generating of the coupon may be implemented by the method <b>700</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>962</b>, the requested semiconductor service is generated. The generating of the semiconductor service may include defining the semiconductor service by its attributes, creating a corresponding semiconductor service record into the service database <b>112</b>, informing relevant entities such as the customer, the service provider, and the semiconductor manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Optionally, the method <b>950</b> may resume to the next step by tracking the generated semiconductor service at step <b>964</b>, which can be initiated by the customer or the service provider. The tracking may involve interactions among the customer <b>122</b>, coupon-point system <b>100</b>, the service provider, and the semiconductor manufacturer. The tracking may be carried out during the lifetime of the semiconductor service.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method <b>950</b> may resume to step <b>966</b> to close the semiconductor service when the semiconductor service is completed. When the service is closed, the service history may be kept but any further action applied to the semiconductor service is blocked unless the semiconductor service is revived.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The method <b>950</b> may resume to step <b>968</b> to analyze the semiconductor service. The analysis can be initiated by the customer for service inspection. The analysis can be initiated by the service provider to evaluate the service quality. Alternatively, the analysis may be performed to all closed semiconductor service records or a subset according to a schedule such as every three months.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One or more advantages may present in various embodiments described above.
