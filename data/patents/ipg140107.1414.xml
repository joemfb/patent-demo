<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to vehicle lighting devices, and particularly to a vehicle lighting device having a plurality of reflecting surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, due to excellent light quality and high luminous efficiency, light emitting diodes (LEDs) have increasingly been used as substitutes for incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lamps and fluorescent tubes as light sources of illumination devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A common vehicle lighting device usually includes a central light source and a reflector surrounding the central light source. The central light source is used for radiating light. The reflector is used for limiting the light along a predetermined outputting direction, thereby achieving a high light illumination. However, in this condition, only about thirty percent of the light radiated from the central light source can be reflected and adjusted by the reflector for effective utilization. The other seventy percent of the light will be output directly, without being reflected or adjusted by the reflector. As such, part of the seventy percent of the light will not travel along the predetermined direction, and be not available for utilization to enhance a light illumination thereof. As such, a luminous flux of the light of the common vehicle lighting device employing a light emitting diode (LED) as the central light source in a predetermined outputting area usually can not achieve the rules cause of low utilization of light.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, what is needed is to provide a vehicle lighting device which can overcome the above shortcomings.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe the vehicle lighting device, in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a vehicle lighting device <b>100</b> of an exemplary embodiment is provided. The vehicle lighting device <b>100</b> includes a body <b>10</b>, a light source <b>20</b>, a supporting board <b>30</b> and a reflector module <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The body <b>10</b> is used for receiving the light source <b>20</b>, the supporting board <b>30</b> and the reflector module <b>40</b>. The body <b>10</b> is substantially bowl-shaped. Light radiated from the light source <b>20</b> can travel out of the body <b>10</b> via part of an opening thereof. This part of the opening of the body <b>10</b> acts as a light outputting opening <b>12</b>. A circuit control module (not illustrated) can be further employed in the body <b>10</b> to supply power for the light source <b>20</b>. A lens <b>14</b> is fixed at the opening of the body to envelope the body <b>10</b>. The light radiated from the light source <b>20</b> will be firstly reflected by the reflecting module <b>40</b>, and then travels out of the lens <b>14</b> via the outputting opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The light source <b>20</b> includes an LED <b>22</b> and a base <b>24</b> supporting the LED <b>22</b>. The LED <b>22</b> is arranged on the base <b>24</b> and electrically connected to the base <b>24</b>. A surface of the base <b>24</b> supporting the LED <b>22</b> is plated with copper by semiconductor process. The base <b>24</b> plated with copper can decrease an error of the base <b>24</b>, thereby improving an assembly accuracy of the light source <b>20</b> to increase an efficiency of light distribution control. Further, the base <b>24</b> plated with copper has better thermal conductivity than a conventional base made of ceramic material. Thus, the base <b>24</b> can increase heat dissipation efficiency of the vehicle lighting device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The supporting board <b>30</b> is substantially a plate like structure. The supporting board <b>30</b> is inclined to a central axis O<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>of the vehicle lighting device <b>100</b> without intersecting the central axis O<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The supporting board <b>30</b> includes an outer distal end <b>31</b> and an inner distal end <b>32</b>. The outer distal end <b>31</b> is remote from the central axis O<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and abuts against an inner surface of the body <b>10</b>, near the lens <b>14</b> in the opening of the body <b>10</b>. The inner distal end <b>32</b> is adjacent to the central axis O<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>of the vehicle lighting device <b>100</b>, remaining a distance therebetween. The light source <b>20</b> is mounted on the supporting board <b>30</b>. The base <b>24</b> is fixed on the supporting board <b>30</b> with the light source <b>20</b> facing the lens <b>14</b>. The supporting board <b>30</b> can be made of materials with light reflecting ability, such as aluminum and ceramic, to assist the reflecting module <b>40</b> in reflecting light.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The reflecting module <b>40</b> includes a first reflector <b>41</b>, a second reflector <b>42</b>, and a third reflector <b>43</b>. One part of light incident to the first reflector <b>41</b> is firstly reflected by the first reflector <b>41</b>, secondly reflected by the second reflector <b>42</b>, thirdly reflected by the third reflector <b>43</b>, and finally travels out of the body <b>10</b> via the outputting opening <b>12</b>. Another part of the light incident to the first reflector <b>41</b> is firstly reflected by the first reflector <b>41</b>, secondly reflected by the third reflector <b>43</b>, and finally travels out of the body <b>10</b> via the outputting opening <b>12</b>. The rest part of the light is incident to the third reflector <b>43</b> and then reflected by the third reflector <b>43</b> to travel out of the body <b>10</b> via the outputting opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first reflector <b>41</b> is positioned adjacent to the lens <b>14</b>. The first reflector <b>41</b> includes a holder <b>412</b>, a curved portion <b>411</b>, and a reflecting surface <b>413</b>. The reflecting surface <b>413</b> faces away from the lens <b>14</b>. In other words, the reflecting surface <b>413</b> faces the light source <b>20</b> away from a direction of the light output from the outputting opening <b>12</b> of the body <b>10</b>. The holder <b>412</b> is positioned at an end of the curved portion <b>411</b> and is fixed to the outer distal end <b>31</b> of the supporting board <b>30</b>, thereby connecting the first reflector <b>41</b> to the supporting board <b>30</b>. The curved portion <b>411</b> is positioned above the light source <b>20</b> and protrudes towards a direction along the light radiated from the light source <b>20</b>. The reflecting surface <b>413</b> is substantially a curved reflecting surface. The reflecting surface <b>413</b> can be made up of a free curved surface with parabola, a deformed parabola, a deformed ellipsoid, or a combination thereof. The curved portion <b>411</b> faces the light source <b>20</b> to reflect the light radiated from the light source <b>20</b> towards an opposite direction. Taking an example, light A is a light beam radiated from the light source <b>20</b> along a direction collinear with an optical axis of the LED <b>22</b>. Light B is a light beam radiated from the light source <b>20</b> along a direction inclined towards a right side of the optical axis of the LED <b>22</b>. Light C<b>1</b> is a light beam radiated from the light source <b>20</b> along a direction inclined towards a left side of the optical axis of the LED <b>22</b>. Light C<b>2</b> is a light beam radiated from the light source <b>20</b> along a direction inclined towards the far left of the optical axis of the LED <b>22</b>. The light A, B, C<b>1</b> can be incident to the first reflector <b>41</b> and be reflected by the first reflector <b>41</b> firstly. The light C<b>2</b> can not be incident to the first reflector <b>41</b>, but is incident to the third reflector <b>43</b> directly. The fact that light radiated from the light source <b>20</b> along a direction inclined towards the left of an optical axis of the LED <b>22</b> can be incident to the first reflector <b>41</b> or the third reflector <b>43</b>, depends on a curvature radius and an area of the first reflector <b>41</b>. More light will incident to the first reflector <b>41</b> when the curvature radius and/or the area of the first reflector <b>41</b> is adjusted to meet different actual requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second reflector <b>42</b> is positioned in a central portion of the vehicle lighting device <b>100</b> and fixed at the inner distal end <b>32</b> of the supporting board <b>30</b> away from the holder <b>412</b> of the first reflector <b>41</b>. In other words, the first reflector <b>41</b> and the second reflector <b>42</b> are positioned on two different ends of the supporting board <b>30</b>, respectively. The second reflector <b>42</b> substantially faces the first reflector <b>41</b>. The second reflector <b>42</b> includes a first portion <b>421</b>, a second portion <b>422</b> and a reflecting surface <b>423</b>. The first portion <b>421</b> and the second portion <b>422</b> are both with plate like structures. The second portion <b>422</b> is parallel to the central axis O<sub>1</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>of the vehicle lighting device <b>100</b>, and away from the first reflector <b>41</b>. The first portion <b>421</b> is parallel to the supporting board <b>30</b> and stacked on the supporting board <b>30</b> firmly, adjacent to the light source <b>20</b>. The first portion <b>421</b> intersects the second portion <b>422</b> with an angle therebetween. A corner <b>424</b> interconnects the first portion <b>421</b> and the second portion <b>422</b>.
