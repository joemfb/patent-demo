<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present Application for Patent is a continuation of patent application Ser. No. 12/098,017 entitled &#x201c;ARRAY STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF MAGNETORESISTIVE RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (MRAM) BIT CELLS&#x201d; filed Apr. 4, 2008, pending, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are directed to array structural designs of Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) bit cells. More particularly, embodiments of the invention are related to array structural designs of Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is a non-volatile memory technology that uses magnetic elements. For example, Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) uses electrons that become spin-polarized as the electrons pass through a thin film (spin filter). STT-MRAM is also known as Spin Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM), Spin Torque Transfer Magnetization Switching RAM (Spin-RAM), and Spin Momentum Transfer (SMT-RAM).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a diagram of a conventional STT-MRAM cell <b>100</b> is illustrated. The STT-MRAM bit cell <b>100</b> includes magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) storage element <b>105</b>, transistor <b>110</b>, bit line <b>120</b> and word line <b>130</b>. The MTJ storage element is formed, for example, from a pinned layer and a free layer, each of which can hold a magnetic field, separated by an insulating (tunnel barrier) layer as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The STT-MRAM bit cell <b>100</b> also includes a source line <b>140</b>, sense amplifier <b>150</b>, read/write circuitry <b>160</b> and bit line reference <b>170</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the operation and construction of the memory cell <b>100</b> is known in the art. Additional details are provided, for example, in M. Hosomi, et al., A Novel Nonvolatile Memory with Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Magnetization Switching: Spin-RAM, proceedings of IEDM conference (2005), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in conventional designs, the source lines (SL) of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) bit cell arrays are arranged to be parallel to either the bit line (BL) or the word line. However, in conventional designs there is no direct and parallel overlap between the source line (SL) and bit line (BL) due to via and metal spacing rules. Therefore, the minimum bit cell size of conventional designs cannot be reduced or minimized as a result of metal and via spacing rules.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a top down screen view of a conventional magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) bit cell array having source lines (SL) arranged parallel to the bit lines (BL). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the source lines (SL) do not overlap the bit lines (BL), and thus, the bit cell size is limited by the spacing rules between the source lines (SL) and the bit lines (BL).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are directed to array structural designs of Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) bit cells. More particularly, embodiments of the invention are related to array structural designs of Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM).

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term &#x201c;embodiments of the invention&#x201d; does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of embodiments of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including&#x201d;, when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the invention can provide an MRAM bit cell array that may reduce the bit cell size. For example, an embodiment of an STT-MRAM bit cell array can reduce average bit cell size by placing at least a portion of the source line (SL) on top of the bit line (BL) so that it can overcome the limitations imposed by conventional metal and via interconnect spacing rules.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments can solve the problems of the conventional MRAM bit cell arrays. Embodiments can reduce the MTJ bit cell sizes by adding via interconnects to the source line (SL) and adding a top thin metal layer (e.g. M<b>7</b>) such that the source line (SL) is configured to be directly on top of or above (e.g., overlapping and parallel to) the bit line (BL) to overcome conventional main metal and via design rule limitations, thereby saving silicon space.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref>, embodiments of the invention can provide an MRAM bit cell array that reduces or minimizes the bit cell size. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically illustrates an embodiment of an MRAM bit cell array. An embodiment of the STT-MRAM bit cell array can reduce average bit cell size by placing the source line (SL) overlapping and parallel to (e.g., above) the bit line (BL) to resolve or overcome limitations resulting from conventional metal and via interconnect spacing rules.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exemplary STT-MRAM bit cell <b>500</b> includes a source line (SL) formed in a first plane and a bit line (BL) formed in a second plane. The bit line (BL) has a longitudinal axis that is parallel to a longitudinal axis of the source line (SL). According to the exemplary embodiments, the source line (SL) overlaps at least a portion of the width of the bit line (BL), thereby reducing the bit cell size. In one embodiment, the source line (SL) can substantially overlap the width of the bit line (BL), thereby further reducing the bit cell size. As another example, as shown in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the source line (SL) can completely overlap the bit line (BL), thereby further reducing the bit cell size.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the MTJ bit cell size is reduced by adding a top thin metal layer (M<b>7</b>) to form the source line (SL) directly on top of or above (e.g., overlapping and parallel to) the bit line (BL). The metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b> are extended in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the source line (SL) and the bit line (BL) and in the same plane as the respective metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b> such that at least a portion of the metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b> are not overlapping with the bit line (BL). A via interconnect connects (e.g., electrically connects) the portions of the metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b>, which are not overlapping with the bit line (BL), to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, in an embodiment, a portion of the metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b> are extended in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the source line (SL) and the bit line (BL) and in the same plane as the respective metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b> to form lateral extensions (e.g., first and second lateral extensions). A via interconnect connects (e.g., electrically connects) the lateral extensions to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, a metal layer M<b>6</b> is formed in the area of the lateral extensions between metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b>. The illustrative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a via interconnect V<b>5</b> to connect the lateral extension of metal layer M<b>5</b> to the metal layer M<b>6</b> and a via interconnect V<b>6</b> to connect the metal layer M<b>6</b> to the lateral extension of metal layer M<b>7</b>. Thus, the embodiment can avoid shorting or interconnect of the source line (e.g., M<b>7</b>) to the bit line (BL) which would otherwise result from the parallel overlapping of the source line (SL) and the bit line (BL). Cross-sectional illustrations of the embodiment of the MRAM bit cell array of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another exemplary embodiment, the MTJ cell can be moved one metal layer down such that the existing top thin metal (e.g., M<b>6</b>) can be used as the source line (SL). Accordingly, in this illustrative embodiment, an additional metal layer (e.g., M<b>7</b>) is not included in the bit cell.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a top down screen view of an embodiment of an MRAM bit cell array <b>600</b>, generally corresponding to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with like elements being labeled the same. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is another top down screen view of an embodiment of an MRAM bit cell array <b>700</b> illustrating a larger scale integration of the bit cells.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the metal layers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, M<b>5</b>, and M<b>6</b> (BL) are connected to each other by via interconnects V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b>, V<b>4</b>, and V<b>5</b>, respectively. The source line M<b>7</b> is configured to be parallel to and overlapping with the metal layer M<b>6</b> (BL) but not interconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional illustration of the embodiment of a source <b>900</b> of the MRAM bit cell array of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> along A<b>9</b>-A<b>9</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the metal layers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, and M<b>5</b> are connected to each other by via interconnects V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b>, and V<b>4</b>, respectively. The metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b> extend in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the source line (SL) and the bit line (BL) and in the same plane as the respective metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b> to form lateral extensions (e.g., first later extension <b>910</b> and second lateral extension <b>920</b>). A metal layer (e.g., M<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is formed in the area of the lateral extensions between metal layers M<b>5</b> and M<b>7</b>. For example, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the metal layer (e.g., M<b>6</b>) can be formed in the same plane as the bit line (BL), but electrically isolated from the bit line (BL). The embodiment includes via interconnects VS and V<b>6</b> to connect the lateral extension <b>920</b> of metal layer M<b>5</b> to the metal layer M<b>6</b> and the metal layer M<b>6</b> to the lateral extension <b>910</b> of metal layer M<b>7</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which is a perspective illustration of an embodiment of a source <b>900</b> of an MRAM bit cell array, the source line (SL) (e.g., M<b>7</b>) is configured to be parallel to and overlapping with the bit line (BL) but not interconnected (e.g., not electrically interconnected). Thus, the exemplary embodiments can avoid shorting the source line (SL) M<b>7</b>) to the bit line (BL) which would otherwise result from the parallel overlapping of the source line (SL) and the bit line (BL), while minimizing or reducing the average bit cell size compared with the conventional bit cell design.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to an embodiment, one or more via interconnects (e.g., V<b>5</b> and V<b>6</b>) and a top thin metal layer (M<b>7</b>) can be designed to connect the source line (SL) of the access transistor in a MTJ bit cell so that the source line (SL) can be placed directly on top of or above (e.g., overlapping and parallel to) the bit line (BL) without shorting or interconnecting of the source line (SL) (e.g., M<b>7</b>) to the bit line (BL), thereby reducing the average bit cell area.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can be a Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) bit cell including a source line (SL) formed in a first plane, and a bit line (BL) formed in a second plane and having a longitudinal axis that is parallel to a longitudinal axis of the source line (SL), wherein the source line (SL) overlaps at least a portion of the bit line (BL).

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, the source line (SL) includes a first lateral extension <b>910</b> that extends in the first plane and in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the source line (SL) such that a portion of the first lateral extension <b>910</b> is not overlapping with the bit line (BL).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another embodiment, the source line is a first metal layer (e.g., M<b>7</b> (SL)) and the bit line is a second metal layer (e.g., BL). The bit cell also can include a third metal layer (e.g., M<b>5</b>) formed in a third plane and having a longitudinal axis that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the first metal layer (e.g., M<b>7</b>), wherein the second metal layer (e.g., BL) interposes the first metal layer (e.g., M<b>7</b>) and the third metal layer (e.g., M<b>5</b>). The first metal layer (e.g., M<b>7</b>) and/or the second metal layer (e.g., BL) can overlap at least a portion of the third metal layer (e.g., M<b>5</b>).</p>
