<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a surface emitting laser and an image forming apparatus including the surface emitting laser.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) are used as light sources of exposure optical systems included in electrophotographic image forming apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to improve the performance of the surface emitting laser, the surface emitting laser having a stepped structure provided on an emitting surface and in an emission area has been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For instance, in order to accomplish laser oscillation in single transverse mode, JP No. 2001-284722 A discloses a surface emitting laser having a stepped structure provided in its surface so that a reflectivity of a center portion is higher than that of a peripheral portion in an upper mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-284722 discloses a method forming the stepped structure by etching process or liftoff process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the stepped structure is provided on an emitting surface and in an emission area, a distribution of electric-field amplitude in a near field is modulated. Thus, a distribution of electric-field amplitude in a far field is also modulated. As a result, a distribution of an intensity in the far field (FFP: Far Field Pattern) is also modulated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When a protective film is not formed on the stepped structure, a boundary between the stepped structure and air may be referred to as a lateral face. The lateral face may be called edge portion. A lateral face of the stepped structure is not always perpendicular. The lateral face may have some angular degree and the stepped structure may have a tapered shape.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The angular degree depends on how to manufacture it, but in general, controlling the angular degree is more difficult than that of a film thickness. Thus, it is difficult to make the FFP a predetermined value because a shape of the stepped structure may be varied.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, one disclosed aspect of the embodiments provides a surface emitting laser that may control the effect of the variation of the stepped structure shape in the process, and an image forming apparatus including the surface emitting laser.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the embodiments, a surface emitting laser operating (e.g., oscillating) at a wave length &#x3bb; includes a substrate; a stacked structure provided on the substrate, the stacked structure including a bottom mirror, an active layer, and an upper mirror; a stepped structure having a step between a first region and a second region, the stepped structure provided in an emission area located in an upper portion of the upper mirror; and a light shielding member provided in a third region between the first region and the second region and not provided in a portion of the first region and a portion of the second region. Regarding an optical path length from a standard surface set on the outside of the surface emitting laser and extending perpendicular to a stacking direction of the stacked structure to an upper boundary surface of the upper mirror, the optical path length of the first region is different from the optical path length of the second region.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The reason why the FFP is varied due to the stepped structure is because an inclined angle in the edge portion of the stepped structure is easily varied and a laser light through the area having the inclined angle affects FFP. Thus, when the laser light is not transmitted through the area having the edge portion of the stepped structure, the effect of the variation in the shape of the stepped structure may be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, one aspect of the embodiments has a light shielding member provided in the area having the edge portion where the inclined angle of the stepped structure may be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a surface emitting laser <b>100</b> according to an embodiment. The surface emitting laser <b>100</b> has a stacked structure including a bottom mirror <b>112</b>, an active layer <b>114</b>, and an upper mirror <b>116</b>. These are provided on a semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. A cylindrical mesa structure is formed by etching a portion of upper mirror <b>116</b> and a bottom mirror <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A current confinement structure <b>118</b> provided in the upper mirror <b>116</b> has an insulating region so as to limit a current. For example, the insulating region is manufactured by introducing the water vapor from a lateral side of the mesa structure and oxidizing a semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The current confinement structure <b>118</b> has a semiconductor region and an insulating region. The insulating region has lower refractive index than that of the semiconductor region so it defines an oscillation mode <b>130</b> and an emitting region.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An upper electrode <b>122</b> and a bottom electrode <b>120</b> for injecting current to the active layer <b>114</b> are provided on the upper mirror <b>116</b> and the back side of the substrate <b>120</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A stepped structure <b>150</b> having convex shape is provided on the upper mirror <b>116</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An optical thickness of the stepped structure <b>150</b> is different between a first region <b>160</b> and a second region <b>162</b>. The stepped structure <b>150</b> is provided in an emission area which emits light.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second region <b>162</b> is provided far from the first region <b>160</b> with respect to a center of the emission area. A third region <b>165</b> is located between the first region <b>160</b> and the second region <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As the stepped structure <b>150</b> is configured as above, a reflectivity and the FFP may be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the stepped structure having convex shape as example, but the present invention may apply to a stepped structure having concavity shape.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of the first region <b>160</b>, the second region <b>162</b>, and the third region <b>165</b> in the surface emitting laser <b>100</b>. Each of lasers emits from each of these regions. The lasers interfere with each other so the FFP is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Regarding an optical path length from the an upper boundary surface <b>142</b> of the upper mirror <b>116</b> to a standard surface <b>144</b>, the optical path length varies between the first region <b>160</b> and the second region <b>162</b>. As the optical thickness of the stepped structure <b>150</b> varies between the first region <b>160</b> and the second region <b>162</b>, the optical path length from the upper boundary <b>142</b> to the standard surface <b>144</b> also varies between the first region <b>160</b> and the second region <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Here, the standard surface <b>144</b> indicates an imaginary surface set on the outside of the surface emitting laser, which is perpendicular to a stacking direction of the stacked structure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An environmental medium <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is air.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When a difference L between the optical length of the first region <b>160</b> and the optical length of the second region <b>162</b> satisfies the expression (N+&#xbc;)&#x3bb;&#x3c;L&#x3c;(N+&#xbe;)&#x3bb; (N is an integer), the FFP may be controlled. For instance, the stepped structure <b>150</b> may make an angle of the FFP to spread or make a shape of the FFP to be flat around the center of the FFP. For example, L may be &#x3bb;/2.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the third region <b>165</b> which is provided between the first region <b>160</b> and the second region <b>162</b>, the edge of the stepped structure <b>150</b> may be inclined.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the third region <b>165</b>, the light shielding member <b>155</b> is provided on the stepped structure <b>150</b>. The light shielding member <b>155</b> does not allow the light from the inclined edge of the stepped structure <b>150</b> to affect the FFP.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">That is, the light shielding member <b>155</b> may control the variation of the FFP when the tapered shape of the stepped structure has been varied in the manufacture process.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to diminish the influence on the FFP due to the error in manufacturing the stepped structure <b>150</b>, the light shielding member <b>155</b> may be provided on all of the third region <b>165</b> including the edge portion of the stepped structure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Even though the light shielding member <b>155</b> is provided in a part of the third region <b>165</b>, the variation of the FFP may be diminished. Thus, one embodiment may include this arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light shielding member may be made of the material which is not substantially transparent against the laser light. The light shielding member includes an absorption member and a reflective member. When a metal film is used for the light shielding member <b>155</b>, it functions as the upper electrode <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A thickness of the light shielding member <b>155</b> may be thinner than a thickness of the step in the stepped structure <b>150</b> in order to diminish light scattering caused by the light shielding member <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the difference of a refractive index between the stepped structure <b>150</b> and the light shielding member <b>155</b> is less than 20% of the refractive index of the stepped structure <b>150</b>, the reflectivity between the stepped structure <b>150</b> and the light shielding member <b>155</b> is less than 1%. For example, the stepped structure <b>150</b> may be made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and the light shielding member <b>155</b> may be made of Al in the surface emitting laser <b>100</b> (&#x3bb;=680 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(Manufacturing Method)</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The following is an example of a manufacturing method of the surface emitting laser <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A vertical cavity structure (&#x3bb;=680 nm) including a bottom mirror <b>112</b> made of n-type semiconductor, an active layer <b>114</b>, and an upper mirror <b>116</b> made of p-type semiconductor. These are formed on GaAs substrate <b>110</b> and manufactured by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) method.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The bottom mirror <b>112</b> and the upper mirror <b>116</b> form a multilayer mirror. For example, Al<sub>0.9</sub>Ga<sub>0.1</sub>As of &#x3bb;/4 and Al0.5Ga0.5As of &#x3bb;/4 are stacked alternately, and the bottom mirror <b>112</b> and the upper mirror <b>116</b> have 70 pairs and 35 pairs, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The active layer <b>114</b> has a multiple-quantum-well structure and a cladding layer. When oscillation wavelength is 680 nm, for example, the multiple-quantum-well structure may be made of GaInP/AlGaInP and the cladding layer may be made of AlGaInP.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, a cylindrical mesa structure having 30 &#x3bc;m diameter is formed by etching. After that, a current confinement structure <b>118</b> having 5.2 &#x3bc;m diameter may be formed by oxidizing Al<sub>0.98</sub>Ga<sub>0.02</sub>As layer located near to the active layer <b>114</b> in the upper mirror <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A stepped structure <b>150</b> is provided on the surface of the upper mirror <b>116</b>. The stepped structure <b>150</b> may be made of semiconductor or dielectric materials. For example, the stepped structure <b>150</b> made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>having refractive index of 1.5 may be deposited by plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A first region <b>160</b> is inside a circle having 3.6 &#x3bc;m diameter and a second region <b>162</b> is outside a circle having 5.0 &#x3bc;m diameter. A center of the first region <b>160</b> and a center of the second region <b>162</b> are substantially same as an optical axis <b>136</b> of a light source which is a center of the current confinement structure <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A manufacturing method of the stepped structure <b>150</b> is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At first, SiO<sub>2 </sub>having 1.5&#x3bb; optical thickness is deposited and a member corresponding to the second region <b>162</b> is etched by wet etching or dry etching. Thus, the taper shaped structure having the inclined edge is formed in the third region <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, SiO<sub>2 </sub>having 0.5&#x3bb; optical thickness is deposited so as to cover the structure so a member of 2.0&#x3bb; optical thickness and a member of 0.5&#x3bb; optical thickness may be formed in the first region <b>160</b> and the second region <b>162</b>, respectively. In the process, the tapered shape is maintained and the inclined edge exists in the third region <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The following is some other manufacturing method of the stepped structure <b>150</b>. At first, SiO<sub>2 </sub>having 0.5&#x3bb; optical thickness is deposited and a resist is deposited in the area except the first region <b>160</b>. Then SiO<sub>2 </sub>having 1.5&#x3bb; optical thickness is deposited and the resist is removed by a liftoff method. In this way, the stepped structure <b>150</b> is formed, which has the member of 2.0&#x3bb; optical thickness in the first region <b>160</b> and the member of 0.5&#x3bb; optical thickness in the second region <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The light shielding member <b>155</b> is formed on the third region <b>165</b> by a liftoff method. The light shielding member <b>155</b> is formed in the edge portion of the stepped structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the light shielding member <b>155</b> is metal film (e.g., Au) of 100 nm thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The p-type upper electrode <b>122</b>, for example, Ti/Au and the n-type bottom electrode <b>110</b>, for example, AuGe/Au are provided on the upper mirror <b>116</b> and on the back side of the substrate <b>110</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the stepped structure <b>150</b> is made of semiconductor, the stepped structure <b>150</b> may be formed by etching the semiconductor in the second region <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the metal film as the light shielding member <b>155</b> is selected from the materials which may contact to the semiconductor of the stepped structured <b>150</b> as ohmic contact, the metal film of the light shielding member <b>155</b> may be used for the upper electrode <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After forming the light shielding member <b>155</b>, it is possible to form the stepped structure <b>150</b> using the light shielding member <b>155</b>. For example, the photoresist is formed on the light shielding member <b>155</b> so as to cover the first region <b>160</b>. After that, the second region <b>162</b> is etched to form the stepped structure <b>150</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of a surface emitting laser <b>102</b> according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the second embodiment, the stepped structure <b>150</b> is formed above the light shielding member <b>155</b>, which is different from the first embodiment. In this case, the light shielding member <b>155</b> is provided in the third region <b>165</b> as with the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the light shielding member <b>155</b> is a ring-shaped metal having an inner diameter of 3.7 &#x3bc;m and an outer diameter of 5.1 &#x3bc;m. The light shielding member <b>155</b> is formed on the upper mirror <b>116</b>. Its thickness is, for example, 100 &#x3bc;m. The stepped structure <b>150</b> made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is formed above it.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Because the light shielding member <b>155</b> is formed on the upper mirror <b>116</b>, the light shielding member <b>155</b> may be arranged in a horizontal direction. Also, the light shielding member <b>155</b> is not exposed due to the stepped structure <b>150</b>. As a result, the second embodiment may have advantages compared with the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The following is an explanation about an image forming apparatus including a surface-emitting-laser array used for a light source. The surface-emitting-laser array light source includes a plurality of surface emitting lasers according to any of the above embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a plan view of the image forming apparatus and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a side view of it.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A laser beam emitted from the surface-emitting-laser-array light source <b>514</b>, as a recording light source, is transmitted through a collimator lens <b>520</b> and travels toward a rotating polygon mirror <b>510</b>, which is driven to rotate by a motor <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The laser beam that strikes the rotating polygon mirror <b>510</b> is reflected by the rotating polygon mirror <b>510</b>. The reflected beam is transmitted through an f-&#x3b8; lens <b>522</b>. The beam is reflected by the mirror <b>516</b> in such a manner as to fall onto a photosensitive member <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The photosensitive member <b>500</b> is charged in advance by a charging device <b>502</b> and is exposed to the scanningly moved laser beam, whereby an electrostatic latent image is formed thereon. The electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive member <b>500</b> is developed by a developing device <b>504</b> into a visible image. The visible image is transferred to transfer paper by a transfer charging device <b>506</b>. The transfer paper having the visible image is conveyed to a fixing device <b>508</b>, where fixing is performed thereon. Subsequently, the paper having the fixed image is discharged to the outside of the apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the second region <b>162</b> surrounds the first region <b>160</b>. The embodiments are not limited to this arrangement. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the first region <b>160</b> and the second region <b>162</b> are of semicircular shape, the light shielding member may be arranged in the third region <b>165</b>. That is, the second region <b>162</b> is not provided far from the first region <b>160</b> with respect to the center of the emission area.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The light shielding member may be provided in not only all of the third region <b>165</b> but also a part of the third region <b>165</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
