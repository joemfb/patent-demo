<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application for patent is a continuation of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/492,605, entitled &#x201c;Channel Estimation for Wireless Communication,&#x201d; inventors Tao Luo, et al., filed Jul. 24, 2006, which claims priority to Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/707,673, entitled &#x201c;SNR Sensitive Channel Estimation for Advanced Receivers,&#x201d; filed Aug. 12, 2005, both assigned to the assignee hereof, and both expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">I. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for performing channel estimation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">II. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a wireless communication system, a transmitter typically processes (e.g., encodes and modulates) traffic data to generate data symbols. In a coherent system, the transmitter multiplexes pilot symbols with the data symbols, processes the multiplexed data and pilot symbols to generate a modulated signal, and transmits the modulated signal via a wireless channel. The wireless channel distorts the transmitted signal with a channel response and further degrades the signal with noise and interference.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A receiver receives the transmitted signal and processes the received signal to obtain input samples. For coherent data detection, the receiver estimates the response of the wireless channel based on received pilot symbols and derives a channel estimate. The receiver then performs data detection on the input samples with the channel estimate to obtain detected symbols, which are estimates of the data symbols sent by the transmitter. The receiver then processes (e.g., demodulates and decodes) the detected symbols to obtain decoded data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The quality of the channel estimate may have a large impact on data detection performance and may affect the quality of the detected symbols as well as the reliability of the decoded data. There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to derive a high quality channel estimate for wireless communication.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Techniques for deriving channel estimates with different channel estimation filters are described herein. According to an exemplary embodiment, an apparatus is described which includes at least one processor and a memory. The processor(s) determine a filter selection metric for a signal to be recovered, select a channel estimation filter based on the filter selection metric, and derive a channel estimate with the selected channel estimation filter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another exemplary embodiment, an apparatus is described which includes at least one processor and a memory. The processor(s) derive a first channel estimate based on pilot symbols and with a first channel estimation filter. The processor(s) recover a first packet with the first channel estimate and regenerate data symbols for the first packet. The processor(s) derive a second channel estimate based on the data symbols and with a second channel estimation filter, and obtains a third channel estimate based on the first and second channel estimates.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to yet another exemplary embodiment, an apparatus is described which includes at least one processor and a memory. The processor(s) derive a first channel estimate with a first channel estimation filter having a first filter response, recover a first signal with the first channel estimate, and estimate and remove interference due to the first signal. The processor(s) derive a second channel estimate with a second channel estimation filter having a second filter response that is different from the first filter response.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any exemplary embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wireless communication system <b>100</b>. For simplicity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows only one base station <b>110</b> and three terminals <b>120</b>. A base station is generally a fixed station that communicates with the terminals and may also be called a Node B, an access point, a base transceiver station (BTS), or some other terminology. A base station may communicate with one or more terminals on the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base station to the terminals, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A terminal may be stationary or mobile and may also be called a user equipment (UE), a mobile station, a user terminal, a subscriber unit, or some other terminology. A terminal may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless device, a wireless modem card, a handheld device, or some other device or apparatus. In the following description, the terms &#x201c;terminal&#x201d; and &#x201c;user&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the downlink, base station <b>110</b> may transmit one or more downlink signals to terminals <b>120</b>. Each downlink signal may reach each terminal <b>120</b> via one or more signal paths, which may include a direct path and/or reflected paths. The reflected paths are created by reflections of radio waves due to obstructions (e.g., buildings, trees, vehicles, and other structures) in the wireless environment. Each terminal <b>120</b> may receive multiple instances or copies of each downlink signal. Each received signal instance is obtained via a different signal path and has a particular complex gain and a particular time delay determined by that signal path. The received signal at each terminal <b>120</b> is a superposition of all received signal instances for base station <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">On the uplink, each terminal <b>120</b> may transmit one or more uplink signals to base station <b>110</b>. Each uplink signal may reach base station <b>110</b> via one or more signal paths. The received signal at base station <b>110</b> is a superposition of all received signal instances for all terminals transmitting on the uplink.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The channel estimation techniques described herein may be used for various communication systems such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems, Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) systems, Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) systems, and so on. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as cdma2000, Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD), or UTRA Time Division Duplexing (TDD). cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. UTRA FDD is also referred to as Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA). A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). These various radio technologies and standards are known in the art. UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, and GSM are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP). cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). 3GPP and 3GPP2 documents are publicly available.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The channel estimation techniques may be used for downlink and uplink transmissions and may be implemented at a base station as well as a terminal. For clarity, the techniques are described below for uplink transmission in W-CDMA.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a frame format in W-CDMA. The timeline for transmission is divided into radio frames. Each radio frame has a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms) and is identified by a 12-bit system frame number (SFN). Each radio frame is further partitioned into 15 slots, which are labeled as slot 0 through slot 14. Each slot has a duration of 0.667 ms and includes 2560 chips at 3.84 Mcps. Each ratio frame is also partitioned into five subframes. Each subframe has a duration of 2 ms and includes 3 slots.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a slot format for an uplink dedicated physical channel (DPCH) used by a terminal to send traffic and other data on the uplink. The uplink DPCH includes a dedicated physical data channel (DPDCH) that carries traffic data and a dedicated physical control channel (DPCCH) that carries pilot and control data. A radio link for a terminal may include zero, one, or multiple DPDCHs and only one DPCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each slot of the DPCCH includes a pilot field, a transport format combination indicator (TFCI) field, a feedback information (FBI) field, and a transmit power control (TPC) field. The pilot field carries pilot symbols. The TFCI field carries format information used to recover the traffic data. The FBI field carries feedback from a terminal to a base station, e.g., for transmit diversity. The TPC field carries power control information to direct the base station to adjusts its transmit power for downlink transmission to the terminal. The number of bits in each field is zero or greater and is determined by a slot format selected for use.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a slot format for an E-DCH DPDCH (E-DPDCH) that carries traffic data and an E-DCH DPCCH (E-DPCCH) that carries control data. A radio link for a terminal may include zero, one, or multiple E-DPDCHs and at most one E-DPCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a block diagram of base station <b>110</b> and terminal <b>120</b>, which is one of the terminals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At terminal <b>120</b>, a transmit (TX) data processor <b>310</b> receives data packets, processes (e.g., encodes, interleaves, and symbol maps) each packet, and generates data symbols. A packet may also be referred to as a transport block, a frame, and so on. A data symbol is a symbol for data, a pilot symbol is a symbol for pilot, and pilot is data that is known a priori by both the terminal and base station. The data and pilot symbols may be modulation symbols from a signal constellation for PSK, QAM, or some other modulation scheme. TX data processor <b>310</b> also appends a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value to each packet, which is used to determine whether the packet is decoded correctly or in error. A CDMA modulator <b>320</b> processes the data symbols and pilot symbols and provides output chips to a transmitter (TMTR) <b>330</b>. Transmitter <b>330</b> processes (e.g., converts to analog, amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) the output chips and generates an uplink signal, which is transmitted from an antenna <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At base station <b>110</b>, an antenna <b>352</b> receives the uplink signals from terminal <b>120</b> as well as other terminals via direct and/or reflected paths. Antenna <b>352</b> provides a received signal to a receiver (RCVR) <b>354</b>. Receiver <b>354</b> processes (e.g., filters, amplifies, frequency downconverts, and digitizes) the received signal and provides input samples to an RX processor <b>360</b>. Within RX processor <b>360</b>, a CDMA demodulator (Demod) <b>362</b> processes the input samples and provides detected symbols, which are estimates of the data symbols sent by terminal <b>120</b>. CDMA demodulator <b>362</b> may implement a rake receiver and/or an equalizer, each of which can combine energy from multiple signal paths. An RX data processor <b>364</b> processes (e.g., symbol demaps, deinterleaves, and decodes) the detected symbols and provides decoded data. In general, the processing by CDMA demodulator <b>362</b> and RX data processor <b>364</b> is complementary to the processing by CDMA modulator <b>320</b> and TX data processor <b>310</b>, respectively, at terminal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Controllers/processors <b>340</b> and <b>370</b> direct operation of various processing units at terminal <b>120</b> and base station <b>110</b>, respectively.

Spreader <b>412</b> then multiplies the N replicated symbols with the N chips of code C<sub>d </sub>to generate N data chips for the data symbol. A multiplier <b>414</b> multiplies the output of spreader <b>412</b> with a gain factor &#x3b2;<sub>d </sub>for the DPDCH.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The gain factors &#x3b2;<sub>d </sub>and &#x3b2;<sub>ed </sub>determine the amount of transmit power to use for traffic data. The gain factors &#x3b2;<sub>c </sub>and &#x3b2;<sub>ec </sub>determine the amount of transmit power to use for pilot and control data. A traffic-to-pilot ratio (TtoP) is the ratio of traffic power to pilot power and may be given in units of decibel (dB) as: TtoP=20&#xb7;log<sub>10</sub>(&#x3b2;<sub>d</sub>/&#x3b2;<sub>c</sub>) or 20&#xb7;log<sub>10</sub>(&#x3b2;<sub>ed</sub>/&#x3b2;<sub>ec</sub>).

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In general, channel estimation performance is affected by two competing factors&#x2014;noise suppression and channel tracking. For a slowly varying channel, it is desirable to derive a channel estimate with as many symbols as possible since the channel gains change slowly and the quality of the channel estimate typically improves by using more symbols. For a fast fading channel, it is desirable to derive a channel estimate with fewer symbols since channel variation limits the number of symbols that can be coherently combined. Similarly, it is desirable to derive a channel estimate with more symbols for a low SNR channel and with fewer symbols for a high SNR channel.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an exemplary embodiment, channel estimates are derived with different channel estimation filters designed for different channel conditions. The channel conditions may be quantified by SNR, mobility, fading, and/or other factors, and may be explicitly or implicitly determined as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The channel estimation filters may be implemented with various designs. In an exemplary embodiment, the channel estimation filters are implemented with finite impulse response (FIR) filters, as follows:</p>

First, despreaders <b>512</b> and <b>522</b> receive input samples for terminal u. These input samples may or may not be the input samples from receiver <b>354</b> depending on whether or not terminal u is the first terminal being recovered. Second, channel estimation filter <b>516</b> (instead of combiner <b>538</b>) provides a pilot-based channel estimate, CHPu, for terminal u to demodulator/decoder <b>524</b>. Third, channel estimation filter <b>536</b> provides a data-based channel estimate, CHDu, for terminal u.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">If a packet is decoded correctly for terminal u, then encoder/modulator <b>528</b> processes the decoded packet and provides regenerated data symbols for terminal u. A CDMA modulator <b>540</b> then spreads and scrambles the regenerated data symbols (and possibly pilot and control symbols) and generates output chips for terminal u. A channel emulator <b>542</b> receives the output chips from CDMA modulator <b>540</b> and a channel estimate from combiner <b>538</b>, convolves the output chips with the channel estimate, and provides an interference estimate for terminal u. Channel emulator <b>542</b> simulates the effects of the wireless channel for terminal u. An interference subtraction unit <b>544</b> subtracts the interference estimate from the input samples for terminal u and provides input samples for the next terminal u+1.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the data-based channel estimate CHDu from filter <b>536</b> is used to derive an interference estimate for terminal u. The data-based channel estimate may also be used for demodulation and decoding for terminal u in similar manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, whenever a packet is decoded correctly, the data-based channel estimate is derived from the regenerated data symbols for this packet and used for interference estimation for the present packet as well as demodulation/decoding for the next packet.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">Combiner <b>538</b> may combine pilot-based and data-based channel estimates using any of the criteria described above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and/or other criteria applicable for interference cancellation. For example, combiner <b>538</b> may provide the pilot-based channel estimate for the first stage or the first few stages. Combiner <b>538</b> may provide the data-based channel estimate or may combine the pilot-based and data-based channel estimates for the remaining stages.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the processing for one terminal in one stage. U terminals may be processed sequentially in U stages, one terminal in each stage. The first stage processes the input samples from receiver <b>354</b> for the first terminal and provides input samples for the second stage. Each subsequent stage processes the input samples from a preceding stage for one terminal and provides input samples for the next stage.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">The terminals may also be processed with parallel interference cancellation. In this case, all terminals may be processed in the first round. The interference from all terminals successfully decoded in the first round may be estimated and subtracted from the input samples. Terminals not successfully decoded in the first round may then be processed again using the interference-canceled input samples. The processing may continue until all terminals are successfully decoded or the interference from all successfully decoded terminals has been canceled. A combination of sequential and parallel interference cancellation may also be performed. In this case, the terminals may be arranged into groups, e.g., based on their SNRs. The groups may be processed sequentially, and the terminals in each group may be processed in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">With interference cancellation, the SNR of each terminal is dependent on the stage/order in which the terminal is recovered. The SNR of the first terminal may be the worst since no interference has been removed. The SNR of the next terminal may be better since the interference from the first terminal has been removed. The SNR of the last terminal may be the best since the interference from all prior terminals have been removed. In general, SNR progressively improves the later a terminal is recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">A large variation in SNRs may be present in the symbols used to derive channel estimates. The large SNR variation may result from interference cancellation and/or from using different types of symbols, e.g., pilot symbols and data symbols, for channel estimation. The channel estimation filtering may be matched to the variation in SNRs to obtain higher quality channel estimates.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">The channel estimation filters for each terminal may be selected based on the SNR for that terminal, which may be dependent on the stage/order in which the terminal is recovered as well as where within the stage the filters are used. For the first terminal with the worst SNR, channel estimation filter <b>516</b> may be for low SNR, and channel estimation filter <b>536</b> may be for low or medium SNR. For each subsequent terminal, filters <b>516</b> and <b>536</b> may be for progressively higher SNR. In general, filter <b>516</b> for successively later stages may be for progressively higher SNR. Filter <b>536</b> for successively later stages may also be for progressively higher SNR. For any given stage, filter <b>536</b> may be for higher SNR than filter <b>516</b>. The particular filters to use for each stage may be appropriately selected from among all channel estimation filters available for use.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">The channel estimation techniques described herein may also be used for data sent with hybrid automatic repeat request (H-ARQ). With H-ARQ, a transmitter sends one or multiple transmissions for a packet until the packet is decoded correctly by a receiver or the maximum number of transmissions has been sent for the packet. H-ARQ improves reliability for data transmission and supports rate adaptation for packets in the presence of changes in channel conditions. For a packet sent with H-ARQ, demodulator/decoder <b>524</b> may store all transmissions for the packet, combine the stored transmissions with a current transmission, and demodulate and decode the combined transmission to recover the packet. Different channel estimation filters may be used for different transmissions of a given packet, which may be associated with different SNRs.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">The channel estimation techniques described herein may be used for single-input single-output (SISO), single-input multiple-output (SIMO), multiple-input single-output (MISO), and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions. Single-input refers to the use of a single transmit antenna, and multiple-input refers to the use of multiple transmit antennas for data transmission.
