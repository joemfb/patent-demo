<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although the aforesaid methods can prevent over-inflation or deformation of the bladder, many devices, manufacturing procedures, and laborers are required to complete a production. Further, the rubber bladder <b>1</b>, the rubber outer cover layer <b>3</b> or the rubber outer bladder <b>4</b> after vulcanization at high temperature changes its molecular structure, so that the chance of being recycled is low. Moreover, many kinds of additives (such as sulfur) must be mixed with the raw rubber before vulcanization at high temperature may be performed. During this process, contamination is likely to occur, and offensive odor is created during burning, thereby causing harmful effects on human body.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a strong and easy to manufacture inflatable ball with a rib structure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this invention, an inflatable ball comprises a first half ball body, a second half ball body, and a valve unit. The first half ball body has a first half ball wall, and a first rib structure formed as one piece with the first half ball wall. The first half ball wall has a first inner wall surface, a first outer wall surface, a through hole extending through the first inner and outer wall surfaces, and a first annular connecting edge interconnecting circumferential ends of the first inner and outer wall surfaces. The first rib structure projects from one of the first inner and outer wall surfaces. The other one of the first inner and outer wall surfaces is free of the first rib structure. The second half ball body is connected fixedly to and cooperates with the first half ball body to define an inflation chamber.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The valve unit <b>30</b> is attached to the first half ball body <b>10</b>, and includes a valve seat <b>31</b> and a valve member <b>32</b>. The valve seat <b>31</b> is connected to the first inner wall surface <b>111</b> at a position corresponding to that of the through hole <b>113</b>, and has a receiving hole <b>311</b> communicating fluidly with the through hole <b>113</b>. In this embodiment, the valve seat <b>31</b> is made of a material selected from a group consisting of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and rubber. If the valve seat <b>31</b> is made of TPU, the valve seat <b>31</b> is fixed to the first half ball wall <b>11</b> by using high frequency or ultrasonic wave heating. If the valve seat <b>31</b> is made of rubber, the valve seat <b>31</b> is fixed to the first half ball wall <b>11</b> by using adhesive. Preferably, the valve seat <b>31</b> is made of TPU, and is produced by an injection molding process. Further, the valve seat <b>31</b> may be connected integrally as one piece to the first inner wall surface <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the valve member <b>32</b> is disposed in the receiving hole <b>311</b> of the valve seat <b>31</b>, and extends through the through hole <b>113</b> in the first half ball wall <b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">From the aforesaid description, the manufacturing process of the present invention can be explained briefly as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">1. Forming the first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> using an injection molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">2. Fixing the valve seat <b>31</b> to the first inner wall surface <b>111</b> of the first half ball body <b>10</b> using a high frequency or ultrasonic wave heating or adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">3. Connecting fixedly the first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> using a thermal welding process.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">4. Inserting the valve member <b>32</b> through the through hole <b>113</b> in the first half ball wall <b>11</b> into the receiving hole <b>311</b> in the valve seat <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Through this, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the inflatable ball of this invention can be directly used as a bladder. An outer cover layer <b>200</b> (shown in phantom lines) may be covered around the bladder or inflatable ball to form an inflatable sports ball.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The advantages of the present invention can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">1. The first and second rib structures <b>12</b>, <b>42</b> are used to effectively restrict expansion and deformation of the first and second half ball walls <b>11</b>, <b>41</b>, so that during manufacture of the present invention, there is no need to perform the reinforcing manufacturing process described in the aforesaid conventional inflatable ball, such as wrapping a yarn layer <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) around the rubber bladder, fixing adhering pieces <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to an outer surface of the outer cover layer, or adhering fabric lining layers <b>703</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to an inner surface of the outer cover layer. Compared to the conventional inflatable ball, the production of the present invention only requires a matured and developed injection molding machine and a low cost thermal welding process to greatly reduce the manufacturing process. Further, the machine and the process are simple to operate, and require less laborers. Moreover, because the present invention does not need yarns, adhering pieces, or fabric lining layers, the production costs can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">2. The first and second rib structures <b>12</b>, <b>42</b> are connected integrally as one piece with the first and second half ball walls <b>11</b>, <b>41</b>, respectively, are hidden inside the first and second half ball walls <b>11</b>, <b>41</b>, and have good tensile and tear strength, so that when the present invention is at a constant pressure, it will not expand further. As such, the original shape of the inflatable ball can be maintained after use. Hence, when the present invention is used as a bladder of an inflatable sports ball, the appearance of the inflatable sports ball can be effectively maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">3. Because the first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are made by injection molding, they can be produced with a uniform thickness, with high precision, and low damages. Further, they can be mass produced using a single mold. Compared to the conventional rubber bladder which can only be made using one mold to produce one rubber bladder, the production capacity of the present invention can be effectively increased.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">4. The first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> use the inter-engagement of the first and second aligning elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>45</b>, <b>44</b> to align with each other during the thermal welding process. Hence, when the present invention is used as a bladder of an inflatable sports ball, the sports ball as a whole is balanced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">5. When the present invention is used as a bladder of an inflatable sports ball, because there are no yarns, adhering pieces, or fabric lining layers between the present invention and the outer cover layer <b>200</b>, the outer cover layer <b>200</b> is soft and comfortable to touch.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">6. The finished product of the present invention is strong, it can bear a pressure of 1000 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>without bursting. Its strength is 50 times that of the conventional rubber bladder, or 25 times that of the bladder with a wrapping yarn layer or a fabric cloth layer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">7. The first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are made of TPU which has a specific gravity of about 1.0&#x2dc;1.2 that is lower than that of the conventional rubber bladder (about 1.3&#x2dc;1.5). Under the same weight, the thickness of the present invention can be increased to more than 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">8. The first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are made of TPU which has good elongation strength and abrasion resistance, excellent waterproof and solvent resistance, good impermeability (about twice that of synthetic rubber, five times that of natural rubber), and good elasticity (about three times that of synthetic rubber, two times that of natural rubber). As such, the appearance of the inflatable ball can be maintained after inflation. Hence, the inflatable ball is suitable as a bladder of an inflatable sports ball, and can effectively maintain the appearance of the inflatable sports ball after use.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">9. The first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are made of TPU, and can be 100% recycled. Compared to the conventional inflatable ball, the present invention is not only environmentally friendly, but also will not cause allergy or other bad effects to human body.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref>, the inflatable ball according to the second preferred embodiment of this invention is shown to be similar to the first preferred embodiment. However, in this embodiment, the first rib structure <b>12</b> of the first half ball body <b>10</b> is formed as one piece with the first outer wall surface <b>112</b> of the first half ball wall <b>11</b>, and is connected to the first annular flange <b>13</b>. The second rib structure <b>42</b> is formed as one piece with the second outer wall surface <b>412</b> of the second half ball wall <b>41</b>, and is connected to the second annular flange <b>43</b>. Further, each of the first and second annular connecting edges <b>114</b>, <b>413</b> is a wavy edge, and each of the first and second annular flanges <b>13</b>, <b>43</b> has a wavy shape corresponding to that of a respective one of the first and second annular connecting edges <b>114</b>, <b>413</b>. The first and second annular connecting edges <b>114</b>, <b>413</b> are connected to each other in a complementary manner. The first and second annular flanges <b>13</b>, <b>43</b> abut against each other in a complementary manner. The interconnected ribs of each of the first and second rib structures <b>12</b>, <b>42</b> include a plurality of interconnected polygonal ribs <b>124</b> that define a plurality of cell areas <b>122</b>, <b>422</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The purpose and advantages of the first preferred embodiment can be similarly achieved using the second preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, the inflatable ball according to the third preferred embodiment of this invention is shown to be similar to the second preferred embodiment. However, in this embodiment, the inflatable ball further comprises a plurality of leather pieces <b>60</b> disposed respectively in the cell areas <b>122</b>, <b>422</b>. The cell areas <b>122</b>, <b>422</b> have knurled regions <b>115</b>, <b>414</b>. The knurled regions <b>115</b>, <b>414</b> of the cell areas <b>122</b>, <b>422</b> are formed by engraving an inner surface of the injection mold, so that the first and second outer wall surfaces <b>112</b>, <b>412</b> of the first and second half ball walls <b>11</b>, <b>41</b> are formed directly and respectively with the knurled regions <b>115</b>, <b>414</b> during the injection molding process. The leather pieces <b>60</b> are made of PVC synthetic leather or PU leather, and are fixed to the respective knurled regions <b>115</b>, <b>414</b> of the cell areas <b>122</b>, <b>422</b> using adhesive. One of the leather pieces <b>60</b> has an aperture <b>61</b> corresponding in position to the through hole <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The knurled regions <b>115</b>, <b>414</b> of the cell areas <b>122</b>, <b>422</b> enhance the bonding strength between the leather pieces <b>60</b> and the adhesive, dispensing with the complicated manufacturing process of the conventional rubber bladder which requires buffing and finishing prior to application of adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Hence, the third preferred embodiment not only can achieve the purpose and advantages described in the first preferred embodiment, but can also serve as a bladder of the conventional inflatable ball. Further, since in this embodiment there is no need to wrap yarns or fabric cloth layer around the bladder as is done in the conventional inflatable ball in order to perform a second vulcanization of the rubber bladder, the manufacturing process and use of materials of this embodiment can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Moreover, since the first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> are made of TPU which has good abrasion resistance, excellent waterproof and solvent resistance, the first and second half ball bodies <b>10</b>, <b>40</b> may be added with colored paste depending on the requirement to directly produce a desired color. As such, the third preferred embodiment may be directly used as an inflatable sports ball.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In summary, the inflatable ball of the present invention not only has a strong structure, but also has a simplified manufacturing process to facilitate production thereof. Hence, the object of the present invention can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">While the present invention has been described in connection with what are considered the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretation and equivalent arrangements.</p>
