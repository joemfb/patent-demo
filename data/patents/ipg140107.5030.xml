<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is related generally to an improved data processing system, and in particular to a method, apparatus, and computer program product for managing phone messages. In particular, the present invention is directed to a method, apparatus, and computer program product for generating dynamic voice response messages in a mobile computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many mobile computing devices now have baseband processors or transceivers that provide receiver and transmitter operations for wireless communications, such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Wireless communications enabled mobile computing devices include, for example, cellular phones, laptops, tablet computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as Palm OS&#xae; and Windows Mobile&#xae; Pocket PC. Among the phone features most often included by a wireless communications provider is a voice mail service.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A voice mail service generally operates by sending a prerecorded message to a caller when a user is unable to answer a phone call. A user may be unable to answer the phone for a number of reasons. For example, the user may be talking to someone else on the phone or may be in a meeting or conference that cannot be disrupted by accepting a phone call. During these circumstances, current voice mail systems send a single prerecorded or default message to all callers. The prerecorded message typically states that the user is unable to answer the phone and asks the caller to leave a message. A caller is then given an opportunity to record a message for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current voice mail systems are static answering systems. When a user does not answer a call, every caller is connected to the voice mail answering system that sends the same outgoing message to all callers. Although a user can personalize the static prerecorded outgoing message by recording the user's own message, the same static message is sent to all callers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Current voice mail systems typically permit a user to record a different voice mail message for a no-answer outgoing message as opposed to a busy-signal outgoing message. For example, the same no-answer outgoing message is sent to all callers that are connected to the voice mail system when a call is not answered after a preset number of rings or when a call is diverted to voice mail by a user. Likewise, the same busy-signal outgoing message is sent to all callers that are connected to the voice mail system due to a busy signal on the user's phone. In addition, some message systems send a particular response message to a caller based on the caller's phone number. However, the same static prerecorded message is sent to the caller each time the user is unable to answer the caller's incoming call.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The aspects of the present invention provide a computing device implemented method, apparatus, and computer program product to generate dynamic voice response messages in a mobile computing device. In response to receiving an incoming call from a caller, the process displays a list of response messages in a set of response messages. In response to receiving a selection of a response message from the list of response messages, the process sends the selected response message to the caller.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A mobile computing device is a computing device that is compact enough to be held in one or two human hands. For example, a mobile computing device includes laptops, tablet computers, cellular phones, smart watches, and personal digital assistants, also known as palmtops and PDAs. Many mobile computing devices now have baseband processors or transceivers that provide receiver and transmitter operations for wireless communications through the device, such as telephone calls. Wireless communications enabled mobile computing devices are typically capable of performing a number of functions, including caller identification (caller ID) and voice mail features.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A voice mail service generally operates by sending a prerecorded message to a caller when a user is unable to answer a phone call. A user may be unable to answer the phone for a number of reasons. For example, the user may be talking to someone else on the phone or may be in a meeting or conference that cannot be disrupted by accepting a phone call. During these circumstances, current voice mail systems send the same prerecorded or default message to all callers. The prerecorded response message typically states that the user is unable to answer the phone and asks the caller to leave a message. A caller is then given an opportunity to record a message for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The aspects of the illustrative embodiments recognize that current voice mail and other phone answering systems do not enable a user to dynamically select a custom message from a plurality of custom messages based on the identity of the caller in order to let the caller know that the user did in fact receive the call at the time the call is received. In current answering systems, when a user is unable to answer the phone, the caller is connected to voice mail or another static answering system that sends the same response message that does not assure the caller that the user received the call. In other words, when a user is unable to answer a call from a known person, such as a spouse, child, friend, or business acquaintance, the caller receives the same static response message and has no way of knowing if the user actually received the call or is unaware of the call.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A user can be unaware of a missed call for a number of reasons, such as, the phone is turned off, the ringer was left muted or the ringer volume was left turned down low by mistake, the phone was lost or left somewhere, the phone is out of power, or any other reason that could cause a user to be unaware of an incoming call. A caller that is uncertain as to whether the user is aware of the missed call frequently resorts to repeatedly calling the user until the user answers the phone.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, the aspects of the illustrative embodiments recognize the need for the ability to dynamically select a custom voice response message at the time a call is received. Therefore, the illustrative embodiments are directed to a computing device implemented method, apparatus, and computer program product for selecting dynamic voice response messages in a mobile computing device. In response to receiving an incoming call from a caller, the process displays a list of response messages in a set of response messages. In response to receiving a selection of a response message from the list of response messages, the process sends the selected response message to the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, a computing device is a computing device, such as a mobile computing device. A computing device includes telephones, cellular phones, tablet computers, smart watches, personal navigation devices, and personal digital assistants, also known as PDAs and palmtops, and any other type of computing device shown or described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. Thus, the illustrative embodiments can be implemented in a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant, a laptop, or any other type of computing device.</p>

However, the aspects of the illustrative embodiments are also capable of being implemented in any land-based telephone or other device capable of sending and receiving communications signals through a telephone line, fiber optic cable, or by any other known or available non-wireless method for sending and receiving communications signals, including but not limited to, sending and receiving communications signals associated with a telephone local exchange, main exchange, or international exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram illustrating data flow in a process for generating a proximity task-reminder alarm in a mobile computing device in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. User <b>800</b> utilizes mobile computing device <b>810</b> to receive incoming call <b>820</b> from caller <b>830</b>. Mobile computing device <b>810</b> can be any computing device, such as any mobile computing device described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In response to receiving incoming call <b>820</b>, message manager <b>840</b> determines whether to send a dynamic response message to caller <b>830</b>. This determination is made by message manager <b>840</b> based on whether user <b>800</b> will answer incoming call <b>820</b>. The determination as to whether user <b>800</b> will answer incoming call <b>820</b> can be made based on one or more indicators. An indicator includes, but is not limited to, user selection of a voice mail option, mobile computing device is turned off, mobile computing device is set to a meeting or conference setting, an identity of a caller, or user <b>800</b> fails to answer incoming call after a preset number of rings.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A preset number of rings can be a default number of rings or a user selected number of rings. A user selection of a voice mail option can be made by selecting a control to terminate incoming call <b>820</b>, selecting a control to forward incoming call <b>820</b> to voice mail, or selecting a control to automatically route all calls to a voice mail for automatically responding to incoming calls with one or more prerecorded messages. As used herein, voice mail refers to any known or available phone answering service or answering system for sending a prerecorded or pre-prepared response message to a caller when a user does not answer an incoming call. A response message is any recorded message sent to a caller, such as caller <b>830</b>, when user <b>800</b> does not answer an incoming call from the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An identity of caller <b>830</b> is identified by call identifier <b>850</b>. Call identifier <b>850</b> is a component for displaying a name and telephone number of caller <b>830</b>. Any known or available system or service for providing a name and telephone number of caller <b>830</b> may be utilized in conjunction with call identifier <b>850</b> to provide message manager <b>840</b> and/or user <b>800</b> with an identity of caller <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If message manager <b>840</b> determines that a dynamic response message should be sent to caller <b>830</b>, message selection <b>860</b> identifies a category of callers associated with the caller's identity. For example, if call identifier <b>850</b> identifies caller <b>830</b> as wife, then message selection identifies a category of callers for caller <b>830</b> as wife, family, or any other category selected by a user for the caller's identity. User <b>800</b> can also create a category of caller for unknown callers. In such a case, if caller <b>830</b> is an unknown or unidentified caller, user <b>800</b> is presented with a set of responses associated with a category for unknown callers. In the alternative, if a caller is unknown or unidentified, a default message response is sent to caller <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">User <b>800</b> can preset a category of caller for each caller identified in a phone directory or other directory of caller names and/or phone numbers. In addition, a category for unknown callers and/or callers not associated with any other category for callers. Message selection <b>860</b> selects a set of response messages, such as set of response messages <b>870</b> or <b>872</b> from a plurality of response messages stored in a message database, such as message database <b>874</b> and remote message database <b>878</b> based on the identified category of caller <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Message database <b>874</b> is a database for storing a plurality of customized response messages associated with user <b>800</b>. Message database <b>874</b> is any type of database or collection of data associated with mobile computing device <b>810</b>. In this illustrative example, message database <b>874</b> is located on mobile computing device <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Remote message database <b>878</b> is also a message database for storing a plurality of customized response messages associated with user <b>800</b>, like message database <b>874</b>. Remote message database <b>878</b> is any type of database for storing a collection of data that is not located on computer <b>810</b>. In this illustrative example, remote message database is located on server <b>880</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Server <b>880</b> is any type of server, such as server <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Server <b>880</b> can be a server associated with a telephone system or phone service provider that user <b>800</b> is a customer. In addition, server <b>880</b> can be a server on a network, such as network <b>102</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Mobile computing device <b>810</b> accesses remote message database <b>878</b> on server <b>880</b> through a network connection via network device <b>885</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Network device <b>878</b> is any type of network access software known or available for allowing mobile computing device <b>810</b> to access a network. Network device <b>885</b> connects to a network connection, such as network <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The network connection permits access to any type of network, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Message database <b>875</b> and remote message database <b>878</b> contain a plurality of customized message responses. A customized response message is a response message created by user <b>810</b> or selected by user <b>810</b> in association with a particular caller. For example, a customized response message associated with a user's wife could say, &#x201c;Honey, I will call you back ASAP.&#x201d; User <b>800</b> can store this message in message database <b>874</b> or remote message database <b>878</b>. In this illustrative example, only two message databases, <b>874</b> and <b>878</b>, are depicted. However, in accordance with the aspects of the illustrative embodiments, any number of local and/or remote databases for storing a collection or set of message responses can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">User <b>800</b> creates a customized response message and links the message to set of response messages <b>870</b> and/or set of response message <b>872</b>. Set of response messages <b>870</b> and/or set of response messages <b>872</b> are linked to an identified caller, such as user <b>800</b>'s wife. User <b>800</b> can also create additional messages for his wife, such as &#x201c;I'm sorry, I'm in a meeting and will call you back in 30 minutes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;I will call you back in 10 minutes.&#x201d; Thus, when caller <b>830</b> is identified as &#x201c;wife,&#x201d; message selection <b>860</b> will display the set of response messages associated with the category of caller for &#x201c;wife.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Message manager <b>840</b> displays the list of response messages in the set of response messages on a display for user <b>800</b>. User <b>800</b> dynamically selects a response message from the list of response messages displayed. As used herein, a set of response messages includes a single response message, as well as two or more response messages.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this manner, message selection <b>860</b> filters the plurality of response messages based on the caller's identity. Message manager <b>880</b> only presents the set of response messages associated with a category for the caller to user <b>800</b>. User <b>800</b> is then able to select an appropriate dynamic response message from the set of response messages to be sent to caller <b>830</b>. User <b>800</b> can select a particular response message from the list using a menu function, using control buttons on mobile computing device <b>810</b>, using a touch screen interface, or any other known or available means for selecting an option in a list. In addition, the response messages in the set of response messages can be presented to user <b>800</b> as a menu, list of items, graphical icons, or by any other known or available means for presenting options for selection by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In response to receiving a selection of a response message from the list of response messages, message manager <b>840</b> sends selected response message <b>888</b> to caller <b>830</b>. Thus, caller <b>830</b> receiving dynamically selected response message is made aware that the user actually received incoming call <b>820</b>. In addition, selected response message <b>888</b> can provide caller <b>830</b> with additional information, such as where the user is and when the user will return the call. For instance, in the example given above, if the user is in a meeting that will last another 30 minutes when the user's wife calls, the user can select the response message that says, &#x201c;I'm sorry, I'm in a meeting and will call you back in 30 minutes.&#x201d; If user <b>800</b>'s wife calls again twenty minutes later, the user can select the response message that says, &#x201c;I will call you back in 10 minutes.&#x201d; In this example, when user <b>800</b> selects a message containing a time interval, message manager <b>840</b> associates a return call time corresponding to the time interval. In this case, the time interval in the last selected response message is 10 minutes. Thus, message manager associates a return call time of 10 minutes with caller <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alert timer <b>890</b> provides a reminder to user <b>800</b> to return a call received from caller <b>830</b> at the call return time. When the return call time is reached, alert timer <b>894</b> issues a return call alert <b>895</b> to remind user <b>800</b> to call caller <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Return call alert <b>895</b> is presented by mobile computing device <b>800</b> as any type of available alarm or alert type, including, but not limited to a graphic alarm, a sound alarm, a vibration alarm, a flashing visual alarm, or any combination of these alarm types. For example, alert timer <b>894</b> could generate return call alert <b>895</b> by emitting a beeping sound in addition to a flashing LED display presenting a name or category of caller <b>830</b>, phone number, and/or call time for incoming call <b>810</b> on a display of mobile computing device <b>810</b>. In accordance with this exemplary illustration, mobile computing device <b>810</b> presents a name and/or phone number of caller <b>810</b> and a call time of incoming call <b>810</b> to user <b>800</b> via a display when return call alert <b>898</b> is issued by alert timer <b>894</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If user <b>800</b> fails to select a dynamic customized response message, message selection <b>860</b> sends a default response message to caller <b>830</b>. A default response message can be a traditional message stating that user <b>800</b> cannot answer the phone and ask the caller to leave a name and phone number.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an alternative embodiment, if an identity for caller <b>830</b> is not associated with any category of caller, message selection gives the user the option to select a category of caller not associated with the caller. For example, if a user's new business associate is Mr. Jones, when a call identifier identifies a caller as Jones, the user can select a category for &#x201c;business.&#x201d; In response, message selection <b>860</b> will present a list of response messages from set of response messages <b>870</b> associated with business. The user can then select a message from the list to be sent to Mr. Jones. In accordance with another embodiment, when user <b>800</b> selects a category of response messages for &#x201c;business&#x201d; callers to respond to Mr. Jones' call, message manager <b>840</b> automatically creates an association or link for Mr. Jones with the &#x201c;business&#x201d; caller category. Thus, when Mr. Jones calls again, message manager will automatically present the set of responses associated with the category of business callers to user <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, if a name and/or phone number of caller <b>830</b> is not associated with a category of caller, message selection <b>860</b> automatically sends the default message without presenting the user with a list of categories of callers.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, message selection <b>860</b> presents set of response messages <b>870</b> and/or set of response messages <b>872</b> to user <b>800</b> based on a pre-selected activity. A pre-selected activity can include, but is not limited to, a meeting, lunch, or travel. For example, if a user is traveling to an offsite meeting, the user can select a &#x201c;travel&#x201d; activity option. If the user receives an incoming call, message selection presents the user with a set of responses associated with a travel message response set. The response set could include response messages such as &#x201c;I am reroute to the meeting and expect to arrive in 45 minutes,&#x201d; &#x201c;I expect to arrive 20 minutes,&#x201d; and so forth. If the user receives a call from someone at the offsite meeting location when the user is still 20 minutes away, the user can select the &#x201c;I expect to arrive 20 minutes&#x201d; response message.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, the user can select a time-based set of response messages. A time-based set of response messages contains messages that estimate a time duration or time interval until the user will return a call. For example, a set of time-based response messages could include messages such as, &#x201c;I will return your call in one hour,&#x201d; &#x201c;I will return your call in 30 minutes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;I will return your call in 15 minutes.&#x201d; The user selects a time-based response message from a set of time-based response messages. In this manner, a user can dynamically select a message stating the appropriate estimated time duration until a user will be available to return a call. The time duration or time interval included in a selected response message is associated with caller <b>830</b> to form a return call time. When the return call time is reached, alert timer <b>894</b> issues return call alert <b>898</b> to remind user <b>800</b> to call caller <b>830</b> at the time indicated in the selected response message. Thus, user <b>800</b> will not forget to return caller <b>830</b>'s call as indicated in the selected response message sent to caller <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, the user can enter a time of day at which the user will be available to return calls to form a return call time. For example, if the user will be in a meeting until 10:00 a.m., the user can enter the time 10:00 a.m. When incoming call <b>820</b> is received, message manager determines a time of day when incoming call <b>820</b> is received. If incoming call <b>820</b> is received at 9:45 a.m., message manager determines an estimated time difference between the time incoming call <b>820</b> is received and return call time of 10:00 a.m. In this example, the estimated return call time is 15 minutes. Message selection <b>860</b> selects set of messages <b>870</b> associated with an estimated return call time. A return call time is an estimated time when a user will return missed calls, such as incoming call <b>810</b>. Each response message in set of response messages <b>870</b> based on a return call time states different time duration until the user will return a phone call. Thus, the messages in the set of response messages state, for example, &#x201c;I will call back in 15 minutes,&#x201d; I will call back in 10 minutes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;I will call back in 5 minutes.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Message selection <b>860</b> then selects the particular response message in set of messages <b>870</b> that indicates the user will return the call in 15 minutes. Thus, in this illustrative example, message selection <b>860</b> identifies a response message in the set of response messages that includes a time duration corresponding to an estimated time difference between a time the call is received and the return call time. Message manager dynamically sends the identified response message to the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the example provided above, the return call time was set to 10:00 a.m. Thus, when the return call time of 10:00 a.m. is reached, alert timer <b>894</b> issues return call alert <b>898</b> to user <b>800</b>. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment, return call alert <b>898</b> provides a list of all missed calls. The list of missed calls can include a name, category of caller, phone number, and/or call time for each missed call.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, a user is presented with a first menu of categories corresponding to a caller's identity. For example, a first menu of categories includes family, friends, business, and other. A user selects a category, such as family. After selecting a category, the user is presented with a second menu of categories corresponding to a time and/or activity. For example, after selecting family, the user is presented with a list of categories such as meeting, travel, and time. If the user selects time, the user is presented with a list of response messages for family members that include estimated times until the user can return the call. The user can then select a response message for &#x201c;wife&#x201d; that indicates the call will be returned in 15 minutes. In this example, the selected message says, &#x201c;Honey, I will call you back in 15 minutes.&#x201d; If the user had selected the meeting category, the user could have selected a different customized message for the user's wife, such as &#x201c;Honey, I am in a meeting and will call you back as soon as I can.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an interface for a mobile computing device when an incoming phone call triggers a dynamic voice response message list function in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Message category <b>900</b> displays a list of categories <b>910</b> for callers, such as wife, friend, business, and other. A user can select a category by using a scroll display wheel <b>920</b> to scroll through the list. In accordance with this illustrative embodiment, a user can select a particular category by depressing the scroll wheel when the desired category is indicated by the scroll wheel display indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, a user can select a particular category of callers to view a list of response messages associated with the selected category by using control buttons <b>930</b>-<b>938</b>. Control buttons <b>930</b>-<b>936</b> are any type of keys, such as soft keys, for scrolling through a list. In addition, a user can select a category of callers by utilizing a joy stick, such as joy stick control <b>938</b>. In accordance with the aspects of the illustrative embodiments, a user can utilize any known or available user interface to select a category of callers and/or select a particular response message from a list of response messages presented to the user by a mobile computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, a category of caller is automatically selected by a mobile computing device message manager based on a name and/or phone number of the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In accordance with an illustrative example, when an incoming call is received, a user can affirmatively decline to send a customized response message to the caller. A user can affirmatively indicate a selection to not send a customized response message by selecting a decline choice on a menu of response message options. In addition, a user can indicate a decline choice by selecting a default response message. Thus, in response to receiving an indicator indicating a user affirmatively declines to send a customized response message to a caller, the process of the illustrative embodiments sends a default response message to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In accordance with another illustrative embodiment, if a user fails to select a customized response message from the list of response messages presented to the user in response to an incoming call, a default message is sent to the caller. In this example, the default message is sent if the user fails to select a customized response message after a predetermined period of time has passed since the list of customized response messages was presented to the user. In an alternative embodiment, the default message will be sent in response to the user failing to select a customized response message from the list of response messages after a predetermined number of rings.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart outlining an operation of an exemplary embodiment when a user dynamically selects a customizable voice response message to responds to a phone call in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is implemented in a message application, such as message manager <b>840</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The process receives a call (step <b>1010</b>). The process determines if a customized response message is to be sent (step <b>1015</b>). This determination is made based on indicator indicating that the user will not answer the phone, the phone is turned off, the user selects to route the call to voice mail, or any other indicator indicating that a user will not answer the incoming call.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the process determines that a customized response message is to be sent, the process determines if the caller is a known caller name and/or phone number (step <b>1020</b>). If the caller is not known, the process determines if a category for unknown callers is available (step <b>1025</b>). If a category for unknown caller is not available, the process sends a default message to the unknown caller (step <b>1030</b>) with the process terminating thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Returning now to step <b>1025</b>, if a category of unknown callers is available, the process displays the set of response messages for the category of unknown callers (step <b>1050</b>). The process then determines if a selection of a message response is received from user (step <b>1060</b>). If a selection of a message response is not received after a predetermined period of time or a predetermined number of rings, the process sends a default message (step <b>1030</b>) with the process terminating thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Returning now to step <b>1060</b>, if the process receives a selection of a response message from the set of response messages associated with unknown callers, the process sends the selected response message to the caller (step <b>1070</b>) with the process terminating thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Returning now to step <b>1020</b>, if the caller is a known or identified caller name and/or caller phone number, the process determines a category for the caller based on the caller's identity (step <b>1040</b>). The process then displays a set of response messages to the user that is associated with the category of caller (step <b>1050</b>). The process determines if a user selection of a response message from the set of response messages is received (step <b>1060</b>). If a user selection of a response message is not received, a default message is sent to the caller (step <b>1030</b>) with the process terminating thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Returning now to step <b>1060</b>, if a selected response message is received from the user, the process sends the selected response message to the caller (step <b>1070</b>) with the process terminating thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Returning now to step <b>1015</b>, if the process determines that a customized message is not to be sent the process sends a default message to the caller (step <b>1030</b>) with the process terminating thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In accordance with another embodiment, if a category of unknown caller's is not available, the user is presented with a list of available categories of callers and given the opportunity to select an appropriate category for the unknown or unidentified caller.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Thus, the illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method, apparatus, and computer program product for dynamically selecting a voice response message in response to a phone call. The aspects of the illustrative embodiments enable a caller to receive a custom message that provides a caller with an acknowledgement that the user actually is aware of the call. In addition, the dynamic response messages enable a user to provide a caller with additional information regarding the reason the user is unable to answer a call, rather than simply providing a static message that simply says leave a message and I will call you back. Moreover, the illustrative embodiments permit a user to filter possible response message choices based on a caller's identity, an activity, an estimated time until a user can return a phone call, and/or any other category or criteria for filtering message responses for selection by a user.</p>
