<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to electronic devices, and, more particularly, to a vertical conduction electronic power device and corresponding method.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">More particularly, the present invention relates to a vertical conduction electronic power device being integrated on a semiconductor substrate, comprising gate, source and drain areas, realized in an epitaxial layer on the semiconductor substrate and comprising gate, source and drain lines realized by a first metallization as well as gate, source and drain terminals determined by a second metallization, with the drain line being connected to a sinker structure realized in the epitaxial layer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates particularly, but not exclusively, to a MOS vertical conduction power device and the following description is made with reference to this field of application for convenience of illustration only.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As it is well known in recent years the development of power devices has been considerably accelerated under the pressure of two different factors: the increase in the functions which can be integrated in a single chip or die wherein the power device is realized; and the increasing miniaturization of electronic devices for applications on portable devices such as personal computers, mobile phones and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In fact, miniaturization has been the motivation of many mass products and presently around 50% of electronic systems can be branded as &#x201c;portable&#x201d; and this percentage will certainly and drastically increase in next years. Miniaturization requirements obviously impact on the size and weight of these electronic devices. In particular, the highest ratio between the chip or die size and the footprint thereof moved from around 0.3 in the early nineties to around 0.8 at the end of the century.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On another hand, the continuous developments in the microprocessor technology have also led to an increase in the power device operating frequency thus increasing the speed and field of application thereof. To keep or even increase the power of electronic power devices at high operating frequencies there is the need to increase the current provided to the devices and thus the density of the power distributed on the printed circuit board whereon they are assembled. As a consequence, there is the need to provide electronic power devices with lesser and lesser both static and dynamic power losses to improve the efficiency thereof at the required frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this context it may be very important to reduce or remove also the printed circuit board parasitic components that can add losses to the whole electronic system. In the specific case of vertical conduction power devices better performance can be obtained by reducing the device output resistance as well as the parasitic capacitances and the thermal resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In fact, as it is well known, a Q-factor (FFOM) to evaluate the efficiency of a vertical conduction electronic power device is the product of the output resistance (Ron) and the device footprint. Moreover, for high frequency applications the dynamic feature represented by an electric charge value to be provided to the conduction terminal (Gate change) to turn the device on or off is important. The lower the value of the product of the three indicated factors (Ron, Footprint, Gate change), the more efficient the device is.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also known that vertical conduction electronic power devices are usually assembled on printed circuit boards through surface assembly methods and it is thus preferable that they have all conduction terminals on a same plane. In this perspective, methods to realize vertical conduction devices suitable to draw all conduction terminals on a same surface plane have been developed, without penalizing the three above-mentioned Q-factors and particularly the output resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first approach is represented by a power device realized by a conveniently shaped metal container or frame suitable to draw at the same level in an upper surface, the device conduction terminal (drain) located on a lower surface. An embodiment thereof is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described in the document MOSFET BGA design&#x2014;Fairchild Semiconductor&#x2014;August 2002. In this document, a method is described for realizing a power device comprising an assembly step wherein the device integrated on the semiconductor (die) is welded inside a frame through conventional so-called die attach techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although somewhat advantageous under several aspects, the approach has the drawback that the leveling of conduction terminals (source, gate) located on the device upper surface with the conduction terminal (drain) located on the opposite surface, and drawn on this surface, is ensured in the absence of the frame mechanical tolerances, of the semiconductor chip thickness as well as of the thickness of the welding compound used for the die attach technique. Therefore this approach may not be sufficiently reliable for the realization of large-scale-efficiency vertical conduction power devices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A second known approach, commonly indicated with the term WLCSP (Wafer Level Chip Scale Package), provides for the complete removal of the metal frame by realizing a package immediately on a silicon chip, whereon a plurality of dies are integrated, before splitting the single dies. In the realization of vertical conduction devices having overlapped dies, conduction terminals are drawn on a same device surface. This approach provides the realization of deep sinkers, along the die outer perimeter, crossing the whole silicon chip thickness, which are filled with a conductive material such as a metal (for example gold).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also this second known approach, although advantageous under several aspects, has the drawback that the current flow, coming from the terminal located in the die lower surface, can be collected only along the outer perimeter of the device upper surface. This implies that the resistive contribution due to the current flow path on the substrate is considerable. Moreover, the provided realization method is very complex and thus rarely used.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also known to realize a vertical conduction power device through the so-called Flip Chip BGA (Ball Grid Array) technique providing that &#x201c;bumps&#x201d;, made of tin-based welding alloys, are positioned on the chip conduction pads, to allow the same to be directly connected on the board (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). This technique requires that a wettable metal is arranged on the pads.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Flip Chip BGA technique is used in U.S. patent application no. US 2001/0045635 by Kinzer wherein the device drain is brought to the surface by deep and heavily-doped sinkers or sinkers filled with a conductive layer (metal or polysilicon) creating conductive paths between the substrate and the metallization on the device surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Sinkers are located along the device perimeter and the current flow from the die centre towards the perimeter only relies on the conductive substrate made of heavily-doped silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">This third known approach has however the drawback that sinkers are realized along the device perimeter and the substrate, mainly when large-sized, gives a considerable resistive contribution which, in the case of application to low-voltage electronic power devices (20, 50 Volt), has unacceptable values. Moreover in this known approach the contact area with the printed circuit board is reduced, since it is limited to the bumps.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The technical shortcoming underlying the present invention is to provide a vertical conduction electronic power device having a reduced output resistance, a low thermal resistance, a reduced size and a reduced gate change value, this device having on a same surface all conduction terminals and having such structural and functional features as to allow the drawbacks mentioned with reference to the prior art to be overcome. The present invention realizes all conduction terminals on a same device surface by a plurality of modules having an independent structure and a closed contour.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One aspect of the invention is directed to a vertical conduction electronic power device comprising a semiconductor substrate, an epitaxial layer on the semiconductor substrate, and respective gate, source and drain areas in the epitaxial layer. A first metallization level may be adjacent the epitaxial layer defining respective gate, source and drain metallizations. A second metallization level may be adjacent the first metallization level defining respective gate, source and drain terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The respective gate, source and drain areas are configured as a set of modular areas extending parallel to each other. Each modular area may have a rectangular elongate source area perimetrically surrounded by a narrow gate area, and separated from each other by first parallel regions of the drain area extending parallel and connected at opposite ends thereof to a second closed region of the drain area forming a device outer peripheral edge. A sinker structure may extend perpendicularly to the semiconductor substrate, and may comprise a grid of sinkers located below both the first parallel regions and the second closed regions of the drain area to provide a conductive channel for current coming from the source area and directed towards the drain area across the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method for forming a vertical conduction electronic power device as defined above.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to the figures, and particularly to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a vertical conduction electronic power device, particularly a MOS transistor, realized according to the present invention, is globally and schematically indicated with D. The present invention will be described hereafter with reference to the realization of vertical conduction MOS power devices, but it can be advantageously applied to the realization of any vertical conduction power device such as for example BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor), diodes, IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) or power MOS both with planar structure and trench-gate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The process steps and structures described hereafter do not form a complete process flow for producing integrated circuits. In fact, the present invention can be implemented together with the integrated circuit realization techniques presently used in this field, and only those realization steps being necessary to understand the invention will be described hereafter. Figures showing cross sections of portions of a device are not drawn to scale, but they are drawn to show the main features.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The device D, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is configured as a set of modular areas <b>100</b> being approached to each other and extending parallel to each other. More particularly, the device D comprises a plurality of rectangular elongate source areas <b>25</b>, each surrounded by a narrow gate area <b>20</b> and delimited by a closed gate contour <b>23</b>, as better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">These source areas <b>25</b>, and thus gate areas <b>20</b>, extend parallel to each other and they are mutually separated by a first longitudinally-extending region <b>30</b><i>a</i>, with drain area <b>30</b>. Moreover, as particularly emphasized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the device D has all along an outer perimeter P, a second closed region <b>30</b><i>b</i>, with a drain area <b>30</b>, which substantially configures an outer edge.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, showing portions of the device D according to a section A-A&#x2032; and a section B-B&#x2032; respectively, the device D is realized on a semiconductor material substrate <b>10</b>, while the source <b>25</b>, gate <b>20</b> and drain <b>30</b> areas are realized in an epitaxial layer <b>40</b> arranged on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the epitaxial layer <b>40</b> in correspondence with the drain areas <b>30</b>, both below the first regions <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second closed region <b>30</b><i>b</i>, the device D comprises a sinker structure <b>45</b>, created by realizing a quite dense grid of sinkers S. Advantageously a portion of this sinker structure <b>45</b> underlying two first adjacent regions <b>30</b><i>a </i>and corresponding portions of second peripheral regions <b>30</b><i>b</i>, is arranged perimetrically to each modular area <b>100</b> defining the device D.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Substantially, the device D is configured as a set of modular areas <b>100</b> extending parallel to each other, each having a rectangular elongate source area <b>25</b> surrounded by a narrow gate area <b>20</b>, delimited by a closed contour <b>23</b>, and separated from each other by regions <b>30</b><i>a </i>with the drain area <b>30</b> extending parallel and connected at the opposite ends thereof to a second closed region <b>30</b><i>b </i>with the drain area <b>30</b> forming a device outer peripheral edge; as well as a sinker structure <b>45</b> extending perpendicularly to the substrate and formed by a grid of sinkers S located below both the first parallel regions <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second closed region <b>30</b><i>b </i>with the drain area <b>30</b> to favor a conductive channel for a current coming from the source area <b>25</b> and directed towards the drain area <b>30</b> across the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Advantageously, as emphasized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, each sinker S is deeper than the thickness of the epitaxial layer <b>40</b> and such as to penetrate at least partially the substrate <b>10</b>. Each sinker S thus allows a conductive channel to be realized for the current in the substrate <b>10</b>, coming from the source area <b>25</b> and directed towards the drain area <b>30</b> of each modular area <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As emphasized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>, each sinker S has, near the walls, a layer <b>47</b> of enriched material allowing the contact resistance of the sinker S to be improved. Moreover a metal <b>49</b>, such as for example a tungsten plug, is deposited all along the useful depth as emphasized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, respective gate metallization or metal strips <b>21</b>, realized by sputtering, are provided on each gate area <b>20</b> to allow the electrical connection thereof. Similarly, further metallization or metal strips <b>26</b> and <b>31</b> are provided on each source <b>25</b> and drain <b>30</b> area respectively, in the latter case both on the first regions <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second regions <b>30</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A dielectric layer <b>50</b>, arranged on the whole upper surface of the device D, has such a thickness as to completely cover metallization strips <b>21</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>31</b>. Conveniently, the dielectric layer <b>50</b> has a plurality of gate <b>22</b>, source <b>27</b> and drain <b>32</b> via contacts, the latter being visible only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, respectively obtained through openings realized by photolithography on the first metallization or metal level <b>21</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>31</b> and thus on the gate <b>20</b>, source <b>25</b> and drain <b>30</b> areas, so as to allow an electric communication. Particularly, in each rectangular elongate modular area <b>100</b>, source vias <b>27</b> occupy a substantially central portion, gate vias <b>22</b> occupy a portion arranged laterally and outside source vias <b>27</b>, and drain vias <b>32</b> occupy the two transverse opposite ends of each modular area <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Advantageously, the device D has on the dielectric layer <b>50</b> a source terminal or electrode or pad <b>65</b>, a gate pad <b>60</b> and a pair of drain pads <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b</i>, the same, with a substantially rectangular structure, being arranged parallel to each other and transversely to the device D and thus also to each modular area <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, according to a preferred embodiment, each pad of the pair of drain pads <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>is arranged near the transverse ends of the outer perimeter P of the device D, and the source <b>65</b> and gate <b>60</b> pads are arranged inside the pair of drain pads <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>and parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Conveniently, the source <b>65</b>, gate <b>60</b> pads and the pair of drain pads <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>are obtained through a photolithography on a second metallization realized on the whole dielectric layer <b>50</b> of the device D. The second metallization being obtained by sputtering by using some wettable material from the traditional welding compounds used in electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The source <b>65</b>, and gate <b>60</b> pads and the pair of drain pads <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>are realized on the gate <b>22</b>, source <b>27</b> and drain <b>32</b> vias, on a second metallization level, allowing the electric connection. In particular, the pair of drain pads <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b</i>, arranged on drain vias <b>32</b>, allows the current in the substrate <b>10</b> coming from the source area <b>25</b> and directed towards the drain area <b>30</b> for each modular area <b>100</b> to be brought to the surface. The current is thus caught not only by the sinker structure <b>45</b> on the outer perimeter P of the device D below the second region <b>30</b><i>b</i>, but also by the sinker structure <b>45</b> in each first region <b>30</b><i>a </i>interposed between a modular area <b>100</b> and the other on the whole longitudinal length of the device D. The presence of the sinker structure <b>45</b> thus allows the functionality and efficiency of the device D to be considerably improved minimizing the resistive contribution due to the reduced path of the current because of the sinker structure <b>45</b> itself in each modular area <b>100</b>. Moreover, the presence of the sinker structure <b>45</b> and of the drain vias <b>32</b> in correspondence with the outer perimeter P allows an excellent operation of the device D to be ensured during the interdiction step.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To complete the so-obtained device D, the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> can be conveniently reduced and the device D can have a metal bottom, not shown in the figures since it is conventional. It is worth noting that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the source <b>27</b> and drain <b>32</b> vias, but not gate vias <b>22</b> only for clarity of explanation. Moreover, the device D is shown by considering the surface dielectric layer <b>50</b> to be transparent, to show the details of underlying layers.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The invention also relates to a realization method of a vertical conduction electronic power device and it is shown hereafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 11</figref>. The realized power device is the one represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the same reference numerals will be used hereafter to indicate corresponding parts.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The realization method according to the invention provides the following steps: growing an epitaxial layer <b>40</b> on a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>; and realizing respective gate <b>20</b>, source <b>25</b> and drain <b>30</b> areas in that epitaxial layer <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Advantageously, the realization steps of the drain <b>30</b>, gate <b>20</b> and source <b>25</b> areas comply with a layout shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> according to which the device D is configured as a set of modular areas <b>100</b> being adjacent to each other and extending parallelly. More particularly, the device D comprises a plurality of rectangular source areas <b>25</b>, each surrounded by a narrow gate area <b>20</b>, delimited by a gate contour <b>23</b>, and each separated from one another by a first longitudinally-extending region <b>30</b><i>a</i>, with the drain area <b>30</b>. Moreover the device D has all along an outer perimeter P, a second closed region <b>30</b><i>b</i>, with the drain area <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The method further provides the steps of: depositing a thin layer of dielectric material <b>41</b>, for example a 0.5 um-thick oxide, on the epitaxial layer <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, and eventually performing a dielectric thickening thermal process; opening the contacts in correspondence with the body, gate and source areas; and realizing through photolithography, in correspondence with the drain area <b>30</b>, and also in correspondence with the first regions <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second region <b>30</b><i>b</i>, a sinker structure <b>45</b> realizing a quite dense grid of sinkers S being parallel to each other and structurally independent.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Advantageously, the photolithographic step realizes each sinker S of the sinker structure <b>45</b> with a higher depth than the thickness of the epitaxial layer <b>40</b> and such as to penetrate at least partially the substrate <b>10</b>. In a preferred embodiment, each sinker S is deeper than (3-10) um and the width thereof ranges between 0.6 and 1 um.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The realization method according to the invention also provides the steps of: performing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>, an enrichment implant on the sinker structure <b>45</b> allowing the contact resistance to be improved. Preferably the enrichment implant occurs according to the following features 1E15P/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 30 KeV and it is performed with a tilt angle varying from +7&#xb0; to &#x2212;7&#xb0; to allow both side walls of each sinker S to be implanted for the whole depth improving the implant efficiency; eventually performing an annealing process; and depositing a first metal barrier, not emphasized in the figures, for example by an alloy of Ti/TiN, and eventually performing a silicidation, as for example the device subjected for 30 sec. at 80&#xb0; C. The method may further include filling all the previously opened contacts and the sinkers S of the sinker structure <b>45</b> for the whole depth thereof with a conductive material <b>49</b>, particularly a metal one, such as for example a 0.3-0.7 um-thick tungsten plug (W-plug); performing an etch back step of the conductive material <b>49</b>; depositing a second metal barrier layer preferably by for example of 0.1 um of Ti, not shown in the figures; realizing by sputtering a first metallization, preferably by using AlSiCu with a thickness from 0.5 um to 3 um; and realizing through photolithography on the first metallization and on the metal barrier layer convenient gate <b>21</b>, source <b>26</b> and drain <b>31</b> metallizations in each modular area <b>100</b> which, overlapping respective gate <b>20</b>, source <b>25</b> and drain <b>30</b> areas, define convenient closed contour structures. The method may further include performing an alloy thermal process; depositing a dielectric layer <b>50</b> with such a thickness as to completely overhang gate <b>20</b>, source <b>25</b> and drain <b>30</b> metallizations, for example by using 1 um of oxide; realizing through a photolithographic step on the dielectric layer <b>50</b> a plurality of contact vias for the source <b>27</b>, gate <b>22</b> and drain <b>32</b> regions to open connection vias with the gate <b>20</b>, source <b>25</b> and drain <b>30</b> metallizations.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Advantageously, the source <b>27</b>, gate <b>22</b> and drain <b>32</b> vias will occupy transverse areas of each modular area <b>100</b>. In particular, the source <b>27</b> vias will occupy a substantially central area of each modular area <b>100</b>, gate <b>22</b> vias will occupy a portion arranged laterally to source vias <b>27</b> and drain vias <b>32</b> will occupy the two transverse ends of each modular area <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The realization method thus provides to continue with the following: performing a second metallization by sputtering, using a material being conveniently wettable by traditional welding compounds, preferably Ti/Ni/Au or Ti/NiAg; performing a photolithographic step of the second metallization defining on the source <b>27</b>, gate <b>22</b> and drain <b>32</b> vias corresponding source <b>65</b>, gate <b>60</b> electrodes or pads and a pair of drain electrodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b</i>, which will be arranged transversely to each modular area <b>100</b>; traditionally completing the device D by eventually realizing a reduction of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> and eventually inserting a metal bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The realization method according to the invention allows a vertical conduction power device D to be realized having the three conduction terminals brought on the same device surface, the arrangement being obtained by a synergy between the device layout and the process sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is also possible to envisage alternative embodiments of the vertical conduction power device according to the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> a first alternative embodiment emphasizes a possible approach for a second embodiment of the sinker structure <b>45</b>. Preferably in this approach the sinker structure <b>45</b> has a plurality of connection ducts <b>95</b> between sinkers S being plan parallely arranged, allowing the flowing current distribution, coming from the source area and directed towards the drain area. The plurality of ducts <b>95</b> can be realized by a convenient mask during the photolithographic step.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A further embodiment of the vertical conduction power device D provides, in correspondence with the drain area, a single trench <b>96</b>, realized as an alternative to single sinkers S of the sinker structure <b>45</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. The trench <b>96</b> occupies the whole available area and it is filled by the high conductivity material <b>49</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> allowing the current to flow from the source to the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The main advantage of the vertical conduction power device is to bring on a same surface the source, gate electrodes and the drain electrode by a particular device layout arrangement. A further advantage of the device is to obtain with the particular layout arrangement a plurality of juxtaposed structurally-independent modules, each one having a source, gate metallization and a drain metallization realized in correspondence with the closed contour.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The presence of the sinker structure is also advantageous, which, realized in correspondence with the drain area, is arranged on the perimeter of each modular area and on the device outer edge, thus ensuring an excellent device operation in the interdiction step.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A further advantage of the device is that the sinker structure created by realizing a quite dense grid of sinkers without excessively penalizing the active area minimizes the resistive contribution due to the current path on the substrate and it thus reduces the device output resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another advantage of the so-realized device is that the reduced size of each sinker facilitates and simplifies the filling thereof with a high conductivity metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The size of contact terminals is also advantageous for the device, in fact they have a contact area with the board being much larger than the size of previous devices and this generates significant advantages on the resistive contribution.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">From experimental tests carried out by the Applicant it was possible to verify that the so-obtained device, although the presence of the sinker structure limits the possibility to exploit the whole semiconductor layer, has a gain on the resistive contributions of the drain terminal resulting in an advantage of the device in the dynamic operation thereof, as it can be seen in the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">From experimental tests carried out by the Applicant it is possible to verify that the device has an extremely reduced product between the output resistance, the Gate change and the Footprint, as it can be seen from the comparison diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Last but not least, the device has a simple, efficient and reduced-cost process sequence.</p>
