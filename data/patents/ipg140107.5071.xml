<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a wireless communication system and more particularly to a method of handover in a wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are hard handover (HHO) and soft handover in methods of handover according to related art. And there are Macro Diversity Handover (MDHO) and Fast Base Station Switching (FBSS) in soft handover. However, soft handover has large overhead. Thus, technology about hard handover is studied.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates procedure of hard handover according to related art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a serving base station (SBS) is what a mobile station is served by and a target base station (TBS) is what a mobile station is going to perform a handover to.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In hard handover according to related art, a mobile station previously synchronizes with a target base station to reduce communication interruption time during hard handover.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a mobile station transmits a mobile station handover request (MOB_MSHO-REQ) message to a serving base station S<b>110</b>. Then, a serving base station transmits a handover request (HO-REQ) message to a target base station S<b>120</b>, and receives a handover response (HO_RSP) message S<b>130</b>. And, a serving base station transmits a handover response (MOB_BSHO_RSP) message to a mobile station as a response of the MOB_MSHO-REQ message of a mobile station S<b>140</b>. A mobile station acquires information of a target base station through the MOB_BSHO_RSP message, and prepares a previous procedure for handover, and transmits a handover indicate (MOB_HO_IND) message to a serving base station.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A base station changes communication setting according to a target base station, and waits for a Fast_Ranging_IE (information element) until action time. The Fast_Ranging_IE includes information for ranging process between a mobile station and a target base station. Action time is a time at which a target base station transmits the Fast_Ranging_IE to a mobile station.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">After receiving the Fast_Ranging_IE, a mobile station performs an authentication and reopens communication.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A mobile station, a serving base station and a target base station buffer data to prevent loss of data during communication interruption, transmits and receiver the buffed data and continue communication. A mobile station starts buffering from transmitting the MOB_MSHO-REQ message, and a serving base station starts buffering from receiving the MOB_MSHO-REQ message.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Recently, technologies about femto cell for supporting indoor or shadow area which macro cell cannot support are being defined. A femto cell base station is a micromini and low power indoor base station. Femto cell is a coverage of a femto cell base station and similar concept with pico cell. Femto cell is evolved more than pico cell. A femto cell base station is a mini cellular base station connected to a broadband router and connects data to backbone network of a mobile communication company trough Digital Subscriber Line (DSL).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">So, appearance of a femto cell base station makes method of handover to a femto cell base station necessary.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As previously stated above, according to the related art, a serving base station informs a mobile station of information of neighbor base stations which are candidates for handover. But, because there are too many femto cell base stations, overhead increases if a serving base station informs a mobile station of information of neighbor femto cell base stations. And a mobile station can be denied to access a femto cell base station according to an access type of the femto cell base station. Accordingly, handover method according to related art has a problem that a serving base station cannot efficiently inform a mobile station of information of femto cell base stations which are candidates for handover.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present invention is to provide an efficient method of handover.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An object of the present invention is to provide a method of handover, which can reduce overhead.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First, a wireless communication system with femto cell base stations will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a wireless communication system with femto cell base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a wireless communication system with femto cell base stations comprises a femto cell base station <b>210</b>, a macro base station <b>220</b>, a femto network gateway (FNG) <b>230</b>, an access service network (ASN) <b>240</b> and a connectivity service network (CSN) <b>250</b>. A macro base station <b>220</b> is a general base station of a previous wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A femto cell base station <b>210</b> is a mini version of a macro base station and performs most functions of a macro base station. A femto cell base station <b>210</b> connects directly to a transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) network, operates independently like a macro base station <b>220</b>. Coverage of a femto cell base station is about 0.1&#x2dc;30 m and a femto cell base station can accepts 10&#x2dc;20 mobile stations. Frequency used by a femto cell base station <b>210</b> can use same or different from that used by a macro base station <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A femto cell base station <b>210</b> connects to a macro base station <b>220</b> through R<b>1</b> interface so to receive downlink channel from a macro base station <b>220</b> and transmit control signal to a macro base station <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A femto cell base station <b>210</b> can cover indoor or shadow area which a macro base station cannot cover and support high data rate transmission. A femto cell base station <b>210</b> can be established as overlay in macro cell area or as non-overlay in area which a macro base station does not cover.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">There are two types of a femto cell base station <b>210</b>. One type is a closed subscriber group (CSG) femto cell base station and another type is an open subscriber group (OSG) femto cell base station. A CSG femto cell base station groups mobile stations which is accessible to the CSG femto cell base station, grants the mobile stations CSG identification (ID) and allow the only mobile stations granted CSG ID to access to the CSG femto cell base station. An OSG femto cell base station is a base station which all mobile station can access.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A FNG <b>230</b> controls a femto cell base station <b>210</b> and connects to an ASN <b>240</b> and a CSN <b>250</b> through Rx and Ry interface respectively. A femto cell base station <b>210</b> can be served by a CSN <b>250</b> through a FNG <b>230</b>. A mobile station connected to a femto cell base station <b>210</b> can be authenticated by a FNG <b>230</b> or a CSN <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A CSN <b>250</b> provides a mobile station authentication, charging function and an application service like internet and VoIP. And an ASN <b>240</b> controls a macro base station <b>220</b> and manages connection of a macro base station <b>220</b> and a CSN <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, a method of handover according to embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to FIGS. A handover initiated by a mobile station will be described in first embodiment of the present invention and a handover initiated by a serving base station will be described in first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A method of handover according to first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of handover according to first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates process which objects of a wireless communication system perform in a method of handover according to first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if a mobile station predicts handover to a femto cell base station, it transmits a control message including at least one among information of a femtocell base station detected through initial scanning and location information of the mobile station to a serving base station S<b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A mobile station predicts handover to a femto cell base station with various criterions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Signal strength of a femto cell base station or approach to a femto cell can be criterions to predict handover. For example, a mobile station receives downlink signal of a femto cell base station when move to femto cell, and predicts handover if strength of received signal from a femto cell base station is over threshold. At this time, trigger condition like a type of femto cell base station can be given. For example, a mobile station does not predict handover if a femto cell base station is a CSG femto cell base station, and a mobile station predicts handover if a femto cell base station is a OSG femto cell base station.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If a mobile station predicts handover to a femto cell base station, it transmits a control message including information of a femtocell base station detected, location information of the mobile station or all of them to a serving base station.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates processes which each object performs in a method of handover according to first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a mobile station detects a neighbor femto cell base station, FM <b>7</b> and transmits a control message including information of FM <b>7</b> to a serving base station. Then, a serving base station can estimate a location of FM <b>7</b> as knowing topology information of femto cell base stations which are in coverage of a serving base station. So, a serving base station transmits information needed for scanning to a mobile station, wherein the information includes system information and frequency information of FM<b>7</b>, FM<b>2</b> and FM <b>1</b> which exist around a mobile station and allow a mobile station to access. Then, a mobile station scans only femto cell base stations whose information is received from a serving base station.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a handover process in case that a mobile station transmits a control message including information of detected femto cell base station. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a handover process in case that a mobile station transmits a control message including information of location of a mobile station.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In case that a mobile station transmits a control message including information of detected femto cell base station, a mobile station performs initial scanning for searching a femto cell base station. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, if a mobile station predict handover to a femto cell base station, a mobile station requests initial scanning interval to a serving base station S<b>510</b>. When communicating with a serving base station by specific frequency, a mobile station cannot detect femto cell base stations which use different frequency from the specific frequency. So, a mobile station has to scan different frequency from the specific frequency, however a mobile station can not communicate with a serving base station during scanning the different frequency. So, a mobile station scans during period allowed by a serving base station. The period allowed is the initial scanning interval.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After receiving request of a mobile station, a base station assigns the initial scanning interval to a mobile station S<b>520</b>. At this time, if a serving base station knows a location of a mobile station, a serving base station can transmits a list of neighbor femto cell base stations and information of frequency used by the neighbor femto cell base stations to a mobile station. But, generally a serving base station does not know a location of a mobile station. The initial scanning interval is generally shorter than normal scanning interval.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A mobile station scan femto cell base stations during the initial scanning interval and transmits a control message including information of detected femto cell base station to a serving base station S<b>530</b>. When performing initial scanning, a mobile station can scan same or different frequency band from frequency band used in communication with a serving base station.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a case that a mobile station scans different frequency band from frequency band used in communication with a serving base station during initial scanning. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when communicating with a serving base station by frequency band central frequency of which is f<b>1</b>, a mobile station initially scans frequency band whose central frequency is f<b>2</b>, detects femto cell base station <b>2</b> and transmits a control message including information of femto cell base station <b>2</b> to a serving base station. Then, a serving base station searches femto cell base station <b>3</b> which uses frequency band whose central frequency is f<b>3</b> and femto cell base station <b>4</b> which uses frequency band whose central frequency is f<b>4</b>. And a serving base station informs a mobile station of information of femto cell base station <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Or during initial scanning, a mobile station can scan same frequency band as frequency band used in communication with a serving base station. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in case that femto cell base station <b>2</b> use frequency band whose central frequency is f<b>1</b>, a mobile station initially scans frequency band whose central frequency is f<b>1</b>, detects femto cell base station <b>2</b> and transmits a control message including information of femto cell base station <b>2</b> to a serving base station. Then, a serving base station searches femto cell base station <b>3</b> which uses frequency band whose central frequency is f<b>3</b> and femto cell base station <b>4</b> which uses frequency band whose central frequency is f<b>4</b>. And a serving base station informs a mobile station of information of femto cell base station <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The information of femto cell base station <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> includes system information.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Information of a detected femto cell base station can include base station ID of the detected femto cell base station, result of channel estimation and information of frequency used by a detected femto cell base station. At this time, a control message can include location information of a mobile station.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In case that a mobile station transmits a control message which includes not information of a detected base station but location information of a mobile station, a mobile station need not perform initial scanning. So, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a mobile station does not perform steps of requesting initial scanning interval and receiving initial scanning interval. If a mobile station predicts handover to a femto cell base station, a mobile station transmits a control message including location information of a mobile station to a serving base station S<b>610</b>. Then, a serving base station makes a list of neighbor femto cell base stations based on the location information of a mobile station and requests scanning as transmitting information of the neighbor femto cell base stations to a mobile station S<b>620</b>. Information of the neighbor femto cell base stations can include base station ID, central frequency and system information.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a mobile station receives information of neighbor femtocell base stations to which the mobile station is accessible from a base station S<b>320</b>. At this time, a base station can request a mobile station to scan the neighbor femtocell base stations and assign scanning interval.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A serving base station makes a list of neighbor femto cell base stations to which the mobile station is accessible based on information of detected femto cell base station or location information of a mobile station included in a control message. That is, in case that a serving base station makes a list based on information of detected femto cell base station, a serving base station makes a list of femto cell base stations which exist around the detected femtocell base station. In case that a serving base station makes a list based on location information of a mobile station, a serving base station makes a list of femto cell base stations which exist around the mobile station.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A mobile station can access to OSG femto cell base stations and CSG femto cell base stations which allow the mobile station to access. That is, a mobile station can handover only neighbor femto cell base stations which allow the mobile station to access.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When making a list of neighbor femto cell base stations to which the mobile station is accessible, a serving base station can use information which a serving base station already know or information which is received from a FNG through a backbone network.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a serving base station makes a list of neighbor femto cell base stations to which the mobile station is accessible communicating with a FNG through a backbone network S<b>420</b>. And a serving base station transmits information of femto cell base stations (FM <b>7</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>1</b>) of the list to a mobile station S<b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A serving base station transmits information of femto cell base stations of the list to a mobile station.
