<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/523,218, filed on Sep. 18, 2006, by Dipak M. Shah and John L. Norin, entitled &#x201c;MULTIPLE DWELLING UNIT SATELLITE TELEVISION DELIVERY SYSTEM,&#x201d; which application is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a satellite receiver system and in particular, to a system architecture for control and data signal distribution on coaxial cable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Satellite broadcasting of communications signals has become commonplace. Satellite distribution of commercial signals for use in television programming currently utilizes multiple feedhorns on a single Outdoor Unit (ODU) which supply signals to up to eight IRDs on separate cables from a multiswitch.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a typical satellite television installation of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">System <b>100</b> uses signals sent from Satellite A (SatA) <b>102</b>, Satellite B (SatB) <b>104</b>, and Satellite C (SatC) <b>106</b> that are directly broadcast to an Outdoor Unit (ODU) <b>108</b> that is typically attached to the outside of a house <b>110</b>. ODU <b>108</b> receives these signals and sends the received signals to IRD <b>112</b>, which decodes the signals and separates the signals into viewer channels, which are then passed to television <b>114</b> for viewing by a user. There can be more than one satellite transmitting from each orbital location.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Satellite uplink signals <b>116</b> are transmitted by one or more uplink facilities <b>118</b> to the satellites <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> that are typically in geosynchronous orbit. Satellites <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> amplify and rebroadcast the uplink signals <b>116</b>, through transponders located on the satellite, as downlink signals <b>120</b>. Depending on the satellite <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> antenna pattern, the downlink signals <b>120</b> are directed towards geographic areas for reception by the ODU <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each satellite <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> broadcasts downlink signals <b>120</b> in typically thirty-two (32) different frequencies, which are licensed to various users for broadcasting of programming, which can be audio, video, or data signals, or any combination. These signals are typically located in the Ku-band of frequencies, i.e., 11-18 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Future satellites will likely broadcast in the Ka-band of frequencies, i.e., 18-40 GHz, but typically 20-30 GHz. For example, satellite <b>122</b> is at 99 degrees, satellite <b>124</b> is at 103 degrees, satellite <b>126</b> is at 95 degrees, and satellite <b>128</b> is at 72.5 degrees. Satellites <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are typically Ka-band satellites; however, other orbital slots can be used at Ka-band without departing from the scope of the present invention. Satellite <b>128</b> at 72.5 degrees is typically used for local programming, via spot beams that serve different geographic areas through frequency reuse and/or geographic diversity to allow the antenna beams to service different geographical areas.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a multiple dwelling unit in a typical urban setting.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Multiple dwelling unit (MDU) <b>130</b> is adjacent to MDU <b>132</b> and diagonally opposed to MDU <b>134</b>. A given dwelling unit <b>136</b> in MDU <b>130</b> is shown for illustrative purposes. If satellite signals <b>120</b> are arriving from direction <b>138</b>, then dwelling unit <b>130</b> can mount an ODU <b>108</b> facing direction <b>138</b> and potentially receive satellite signals <b>120</b>. However, the majority of the dwelling units in MDU <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> will not have clear access to direction <b>138</b>, and, as such, will not have access to satellite signals <b>120</b>. Further, if satellite signals <b>120</b> are incident from direction <b>140</b>, then dwelling unit <b>136</b> will not have access to satellite signals <b>120</b>. This problem also affects off-air television signals; an antenna for dwelling unit <b>136</b> will be shadowed by not only MDU's <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, but by MDU <b>130</b> depending on where the off-air signal transmitter is located with respect to MDU <b>130</b> and dwelling unit <b>132</b>. In essence, even if dwelling unit <b>136</b> has a complete view of the southern sky, other dwelling units in MDU <b>130</b> will not, which will eliminate or seriously degrade the reception and use of satellite signals <b>120</b> in those units.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a typical ODU of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">ODU <b>108</b> typically uses reflector dish <b>222</b> and feedhorn assembly <b>224</b> to receive and direct downlink signals <b>120</b> onto feedhorn assembly <b>224</b>. Reflector dish <b>222</b> and feedhorn assembly <b>224</b> are typically mounted on bracket <b>226</b> and attached to a structure for stable mounting. Feedhorn assembly <b>224</b> typically comprises one or more Low Noise Block converters <b>228</b>, which are connected via wires or coaxial cables to a multiswitch, which can be located within feedhorn assembly <b>124</b>, elsewhere on the ODU <b>108</b>, or within house <b>110</b>. LNBs typically downconvert the FSS-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band downlink signals <b>120</b> into frequencies that are easily transmitted by wire or cable, which are typically in the L-band of frequencies, which typically ranges from 950 MHz to 2150 MHz. This downconversion makes it possible to distribute the signals within a home using standard coaxial cables.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The multiswitch enables system <b>100</b> to selectively switch the signals from SatA <b>102</b>, SatB <b>104</b>, and SatC <b>106</b>, and deliver these signals via cables <b>224</b> to each of the IRDs <b>112</b>A-D located within house <b>110</b>. Typically, the multiswitch is a five-input, four-output (5&#xd7;4) multiswitch, where two inputs to the multiswitch are from SatA <b>102</b>, one input to the multiswitch is from SatB <b>104</b>, and one input to the multiswitch is a combined input from SatB <b>104</b> and SatC <b>106</b>. There can be other inputs for other purposes, e.g., off-air or other antenna inputs, without departing from the scope of the present invention. The multiswitch can be other sizes, such as a 6&#xd7;8 multiswitch, if desired. SatB <b>104</b> typically delivers local programming to specified geographic areas, but can also deliver other programming as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To maximize the available bandwidth in the Ku-band of downlink signals <b>120</b>, each broadcast frequency is further divided into polarizations. Each LNB <b>228</b> can only receive one polarization at time, so by aligning polarizations between the downlink polarization and the LNB <b>228</b> polarization, downlink signals <b>120</b> can be selectively filtered out from travelling through the system <b>100</b> to each IRD <b>112</b>A-D.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">IRD's <b>112</b>A-D currently use a one-way communications system to control the multiswitch. Each IRD <b>112</b>A-D has a dedicated cable <b>224</b> connected directly to the multiswitch, and each IRD independently places a voltage and signal combination on the dedicated cable to program the multiswitch. For example, IRD <b>112</b>A may wish to view a signal that is provided by SatA <b>102</b>. To receive that signal, IRD <b>112</b>A sends a voltage/tone signal on the dedicated cable back to the multiswitch, and the multiswitch delivers the SatA <b>102</b> signal to IRD <b>112</b>A on dedicated cable <b>124</b>. IRD <b>112</b>B independently controls the output port that IRD <b>112</b>B is coupled to, and thus may deliver a different voltage/tone signal to the multiswitch. The voltage/tone signal typically comprises a 13 Volts DC (VDC) or 18VDC signal, with or without a 22 kHz tone superimposed on the DC signal. 13VDC without the 22 kHz tone would select one port; 13VDC with the 22 kHz tone would select another port of the multiswitch, etc. There can also be a modulated tone, typically a 22 kHz tone, where the modulation schema can select one of any number of inputs based on the modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To reduce the cost of the ODU <b>108</b>, outputs of the Ka-band LNBs <b>128</b> present in the ODU <b>108</b> can be combined, or &#x201c;stacked,&#x201d; depending on the ODU <b>108</b> design. The stacking of the LNB <b>228</b> outputs occurs after the LNB has received and downconverted the input signal. This allows for multiple polarizations, one from each satellite <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, to pass through each LNB <b>228</b>. So one LNB <b>228</b> can, for example, receive the Left Hand Circular Polarization (LHCP) signals from SatC <b>102</b> and SatB <b>104</b>, while another LNB receives the Right Hand Circular Polarization (RHCP) signals from SatB <b>104</b>, which allows for fewer wires or cables between the LNBs <b>228</b> and the multiswitch.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The Ka-band of downlink signals <b>120</b> will be further divided into two bands, an upper band of frequencies called the &#x201c;A&#x201d; band and a lower band of frequencies called the &#x201c;B&#x201d; band. Once satellites are deployed within system <b>100</b> to broadcast these frequencies, each LNB <b>228</b> can deliver the signals from the Ku-band, the A band Ka-band, and the B band Ka-band signals for a given polarization to the multiswitch. However, current IRD <b>112</b> and system <b>100</b> designs cannot tune across this entire frequency band, which limits the usefulness of this stacking feature.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">By stacking the LNB <b>228</b> inputs as described above, each LNB <b>228</b> typically delivers 48 transponders of information to the multiswitch, but some LNBs <b>228</b> can deliver more or less in blocks of various size. The multiswitch allows each output of the multiswitch to receive every LNB <b>228</b> signal (which is an input to the multiswitch) without filtering or modifying that information, which allows for each IRD <b>112</b> to receive more data. However, as mentioned above, current IRDs <b>112</b> cannot use the information in some of the proposed frequencies used for downlink signals <b>120</b>, thus rendering useless the information transmitted in those downlink signals <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, the installation described above is designed for installation in a single residence, rather than in an apartment building or other large structure. Multiple Dwelling Units (MDUs), e.g., an apartment building, hotel, etc., for some configurations may be able to have their own ODU <b>108</b>; however, many MDUs may not be able to have an ODU <b>108</b> installed for each unit. For example, an apartment building may not be able to have an ODU <b>108</b> installed for some apartments because the ODU <b>108</b> cannot be properly pointed at satellites <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. Hotels may also not be able to install ODUs <b>108</b> for every room, for pointing and/or billing reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It can be seen, then, that there is a need in the art for a satellite broadcast system that can be expanded to include MDUs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Currently, there are three orbital slots, each comprising one or more satellites, delivering direct-broadcast television programming signals. However, ground systems that currently receive these signals cannot accommodate additional satellite signals, and cannot process the additional signals that will be used to transmit high-definition television (HDTV) signals. The HDTV signals can be broadcast from the existing satellite constellation, or broadcast from the additional satellite(s) that will be placed in geosynchronous orbit. The orbital locations of the satellites are fixed by regulation as being separated by nine degrees, so, for example, there is a satellite at 101 degrees West Longitude (WL), SatA <b>102</b>; another satellite at 110 degrees WL, SatC <b>106</b>; and another satellite at 119 degrees WL, SatB <b>104</b>. Other satellites may be at other orbital slots, e.g., 72.5 degrees, 95, degrees, 99 degrees, and 103 degrees, and other orbital slots, without departing from the scope of the present invention. The satellites are typically referred to by their orbital location, e.g., SatA <b>102</b>, the satellite at <b>101</b> WL, is typically referred to as &#x201c;<b>101</b>.&#x201d; Additional orbital slots, with one or more satellites per slot, are presently contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present invention allows currently installed systems to continue receiving currently broadcast satellite signals, as well as allowing for expansion of additional signal reception and usage. Further, the present invention allows for the use of pre-existing cabling within a given MDU such that the signal distribution within an MDU can be done without large new cable runs from the external antenna to individual set-top boxes.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The system of the present invention operates by band stacking signals on to a single satellite grade (e.g., RG6 type coaxial) cable, such that all currently operational satellite broadcasts are supported. The stacked signals reside in a frequency band that ranges from 2-3500 MHz, and these signals are transmitted from a distribution lock-box to each apartment using a single cable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The system of the present invention is designed to auto-compensate for signal attenuation as a function of frequency and cable loss within the distribution system. The system is compatible with off-air VHF and UHF frequency bands to support NTSC and ATSC services. Additionally this system provides a 2-way signaling solution to enable broadband data services to co-exist on the common cable. As such, each user receives a standard satellite signal to each receiver. This architecture allows all satellite receivers, past or present, to operate with this system.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">System Diagram</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a system diagram of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">System <b>300</b> comprises ODU <b>108</b> as previously described, conversion unit <b>302</b>, distribution panel <b>304</b>, and customer unit's <b>306</b>A-E (e.g., individual apartments in an apartment building, condominiums in a condominium community, etc.). Conversion unit <b>302</b> accepts the signals from ODU <b>108</b>, and processes these signals for distribution via distribution unit <b>304</b>. Each customer unit <b>306</b>A-E is then coupled via cables <b>308</b>A-E (collectively referred to as cables <b>308</b>) to distribution unit <b>304</b>. Cable <b>310</b> couples the conversion unit <b>302</b> to distribution panel <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although five customer units <b>306</b>A-E are shown, any number of customer unit's <b>306</b>A-E are possible with the present invention. Since each customer unit <b>306</b>A-E uses a single cable <b>308</b>A-E to connect to the distribution panel <b>304</b>, distribution panel <b>304</b> and, if necessary, additional conversion units <b>302</b> can be installed at a single location in an MDU and connections to individual customer unit's <b>306</b>A-E can be arranged. Further, the installation of cables <b>308</b>A-E can be done at the time of construction of customer units <b>306</b>A-E (e.g., at the time the apartment building, condominium project, etc. is being built), such that retrofitting of customer units <b>306</b>A-E is not necessary. Specific examples of different types of distribution panels <b>304</b> and cascaded connections of conversion units <b>302</b> are provided herein, however, the present invention is not to be limited to these specific examples.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Conversion Unit (Frequency Translation Module)</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed block diagram of the conversion unit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Conversion unit <b>302</b> comprises inputs <b>400</b>A-<b>400</b>F for receiving satellite signals from the various satellites in system <b>100</b>. Input <b>402</b> is for an off-air antenna such that terrestrial or cable signals can also be delivered to various dwelling units <b>306</b> via the system of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Combiner <b>404</b> combines signals present in inputs <b>400</b>A-<b>400</b>F and, if present, signals present on input <b>402</b>. Further, any signals present on inputs <b>400</b>A-<b>400</b>F are fed through conversion unit <b>302</b> to outputs <b>406</b>A-<b>406</b>F respectively, and each output <b>406</b>A-<b>406</b>F has a separate respective output <b>408</b>A-<b>408</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Within combiner <b>404</b>, Automatic Gain Control (AGC) circuitry <b>410</b>A-<b>410</b>G automatically adjusts the signal levels of incoming signals on lines <b>400</b>A-F and <b>402</b> to provide a uniform signal strength for all of these signals on output <b>310</b>. The output <b>310</b> is set to a level based on indicators <b>412</b>A-F, which are typically Light Emitting Diodes. Indicators <b>412</b>A-F have three different states that indicate the signal present on the representative input <b>400</b>A-F is either too high of a signal strength, too small of a signal strength, or within predetermined limits of signal strength. Installers of conversion unit <b>302</b> are instructed to adjust external amplifiers (not shown) to amplify signals present on inputs <b>400</b>A-F to have the indicators <b>412</b>A-F read too high of a signal strength, and reduce the amplifier gain until the respective indicator <b>418</b>A-F shows that the respective signal is within the predetermined limit range.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, conversion unit optionally comprises a power divider <b>414</b> and a diplexer <b>416</b>, to allow for signal injection from the output of combiner <b>404</b> back to input <b>402</b> via diplexer <b>416</b>. This allows for data transfer and data services to dwelling units <b>306</b> within the system of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Outputs <b>406</b>A-<b>406</b>F and <b>407</b> are used to cascade multiple conversion units <b>302</b> in series to be able to service additional dwelling units <b>306</b> within a MDU. Further, outputs <b>408</b>A-<b>408</b>F can be connected to a Frequency Translation Module (FTM) which allows for additional types of IRDs <b>112</b> to be used within a dwelling unit <b>306</b>. Power input <b>418</b> provides power, either in AC or DC format, to conversion unit <b>302</b>. Outputs <b>406</b>A-<b>406</b>F, when cascaded to another conversion unit <b>302</b>, also allow for power to be provided to a given conversion unit <b>302</b> when the power at input <b>418</b> fails, to prevent loss of signal delivery from output <b>310</b> of the conversion unit that has lost power at input <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The AGC circuits <b>410</b>A-G allow the output <b>310</b> to be deterministic, such that a large number of dwelling units <b>306</b> can be serviced by a single conversion unit, and, if there are a larger number of dwelling units <b>306</b>, or longer cable runs that will be connected to output <b>310</b> that would be effectively a larger number of dwelling units <b>306</b>, then installers of conversion unit <b>302</b> know to put another conversion unit <b>302</b>, or multiple conversion units <b>302</b>, in cascade to complete a proper installation. So, for example, and not by way of limitation, the AGC circuits <b>410</b>A-G can provide enough gain to the signals present on inputs <b>400</b>A-F and <b>402</b> to a given number of dwelling units <b>306</b> (which are determined by distribution units <b>304</b>), and, once that number is exceeded, installers will install a second conversion unit <b>302</b> in cascade by connecting to outputs <b>406</b>A-F which, once indicators <b>412</b>A-F are properly adjusted on the first conversion unit <b>302</b> in the cascade, will deliver proper signal levels to the cascaded conversion units <b>302</b>. Typically, each conversion unit <b>302</b> can service up to sixty-four dwelling units <b>306</b>, but larger or smaller numbers of dwelling units <b>306</b> can be serviced depending on the design of the MDU and the design of the conversion unit <b>302</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In system <b>700</b>, ODU <b>108</b> is typically coupled to conversion unit <b>304</b> via cables <b>702</b>. These cables deliver the signals from LNBs <b>128</b> to conversion unit <b>302</b>. Conversion unit <b>302</b> has a &#x201c;pass through&#x201d; feature which splits these signals immediately after reception such that the signals on cables <b>702</b> can be forwarded to another conversion unit <b>704</b> (which is substantially identical to conversion unit <b>304</b>, but is given a different reference numeral for clarity). Conversion unit <b>302</b> is connected to distribution unit <b>304</b>, and conversion unit <b>704</b> is coupled to a different distribution unit <b>706</b>. Distribution units <b>304</b> and <b>706</b> may have a different number of outputs <b>308</b> for delivery to customer units <b>306</b>, or the MDU <b>110</b> that system <b>700</b> is installed in may have more customer units <b>306</b> than a single conversion unit <b>302</b> can adequately service. Although only two conversion units <b>304</b> and <b>706</b> are shown, any number of conversion units <b>304</b> and <b>706</b> may be cascaded together without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Such systems <b>300</b> and <b>700</b> provide for a single installation of an ODU <b>108</b>, in a preferred location, such that ODU <b>108</b> can receive signals from satellites <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. The cables <b>702</b> from ODU <b>108</b> can then be installed to a centralized location, where conversion unit <b>302</b>, and, if desired, additional conversion units <b>704</b> are located, along with distribution units <b>304</b> and <b>706</b>. Each customer unit <b>306</b> is then wired to the distribution units <b>304</b>, <b>706</b> with a single cable <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Such systems <b>300</b> and <b>700</b> make it possible to deliver satellite, cable, and off-air television signals to customer units <b>306</b> regardless of customer unit <b>306</b> location, and makes installation of systems <b>300</b> and <b>700</b> easier.</p>
