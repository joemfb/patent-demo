<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/696,514, filed on Apr. 4, 2007, which claims priority to Japanese patent application JP 2006-121672, filed on Apr. 26, 2006.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an aromatic amine derivative and an organic electroluminescence (EL) device obtained by using the same, more specifically to an organic EL device in which use of an aromatic amine derivative having a specific substituent for a hole transporting layer inhibits molecules from being crystallized to enhance a yield in producing the organic EL device and improves a lifetime of the organic EL device and an aromatic amine derivative which materializes it.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An organic EL device is a spontaneous light emitting device making use of the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by recombination energy of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode by applying an electric field. Since organic EL device of a laminate type driven at a low voltage was reported by C. W. Tang et al. of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 51, p. 913, 1987), researches on organic EL devices comprising organic materials as structural materials have actively been carried out. Tang et al. use tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum for the light emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for the hole transporting layer. The advantages of a laminate structure include an elevation in an efficiency of injecting holes into a light emitting layer, a rise in a production efficiency of excitons produced by blocking electrons injected from a cathode to recombine them and shutting up of excitons produced in a light emitting layer. As shown in the above example, a two-layer type comprising a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and light emitting layer and a three-layered type comprising a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known as the device structures of an organic EL device. In such laminate type structural devices, device structures and forming methods are studied in order to enhance a recombination efficiency of holes and electrons injected.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Usually, when an organic EL device is operated and stored under high temperature environment, brought about are adverse effects such as a change in a color of emitted light, a reduction in a current efficiency, a rise in an operating voltage and a reduction in an emission lifetime. A glass transition temperature (Tg) of a hole transporting material has to be raised in order to prevent the above matters. Accordingly, the hole transporting material has to have a lot of aromatic groups in a molecule (for example, aromatic diamine derivatives described in Patent document 1 and aromatic fused ring diamine derivatives described in Patent document 2), and usually, structures having 8 to 12 benzene rings are preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, if they have a lot of aromatic groups in a molecule, crystallization is liable to be caused in forming a thin film using the above hole transporting materials to produce an organic EL device, and problems that an outlet of a crucible used for vapor deposition is clogged and that defects of a thin film originating in crystallization are caused to bring about a reduction in a yield of an organic EL device have been brought about. Further, compounds having a lot of aromatic groups in a molecule have usually a high glass transition temperature (Tg) but have a high sublimation temperature, and it is considered that the phenomena that decomposition is caused in vapor deposition and that a deposited film is unevenly formed are brought about, so that the problem that the lifetime is short has been involved therein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, a publicly known document in which asymmetric aromatic amine derivatives are disclosed is available. For example, aromatic amine derivatives having an asymmetric structure are described in Patent document 3, but no specific examples are found therein, and the characteristics of the asymmetric compounds are not described therein at all. Further, the examples of asymmetric aromatic amine derivatives having phenanthrene are described in Patent document 4, but they are handled on the same basis as symmetric compounds, and the characteristics of the asymmetric compounds are not described therein at all. Also, a specific synthetic process is required for the asymmetric compounds, but descriptions on the production processes of the asymmetric compounds are not clearly shown in the above patents. Further, a production process of aromatic amine derivatives having an asymmetric structure is described in Patent document 5, but the characteristics of the asymmetric compound are not described therein. Thermally stable asymmetric compounds having a high glass transition temperature are described in Patent document 6, but only examples of compounds having carbazole are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, compounds having dibenzofuran are reported in Patent documents 7 to 13, but they assume a structure in which diamine compounds have dibenzofuran in a central skeleton thereof. Compounds having dibenzofuran at a terminal are reported in Patent documents 14 to 15, but they are monoamine compounds. Only specific examples are shown in Patent documents 8 to 12. Actual examples are described in Patent documents 7 and 14, but they are used only as photoconductors. An organic EL device is described in Patent document 13, but it does not have satisfactory performances.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, organic EL devices having a long lifetime are reported, but they are not necessarily satisfactory. Accordingly, organic EL devices having more excellent performances are strongly required to be developed.

<p id="p-0010" num="0024">The present invention has been made in order to solve the problems described above, and an object thereof is to provide an organic EL device in which molecules are less liable to be crystallized and which is improved in a yield in producing the organic EL device and has a long lifetime and an aromatic amine derivative which materializes it.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0025">Intensive researches repeated by the present inventors in order to achieve the object described above have resulted in finding that the above object can be achieved by using a novel aromatic amine derivative having a specific substituent represented by the following Formula (1) as a material for an organic EL device and using it particularly for a hole transporting layer, and thus the present inventors have come to complete the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0026">Further, it has been found that an amino group substituted with an aryl group having a furan structure represented by Formula (2) or Formula (3) is suited as an amine unit having the specific substituent. The above amine unit has a steric hindrance, so that interaction between the molecules is small, and therefore it has the effects that crystallization thereof is inhibited to enhance a yield in producing an organic EL device and that the organic EL device obtained is extended in a lifetime. In particular, it has been found that a marked effect of extending the lifetime is obtained by combining with a blue color emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0027">That is, the present invention provides an aromatic amine derivative represented by the following Formula (1):</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0216">When applying a direct voltage to the organic EL device, light emission can be observed by applying a voltage of 5 to 40 V setting a polarity of the anode to plus and that of the cathode to minus. An electric current does not flow by applying a voltage at a reverse polarity, and light emission is not caused at all. Further, when applying an AC voltage, uniform light emission can be observed only when the anode has a plus polarity and the cathode has a minus polarity. The waveform of an alternating current applied may be optional.</p>

<p id="p-0232" num="0262">A glass substrate (manufactured by Geomatech Co., Ltd.) of 25 mm&#xd7;75 mm&#xd7;1.1 mm thickness equipped with an ITO transparent electrode was subjected to supersonic wave washing in isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes and then to UV ozone washing for 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0263">After washed, the glass substrate equipped with an ITO transparent electrode line was loaded in a substrate holder of a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus, and a film of a compound H232 shown below having a film thickness of 60 nm was formed on a face of a side at which the transparent electrode line was formed so that it covered the transparent electrode described above. This H232 film functions as a hole injecting layer. A film of the compound H1 described above having a film thickness of 20 nm was formed as a hole transporting material on the above H232 film. This film functions as a hole transporting layer. Further, a compound EM1 shown below was deposited thereon to form a film having a film thickness of 40 nm. At the same time, the following amine compound D1 having a styryl group was deposited as a light emitting molecule so that a weight ratio of EM1 to D1 was 40:2. This film functions as a light emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0264">A film of Alq shown below having a film thickness of 10 nm was formed on the above film. This film functions as an electron injecting layer. Then, Li (Li source: manufactured by Saesgetter Co., Ltd.) which was a reducing dopant and Alq shown below were subjected to binary vapor deposition to form an Alq:Li film (film thickness: 10 nm) as an electron injecting layer (cathode). Metal Al was deposited on the above Alq:Li film to form a metal cathode, whereby an organic EL device was formed.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0265">Further, the organic EL device thus obtained was measured for a current efficiency and observed for a luminescent color. The luminance was measured by means of CS1000 manufactured by Konica Minolta Co., Ltd. to calculate the current efficiency at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Further, the half lifetime thereof in light emission was measured at an initial luminance of 5000 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>and room temperature in operating at a DC constant electric current, and the results thereof are shown in Table 1.</p>
