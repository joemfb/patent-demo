<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electronic thermometer includes a probe adapted to be heated by a subject for use in measuring a temperature of the subject. At least one temperature sensor detects a temperature of the probe. An IR emitter emits an infrared signal from the probe. And an IR detector detects the infrared signal emitted by the IR emitter. The detection of the IR signal by the IR detector indicates that the probe is received in a probe cover.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 13/249,636, filed Sep. 30, 2011, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to thermometers, and more particularly to a thermometer having an IR probe sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Medical thermometers are typically employed to measure a subject's body temperature to facilitate the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, body ailments, etc., for humans and other animals. An accurate reading of a subject's body temperature is required for effective use and should be taken from the internal or core temperature of a subject's body. Several thermometer devices are known for measuring a subject's body temperature, such as, for example, electronic thermometers, including tympanic thermometers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tympanic thermometers have a sensing probe that is inserted into a subject's cavity (e.g., ear) for measuring the subject's body temperature. Before inserting the sensing probe into the subject's cavity, a probe cover is preferably mounted onto the sensing probe to provide a sanitary barrier between the sensing probe and the subject. The probe cover is typically discarded after the subject's body temperature has been obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of a tympanic thermometer, the sensing probe includes a heat sensor such as a thermopile for sensing infrared emission from the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. During use, the thermopile is generally located inside the ear canal. The thermopile utilizes a waveguide of radiant heat to transfer heat energy from the eardrum to the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Often times during use, the thermometer probe is inadvertently placed into a subject's cavity without a probe cover. This exposes the thermometer to cross contamination, which compromises the ability of the thermometer to generate accurate reading and necessitates cleaning the probe. A conventional thermometer cannot detect the placement of the probe in the subject's cavity. Therefore, a need exists for a thermometer that can better promote proper usage of the thermometer, including the placement of the probe.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, an electronic thermometer generally comprises a probe adapted to be heated by a subject for use in measuring a temperature of the subject. At least one temperature sensor detects a temperature of the probe. An IR emitter emits an infrared signal from the probe. And an IR detector detects the infrared signal emitted by the IR emitter. The detection of the IR signal by the IR detector indicates that the probe is received in a probe cover.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a method of determining a temperature of a subject with an electronic thermometer generally comprises emitting an IR signal out of a probe with an IR emitter. Detecting the IR signal emitted by the IR emitter with an IR detector. The detection of the IR signal by the IR detector indicating that the probe is received in a probe cover. And detecting a temperature of the probe when inserted into the subject by using a temperature sensor to determine the temperature of the subject.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The exemplary embodiments of the tympanic thermometer and methods of use disclosed are discussed in terms of medical thermometers for measuring body temperature and, more particularly, in terms of a tympanic thermometer that includes a temperature sensor for measuring body temperature when the thermometer is inserted into an ear of a subject. However, the disclosed elements can be used with other types of electronic thermometers (ex., oral and rectal thermometer) without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the discussion that follows, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; will refer to the portion of a structure that is closer to a practitioner, while the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; will refer to the portion that is farther from the practitioner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; for the structure, which is the fully assembled and usable tympanic thermometer. As-used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; refers to a human patient or other animal having its body temperature measured. According to the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;practitioner&#x201d; refers to a doctor, nurse, parent or other care provider utilizing a tympanic thermometer to measure a subject's body temperature, and may include support personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, which are illustrated in the accompanying Figures. Turning now to the Figures and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is illustrated a tympanic thermometer, generally indicated at <b>20</b>, in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. It is contemplated that the tympanic thermometer <b>20</b> includes the necessary electronics and/or processing components to perform temperature measurement via the tympanic membrane, as is known to one skilled in the art. It is further envisioned that tympanic thermometer <b>20</b> may include a waveguide to facilitate sensing of the tympanic membrane heat energy. However, in the illustrated embodiments, the waveguide is beneficially omitted. The tympanic thermometer <b>20</b> is releasably mounted in a holder <b>40</b> for storage in contemplation for use. The tympanic thermometer <b>20</b> and holder <b>40</b> may be fabricated from semi-rigid, rigid plastic and/or metal materials suitable for temperature measurement and related use. It is envisioned that the holder <b>40</b> may include the electronics necessary to facilitate powering the tympanic thermometer <b>20</b>, including, for example, battery charging capability, etc. The thermometer <b>20</b> is operable in a sleep mode wherein the thermometer <b>20</b> conserves energy and is not capable of performing a temperature measurement and an awake mode wherein the thermometer is operating at full power and is capable of performing a temperature measurement in certain conditions as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, tympanic thermometer <b>20</b> includes a cylindrical heat sensing probe, generally indicated at <b>22</b>. The heat sensing probe <b>22</b> extends from a distal end <b>24</b> of tympanic thermometer <b>20</b> and defines a longitudinal axis X. The heat sensing probe <b>22</b> may have various geometric cross-sectional configurations, such as, for example, rectangular, elliptical, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A probe cover <b>32</b> may be disposed over the heat sensing probe <b>22</b>. The probe cover <b>32</b> has a distal end <b>54</b> that is substantially enclosed by a film <b>56</b>. The film is substantially transparent to infrared radiation and configured to facilitate sensing of infrared emissions by heat sensing probe <b>22</b>. The film <b>56</b> is advantageously impervious to ear wax, moisture and bacteria to prevent disease propagation. One skilled in the art, however, will realize that other materials and fabrication methods suitable for assembly and manufacture are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the heat sensing probe <b>22</b> includes a nozzle, generally indicated at <b>100</b>, mounted on a base <b>106</b>. The nozzle <b>100</b> includes a base <b>110</b> and an elongated nose portion <b>112</b> projecting distally from the base. By way of non-limiting example, nozzle <b>100</b> may be fabricated from metal or other material which aides in the rapid exchange or transfer of heat. The nozzle <b>100</b> is formed of two parts (the base <b>110</b> and the nose portion <b>112</b>) in the illustrated embodiment. It will be understood that a nozzle can be formed as one piece or more than two pieces without departing from the scope of the present invention. In particular, it is envisioned that the elongated nose section <b>112</b> can be formed of two or more pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The heat sensing probe <b>22</b> also includes a sensor can, generally indicated at <b>102</b>, attached to temperature sensing electronics mounted on a distal end of a sensor housing <b>104</b> (or &#x201c;retainer&#x201d;) received within the nozzle <b>100</b>. The can <b>102</b> includes a sensor base <b>126</b> and a generally inverted cup-shaped tip <b>116</b> mounted on the base. A temperature sensor <b>122</b> (e.g., a thermopile), an infrared filter or window <b>120</b> and thermistor <b>124</b> are housed within can <b>102</b>. The sensor housing <b>104</b> is mounted on the base <b>106</b> of probe <b>22</b> such that it extends generally coaxially within nozzle <b>100</b>. By way of non-limiting example, the sensor housing <b>104</b> is fabricated from materials that provide for less thermo transmission (i.e., more insulated) than the nozzle <b>100</b>, for example, plastic or other similar matter. So the material of the sensor housing <b>104</b> has a low thermal conductivity as compared to the thermal conductivity of the nozzle <b>100</b> and the base <b>126</b> of the can <b>102</b>. The probe may also include a probe cover film <b>119</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The probe cover <b>32</b> is received on the nozzle <b>100</b> such that a distal portion of the cover is in thermal contact with the nose <b>112</b> of the nozzle. Probe cover <b>32</b> may be shaped, for example, frustoconically, or shaped in a tapered manner as to allow for easier insertion into the ear of the subject and attachment and detachment from the heat sensing probe <b>22</b>. The probe cover <b>32</b>, which is disposable, may be fabricated from materials suitable for measuring body temperature via the tympanic membrane with a tympanic thermometer measuring apparatus. These materials may include, for example, plastic materials, such as, for example, polypropylene, polyethylene, etc., depending on the particular temperature measurement application and/or preference of a practitioner.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In operation, infrared energy IR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) from the subject's tympanic membrane, for example, passes through the film <b>56</b> of probe cover <b>32</b> and enters can <b>102</b> through the window <b>120</b> of probe <b>22</b>. This infrared energy may heat the can <b>102</b> and create a temperature gradient across the tip <b>116</b> from its distal end to its proximal end contacting the base <b>126</b>. That is, the distal end can be much warmer than the proximal end. Heat from, for example, the ear of the subject is transferred from probe cover <b>32</b> to nozzle <b>100</b> to the base <b>126</b> of the can <b>102</b> via a path of heat flux (not shown). The path of heat flux heats the can <b>102</b> in order to reduce the temperature gradient across tip <b>116</b>, thereby enabling a faster and more accurate temperature reading. An internal ridge <b>121</b> engages a distal side of a peripheral edge margin <b>114</b> of the base <b>126</b> to provide a heat conducting path from the nozzle <b>100</b> to the base <b>126</b> defining the path of heat flux. It is contemplated herein that nozzle <b>100</b> may be both in physical contact with the peripheral edge margin <b>114</b> or in a close proximate relationship with peripheral edge margin <b>114</b> of can <b>102</b>. In either case, there should be such thermal contact as to enable heat transfer from the internal ridge <b>121</b> of the nozzle <b>100</b> to the peripheral edge margin <b>114</b> of the base <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, an IR signal emitter <b>130</b> and an IR signal detector <b>132</b> are disposed in a wall of the nozzle <b>100</b> at a proximal end of the nozzle. The IR signal emitter <b>130</b> is configured to emit an infrared signal and the IR signal detector <b>132</b> is configured to detect the infrared signal emitted by the IR signal emitter when the probe <b>22</b> is received in the probe cover <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, the IR emitter emits an infrared signal within about a 940 nm wavelength range and the IR detector <b>132</b> generates a voltage level that is proportional to the strength of the infrared signal detected by the IR detector. A constant current source <b>131</b> provides electric current to the IR signal emitter <b>130</b>. And, in one embodiment, a signal conditioner <b>133</b> conditions the voltage signal produced by the IR signal detector <b>132</b> to condition the signal into a suitable form to be processed by a controller (not shown) of the thermometer <b>20</b>. The constant current source <b>131</b>, IR signal emitter <b>130</b>, IR signal detector, and signal conditioner <b>133</b> comprise an IR system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An emitter fiber <b>134</b> extends within the wall of the nozzle <b>100</b> along a length of the nozzle from the IR emitter <b>130</b> at the proximal end of the nozzle to a distal end of the nozzle. In one embodiment, the emitter fiber <b>134</b> comprises fiber optic strands for conducting an infrared signal. The emitter fiber <b>134</b> terminates at an emitter opening <b>136</b> in the distal end of the nozzle <b>100</b> so that the emitted infrared signal is conducted out of the distal end of the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A detector fiber <b>138</b> extends within the wall of the nozzle <b>100</b> along the length of the nozzle from the IR detector <b>132</b> at the proximal end of the nozzle to the distal end of the nozzle. The detector fiber <b>138</b> also comprises, for example, fiber optic strands for conducting an infrared signal. The detector fiber <b>138</b> terminates at a detector opening <b>140</b> in the distal end of the nozzle <b>100</b> so that the emitted infrared signal from the IR emitter <b>130</b> can be conducted to the IR detector <b>132</b> when the probe <b>22</b> is received in the probe cover <b>32</b>. In particular, the film <b>56</b> of the probe cover <b>32</b> reflects the infrared signal emitted by the IR emitter <b>130</b> into the detector opening <b>140</b> and to the detector fiber <b>138</b> so that the infrared signal can be conducted to the IR detector <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the infrared signal IRS is reflected multiple times between an inner surface of the film <b>56</b> and distal edge of the nozzle <b>100</b> until the signal reaches the detector opening <b>140</b>. Once the signal is directed to the detector opening <b>140</b>, the detector fiber <b>138</b> conducts the signal to the IR detector <b>132</b>. The detection of the infrared signal by the IR detector <b>132</b> indicates that the probe <b>22</b> is received in the probe cover <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the illustrated embodiment, the emitter opening <b>136</b> and detector opening <b>140</b> are spaced about 90 degrees from each other to ensure that the infrared signal reaches the IR detector <b>132</b> without having to travel an extended distance. However, the openings <b>136</b>, <b>140</b> can be spaced at other distances and angles from each other without departing from the scope of the invention. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a second embodiment of a probe <b>222</b> of the present invention having several options for possible emitter and detector openings. Also, the IR signal emitter <b>130</b> and IR signal detector <b>132</b> can be disposed at the distal end of the probe <b>22</b> near the emitter opening <b>136</b> and detector opening <b>140</b>, respectively. In this embodiment, the emitter fiber <b>134</b> and detector fiber <b>138</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The temperature sensor <b>122</b>, IR signal emitter <b>130</b>, IR signal detector <b>132</b>, constant current source <b>131</b>, and signal conditioner <b>133</b> are operatively connected to a microprocessor system including a processor (not shown) of the controller. The processor is programmed to perform the temperature measurements for determining the temperature of the subject through the connection between the processor and the temperature sensor <b>122</b>. The processor may also control the IR system for detecting the placement of the probe <b>22</b> as will be explained in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the processor may control the IR system so that when the thermometer <b>20</b> is in the sleep mode, and when the thermometer is in the awake mode, but the probe <b>22</b> is not received in the probe cover <b>32</b>, the processor will deactivate the IR system. In these two conditions, the processor may also be programmed to prevent power from being supplied to the temperature sensor <b>122</b>. Thus, the thermometer <b>20</b> would not be capable of performing a temperature measurement. When the probe <b>22</b> is fully inserted into the probe cover <b>32</b>, the probe cover engages a switch (not shown) on the probe and switches the thermometer <b>20</b> to the awake mode so that the processor may activate the IR system. Although the microprocessor of the thermometer is described as controlling both the temperature measurements and the IR system, a separate processor from the thermometer microprocessor may control the IR system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the IR system is activated, the processor can be programmed to identify a first condition wherein the infrared signal detected by the IR detector <b>132</b> indicates that the probe <b>22</b> is received in the probe cover <b>32</b> but not inserted into the subject, and a second condition wherein the infrared signal detected by the IR detector indicates that the probe is received in the probe cover and inserted into the subject. The processor can be programmed to provide an indication, such as a read-out on a display <b>30</b> of the thermometer <b>20</b>, notifying the practitioner which condition is being detected by the IR system. However, the indications can be provided in other ways such as audible indications without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By way of example, when the processor identifies the first condition, the IR detector produces a voltage based on the received infrared energy; this voltage will be the reference voltage. When the processor identifies the second condition, the IR detector detects a voltage level shift from the reference voltage established during the first condition. The voltage ranges corresponding to the first and second conditions can have other values without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The processor can also be programmed to activate the temperature sensor <b>122</b> to measure the temperature of the subject only after the processor identifies the second condition wherein the probe <b>22</b> is received in the probe cover <b>32</b> and inserted into the subject. This improves the accuracy of the thermometer <b>20</b> because power is not supplied to the temperature sensor <b>122</b> until the probe <b>22</b> is properly inserted into the subject. Also, external effects on the temperature sensor <b>122</b> are minimized making the temperature readings produced by the temperature sensor more accurate. Once the thermometer <b>20</b> acquires the subject's temperature, the processor may deactivate the IR system to conserve battery life and prevent the reuse of the probe cover.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Having described the invention in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiments(s) thereof, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d; and &#x201c;said&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements.
