<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-020798 filed on Feb. 2, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a slitting apparatus for slitting-material formed with a coating layer on a support body, and to an inkjet paper manufacturing apparatus and a method of manufacturing inkjet paper.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Technology for slitting inkjet paper formed with a relatively hard coating layer on a support body is known, in which the inkjet paper is slit from the coating layer side with a highly raked male blade while supporting the inkjet paper with a female blade (see for example the specification of US Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0255743). Technology for slitting photographic paper by slitting from the support body side is also known (see for example the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 5,974,922).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, it is difficult to achieve a good cut face when slitting a slitting-material having a coating layer harder than the support body from the coating layer side with a male blade, with this being a cause of poor yield. On the other hand, when a slitting-material having a coating layer harder than the support body is slit with a male blade from the support body side, there is concern regarding damage to the surface of the coating layer due to rubbing of the coating layer accompanying relative displacement between the coating layer of the slitting-material and a support member and female blade.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention addresses suppressing cracking and burring (raised burr) from occurring in the vicinity of the slit edge of a coating layer during slitting.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first aspect of the present invention provides a slitting-material slitting apparatus including:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a rotatable male blade;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a female blade that is provided below the male blade so as to be capable of rotating about a rotation axis aligned with the rotation axis direction of the male blade, and is provided so as to face a blade tip portion of the male blade along the male blade rotation axis direction; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a wrap section that wraps a slitting-material around the female blade such that the slitting-material makes contact with the female blade on a coated layer side of the slitting-material configured by a support body with a coating layer on the support body harder than the support body; wherein</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">the relative position of the male blade and the female blade are determined such that the male blade slits the slitting-material in a state in which the coating layer is wrapped against the female blade by the wrap section and in contact with the female blade.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the above aspect, the female blade is provided below the rotating male blade so as to be capable of rotating about a rotation axis aligned with the rotation axis direction of the male blade, and so as to face a blade tip portion of the male blade along the male blade rotation axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the wrap section wraps the slitting-material configured by the support body formed with the coating layer harder than the support body around the female blade such that the coated layer side of the slitting-material makes contact with the female blade.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The rotating male blade then slits the slitting-material wrapped in this manner against the female blade from the support body side. The male blade slits the slitting-material in a state in which the coating layer is wrapped against the female blade by the wrap section and is in contact with the female blade.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Due to this, slitting-material is slit in a stable state, and cracking and burring (raised burr) can be suppressed from occurring at the vicinity of the slit edge of the coating layer during slitting.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second aspect of the present invention provides the slitting-material slitting apparatus of the first aspect, wherein:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">a blade tip angle of the male blade as viewed from the rotation direction of the male blade is 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;; and</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">a blade tip portion of the male blade is provided with a secondary blade that, when viewed from the rotation direction, has a rotation axis direction thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m and a blade tip angle of 60&#xb0; to 85&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the above configuration, the blade tip angle of the male blade as viewed from the rotation direction of the male blade is 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;, and the blade tip portion of the male blade is provided with a secondary blade that has a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m and blade tip angle of 60&#xb0; to 85&#xb0;. Cracking and burring (raised burr) can accordingly be efficiently suppressed from occurring at the vicinity of the slit edge of the coating layer during slitting.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The third aspect of the present invention provides the slitting-material slitting apparatus of the first aspect, wherein a material of the male blade is cemented carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the above configuration, the durability of the male blade can be raised (the working life can be prolonged) since the material of the male blade is cemented carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fourth aspect of the present invention provides the slitting-material slitting apparatus of the first aspect, wherein a blade tip angle of the female blade is 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the above configuration, the female blade is easily fabricated, and the durability of the female blade can also be raised (the working life can be prolonged) due to the blade tip angle of the female blade being 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fifth aspect of the present invention provides the slitting-material slitting apparatus of the first aspect, wherein:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">a male blade beveled portion is provided to a blade tip portion of the male blade facing towards the female blade, the male blade beveled portion having a bevel dimension along the rotation axis direction of 1 &#x3bc;m or greater; and</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">a female blade beveled portion is provided to a blade tip portion of the female blade facing towards the male blade, the female blade beveled portion having a bevel dimension along the rotation axis direction of 1 &#x3bc;m or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the above configuration, a male blade beveled portion is provided to the blade tip portion of the male blade facing towards the female blade, the male blade beveled portion having a bevel dimension along the rotation axis direction of 1 &#x3bc;m or greater, and a female blade beveled portion is provided to the blade tip portion of the female blade facing towards the male blade, the female blade beveled portion having a bevel dimension along the rotation axis direction of 1 &#x3bc;m or greater.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Overall Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Inkjet Paper Manufacturing Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an inkjet paper manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> includes: a feeder section <b>12</b> serving as an example of a feeder section for feeding out inkjet paper <b>11</b> serving as slitting-material; a slitting-material slitting apparatus <b>13</b> (referred to below simply as a slitting apparatus) for slitting the inkjet paper <b>11</b> conveyed out from the feeder section <b>12</b> along the conveying direction; and a winding section <b>16</b> serving as an example of a winding section for winding up the inkjet paper <b>11</b> that has been slit by the slitting apparatus <b>13</b> and acting as a drive source.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The feeder section <b>12</b> successively feeds out the inkjet paper <b>11</b> that has been wound in roll-form, and the winding section <b>16</b> is configured so as to separately wind up the inkjet paper <b>11</b> that has been slit into plural narrow width strips of inkjet paper as respective rolls. Configuration is accordingly made such that the inkjet paper <b>11</b> is conveyed between the feeder section <b>12</b> and the winding section <b>16</b> (see the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While described in more detail later, briefly the slitting apparatus <b>13</b> includes an apparatus body <b>14</b>, and a guide roller <b>22</b> and a guide roller <b>24</b>, serving as an example of a wrap section, described later. The apparatus body <b>14</b> is configured so as to pass the inkjet paper <b>11</b> between an upper knife unit <b>18</b> and a lower knife unit <b>20</b> so as to slit the inkjet paper <b>11</b> into plural sections disposed across the width direction (a direction orthogonal to the conveying direction) of the inkjet paper <b>11</b>. The guide roller <b>22</b> is provided between the feeder section <b>12</b> and the apparatus body <b>14</b>, and the inkjet paper <b>11</b> is wrapped on the guide roller <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inkjet paper <b>11</b> is guided by the guide roller <b>22</b> and introduced into the apparatus body <b>14</b> with a specific entry angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b>, and is guided by the guide roller <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) out from the apparatus body <b>14</b> with a specific exit angle &#x3b1;<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in FIG. <b>3</b>(<b>1</b>) and FIG. <b>3</b>(<b>2</b>), in the apparatus body <b>14</b> the male blade <b>30</b> slits the inkjet paper <b>11</b> from the support body paper <b>26</b> side along the conveying direction. Therefore, a burr is suppressed from being raised from the outside face of the paper <b>26</b> of the inkjet paper <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the blade tip angle (the angle A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the male blade <b>30</b> as viewed from the rotation direction is 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;. Furthermore, the secondary blade <b>56</b> is provided to the blade tip portions <b>30</b>A of the top knives <b>30</b> with a rotation axis direction thickness as viewed from the rotation direction of the male blade <b>30</b> (dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, and a blade tip angle (angle B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 60&#xb0; to 85&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Namely, due to providing the secondary blade <b>56</b> with a rotation axis direction thickness (dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, and a blade tip angle of 60&#xb0; to 85&#xb0;, localized load is better prevented from being applied to the inkjet paper <b>11</b> when slitting the inkjet paper <b>11</b> than in cases with an acute blade tip angle of the secondary blade, thereby suppressing cracks from occurring in the inkjet paper <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Furthermore, by setting the blade tip angle of the top knives <b>30</b> (angle A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;, load is suppressed from occurring along the width direction of the inkjet paper <b>11</b> during slitting, and burring of the inkjet paper <b>11</b> is better suppressed from occurring that in cases with an obtuse blade tip angle of the top knives <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Evaluation was performed regarding cracking and burring with the blade tip angle of the male blade <b>30</b> (angle A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) set at 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0; while varying values for the thickness of the secondary blade <b>56</b> (dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the blade tip angle of the secondary blade <b>56</b> (angle B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to various levels. For comparison evaluation was also performed of configurations without the secondary blade <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, with respect to cracking evaluation is indicated as: A for 0 to 10 individual cracks per meter; B for 10 to 20 individual cracks per meter; C for 20 to 40 individual cracks per meter; and NG for 40 or more individual cracks per meter. With respect to burring evaluation is indicated as: A for 0 to 50 &#x3bc;m; B for 50 to 100 &#x3bc;m; C for 100 to 150 &#x3bc;m; and NG for 150 &#x3bc;m or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It can be seen that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, according to the present exemplary embodiment, evaluation for cracking and burring is either A or B when the secondary blade thickness (dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m and the blade tip angle of the secondary blade <b>56</b> (angle B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is 60&#xb0; to 85&#xb0;, and it can be seen that in the present exemplary embodiment cracking and burring are suppressed from occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the male blade <b>30</b> is provided with the male blade beveled portion <b>54</b> having a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m and a bevel dimension in the radial direction (dimension E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. The female blade <b>36</b> is provided with the female blade bevel portion <b>58</b> having a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m and a bevel dimension in the radial direction (dimension G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The durability is also evaluated while varying the bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction for the male blade bevel portion (dimension D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction for the female blade bevel portion (dimension F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to various levels.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, evaluation is indicated as: A when the slitting distance without male blade or female blade breakage exceeds 500000 m; B when the distance without male blade of female blade breakage is 100000 m to 500000 m; and NG when distance without male blade of female blade breakage is less than 100000 m.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">It can be seen that the present exemplary embodiment raises durability since, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, evaluation is A when, as in the present exemplary embodiment, the bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction for the male blade bevel portion (dimension D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, and the bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction for the female blade bevel portion (dimension F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Evaluation was performed based on the above evaluations to narrow down the range of the optimal conditions enabling both suppression of cracking and burring to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Evaluation standards are, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the same as previously, wherein with respect to cracks evaluation is indicated as: A for 0 to 10 individual cracks per meter; B for 10 to 20 individual cracks per meter; C for 20 to 40 individual cracks per meter; and NG for 40 or more individual cracks per meter. Similarly, with respect to burring evaluation is indicated as: A for 0 to 50 &#x3bc;m; B for 50 to 100 &#x3bc;m; C for 100 to 150 &#x3bc;m; and NG for 150 &#x3bc;m or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, it can be determined that the optimum state is achieved when the male blade beveled portion <b>54</b> has a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 3 &#x3bc;m and the thickness of the secondary blade <b>56</b> provided to the male blade <b>30</b> (dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, the blade tip angle of the secondary blade <b>56</b> (angle B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is 85&#xb0; and the female blade bevel portion <b>58</b> has a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 4 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The inkjet paper <b>11</b> slit in this manner is wound on the winding section <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As described above, in order to manufacture inkjet paper, first the inkjet paper <b>11</b> is fed out with the feeder section <b>12</b> towards the slitting apparatus <b>13</b> (feed process). Next, the inkjet paper <b>11</b> that has been fed out from the feeder section <b>12</b> is slit in the slitting apparatus <b>13</b> (slitting process). Then, the slit inkjet paper <b>11</b> is wound using the winding section <b>16</b> (winding process).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As explained above, due to the top knives <b>30</b> slitting the inkjet paper <b>11</b> along the conveying direction from the support body paper <b>26</b> side, burring can be suppressed from being raised on the outside of the outer face of the paper <b>26</b> of the inkjet paper <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Due to suppressing a burr from being raised to the outside from the outside face of the paper <b>26</b>, contact of burr against a support member and accompanying contamination can be suppressed when, in subsequent processes, the inkjet paper <b>11</b> is conveyed in a state in which the paper <b>26</b> is supported.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Furthermore, configuration is made such that the top knives <b>30</b> slit the inkjet paper <b>11</b> while the ink receiving layer <b>28</b> is in a supported state on the outer peripheral face of the female blade <b>36</b> (in an wrapped state). Therefore, the inkjet paper <b>11</b> can be slit by the top knives <b>30</b> in a stable state.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Due to being able to slit the inkjet paper <b>11</b> with the top knives <b>30</b> in a stable state, cracking and burring (raised burr) can be suppressed from occurring in the vicinity of the slit edge of the ink receiving layer <b>28</b> during slitting.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Furthermore, the blade tip angle of the top knives <b>30</b> (angle A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is set at 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;. At the blade tip portions <b>30</b>A of the top knives <b>30</b>, there is provided the secondary blade <b>56</b> with a thickness (dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, and a blade tip angle (angle B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 60&#xb0; to 85&#xb0;. Therefore, cracking and burring (raised burr) can be efficiently suppressed from occurring in the vicinity of the slit edge of the ink receiving layer <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Furthermore, due to employing cemented carbide as the material of the male blade <b>30</b> and the female blade <b>36</b>, the durability of the male blade <b>30</b> and the female blade <b>36</b> can be raised (working life can be prolonged).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Furthermore, due to employing an angle of 90&#xb0; for the blade tip angle of the female blade <b>36</b>, the female blade <b>36</b> is easily fabricated, and the durability of the female blade <b>36</b> can be further raised (working life can be prolonged).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Furthermore, the male blade <b>30</b> is provided with the male blade beveled portion <b>54</b> having a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m and a bevel dimension in the radial direction (dimension E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. On the other hand, the female blade <b>36</b> is provided with the female blade bevel portion <b>58</b> having a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m and a bevel dimension in the radial direction (dimension G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. Accordingly, the durability of the male blade <b>30</b> and the female blade <b>36</b> can be raised (working life can be prolonged).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The tension on the inkjet paper <b>11</b> to be slit by the slitting apparatus <b>13</b> is set in the range 130N/m to 686N/m. Therefore, cracks can be prevented from appearing in the inkjet paper <b>11</b> compared with cases in which the inkjet paper <b>11</b> is pulled at higher tension, and the inkjet paper <b>11</b> can be slit in a stable state.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The degree of overlap of the blade tip portions <b>30</b>A of the top knives <b>30</b> and the blade tip portions <b>36</b>A of the bottom knives <b>36</b> (dimension J in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is set in the range 0.8 mm to 1.0 mm. Accordingly the top knives <b>30</b> can be suppressed from riding up on the bottom knives <b>36</b>, and the inkjet paper <b>11</b> can be prevented from undergoing large amounts of deformation during slitting.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The present invention is explained in detail according to particular exemplary embodiments, however the present invention is not limited by the exemplary embodiments. It will be obvious to someone of skill in the art that various other exemplary embodiments are possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, whereas in the above exemplary embodiments the male blade beveled portion <b>54</b> is set with a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, configuration may be made at greater than 10 &#x3bc;m. Similarly, whereas in the above exemplary embodiments the female blade bevel portion <b>58</b> is set with a bevel dimension in the rotation axis direction (dimension F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, configuration may be made at greater than 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
