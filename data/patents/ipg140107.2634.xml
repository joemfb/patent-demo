<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/875,382 filed Sep. 3, 2010, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0083632, filed on Sep. 4, 2009, the disclosures of which are each hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure herein relates to semiconductor chips and methods of fabricating the same, and more particularly, to semiconductor chips having guard rings and method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor devices may include integrated circuits having specific functions. The integrated circuits may be completed by forming a number of discrete devices in a limited area of a semiconductor substrate. The discrete devices may include active elements such as transistors and passive elements such as resistors and capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The integrated circuits may be formed in main chip regions of the semiconductor substrate. The main chip regions may provide a scribe lane region therebetween. After the integrated circuits are formed, the semiconductor substrate in the scribe lane region may be cut to provide a plurality of semiconductor chips physically separated from each other. This process may also be referred to as a die sawing process. The respective discrete semiconductor chips may be encapsulated through an assembly process so that the semiconductor chips are protected from external environments. During the die sawing process, the semiconductor substrate in the scribe lane region and material layers thereon may be physically cut using a sawing blade. Accordingly, stresses caused by physical frictions between the sawing blade and the material layers (or the semiconductor substrate) may be generated in the die sawing process. These stresses may be delivered to material layers constituting the integrated circuit in the main chip region to cause cracks. The cracks may cause a malfunction of the integrated circuit formed in the main chip region, or may degrade the reliability of the integrated circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure may provide semiconductor chips and methods of fabricating the same, which are suitable to inhibit a stress generated during a die sawing process of cutting a scribe lane region from being delivered to a main chip region.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure may also provide semiconductor chips and methods of fabricating the same, which are suitable to alleviate a stress generated during a die sawing process of cutting a scribe lane region, and to reduce the width of the scribe lane region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example embodiment of the inventive concepts provides a semiconductor chip. The semiconductor chip comprises a semiconductor substrate including a main chip region and a scribe lane region surrounding the main chip region. An insulating layer is disposed over the semiconductor substrate, and a guard ring is disposed in the insulating layer in the scribe lane region. The guard ring surrounds at least a portion of the main chip region. The guard ring has a brittleness greater than a brittleness of the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the guard ring may be an insulating guard ring. The insulating guard ring may comprise a porous insulating layer. The porous insulating layer may be an insulating layer containing at least one of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and fluorine (F). The porous insulating layer may be one of a Fluorosilicate Glass (FSG) layer, a SiOC layer, a SiOCH layer, a SiLK&#x2122; (a trademark of The Dow Chemical Company) resin layer, and a SiN layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other embodiments, the guard ring may be a single loop-shaped guard ring continuously surrounding an edge of the main chip region.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still other embodiments, the semiconductor chip may further include at least one conductive guard ring in the insulating layer in the scribe lane region. The at least one conductive guard ring may be disposed between the guard ring and the main chip region. The guard ring may have a width less than a width of the at least one conductive guard ring.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet other embodiments, the guard ring may vertically penetrate the insulating layer to contact the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet still other embodiments, the insulating layer may include a plurality of interlayer dielectric layers that are sequentially stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another example embodiment of the inventive concepts provides a method of fabricating a semiconductor chip. The method of fabricating the semiconductor chip comprises forming an insulating layer over a semiconductor substrate including a main chip region and a scribe lane region surrounding the main chip region. A guard ring is formed in the insulating layer in the scribe lane region. The guard ring surrounds at least a portion of the main chip region. The guard ring is formed of a material layer having a brittleness greater than a brittleness of the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the guard ring may be formed of an insulating material layer. The insulating guard ring may be formed of a porous insulating layer. The porous insulating layer may include an insulating layer containing at least one of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and fluorine (F). The porous insulating layer may be one of a Fluorosilicate Glass (FSG) layer, a SiOC layer, a SiOCH layer, a SiLK&#x2122; resin layer, and a SiN layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other embodiments, the forming of the guard ring may include: patterning the insulating layer to form a groove exposing the semiconductor substrate in the scribe lane region, forming a porous insulating layer filling the groove and covering the insulating layer, and planarizing the porous insulating layer to expose an upper surface of the insulating layer. The porous insulating layer may be formed using a plasma chemical vapor deposition technique.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to still another example embodiment of the inventive concepts, the method of fabricating the semiconductor chip comprises preparing a semiconductor substrate including a main chip region and a scribe lane region surrounding the main chip region, forming an insulating layer over the semiconductor substrate, forming an insulating guard ring in the insulating layer in the scribe lane region and the insulating guard ring surrounds at least a portion of the main chip region. The method further includes forming at least one conductive guard ring in the insulating layer in the scribe lane region and the at least one conductive guard ring surrounds at least a portion of the main chip region. The insulating guard ring is formed of a material layer having a brittleness greater than a brittleness of the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the formation of the insulating layer, the insulating guard ring, and the at least one conductive guard ring may comprise forming a lower interlayer dielectric layer over the semiconductor substrate, forming a lower insulating guard ring surrounding the main chip region in the lower interlayer dielectric layer, forming at least one lower conductive guard ring surrounding the main chip region in the lower interlayer dielectric layer, forming an upper interlayer dielectric layer over the lower interlayer dielectric layer, the lower insulating guard ring, and the at least one lower conductive guard ring, forming an upper insulating guard ring that penetrates the upper interlayer dielectric layer to contact the lower insulating guard ring, and forming at least one upper conductive guard ring that penetrates the upper interlayer dielectric layer to contact the at least one lower conductive guard ring.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other embodiments, the insulating guard ring may be formed of a porous insulating layer. The porous insulating layer may be formed of one of a Fluorosilicate Glass (FSG) layer, a SiOC layer, a SiOCH layer, a SiLK&#x2122; resin layer, and a SiN layer.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> may be provided to include main chip regions MC and a scribe lane region SL therebetween. A device isolation layer <b>12</b> may be disposed in a certain region of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to define an active region <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The active region <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be located in the scribe lane region SL. Unlike this, the device isolation layer <b>12</b> may extend into the scribe lane SL as indicated by the dotted line <b>12</b><i>f </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An insulating layer <b>31</b> may be disposed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The insulating layer <b>31</b> may include a plurality of stacked interlayer dielectric layers. For example, the insulating layer <b>31</b> may include a lower interlayer dielectric layer <b>14</b>, a first interlayer dielectric layer <b>18</b>, a second interlayer dielectric layer <b>24</b>, and an upper interlayer dielectric layer <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A main chip, i.e., a semiconductor device may comprise an integrated circuit which is formed in the insulating layer <b>31</b> of each of the main chip regions MC. The semiconductor device may comprise a semiconductor memory device or a semiconductor logic device. The integrated circuit may include a plurality of discrete devices such as, for example, transistors, resistors and/or capacitors which are electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A guard ring <b>34</b> may be disposed in the insulating layer <b>31</b> in the scribe lane region SL, thereby surrounding at least a portion of each of the main chip regions MC. The guard ring <b>34</b> may be disposed in a groove <b>31</b><i>g </i>vertically passing through the insulating layer <b>31</b> to contact the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The guard ring <b>34</b> may be a material layer having a brittleness greater than that of the insulating layer <b>31</b>. The main chip region MC and the guard ring <b>34</b> surrounding the main chip region MC may constitute a semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;brittleness&#x201d; means the properties opposite to &#x201c;softness&#x201d;. The brittleness relates to the Young's modulus. The meaning of &#x201c;the brittleness of a first material layer is greater than that of a second material layer&#x201d; is that &#x201c;the minimum stress required to destroy the first material layer is less than that required to destroy the second material layer&#x201d;. For example, if the first material layer has a first brittleness and the second material layer adjacent to the first material layer has a second brittleness less than the first brittleness, most of external stress applied to the first material layer may be dispersed and extinguished in the first material layer. Consequently, the first material layer may be destroyed by itself. Accordingly, it can prevent the stress applied to the first material layer from being delivered to the second material layer adjacent to the first material layer. That is, the first insulating layer may serve as a stress buffer for the second insulating layer. Accordingly, even though a stress is applied to the first insulating layer, generation of cracks in the second insulating layer may be significantly suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment, the guard ring <b>34</b> may be an insulating guard ring. The insulating guard ring may be, for example, a porous insulating layer. The porous insulating layer may include, for example, an insulating layer containing at least one of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and fluorine. For example, the porous insulating layer may include a fluorosilicate glass (FSG) layer, a SiOC layer, a SiOCH layer, a SiLK&#x2122; resin layer, or a SiN layer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment, at least one conductive guard ring may be further disposed in the insulating layer <b>31</b> between the main chip region MC and the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> surrounding the main chip region MC. For example, the at least one conductive guard ring may include an internal conductive guard ring GR<b>1</b> and an external conductive guard ring GR<b>2</b>. The internal conductive guard ring GR<b>1</b> may be disposed in the insulating layer <b>31</b> between the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> and the main chip region MC, and the external conductive guard ring GR<b>2</b> may be disposed in the insulating layer <b>31</b> between the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> and the internal conductive guard ring GR<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The internal conductive guard ring GR<b>1</b> may include a lower conductive guard ring <b>16</b><i>a </i>in the lower interlayer dielectric layer <b>14</b>, a first conductive guard ring <b>22</b><i>a </i>in the first interlayer dielectric layer <b>18</b>, the second conductive guard ring <b>28</b><i>a </i>in the second interlayer dielectric layer <b>24</b>, and the upper conductive guard ring <b>36</b><i>a </i>on the upper interlayer dielectric layer <b>30</b>. The lower conductive guard ring <b>16</b><i>a</i>, the first conductive guard ring <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the second conductive guard ring <b>28</b><i>a</i>, and the upper conductive guard ring <b>36</b><i>a </i>may be connected to each other through conductive via plugs <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a </i>which vertically penetrate the interlayer dielectric layers <b>18</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively. The conductive via plugs <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>a </i>may also have a loop-shaped configuration when viewed from the top plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Similarly, the external conductive guard ring GR<b>2</b> may include a lower conductive guard ring <b>16</b><i>b</i>, a first conductive guard ring <b>22</b><i>b</i>, a second conductive guard ring <b>28</b><i>b</i>, and an upper conductive guard ring <b>36</b><i>b</i>, which are sequentially stacked in the insulating layer <b>31</b>. Further, the lower conductive guard ring <b>16</b><i>b</i>, the first conductive guard ring <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the second conductive guard ring <b>28</b><i>b</i>, and the upper conductive guard ring <b>36</b><i>b </i>may be connected to each other through conductive via plugs <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>which vertically penetrate the interlayer dielectric layers <b>18</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively. The conductive via plugs <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>may also have a loop-shaped configuration when viewed from the top plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The conductive guard rings GR<b>1</b> and GR<b>2</b> may include a metal layer. For example, the lower conductive guard rings <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>, the first conductive guard rings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and the second conductive guard rings <b>28</b><i>a </i>and <b>28</b><i>b </i>may include a copper layer or a tungsten layer, and the upper conductive guard rings <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b </i>may include an aluminum alloy layer. The conductive via plugs <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>may also include, for example, a copper layer or a tungsten layer.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A bonding pad <b>36</b><i>p </i>may be disposed on a certain area of the insulating layer <b>31</b> in the main chip region MC. The bonding pad <b>36</b><i>p </i>may be the same material layer as the upper conductive guard rings <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b</i>. The insulating layer <b>31</b> in the main chip region MC may be covered with a passivation layer <b>38</b> having a pad window <b>40</b><i>w </i>which exposes the bonding pad <b>36</b><i>p</i>. In addition, a polyimide layer <b>40</b> may be disposed on the passivation layer <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The width Wp of the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> may be less than the width W<b>1</b> of the internal conductive guard ring GR<b>1</b> and the width W<b>2</b> of the external conductive guard ring GR<b>2</b>. Even though the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> has the width Wp less than the width W<b>2</b> of the external conductive guard ring GR<b>2</b>, the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> may be more excellent than the external conductive guard ring GR<b>2</b> in terms of the stress buffer. Accordingly, when the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> is employed instead of an additional conductive guard ring, the width of the scribe lane region SL may be significantly reduced without degradation of the stress buffering effect. Consequently, the number of the main chips formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> can be increased by disposing the guard ring <b>34</b> having a greater brittleness than the insulating layer <b>31</b> inside the insulating layer <b>31</b> of the scribe lane region SL.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A method for fabricating the semiconductor chip according to an embodiment of the inventive concept is not limited to the above embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref>. For example, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref> may also be applied to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. That is, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref> may be applied to fabrication of the semiconductor chip including the insulating guard ring <b>34</b>&#x2032; discontinuously surrounding the main chip region MC as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In addition, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref> may be applied to fabrication of the semiconductor chip including the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> between the conductive guard rings GR<b>1</b> and GR<b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating a method of fabricating a semiconductor chip according to another embodiment. This embodiment is different from the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref> in the method for forming the guard ring <b>34</b>. Accordingly, the same process steps as the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref> will be omitted or briefly described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, an insulating layer <b>31</b> including a plurality of interlayer dielectric layers <b>14</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>30</b> may be formed over a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, and then the insulating layer <b>31</b> may be patterned to form a groove <b>31</b><i>g </i>discontinuously or continuously surrounding the main chip region MC. A guard ring layer <b>34</b>L having a brittleness greater than the insulating layer <b>31</b> may be formed over the substrate having the groove <b>31</b><i>g</i>. The guard ring layer <b>34</b>L may be formed using a chemical vapor deposition technique, e.g., a plasma chemical vapor deposition technique.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The guard ring layer <b>34</b>L may be formed of the same material layer as the insulating guard rings of the embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3E</figref>. The guard ring layer <b>34</b>L may be planarized to expose the upper surface of the insulating layer <b>31</b>. Consequently, a guard ring <b>34</b>, i.e., an insulating guard ring may be formed in the groove <b>31</b><i>g</i>. Thereafter, a bonding pad, internal/external conductive interconnections, a passivation layer, and a polyimide layer may be formed using the same method as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a die sawing process for physically separating semiconductor chips from each other according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the semiconductor chips fabricated according to embodiments of the inventive concept should be physically separated from each other through a die sawing process. The die sawing process can be achieved by cutting a scribe lane region SL of a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> using a sawing blade BL.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">During the die sawing process, a stress ST may be generated in the scribe lane region SL as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The stress ST may be applied to a guard ring <b>34</b>, e.g., an insulating guard ring surrounding at least a portion of a main chip region MC. The stress ST may be dispersed in the upward and downward directions as shown by the arrows &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;B&#x201d; and extinguished in the insulating guard ring <b>34</b>. Accordingly, the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> may be destroyed by itself, and some portions of the insulating guard ring <b>34</b> may be detached from the scribe lane region SL. This is because the guard ring <b>34</b> may be formed of a material layer having a brittleness greater than the insulating layer <b>31</b>. Accordingly, the stress ST generated in the scribe lane region SL during the die sawing process can be considerably alleviated because of the presence of the guard ring <b>34</b>. That is, the guard ring <b>34</b> may suppress the stress ST applied to the scribe lane SL from being delivered to the main chip region MC. Consequently, due to the presence of the guard ring <b>34</b>, it can prevent defects such as cracks from being generated in the main chip region MC at least during the die sawing process.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to embodiments of the inventive concept, a guard ring surrounding a main chip region may have a brittleness greater than those of insulating layers formed over the semiconductor substrate. Accordingly, even though a stress is generated during a die sawing process of cutting a scribe lane region surrounding the main chip region, the stress can be considerably reduced. Consequently, as cracks can be inhibited in insulating layers forming an integrated circuit in the main chip region, the reliability of the integrated circuit can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition, the guard ring is more excellent than a conductive guard ring in terms of stress-blocking performance. Accordingly, the width of the guard ring can be less than the width of the conductive guard ring. Consequently, the width of the scribe lane region between the main chip regions can be reduced, thereby maximizing the number of main chips formed in one semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The above-disclosed subject matter is to be considered illustrative and not restrictive, and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications, enhancements, and other embodiments, which fall within the true spirit and scope of the inventive concept Thus, to the maximum extent allowed by law, the scope of the inventive concept is to be determined by the broadest permissible interpretation of the following claims and their equivalents, and shall not be restricted or limited by the foregoing detailed description.</p>
