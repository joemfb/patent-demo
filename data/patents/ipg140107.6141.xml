<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a computing device, a computerized method and a non-transitory storage medium are applied in checking a stored wiring diagram for high-noise components in close proximity to signal lines. An electronic component is selected in a PCB wiring file. A checking range of the selected electronic component is determined for searching for one or more signal transmission lines which pass within the checking range in the PCB wiring file. Basic information of the one or more signal transmission lines is recorded into a result list which is displayed on a display unit of the computing device.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Printed circuit boards (PCBs) may include a component layer which is on the top of the PCB, and one or more wiring layers which are inside the PCB. Electronic components, especially high noise components, such as voltage regulators and crystal oscillators mounted on the component layer, may cause electromagnetic inference (EMI) to the signal transmission lines embedded in the wiring layers, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The electromagnetic inference may degrade signals passing through the signal transmission lines, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For avoiding the electromagnetic inference, the signal transmission lines need to be kept away from the high noise components. However, existing PCB wiring software does not alert a wiring engineer of any signal transmission lines near the high noise components. Thus, the wiring engineer must check for this manually. It is time-consuming and troublesome for the wiring engineer to do the check.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In step S<b>11</b>, the loading module <b>100</b> loads a PCB wiring file <b>60</b> from the storage unit <b>30</b> of the computing device <b>1</b>, and obtains the wiring diagram in the PCB wiring file <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step S<b>12</b>, the receiving module <b>12</b> receives a preset distance D and one or more named keywords of electronic components of the wiring diagram in the PCB wiring file <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, D=30 mils. In any other embodiment, D may be 0 or any other value. The named keyword may consist of U*, which means an initial character of the component name of an electronic component is U, such as U<b>1</b>, U<b>2</b>, U<b>3</b>, an so on. In one embodiment, the electronic components refer to high noise components.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step S<b>13</b>, the filtering module <b>13</b> filters one or more electronic components from the PCB wiring file according to the named keyword, and records the filtered electronic components into a filtered list. For example, if the keyword name is U*, the filtered electronic components may by U<b>1</b>, U<b>2</b>, and U<b>3</b>, for example, and if the keyword name is *U, the filtered electronic components may be, <b>1</b>U, <b>2</b>U, and <b>3</b>U, for example.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In step S<b>15</b>, the computation module <b>15</b> computes a surrounding box of the selected electronic component according to coordinates of the selected electronic component. The surrounding box is a minimal cube which can enclose the selected electronic component. In one embodiment, the computation module <b>15</b> acquires coordinates of edge points of the selected electronic component, and computes the surrounding box according to the coordinates of the edge points. One example of the surrounding box is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step S<b>16</b>, the computation module <b>15</b> further computes a checking range of the selected electronic component according to the surrounding box and the preset distance D. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the checking range is computed by adding the preset distance D to each dimension of the surrounding box.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In step S<b>17</b>, the searching module <b>16</b> determines whether there are one or more signal transmission lines which pass within the checking range, by searching for such signal transmission lines within the checking range. Step S<b>18</b> is implemented if at least one such signal transmission line exists, otherwise, step S<b>19</b> is implemented if no such signal transmission line exists.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In step S<b>18</b>, the searching module <b>16</b> records basic information of the signal transmission lines that pass through the checking range into a result list. In one embodiment, the basic information may include line names of the signal transmission lines, PCB layers where the signal transmission lines embedded in, and coordinates of intersection points between the signal transmission lines and the checking range. The result list can be displayed on the display unit <b>40</b>. From the result list, a user can know which signal transmission lines are near high noise components in the wiring diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step S<b>19</b>, the determination module <b>17</b> whether any other electronic components in the filtered list remains to be selected. The procedure returns to step S<b>14</b> if any one of the electronic components in the filtered list remains to be selected. The flow ends if every electronic component in the filtered list has been selected.</p>
