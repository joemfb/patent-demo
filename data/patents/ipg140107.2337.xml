<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a honeycomb structure. More specifically, the present invention relates to a honeycomb structure capable of inhibiting pressure loss from increasing upon trapping particulate matter in exhaust gas and effectively combusting and removing the trapped particulate matter.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a growing requirement for removing particulate matter in exhaust gas discharged from internal combustion engines such as an automobile engine, a construction machine engine, and an industrial machine stationary engine, other burning appliances, and the like in consideration of an influence on environment. Therefore, a honeycomb structure made of ceramic or the like is widely used as a filter (diesel particulate filter: DPF) for removing particulate matter. As a DPF, there is used a filter having a structure where predetermined cells having openings on one end and plugged end portions on the other side and the other cells having plugged end portions on one end and openings on the other side are alternately disposed. When it is used, a fluid (exhaust gas) is allowed to flow into the structure from one end portion where the predetermined cells have openings, and the exhaust gas is passed through the partition walls and flow out to the other cells as a permeated fluid, which is discharged from the other end portion where the other cells are open. Thus, particulate matter in exhaust gas can be trapped and removed by the partition walls.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, in the DPF, a catalyst is sometimes loaded inside pores or the like of the partition walls in order to combust and remove trapped particulate matter (see, e.g., JP-Y-2607898, JP-A-2007-289902, and JP Application 2006-36185).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the DPF, particulate matter is trapped by partition walls when exhaust gas is passed through the pores of the partition walls. When the pore diameter of the partition walls is increased, a large amount of particulate matter enters the pores to cause clogging of the pores, thereby causing a problem of increase in pressure loss upon treating exhaust gas. On the other hand, when the pore diameter of the partition walls is decreased to make particulate matter hardly enters, increase in pressure loss due to deposition of particulate matter inside the pores can be inhibited. However, passages in the walls are narrow to cause a problem of increasing pressure loss before the particulate matter deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, as the utility model described in the Patent Document 1, there can be considered a technique of two-layer structure having a coat to inhibit microparticles from entering the pores on the surface of the substrate. In this case, pressure loss before deposition of the particulate matter can be suppressed. However, particularly in the presence of a loaded catalyst, since particulate matter does not enter the pores, particulate matter is hardly brought into contact with the catalyst loaded in the pores, and combustion of the particulate matter cannot effectively be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, there have been proposed, as the invention described in the Patent Document 2, a method where the surface of the substrate is made uneven in order to positively increase a contact area between particulate matter and a catalyst, and, as the invention described in the Patent Document 3, a method where the pore diameter of the substrate is increased with forming a coat for inhibiting the particulate matter from leaking out on the surfaces of the cells on the outlet side. In any of the cases, though an effect can be admitted under conditions where particulate matter is combusted and removed, there arises a problem of increasing pressure loss due to deposit of particulate matter in the substrate under conditions where temperature of exhaust gas upon trapping particulate matter is low without combustion removal of particulate matter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of such problems of the prior art and aims to provide a honeycomb structure capable of inhibiting pressure loss from increasing upon trapping particulate matter in exhaust gas and effectively combusting and removing the trapped particulate matter with inhibiting pressure loss also when a small amount of particulate matter deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided the following honeycomb structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">[1] A honeycomb structure comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a porous substrate having porous partition walls separating and forming a plurality of cells functioning as fluid passages, a porous coat layer disposed on a surface of the partition walls to inhibit microparticles from entering, a surface of the coat layer having an uneven shape to increase a surface area of the coat layer with respect to the case of a flat surface, and plugging portions for plugging cells, so that a fluid flowing into the structure from an opening portions on one end side of predetermined cells may pass through the partition walls and flows out from opening portions on the other side of the other cells to allow the gas to flow through the partition walls and the coat layers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">[2] A honeycomb structure according to [1], wherein an average height of protrusions of the uneven shape of the coat layer is 20 to 300 &#x3bc;m and wherein an average gap between the protrusions is 30 &#x3bc;m to 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">[3] A honeycomb structure according to [1] or [2], wherein the coat layer has an average pore diameter of 0.1 to 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">[4] A honeycomb structure according to any one of [1] to [3], wherein the surface area of the coat layer is 1.05 to 10 times the surface area of a sup positional plane coat layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">[5] A honeycomb structure according to any one of [1] to [4], wherein a hydraulic diameter of the cells is 0.72 to 0.96 times a hydraulic diameter of the porous substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">[6] A honeycomb structure according to any one of [1] to [5], wherein the partition walls of the porous substrate has an average pore size of 1 to 100-&#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">[7] A honeycomb structure according to any one of [1] to [6], wherein a catalyst is loaded on a surface of the coat layer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">[8] A honeycomb structure according to any one of [1] to [7], having a relation of A&#x3c;B where A is a total area of a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the predetermined cells having plugged end portions on one side and where B is a total area of a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the other cells having plugged end portions on the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">[9] A honeycomb structure according to any one of [1] to [8], wherein a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the predetermined cells having plugged end portions on one side has a different shape from that of a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the other cells having plugged end portions on the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A honeycomb structure of the present invention is provided with a porous coat layer for inhibiting microparticles from entering on the surface of the partition walls, and the surface of the coat layer has an uneven shape for increasing the surface area of the surface of the coat layer. Therefore, when combusting and removing the trapped particulate matter contained in exhaust gas with loading a catalyst on a surface of the coat layer, the particulate matter can be trapped on the surface of the coat layer to inhibit the particulate matter from entering the pores of the coat layer and the partition walls, thereby suppressing increase in pressure loss. Further, since the surface area of the coat layer is increased due to an uneven structure of the coat layer, a sufficient amount of a catalyst loaded on the surface of the coat layer can be secured, and particulate matter trapped at the surface of the coat layer can effectively be combusted and removed.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments for carrying out the present invention will hereinbelow be described specifically. However, the present invention is by no means limited to the following embodiments, and it should be understood that changes, improvements, or the like of the design may suitably be made on the basis of ordinary knowledge of a person of ordinary skill within the range of not deviating from the gist of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b>A, one embodiment of a honeycomb structure of the present invention is provided with a porous substrate <b>1</b> having porous partition walls <b>3</b> separating and forming a plurality of cells <b>2</b> functioning as fluid passages and porous coat layer <b>11</b> disposed on a surface of the partition walls to inhibit microparticles from entering. A surface of the coat layer has an uneven shape to increase a surface area of the coat layer with respect to the case of a flat surface, and the honeycomb structure is provided with plugging portions in one end portions of predetermined cells and the other end portions of the other cells to allow the gas to flow through the partition walls and the coat layer. Here, &#x201c;inhibit microparticles from entering&#x201d; means that microparticles do not clog the gas flow passage inside the substrate and shows that the gas flow passages are secured with no rise in pressure loss though there is a case of a closed pore where the gas flow stagnates or a case that microparticles adhere to a wall face of a pore. In addition, an &#x201c;uneven shape to increase a surface area&#x201d; means a shape of undulations, protrusions, and depressions which increase a microparticle deposition area of the porous coat layer itself. An uneven shape by a particle of a constituent for a coat layer or a needle crystal itself does not fall under the &#x201c;uneven shape to increase a surface area&#x201d; because the piece itself is not porous. In a honeycomb structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, an average height of protrusions <b>12</b> of the uneven shape of the coat layer <b>11</b> is preferably 20 to 300 &#x3bc;m, and an average interval (average of interval W) between the protrusions <b>12</b> and <b>12</b> is preferably 30 &#x3bc;m to 10 mm. In addition, the coat layer <b>11</b> has an average pore diameter of preferably 0.1 to 20 &#x3bc;m. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing one embodiment of a honeycomb structure of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic view showing a part of a cross section perpendicular to the central axial direction of an embodiment of a honeycomb structure of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic view showing an enlarged region A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a honeycomb structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, an average height of protrusions <b>12</b> is preferably 20 to 300 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 30 to 150 &#x3bc;m, and particularly preferably 50 to 100 &#x3bc;m. When it is below 20 &#x3bc;m, a surface area of the coat layer <b>11</b> is hardly increased, and only a small amount of catalyst can be loaded lest the depressions should be filled with the catalyst, which may cause an insufficient loaded amount of the catalyst on the surface of the coat layer. When it is above 300 &#x3bc;m, pressure loss when exhaust gas flows inside the cells <b>2</b> of the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> may increase. The height H of the protrusion <b>12</b> is a height (distance) from the bottom of the depression to the top <b>13</b> of the protrusion <b>12</b>. The average of the height H of the protrusions <b>12</b> means the average of the height of the protrusions (protrusions in a projection view) <b>12</b><i>p </i>in a projection view when the coat layer <b>11</b> is projected on a plane perpendicular to the central axis of the honeycomb structure. More specifically, it is a value obtained as follows. From a microscope photograph of a cross section perpendicular to the central axis of the honeycomb structure, the thickness T (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) of a coat layer in the portion where the coat layer is thinnest is measured. Then, with regard to a sample piece cut out to have a size of 10 mm&#xd7;10 mm from the honeycomb structure, a coat layer in a cell is observed by a microscope along the central axial direction of the honeycomb structure. The image obtained by the microscope observation corresponds with a projection view (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) when the coat layer is projected on the plane perpendicular to the central axis of the honeycomb structure. In this projection view, the portion corresponding with the coat layer <b>11</b> is determined as a coat layer lip, the portion corresponding with the protrusion <b>12</b> is determined as a projection <b>12</b><i>p</i>, and the portion corresponding with the top <b>13</b> of the protrusion is determined as a top <b>13</b><i>p</i>. The height of the protrusion <b>12</b><i>p </i>of the coat layer lip observed above is determined as a value obtained by deducting T from the &#x201c;height (height in the projection view) Ha from the surface of the substrate to the top <b>13</b><i>p </i>of the protrusion&#x201d;. The average value of the heights of the protrusions <b>12</b><i>p </i>in the projection view is determined as the average height of the protrusions <b>12</b> in the honeycomb structure <b>100</b>. As the microscope, there may be employed a SEM (scanning electron microscope) with a scale or an optical microscope. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a projection view obtained by projecting a coat layer of the honeycomb structure of the present embodiment on a plane perpendicular to the central axis of the honeycomb structure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The average interval between the protrusions <b>12</b> and <b>12</b> is preferably 30 &#x3bc;m to 10 mm, more preferably 50 to 500 &#x3bc;m, and particularly preferably 80 to 200 &#x3bc;m. When the average interval is below 30 &#x3bc;m, the protrusions develop a tendency to overlap each other to decrease a surface area of the coat layer. When the average interval is above 10 mm, the number of the protrusions on the surface of the coat layer decreases to decrease a surface area of the coat layer, and thereby a load amount may be insufficient when a catalyst is loaded on a surface of the coat layer. The average interval between the protrusions means a distance between the tops of the adjacent protrusions. More specifically, the average interval between the protrusions is a value obtained by forming 10 sample pieces each having a size of 10 mm&#xd7;10 mm, enlarging and observing the surface of the coat layer of each of the sample pieces with a microscope or the like, measuring and averaging the intervals between the tops <b>13</b> of the five protrusions <b>12</b> per piece (average values at five points are calculated out for each sample piece), and further averaging the average values of the samples as the average value (average value of 10 sample pieces). As the microscope, a SEM with a scale or an optical microscope may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref> are schematic views of enlarged protrusions of a coat layer in a cross section perpendicular to the central axis of a honeycomb structure of the present invention. Each of the protrusions <b>12</b> is preferably in a state that a part of the coat layer <b>11</b> is raised due to a space <b>21</b> present inside each of the protrusions <b>12</b>. Such a structure of the protrusion <b>12</b><i>a </i>can be obtained by applying a coat layer raw material containing a space former on partition walls of a porous substrate upon manufacturing, and then burning away a pore former. The average particle diameter of the space former is preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m. The average particle diameter is a value measured by SEM observation. The average size (width) of the space <b>21</b> inside the protrusion is preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m. When the average width of the space <b>21</b> inside the protrusion is below 10 &#x3bc;m, a pressure loss-reducing effect is hardly obtained; while, when it is above 150 &#x3bc;m, a defect is easily caused in the coat layer. Here, the size (width) of the space <b>21</b> inside the protrusion means the maximum length of the space. In addition, the average size (width) of the space <b>21</b> inside the protrusion is a value obtained by observing the sample pieces cut out to have a size of 10 mm&#xd7;10 mm with a microscope and averaging the maximum length of each space appearing on the cross section of the protrusion with the number of the protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the protrusion <b>12</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the protrusion <b>12</b> is preferably in a state that a part of the coat layer <b>11</b> is raised due to a microparticle of a porous article <b>22</b> inside the protrusion <b>12</b>. Such a structure of the protrusion <b>12</b><i>b </i>can be obtained by applying a coat layer raw material containing microparticles of a porous article on partition walls of a porous substrate upon manufacturing. As the material for the porous article <b>22</b> is preferably ceramic having low thermal expansion coefficient and preferably the same material as that for the coat layer or the substrate. The average particle diameter of the porous article <b>22</b> used for manufacturing a honeycomb structure is preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m. The average particle diameter is a value measured by SEM observation. The average size (width) of the space <b>21</b> inside the protrusion is preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m. When the average width of the space <b>21</b> inside the protrusion is below 10 &#x3bc;m, a pressure loss-reducing effect is hardly obtained, while, when it is larger than 150 &#x3bc;m, a defect is easily caused in a coat layer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the protrusion <b>12</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the protrusion <b>12</b> is preferably in a state that a part of the coat layer <b>11</b> is raised due to the protrusion (protrusion of a partition wall) <b>23</b> formed on a surface of the partition wall <b>3</b>. As a method for thus forming the protrusion <b>23</b> on the partition wall of the porous substrate, there may be employed a method where extrusion forming through a die having a groove formed therein is performed, or a method where a formed substrate is subjected to etching. The average height of the protrusions <b>23</b> of the partition walls is preferably 20 to 200 &#x3bc;m. The average height of the protrusions <b>23</b> of the partition walls is measured by a method of observing a cross section with a microscope. Ten or more sample pieces each having a length of 10 mm are observed the maximum height in each piece is averaged by the number of the sample pieces. When the alignment of the protrusions has regularity, it is necessary to cut without bias in consideration of the alignment. Increasing the length and/or the number of the sample pieces may be recommended as necessary according to the shape and the number of the protrusions to avoid too much difference from the average in the whole honeycomb structure. Since there is a low probability of having the largest portion (top) in that the cutting plane when the number of the protrusion is small, it is important to measure substantial height with confirming the correlation between the sample number and size and the measured value.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As the protrusions <b>12</b><i>d </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the protrusions <b>12</b> have a corrugated shape (wavy shape) of the partition walls <b>3</b> and is preferably in a state that a part of the coat layer <b>11</b> is raised due to a mountain portion of the wavy shape (mountain portion of the partition wall) <b>24</b>. As a method for thus forming the partition walls of the porous substrate in a wavy shape, there may be employed a method where extrusion forming is performed with intentionally varying the density of the formed article or a method where a wavy plate is rolled to give a cylindrical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, the protrusions <b>12</b> may have mountain shapes having unfixed shapes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3</figref> to <b>5</b>, shapes of mountain portions of a corrugated shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or a columnar shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The protrusion <b>12</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has a columnar shape having a circular bottom face, and the protrusion <b>12</b><i>f </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has a columnar shape having a polygonal (quadrangular) bottom face. In addition, as the protrusion <b>12</b><i>g </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a protrusion may have a ridge shape extending along a wall face of a partition wall. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref> are perspective views each schematically showing an enlarged part of a surface of a partition wall of a honeycomb structure of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a honeycomb structure of the present invention, the coat layer <b>11</b> has an average pore diameter of preferably 0.1 to 20 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 1 to 15 &#x3bc;m, particularly preferably 10 to 15 &#x3bc;m. When the average pore diameter of the coat layer <b>11</b> is smaller than 0.1 &#x3bc;m, exhaust gas hardly passes through pores, and therefore the pressure loss may increase. In particular, in the case that a catalyst is loaded inside the pores of the coat layer, when the diameter is smaller than 10 &#x3bc;m, prone to be clogged with the catalyst, and exhaust gas hardly passes through the pores, and therefore the pressure loss may increase. When the average pore diameter is larger than 20 &#x3bc;m, particulate matter enters the pores to cause clogging of pores, and therefore the pressure loss may increase. The average pore diameter of the coat layer <b>11</b> is a value measured with a mercury porosimeter. Since it is necessary to measure pore diameters of only the coat layer, it is necessary to apply a resin or metal film on a face of a test piece other than the coat layer lest mercury should enter the test piece. From an image obtained by a SEM or the like, the pore diameters can be averaged by image processing.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The porosity of the coat layer <b>11</b> is preferably 40 to 85%, more preferably 50 to 75%. When it is below 40%, pressure loss increases, and thereby a treatable amount of exhaust gas may be reduced, while, when it is above 85%, a coat layer <b>11</b> is brittle and may be lost. The porosity of the coat layer <b>11</b> is measured by a mercury porosimeter. Since it is necessary to measure the porosity of only the coat layer, it is necessary to apply a resin or metal film on a face of a test piece other than the coat layer lest mercury should enter the test piece.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The surface area of the coat layer <b>11</b> is preferably 1.05 to 10 times, more preferably 1.2 to 2 times the surface area of a sup positional plane coat layer. When it is smaller than 1.05 times, the amount of catalyst loaded on a surface of the coat layer may be small, while, when it is larger than 10 times, pressure loss of exhaust gas flowing through the cells may increase. In addition, when it is larger than 2 times, there may be the case of reducing unevenness by loading the catalyst, thereby hardly obtaining an effect of increase in the surface area. The surface area of the coat layer <b>11</b> is a value calculated from a ratio of the demarcation line length of the uneven cross section to the straight line length of the observed portion by the observation of a cross section with a microscope. Ten sample pieces having a length of 10 mm are observed, and the length of unevenness of each sample piece is averaged to obtain 10 averages. When the alignment of the protrusions has regularity, it is necessary to cut without bias in consideration of the alignment. Increasing the length and/or the number of the sample pieces may be recommended as necessary according to the shape and the number of the protrusions to avoid too much difference from the average in the whole honeycomb structure. Since there is a low probability of having the largest portion (top) in the cutting plane when the number of the protrusion is small, it is important to measure substantial length of unevenness with confirming the correlation between the sample number and size and the measured value.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The thickness of the coat layer <b>11</b> is preferably 10 to 300 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 20 to 100 &#x3bc;m. When it is below 10 &#x3bc;m, the surface area of the coat layer is not increased, and the amount of the catalyst loaded on a surface of the coat layer may be small, while, when it is above 300 &#x3bc;m, pressure loss of exhaust gas flowing through the cells may increase. The thickness of the coat layer is a value measured by observing a cross section with a microscope. Ten sample pieces having a length of 10 mm are observed, and the thickness of the coat layer at ten points per piece is averaged, and the ten averages are further averaged.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Suitable examples of the material for forming the coat layer <b>11</b> include a material containing ceramic as the main component, heat resistant paper, and sintered metal. Specifically, in the case of a material containing ceramic as the main component, suitable examples of the ceramic include silicon carbide, cordierite, alumina titanate, sialon, mullite, silicon nitride, zirconium phosphate, zirconia, titania, alumina, silica, LAS (lithium aluminum silicate), and a combination of these components. Particularly suitable examples include ceramics such as silicon carbide, cordierite, mullite, silicon nitride, alumina, and alumina titanate in view of alkali resistant characteristics. Of these, oxide based ceramic is preferable also in view of costs. The same material as that for the substrate is particularly preferable in view of excellent thermal shock resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The thermal expansion coefficient in the cell extension direction of the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment at 40 to 800&#xb0; C. is preferably 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C. or less, more preferably 1.2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C. or less, particularly preferably 0.8&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C. or less. When it is 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C. or less, stress due to heat generation upon being exposed to high temperature exhaust gas can be suppressed within an acceptable range, and breakage of the honeycomb structure due to thermal stress can be inhibited. Though the thermal expansion coefficient is preferably as small as possible, the lower limit is about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>/&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Since the coat layer <b>11</b> is formed on the inner surface of the cells <b>2</b> (surface of the partition walls) in the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, the hydraulic diameter <b>31</b> of the cells <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is smaller than the hydraulic diameter of the &#x201c;cells of the porous substrate&#x201d;. The hydraulic diameter <b>31</b> of the cells <b>2</b> is preferably 0.72 to 0.96 times, more preferably 0.82 to 0.92 times that of the cells of the porous substrate <b>1</b>. When it is smaller than 0.72 times, pressure loss of exhaust gas flowing through the cells may increase. When it is larger than 0.96, since it means the height of the protrusions <b>12</b> is small, and therefore depressions may be filled with the catalyst loaded on the surface of the coat layer to decrease the surface area. Here, the &#x201c;hydraulic diameter&#x201d; means the largest inscribed circle of the coat layer in the cell. The hydraulic diameter of the cells <b>2</b> is a value measured by microscope observation of a cross section of a cell viewed in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, the porous substrate <b>1</b> has a honeycomb shape having porous partition walls <b>3</b> separating and forming a plurality of cells <b>2</b> functioning as fluid passages, and the average pore diameter of the partition walls <b>3</b> is preferably 5 to 100 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 10 to 40 &#x3bc;m. When it is below 5 &#x3bc;m, the pressure loss may be increased even in the case of little deposition of particulate matter, while, when it is above 100 &#x3bc;m, the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> may be brittle and have a loss. The average pore diameter of the partition walls <b>3</b> is measured with a mercury porosimeter. Since it is necessary to measure the pore diameter of only the substrate, it is necessary to apply a resin or metal film on a face of a test piece of the coat layer lest mercury should enter the coat layer. From an image obtained by a SEM or the like, the pore diameters can be averaged by image processing.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The porosity of the partition walls <b>3</b> is preferably 38 to 70%, more preferably 40 to 55%. When it is below 38%, pressure loss may increase, while, when it is above 70%, the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> may be brittle and have a loss. Further, when it is in the range from 40 to 55%, increase in pressure loss in the case of little deposition of particulate matter is little, and too much rise in temperature upon combusting and removing particulate matter is hardly caused preferably. The porosity of the partition walls <b>3</b> is measured with a mercury porosimeter. Since it is necessary to measure the porosity of only the substrate, it is necessary to apply a resin or a metal film on a face of a test piece of the coat layer lest mercury should enter the coat layer.</p>

In addition, though the size of the honeycomb structure is not particularly limited, the length in the central axial direction is preferably 40 to 500 mm. For example, in the case that the outer shape of the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> is circular, the radius of the bottom face is preferably 50 to 500 mm.</p>

Though there is no particular limitation on the material for the plugging portions with which openings of the cells are plugged, preferable examples of the material include alumina, cordierite, SiC, aluminum titanate, mullite, AlN, and Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Of these, cordierite, SiC, aluminum titanate, and mullite are preferable in that they have excellent thermal resistance and thermal shock resistance. In addition, it is more preferable that the material for the plugging portions is the same as that for the partition walls. The depth of the plugging portions in the cells from the end faces of the honeycomb structure is preferably 1 to 20 mm from the viewpoint of reducing pressure loss, increasing a catalyst effective area when a catalyst is loaded, and increasing strength though it is not particularly limited. Though the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment is provided with plugging portions in the other end portion of each of the predetermined cells and on one end portion of each of the other cells, the position of the plugging portion of each cell is not limited to this case. That is, the honeycomb structure of the present invention has plugging portions with which a fluid entering in the honeycomb structure from the openings on one end face side of the other cells passes through the partition walls and is discharged from the openings on the other end face side of the predetermined cells. In other words, the plugging portions may be formed inside the cells besides end portions of the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a honeycomb structure of the present invention, it is preferable that there is a relation of A&#x3c;B where A (mm<sup>2</sup>) is a total area of cross sections perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the predetermined cells having plugged end portions on one side and where B (mm<sup>2</sup>) is a total area of cross sections perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the other cells having plugged end portions on the other side. Further, it is preferable that a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the predetermined cells having plugged end portions on one side has a different shape from that of a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the other cells having plugged end portions on the other side. When the honeycomb structure of the present invention is used as a DPF, generally, all the cells have the same cross sectional shape (generally, quadrangular shape) and the same opening area, the end portions of the cells are alternately plugged in such a manner that the end face in the exhaust gas inlet side and the end face in the exhaust gas outlet side have a checkerwise pattern, and the opening ratio of the inlet side end face is the same as that of the outlet side end face. However, as another embodiment of the honeycomb structure of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, as a preferable embodiment, the cross sections (cross sections perpendicular to the central axis) of the cells <b>5</b> have an octagonal shape and a quadrangular shape, and the cross-sectional area (area of a cross section perpendicular to the central axis) of the octagonal cells <b>5</b><i>b </i>is larger than that of the quadrangular cells <b>5</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is a plan view schematically showing one end face where the cells having a larger cross-sectional area are open of another embodiment of a honeycomb structure of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a plan view schematically showing another end face where the cells each having a smaller cross-sectional area are open of another embodiment of a honeycomb structure of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Another embodiment of a honeycomb structure of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> is a cylindrical honeycomb structure where the cells <b>5</b> extending along the central axis are separated and formed by the partition walls <b>6</b>, and the quadrangular cells <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the octagonal cells <b>5</b><i>b </i>having a larger opening area are alternately disposed in two directions perpendicular to each other on each end face. Plugging is performed with a plugging material <b>7</b> in the quadrangular cells <b>5</b><i>a </i>on one end face and in the octagonal cells <b>5</b><i>b </i>on the other end face. Thus, by making the octagonal cells <b>5</b><i>b </i>having a larger opening area open on one end face and making the quadrangular cells <b>5</b><i>a </i>having a smaller opening area open on the other end face, the opening ratio on one end face can be made higher than that on the other end face. By setting one end face on the exhaust gas inlet side and setting the other end face on the exhaust gas outlet side when the honeycomb structure is used as a DPF, the surface area of the coat layer is increased by the uneven structure of the coat layer in comparison with the DPF (plugged honeycomb structure having a single cross-sectional shape (e.g., all the cells have a quadrangular cross-sectional shape) and, in addition, a catalyst amount loaded on the surface of the coat layer can sufficiently be secured to effectively combust and remove particulate matter trapped on the surface of the coat layer. In addition, through increase in pressure loss when gas flows is a concern because of narrow cell passages due to protrusions of the coat layer, rise of the pressure loss can be suppressed by increasing a cross-sectional area of the cells open on the inlet end face.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the honeycomb structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, it is preferable that a catalyst for combusting and removing particulate matter on the surface of the coat layer <b>11</b>. Since the surface area of the coat layer <b>11</b> is increased due to the uneven structure of the coat layer, a sufficient amount of catalyst can be secured on the surface of the coat layer. In addition, particulate matter trapped on the surface of the coat layer <b>11</b> can effectively be combusted and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A specific example of the catalyst contained in the catalyst layer loaded on the surface of the coat layer <b>11</b> is an oxidation catalyst for diesel engine exhaust gas purification. The oxidation catalyst for diesel engine exhaust gas purification contains noble metal. The noble metal is preferably one or more kinds selected from the group consisting of Pt, Rh, and Pd. The total amount of the noble metal is preferably 0.17 to 7.07 g per liter of the volume of the honeycomb structure. Further, a carrier coat contains, for example, a compound such as cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, and silica, or a combination thereof. The compound may be used together with a NOx selective reduction SCR catalyst or a NOx adsorber catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The NOx selective reduction SCR catalyst contains at least one kind selected from the group consisting of metal substituted zeolite, vanadium, titania, tungsten oxide, silver, and alumina.

Incidentally, the total amount of K, Na, Li, and Ca is preferably 0.5 g or more per liter of the volume of the honeycomb structure. When the catalyst for combusting and removing particulate matter is used together with the catalyst for oxidizing and removing NOx or the like, it is preferable to load the catalyst for combusting and removing particulate matter on a surface of the coat layer <b>11</b> and to load the catalyst for oxidizing and removing NOx or the like inside the pores of the coat layer <b>11</b> and/or inside the pores of the partition walls <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The honeycomb catalyst body of the present invention can be manufactured by loading a catalyst according to a manufacturing method based on a conventionally known method. Specifically, in the first place, catalyst slurry containing a catalyst is prepared. Next, the catalyst slurry is coated on pore surfaces of the partition walls of the honeycomb structure by the method of suction or the like. Then, the slurry is dried at room temperature or under heating conditions to obtain a honeycomb catalyst body of the present invention. In addition, the honeycomb structure and the honeycomb catalyst body of the present embodiment can effectively be used for various exhaust gas treatment systems. It is preferable that, when the catalyst for oxidizing and removing NOx or the like is loaded in the pores of the coat layers <b>11</b> and the partition walls <b>3</b>, the average pore diameters of the coat layers <b>11</b> and the partition walls <b>3</b> are preferably within preferable ranges described above. Incidentally, in the present specification, a &#x201c;catalyst&#x201d; simply referred to with no particular explanation means a &#x201c;catalyst for combusting and removing particulate matter&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The thickness of the oxidation catalyst loaded on a surface of the coat layer <b>11</b> is preferably 0.5 to 30 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 1 to 20 &#x3bc;m.

The amount of loaded oxidation catalyst is preferably 1 to 100 g, more preferably 10 to 50 g, per liter of the volume of the honeycomb structure. When it is below 1 g, the efficiency in combusting and removing particulate matter by the catalyst may be deteriorated, while, when it is above 100 g, pressure loss when exhaust gas flows through the cells may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, a method for manufacturing one embodiment of a honeycomb structure of the present invention will be described. The honeycomb structure of the present embodiment can be manufactured by the following method, for example. However, a method for manufacturing the honeycomb structure of the present embodiment is not limited to the following method.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A porous substrate (honeycomb formed article) constituting a honeycomb structure of the present invention can be manufactured according to a conventionally known method for manufacturing a diesel particulate filter (DPF), for example. Therefore, for example, by suitably adjusting the chemical composition of the material, by suitably adjusting the particle size of the raw material, or by suitably adjusting the kind, particle size, addition amount, and the like when porous structure is obtained by using a pore former, porosity and pore size can be controlled within predetermined ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the protrusions <b>23</b> of the partition walls are formed on a surface of the partition walls <b>3</b> of the porous substrate, it is preferable to subject the partition walls to etching by spraying a seal material on the surfaces of the cells of the honeycomb formed article formed in advance before immersing the honeycomb formed article in etching liquid such as acid to inhibit the portion protected with the seal material from being etched. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the protrusions <b>12</b><i>g </i>of the partition walls are formed on the surfaces of the partition walls <b>3</b> of the porous substrate <b>1</b>, it is preferable to perform extrusion forming through a die having grooves formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the partition walls <b>3</b> of the porous substrate <b>1</b> are formed in a corrugated shape, it is preferable to perform extrusion forming with intentionally varying density of the formed article or to roll a corrugated plate into a cylindrical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A predetermined amount of a powdered protrusion-forming material is sprayed on a honeycomb formed article before firing. Then, the honeycomb formed article is calcined to join the protrusion-forming material with the substrate. Then, a slurried coat material is allowed to flow on the surface to form a coat layer. Alternatively, as another method, coat liquid containing the protrusion-forming material dispersed therein in advance is directly allowed to flow in the honeycomb formed article to form a coat layer on the surface layer. In the case of forming a coat layer only on the inlet cell side, a mask is applied on an end face of a honeycomb formed article so that the coat liquid is allowed to flow only in the predetermined cells.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, it is preferable to plug both the end portions of the honeycomb formed article. Though there is no particular limitation on a method for plugging, for example, in the first place, a mask is applied on an end face on one end to alternately cover opening portions of the cells in such a manner that each end face has a checkerwise pattern. Then, plugging slurry containing a ceramic raw material, water, alcohol, and an organic binder is stored in a storage container. Then, the end portion having the mask is immersed in the plugging slurry in the storage container, thereby filling the plugging slurry into the opening portions of the cells without the mask to form plugging portions. For the other end portions, a mask is applied on the cells plugged on the one end side described above, and the plugging portions are formed in the same manner as the plugging on the one end side described above. Thus, the cells which are not plugged on the one end side are plugged on the other end side to having a checkerwise pattern also on the other end face. The plugging may be performed on a honeycomb fired article obtained by firing a honeycomb formed article. In this case, after the honeycomb fired article is plugged, it is fired again to obtain a porous substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, it is preferable to dry a honeycomb formed article having plugging portions to obtain a honeycomb dried article. There is no particular limitation on a drying method, and there may be employed a known drying method such as hot air drying, microwave drying, dielectric drying, reduced pressure drying, vacuum drying, and freeze drying. Of these, a combination of hot air drying with microwave drying or dielectric drying is preferable in that the whole formed article can be dried quickly and uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, it is preferable to calcine the honeycomb dried article obtained above before full firing to obtain a calcined article. The &#x201c;calcine&#x201d; means to combust and remove organic matter (an organic binder, a dispersant, a pore former, and the like) in the honeycomb formed article. Generally, the combustion temperature of the organic binder is about 100 to 300&#xb0; C., and the combustion temperature of the pore former is about 200 to 800&#xb0; C. Therefore, the calcination temperature is about 200 to 1000&#xb0; C. Though the calcination time is not particularly limited, it is generally about 10 to 100 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, a porous substrate is obtained by firing (fully firing) the calcined article. In the present invention, &#x201c;fully fire&#x201d; means to sinter the forming raw material in the calcined article for densification to ensure predetermined strength. Since the firing conditions (temperature and time) are different depending on the kind of the forming raw material, suitable conditions are selected according to the kind. For example, when a cordierite raw material is fired, it is preferable to fire at 1410 to 1440&#xb0; C. for about 3 to 200 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the above, formation of the coat layer and sintering of the honeycomb formed article were simultaneously performed. However, they may be performed separately in two steps. A coat layer is formed on a honeycomb porous substrate obtained by a generally-known manufacturing method to obtain a honeycomb structure. The coat layer is preferably obtained by using a raw material described as the material for the aforementioned coat layer (coat layer raw material), adding an additive to the coat layer raw material to obtain a coat layer-forming raw material, applying the coat layer-forming raw material on the inner wall surfaces (partition wall surfaces) of the cells of the porous substrate, drying the raw material, and firing the porous substrate with the raw material.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Examples of the additive include a dispersion medium, a pore former, an organic binder, and a dispersant.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Examples of the dispersion medium include water and alcohol.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Any pore former can be employed as long as it has a characteristic of flying and disappearing in the firing step, and an inorganic substance such as coke, a polymer compound such as a resin balloon, an organic substance such as starch, and the like can be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As the organic binder, there may be used hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxylmethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and the like. These may be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As the dispersant, ethyleneglycol, dextrin, fatty acid soap, polyalcohol, or the like may be used. They may be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the case of forming a space <b>21</b> in a protrusion <b>12</b><i>a</i>, it is preferable to add a space former as an additive to the raw material for the coat layer. As the material for the space former, a material usable as the above pore former is preferable. The average particle diameter of the space former is preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m. The average particle diameter of the space former is measured by observing a cross section with a microscope.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the case of disposing a porous body <b>22</b> in the protrusion <b>12</b><i>b</i>, it is preferable to add a porous body to the coat layer raw material as an additive. The material for the porous body is not particularly limited, and a material containing ceramic as the main component is a suitable example. Specifically, in the case of a material containing ceramics as the main component, suitable examples of the ceramic include silicon carbide, cordierite, alumina titanate, sialon, mullite, silicon nitride, zirconium phosphate, zirconia, titania, alumina, silica, and LAS (lithium aluminum silicate) and a combination thereof. In particular, ceramics such as silicon carbide, cordierite, mullite, silicon nitride, alumina, and alumina titanate are suitable in view of alkali resistance. Of these, oxide type ceramics are suitable also in view of costs. The material is preferably the same as that for the coat layer because there is no mismatch regarding thermal expansion. The average particle diameter of the porous body is preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m. The average particle diameter of the porous body is measured by observing a cross section with a microscope. The average pore diameter of the porous body is 1 to 100 &#x3bc;m. The average pore diameter of the porous body is measured by mercury porosimetry. The porosity of the porous body is preferably 35 to 80%. The porosity of the porous body is measured by mercury porosimetry.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the case of forming the protrusion <b>12</b><i>e </i>into a columnar shape having an elliptic bottom face, it is preferable that a plate-shaped porous material or a pore former such as carbon is punched out to have predetermined size and shape to use it as a protrusion-forming material.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the case of forming the protrusion <b>12</b><i>f </i>into a columnar shape having a polygonal (quadrangular) bottom face, it is preferable that a plate-shaped porous material or a pore former such as carbon is smashed to have predetermined size and shape to use it as a protrusion-forming material.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the case of forming the protrusion <b>12</b><i>g </i>into a ridge shape, starch is allowed to linearly flow, and a powdered protrusion-forming material is sprayed on the starch to form the protrusion linearly.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Examples of a method for applying a coat layer-forming raw material to the inner walls (partition walls) of the cells of the porous substrate include immersing using the surface tension and deposition of a to-be-coated substance mixed in liquid or a gel substance by filtration.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">There is no particular limitation on a method for drying the coat layer-forming raw material applied on the inner walls of the cells, and there can be used a known drying method such as hot air drying, microwave drying, dielectric drying, reduced pressure drying, vacuum drying, and freeze drying. Of these, a drying method where hot air drying is combined with microwave drying or dielectric drying is preferable in that the applied coat layer-forming raw material can be dried quickly and uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It is preferable that the dried coat layer-forming raw material is calcined before full firing to combust and remove organic matter (an organic binder, a dispersant, a pore former, a space former, and the like) contained in the dried coat layer-forming raw material. Generally, the combustion temperature of the organic binder is about 100 to 300&#xb0; C., and the combustion temperature of the pore former is about 200 to 800&#xb0; C. Therefore, the calcination temperature is about 200 to 1000&#xb0; C. Though the calcination time is not particularly limited, it is generally about 10 to 100 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Next, the calcined coat layer-forming raw material is fired (fully fired) to obtain a coat layer.

After suitable amounts of methyl celluloses and a surfactant are added to them, water was added, followed by mixing them to prepare kneaded clay. After vacuum deairing the kneaded clay, the kneaded clay was extrusion-formed to obtain a honeycomb formed article. Next, the honeycomb formed article was fired to obtain a honeycomb fired article (porous substrate). The firing conditions were 1400 to 1430&#xb0; C. and 10 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Next, plugging was performed to the honeycomb fired article. A mask was alternately applied on cell opening portions on one end face of the honeycomb fired article to show a checkerwise pattern, and the end portion where the mask was applied was immersed in the plugging slurry containing a cordierite material as the ceramic raw material to form plugging portions alternately disposed in a checkerwise pattern. Further, For the other end portion of the honeycomb fired article, a mask was applied for the cells plugged on one end portion, and plugging portions were formed in the same manner as the formation of plugging portions on one end portion described above.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Into the cells of the honeycomb fired article, a gel substance containing water or alcohol containing the protrusion-forming material and an organic binder was filled, and pressure was applied. A protrusion-forming material in the gel was filtered by the honeycomb sintered article and sprinkled on a surface. Then, after an air blow, it was dried to bond the protrusion-forming material with the honeycomb substrate. As the protrusion-forming material, a resin having an average particle diameter of 50 &#x3bc;m was used. The average particle diameter was measured by using an optical microscope with a scale.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the same manner, a gel substance containing cordierite microparticle and silica microparticles as coat layer components, water or alcohol, and an organic binder was filled into the cells, and pressure was applied. The cordierite microparticles and silica microparticles were filtrated by a honeycomb sintered article and deposited on a surface to cover the sintered article and the protrusion-forming material. Then, after an air blow, it was dried by hot air at 120&#xb0; C. for 24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Then, the dried honeycomb fired article with a coat layer (unfired coat layer) was fired at 1430&#xb0; C. for three hours to obtain a cylindrical honeycomb structure having a diameter of 190 mm and a length of 203 mm.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">From the microscope photograph of a cross section perpendicular to the central axis of the honeycomb structure, the coat layer thickness T at the position where the coat layer was thinnest was measured. Then, regarding a sample piece cut out to have a size of 10 mm&#xd7;10 mm of the honeycomb structure, a coat layer in a cell was observed with a microscope along the central axial direction of the honeycomb structure. The image obtained by the observation with the microscope corresponds with a projection view (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) of a coat layer projected on a plane perpendicular to the central axis of a honeycomb structure. The height of the protrusion observed in the projection view (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) was determined by deducting T from the &#x201c;height from the surface of the substrate to the top of the protrusion&#x201d;. The average value of the height of the protrusions in the projection view was determined as the average height (average protrusion height) of the protrusions of the honeycomb structure.
