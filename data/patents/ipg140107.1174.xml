<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be understood that once distal leg portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>and proximate leg portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>are properly fitted with distal collar <b>104</b> and proximate collar <b>106</b> (i.e., retaining system <b>100</b><i>b </i>is properly abutted against proximate leg portion <b>102</b><i>b</i>), the length of system <b>100</b> is relatively secure. In one embodiment, a set screw such as, for example, a pressure fit set screw, could be used to provide additional support for and security to system <b>100</b>. For example, as students use a desk system having system <b>100</b> installed on it, those students cannot adjust the height of system <b>100</b> without first positioning the desk system upside down.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Bores <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> could be used to install the set screw described above according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. For example, when the lip ends of each of distal collar <b>104</b> and proximate collar <b>106</b> (and in particular its respective lips <b>116</b>) are aligned and properly installed on distal leg portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>and proximate leg portion <b>102</b><i>b</i>, bores <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are generally aligned as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one example, should the furniture or desk system using system <b>100</b> require additional support or accessories, bores <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> could be aligned and a set screw placed therein to secure system <b>100</b>. It should be understood that bores <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> could be any suitably shaped, sized, or configured hole or hole-like structure. In one embodiment, bores <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> could include an outer diameter of about 0.187 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, system <b>100</b> generally provides an extendible leg assembly <b>100</b><i>a </i>and retaining system <b>100</b><i>b</i>. In one embodiment, system <b>100</b> could provide an adjusting and retaining system that is easily and safely adjustable, while maintaining a particular height and overall structural integrity of a furniture or desk system to, for example, withstand considerable weight and pressure exerted thereto.</p>
