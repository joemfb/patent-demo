<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates generally to a machine and, more particularly, to a machine with a pivotal connection between a frame and a conveyor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many machines are mobile machines configured to perform one or more tasks while traveling along a ground surface, such as a road surface. A cold planer is an example of such a mobile machine. The cold planer may include a grinding mechanism that grinds a top layer of the road surface. The cold planer may include a conveyor, connected to a frame of the machine, which receives the material that was removed from the road surface. The conveyor may convey the material to another vehicle, such as a dump truck, traveling next to the cold planer. The conveyor may be rotated relative to the machine frame, such that the conveyor is positioned to deposit the material into the dump truck, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,580 to Swisher, Jr. et al. (referred to as the Swisher patent), which issued on Apr. 20, 1982, discloses a conventional cold planer. An upper material lifting conveyor is connected to a main frame of the planer. Specifically, the conveyor includes an upper lug and a lower lug that are pivotally engaged, via a pair of conventional mounting pins, with a pair of corresponding lugs of the main frame. This arrangement allows the conveyor to rotate relative to the main frame.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Swisher patent suffers from numerous disadvantages. Specifically, the upper lifting conveyor is relatively heavy and long. Thus it is awkward to precisely align the conveyor relative to the main frame so that the mounting pins may be disposed through the holes in the lugs to connect the conveyor to the frame. For example, if the conveyor is positioned such that the holes in the upper and lower lugs are rotated even slightly relative to holes in the lugs of the frame, it may be impossible to insert the mounting pins through the lug holes. Specialized tooling is often required to first hold the conveyor, and then to precisely locate and orient the conveyor relative to the main frame. This tooling may be expensive, may not be readily available, and may require a long time to set up and adjust.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosed machine is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above and/or other problems of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure provides a machine configured to travel across a surface. A material removal mechanism is configured to remove material from the surface. A frame supports the material removal mechanism. A conveyor is configured to receive the material and to convey the material to a location off of the machine. A pivotal connection includes connectors connected to the frame and conveyor, respectively, which are configured to mate with one another to allow pivoting of the conveyor relative to the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosure further provides a cold planer configured to remove material from a surface of a roadway. A material removal mechanism is configured to remove material from the surface. A frame supports the material removal mechanism. A conveyor is configured to receive the material and to convey the material to a location off of the cold planer. A pivotal connection includes a frame-side structure and a conveyor-side structure. The frame-side structure includes at least one protrusion that extends from at least one frame-side flange connected to the frame. The conveyor-side structure includes at least one opening formed in at least one conveyor-side flange connected to the conveyor. The at least one protrusion is configured to mate with the at least one opening to allow pivoting of the conveyor relative to the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosure still further provides a cold planer configured to remove material from a surface of a roadway. A material removal mechanism includes a grinding mechanism configured to remove material from the surface of the roadway. A lower conveyor is located adjacent the material removal mechanism and is configured to receive the material removed from the surface of the roadway by the material removal mechanism. A frame supports the material removal mechanism and the lower conveyor. An upper conveyor is configured to receive the material from the lower conveyor and to further convey the material to a location off of the cold planer. A pivotal connection includes a first structure and a second structure. The first structure includes first and second flanges connected to one of the frame and the upper conveyor. The first structure also includes first and second protrusions that extend from top surfaces of the first and second flanges, respectively. The second structure includes third and fourth flanges connected to the other one of the frame and the upper conveyor. The second structure also includes first and second openings formed in the third and fourth flanges, respectively. The first and second protrusions are configured to mate with the first and second openings, respectively, to allow pivoting of the conveyor relative to the frame. The first and second openings have diameters that are approximately &#xbd; to 1&#x2033; larger than corresponding diameters of the first and second protrusions, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Support system <b>20</b> may include various components connecting frame <b>14</b> to ground engaging components <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> in a manner to support machine <b>10</b> from ground engaging components <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, the components connecting front ground-engaging component <b>24</b> to frame <b>14</b> may include an undercarriage bracket <b>28</b> connected to ground engaging component <b>24</b>, and a strut <b>30</b> connected to and extending up from undercarriage bracket <b>28</b>. Strut <b>30</b> may be engaged to frame <b>14</b> directly or through one or more other components (not shown) in a manner allowing a front portion of machine <b>10</b> to be supported by strut <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The engagement between strut <b>30</b> and frame <b>14</b> may be such that it allows rotation of strut <b>30</b>, undercarriage bracket <b>28</b>, and ground-engaging component <b>24</b> about a vertical axis <b>34</b> relative to frame <b>14</b>. This rotation capability may allow steering of ground-engaging component <b>24</b> and, thus, machine <b>10</b>. Steering system <b>22</b> may have one or more actuators (not shown) for controlling the rotation of strut <b>30</b>, undercarriage bracket <b>28</b>, and ground-engaging component <b>24</b> about vertical axis <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Similar to the components connecting front ground-engaging component <b>24</b> to frame <b>14</b>, support system <b>20</b> may include an undercarriage bracket <b>38</b> and a strut <b>40</b> supported from rear ground-engaging component <b>26</b>. Strut <b>40</b> may be engaged to frame <b>14</b> directly or through one or more other components (not shown) in a manner allowing a rear portion of machine <b>10</b> to be supported by strut <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The engagement between strut <b>40</b> and frame <b>14</b> may be such that it allows rotation of strut <b>40</b>, undercarriage bracket <b>38</b>, and ground-engaging component <b>26</b> about a vertical axis <b>44</b> relative to frame <b>14</b>. This rotation capability may allow steering of ground-engaging component <b>26</b>, and, thus, machine <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Machine <b>10</b> may include various components for controlling a lateral position and/or a steering angle of ground-engaging component <b>24</b> and/or ground engaging component <b>26</b>. To receive operator inputs regarding a desired position and/or steering angle of one or both of the ground-engaging components, machine <b>10</b> may include one or more operator-input devices. For example, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, steering system <b>22</b> may include a steering input <b>46</b> (such as a steering wheel, joystick, or other mechanism) that an operator may manipulate to signal desired steering changes. Similarly, steering system <b>22</b> may include an operator-input device (not shown) with which an operator may request inward or outward lateral movement, for example, of one or both of ground-engaging component <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to the components and systems mentioned above, machine <b>10</b> may have various other components and systems. For example, machine <b>10</b> may include a propulsion system for moving it along ground surface <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, such a propulsion system may include one or more components for driving ground-engaging components <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to propel machine <b>10</b>. For instance, where machine <b>10</b> includes a hydraulic pump (not shown) driven by a power source (not shown), machine <b>10</b> may include one or more hydraulic motors (not shown) drivingly connected to ground-engaging components <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to propel machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows further details of a pivotal connection <b>50</b> between frame <b>14</b> and upper conveyor <b>18</b>. Pivotal connection <b>50</b> may connect upper conveyor <b>18</b> with frame <b>14</b>, and may permit rotation of upper conveyor <b>18</b> relative to frame <b>14</b>, about a vertical axis <b>52</b>. Machine <b>10</b> may include one or more actuators, motors, or any other components for controlling rotation of upper conveyor <b>18</b> about vertical axis <b>52</b>. By this arrangement, upper conveyor <b>18</b> may be positioned so that the material removed from ground surface <b>12</b> and conveyed by upper conveyor <b>18</b> may be efficiently delivered, for example, to the box of a dump truck that is disposed proximate an end of upper conveyor <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Pivotal connection <b>50</b> may include a frame-side structure <b>54</b> and a conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> that cooperatively connect with one another. Frame-side structure <b>54</b> may be connected to frame <b>14</b>, either directly or indirectly with additional components between frame-side structure <b>54</b> and frame <b>14</b>. Frame-side structure <b>54</b> may include at least one frame-side flange <b>58</b>, which may be bolted, welded, or otherwise attached, again either directly or indirectly, to frame <b>14</b>. Flange <b>58</b> may extend approximately horizontally from frame <b>14</b> when machine <b>10</b> is located on a horizontal surface. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows flange <b>58</b> including a portion having a particular shape and being a relatively flat plate, flange <b>58</b> is not limited to this shape. For example, flange <b>58</b> may include one or more portions having a square, rectangular, triangular, or any other desired shape, and flange <b>58</b> need not be a flat plate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Flange <b>58</b> may include a connector <b>60</b> extending therefrom that cooperates with a corresponding connector (described below) on conveyor-side structure <b>56</b>. Connector <b>60</b> may be, for example, a protrusion that extends approximately perpendicularly from a top surface <b>62</b> of flange <b>58</b>. As shown in the drawings, the protrusion may be cylindrically shaped and may have an approximately circular cross-section. However, connector <b>60</b> may have any desired shape. Connector <b>60</b> may be connected to flange <b>58</b>, either permanently such as by welding, or temporarily with the use of bolts or other fasteners. Alternately, connector <b>60</b> may be formed when flange <b>58</b> is formed, such as through material removal operations that result in connector <b>60</b> being unitary and integral with flange <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> may be connected to upper conveyor <b>18</b>, either directly or indirectly with additional components between conveyor-side structure <b>58</b> and upper conveyor <b>18</b>. Conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> may include at least one conveyor-side flange <b>64</b>, which may be bolted, welded, or otherwise attached, again either directly or indirectly, to an end of upper conveyor <b>18</b>. Flange <b>64</b> may extend approximately horizontally from upper conveyor <b>18</b> when upper conveyor <b>18</b> is connected to frame <b>14</b> and machine <b>10</b> is located on a horizontal surface. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows flange <b>64</b> including a portion having a particular shape and being a relatively flat plate, flange <b>64</b> is not limited to this shape. For example, flange <b>64</b> may include one or more portions having a square, rectangular, triangular, or any other desired shape, and flange <b>64</b> need not be a flat plate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Flange <b>64</b> may include a connector <b>66</b> that cooperates with connector <b>60</b> of frame-side structure <b>54</b>. Connector <b>66</b> may be, for example, an opening or hole with an axis that extends approximately perpendicularly between top and bottom surfaces <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> of flange <b>64</b>. The hole may be sized, shaped, located, and/or otherwise oriented so that connector <b>60</b> is disposed within connector <b>66</b> and connectors <b>60</b>, <b>66</b> mate with one another. Thus, when connector <b>60</b> is a cylindrically shaped protrusion with an approximately circular cross-section, connector <b>66</b> may be a hole having a corresponding approximately circular cross-section that is slightly larger than that of the protrusion. For example, the diameter of the hole forming connector <b>66</b> may between &#xbd;&#x2033; to 1&#x2033; greater than the diameter of the protrusion forming connector <b>60</b>. Further, bottom surface <b>70</b> of flange <b>64</b> may contact top surface <b>62</b> of flange <b>58</b>. As a result, when upper conveyor <b>18</b> is rotated relative to frame <b>14</b>, connector <b>60</b> rotate within connector <b>66</b>, and flange <b>64</b> rotates on top of flange <b>58</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the hole forming connector <b>66</b> as a through hole (i.e., a hole extending all the way through flange <b>64</b>), the hole forming connector <b>66</b> may be a blind hole (i.e., a hole that does not extend all the way through flange <b>64</b>). A bushing or other structure may be disposed within the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary pivotal connection <b>50</b> in which each of frame-side structure <b>54</b> and conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> includes two flanges (i.e., frame-side structure <b>54</b> includes two flanges <b>58</b>, while conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> includes two flanges <b>64</b>). However, each of these structures is not required to include two flanges. For example, pivotal connection <b>50</b> may include frame-side structure <b>54</b> and conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> each including a single flange (i.e., one flange <b>58</b> and one flange <b>64</b>). Alternately, each of frame-side structure <b>54</b> and conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> may include three or more flanges.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows connector <b>60</b> being a protrusion and connector <b>66</b> being a hole that receives the protrusion, connectors <b>60</b>, <b>66</b> are not required to be a protrusion and a hole, respectively. For example, connector <b>60</b> may be a hole while connector <b>66</b> may be a protrusion extending downwardly and sized to be disposed within the hole. Alternately, connectors <b>60</b> and <b>66</b> may be altogether different structures that are configured to cooperatively mate with one another to connect upper conveyor <b>18</b> to frame <b>14</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described, the disclosure provides a pivotal connection that may be used between a frame and a conveyor in a cold planer. Specifically, the frame and conveyor may each include corresponding structures that permit connection of the conveyor to the frame as well as rotation of the conveyor relative to the frame after connection.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As disclosed, pivotal connection <b>50</b> may include frame-side structure <b>54</b> connected to frame <b>14</b>, and conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> connected to upper conveyor <b>18</b>. Frame-side structure <b>54</b> and conveyor-side structure <b>56</b> may include corresponding connectors that cooperatively connect and mate with one another, such that no additional or separate components (e.g., pins, fasteners, etc.) are required to rotatably connect upper conveyor <b>18</b> to frame <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As a result, assembly of upper conveyor <b>18</b> to frame <b>14</b> is greatly simplified as compared to the prior art. Specialized tooling is not required, for example, to hold and precisely position upper conveyor <b>18</b> relative to frame <b>14</b>, since a pair of conventional mounting pins is not required to be inserted through corresponding sets of through holes that must be accurately aligned relative to each other. Instead, upper conveyor <b>18</b> can be suspended by a support structure, and upper conveyor <b>18</b> may be incrementally lowered while the protrusions on frame-side support structure <b>54</b> are aligned with the corresponding holes on conveyor-side support structure <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, removal of upper conveyor <b>18</b> from machine <b>10</b> is greatly simplified as compared to the prior art. A support structure may be used to lift upper conveyor <b>18</b> approximately vertically off of frame <b>14</b>, without first requiring the removal of any pins or fasteners. Specialized tooling is not required to hold and precisely position upper conveyor <b>18</b> to prevent upper conveyor <b>18</b> from rotating relative to frame <b>14</b>, which may bind pins or fasteners within through holes formed in these components. Thus, the use of the disclosed pivotal connection provides numerous advantages over similar conventional connections.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with the present disclosure, a conventional connection between a frame and an upper conveyor in a cold planer may be modified to form the above-discussed pivotal connection. For example, tooling may be used to hold the upper conveyor relative to the machine frame, so that the conventional pins or fasteners connecting the upper conveyor and the frame may be removed. The upper conveyor may then be moved away from the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A protrusion may be formed in each of the holes of the flanges that are connected to the machine frame. For example, a bar of material having desired characteristics (material type, hardness, length, diameter, etc.) may be disposed in the flange hole. The material may then be permanently connected to the flange, such as by first placing the material in the hole, and then welding the material to the flange. Any desired final shaping of the protrusion may take place.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The existing hole in each of the flanges that are connected to the upper conveyor may be sized so that the protrusion may be received within the corresponding hole. The upper conveyor may then be suspended by a support structure, and the upper conveyor may be incrementally lowered, so that the protrusions formed on the machine frame flanges mate with the holes in the upper conveyor flanges.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After this modification, subsequent removal of the upper conveyor will no longer require the removal of separate pins or fasteners, but instead may be accomplished by lifting the upper conveyor approximately vertically off of the machine frame.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed machine. Other embodiments of the described machine will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the machine disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the disclosure being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
