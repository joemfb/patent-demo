<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to personal care compositions comprising a cationically modified starch polymer. More particularly, the present invention relates to personal care compositions comprising an anionic surfactant system and a cationically modified starch polymer. In one aspect, the present invention relates to personal care compositions as described above which further comprise one or more oily conditioning agents.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Shampoo compositions comprising various combinations of detersive surfactants and conditioning agents are known. These products typically comprise an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a conditioning agent such as silicone, hydrocarbon oil, fatty esters, or combinations thereof. These products have become more popular among consumers as a means of conveniently obtaining hair or skin conditioning and cleansing performance all from a single personal care product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, many shampoo compositions do not provide sufficient deposition of conditioning agents onto hair and skin during the cleansing process. Without such deposition, large proportions of conditioning agent are rinsed away during the cleansing process and, therefore, provide little or no conditioning benefit. Without sufficient deposition of the conditioning agent on the hair and skin, relatively high levels of conditioning agents may be needed in the personal cleansing composition to provide adequate conditioning performance. However, high levels of a conditioning agent can increase raw material costs, reduce lathering, and present product stability concerns.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Obtaining good deposition of a conditioning agent is further complicated by the action of detersive surfactants in the shampoo composition. Detersive surfactants are designed to carry away or remove oil, grease, dirt, and particulate matter from the hair and skin. As a result, the detersive surfactants can interfere with deposition of the conditioning agent and can remove both deposited and non-deposited conditioning agent during rinsing. Consequently, after rinsing, the deposition of the conditioning agent onto the hair and skin is reduced, which, in turn, reduces conditioning performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One method for improving deposition of a conditioning agent involves the use of certain cationic deposition polymers. Typically, these cationic deposition polymers are natural polymers, such as cellulosic or guar polymers that have been modified with cationic substituents. Sufficient deposition of conditioning agents can result from selecting a cationic deposition polymer with sufficient charge density and molecular weight in combination with an optimized surfactant system. However, to achieve this sufficient deposition in shampoo or body wash compositions, generally, the molecular weight of the cellulosic or guar deposition polymers is well above 200,000. High molecular weight cationic starches also have been available for a number of years. However, high molecular weight starches do not provide an appropriate level of wet conditioning or detangling of wet hair. Thus, a need still exists to provide both adequate wet conditioning and a high level of conditioning active deposition with a low cost cationic or amphoteric polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is also desirable that shampoo compositions which deliver conditioning agents do not result in a cleaning tradeoff, buildup, or reduced volume of the intended hair style, and, further, that the shampoos are storage stable. Previous attempts to achieve sufficient conditioning performance in shampoos have been made using dispersed droplets of silicone oil in combination with depositing high levels of high molecular weight polymer. However, these attempts result in buildup of polymer and conditioning agents, which potentially can result in a reduction of hairstyle volume. Thus, a need still exists to provide sufficient conditioning performance without a reduction in hairstyle volume with a low cost cationic or amphoteric polymer in a shampoo composition.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a personal cleansing composition which delivers superior conditioning benefits to hair and/or skin with a low cost cationic or amphoteric polymer without buildup effects or a reduced cleansing performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to a personal care composition comprising: (a) from about 0.01 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a water-soluble cationic cationically modified starch polymer, wherein said water-soluble cationically modified starch polymer has a molecular weight from about 1,000 to about 200,000 and a charge density from about 0.7 meq/g to about 7 meq/g; (b) from about 5 wt. % to about 50 wt. % of an anionic surfactant system, said anionic surfactant system comprising at least one anionic surfactant and having an ethoxylate level and an anion level, (i) wherein said ethoxylate level is from about 1 to about 6, and (ii) wherein said anion level is from about 1 to about 6; and (c) a cosmetically acceptable medium.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additionally, the present invention is directed to a personal care composition as described above further comprising from about 0.01 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of one or more oily conditioning agents.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is also directed to a method of treating hair or skin comprising the steps of applying the personal care composition as described above to the hair or skin and rinsing the hair or skin.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The combination of the cationically modified starch polymer with the anionic surfactant system of the present invention in personal care compositions provides enhanced deposition of conditioning agents to hair and/or skin without reducing cleansing performance. It is believed that certain specific anionic surfactant systems as described by the ethoxylate and anion levels maximize a conditioning benefit of a polymer via maximization of coacervate formation. Coacervates, without being limited to a particular theory, provide improved hair and skin conditioning without any additional conditioning actives. Further, when dispersed conditioning agent droplets are added to the system, the coacervate provides an improved mechanism for conditioning agent deposition.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">All molecular weights as used herein are weight average molecular weights expressed as grams/mole, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Herein, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;charge density&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the ratio of the number of positive charges on a monomeric unit of which a polymer is comprised to the molecular weight of said monomeric unit. The charge density multiplied by the polymer molecular weight determines the number of positively charged sites on a given polymer chain.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;solid particle&#x201d; as used herein means a particle that is not a liquid or a gas.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;water-soluble&#x201d; as used herein, means that the polymer is soluble in water in the present composition. In general, the polymer should be soluble at 25&#xb0; C. at a concentration of at least 0.1% by weight of the water solvent, preferably at least 1%, more preferably at least 5%, most preferably at least 15%.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;water-insoluble&#x201d; as used herein, means that a compound is not soluble in water in the present composition. Thus, the compound is not miscible with water.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise a cationically modified starch polymer, an anionic surfactant system, and a cosmetically acceptable medium. Each of these essential components, as well as preferred or optional components, is described in detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">A. Cationically Modified Starch Polymer</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise water-soluble cationically modified starch polymers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;cationically modified starch&#x201d; refers to a starch to which a cationic group is added prior to degradation of the starch to a smaller molecular weight, or to a starch to which a cationic group is added after modification of the starch to a desired molecular weight. The definition of the term &#x201c;cationically modified starch&#x201d; also includes amphoterically modified starch. The term &#x201c;amphoterically modified starch&#x201d; refers to a starch hydrolysate to which a cationic group and an anionic group are added.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise cationically modified starch polymers at a range of about 0.01% to about 10%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 5%, by weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cationically modified starch polymers for use in the personal care compositions of the present invention have a molecular weight from about 1,000 to about 200,000. In one embodiment of the present invention, the cationically modified starch polymers have a molecular weight from about 5,000 to about 100,000. As used herein, the term &#x201c;molecular weight&#x201d; refers to the weight average molecular weight. The weight average molecular weight may be measured by gel permeation chromatography (&#x201c;GPC&#x201d;) using an Alliance HPLC (Waters 2695 Separation Module) with two hydrogel columns in series (Waters Ultrahydrogel Linear 6-13 um, 7.8&#xd7;300 nm GPC column, part number 011545) at a column temperature of 30&#xb0; C. and at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min, and using a Viscotek Model 300 TDA (triple detector array), light scattering detector (single angle, 90&#xb0;), viscosity detector, and refractive index detector, all at detector temperatures of 30&#xb0; C., with a method created by using pullulan narrow standard P-800 from American Polymer Standards Corporation (M<sub>w</sub>=788,000), with an injection volume of 25 to 100 &#x3bc;l, and using a dn/dc of 0.147. Additional details on measuring the weight average molecular weight according to a GPC method are described in U.S. Publication No. 2003/0154883 A1, entitled &#x201c;Non-Thermoplastic Starch Fibers and Starch Composition for Making Same.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The personal care compositions of the present invention include cationically modified starch polymers which have a charge density from about 0.7 meq/g to about 7 meq/g. The chemical modification to obtain such a charge density includes, but is not limited to, the addition of amino and/or ammonium groups into the starch molecules. Non-limiting examples of these ammonium groups may include substituents such as hydroxypropyl trimmonium chloride, trimethylhydroxypropyl ammonium chloride, dimethylstearylhydroxypropyl ammonium chloride, and dimethyldodecylhydroxypropyl ammonium chloride. See Solarek, D. B., <i>Cationic Starches in Modified Starches: Properties and Uses</i>, Wurzburg, O. B., Ed., CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. 1986, pp 113-125. The cationic groups may be added to the starch prior to degradation to a smaller molecular weight or the cationic groups may be added after such modification.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cationically modified starch polymers of the present invention generally have a degree of substitution of a cationic group from about 0.2 to about 2.5. As used herein, the &#x201c;degree of substitution&#x201d; of the cationically modified starch polymers is an average measure of the number of hydroxyl groups on each anhydroglucose unit which is derivatized by substituent groups. Since each anhydroglucose unit has three potential hydroxyl groups available for substitution, the maximum possible degree of substitution is 3. The degree of substitution is expressed as the number of moles of substituent groups per mole of anhydroglucose unit, on a molar average basis. The degree of substitution may be determined using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&#x201c;<sup>1</sup>H NMR&#x201d;) methods well known in the art. Suitable <sup>1</sup>H NMR techniques include those described in &#x201c;Observation on NMR Spectra of Starches in Dimethyl Sulfoxide, Iodine-Complexing, and Solvating in Water-Dimethyl Sulfoxide&#x201d;, Qin-Ji Peng and Arthur S. Perlin, <i>Carbohydrate Research, </i>160 (1987), 57-72; and &#x201c;An Approach to the Structural Analysis of Oligosaccharides by NMR Spectroscopy&#x201d;, J. Howard Bradbury and J. Grant Collins, <i>Carbohydrate Research, </i>71, (1979), 15-25.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cationically modified starch polymers for use in the personal care compositions of the present invention may comprise maltodextrin. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the cationically modified starch polymers may be further characterized by a Dextrose Equivalance (&#x201c;DE&#x201d;) value of less than about 35, and more preferably from about 1 to about 20. The DE value is a measure of the reducing equivalence of the hydrolyzed starch referenced to dextrose and expressed as a percent (on dry basis). Starch completely hydrolyzed to dextrose has a DE value of 100, and unhydrolyzed starch has a DE value of 0. A suitable assay for DE value includes one described in &#x201c;Dextrose Equivalent&#x201d;, <i>Standard Analytical Methods of the Member Companies of the Corn Industries Research Foundation, </i>1st ed., Method E-26. Additionally, the cationically modified starch polymers of the present invention may comprise a dextrin. Dextrin is typically a pyrolysis product of starch with a wide range of molecular weights.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The source of starch before chemical modification can be chosen from a variety of sources such as tubers, legumes, cereal, and grains. Non-limiting examples of this source starch may include corn starch, wheat starch, rice starch, waxy corn starch, oat starch, cassava starch, waxy barley, waxy rice starch, glutenous rice starch, sweet rice starch, amioca, potato starch, tapioca starch, oat starch, sago starch, sweet rice, or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment of the present invention, cationically modified starch polymers are selected from degraded cationic maize starch, cationic tapioca, cationic potato starch, and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, cationically modified starch polymers are cationic corn starch.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The starch, prior to degradation or after modification to a smaller molecular weight, may comprise one or more additional modifications. For example, these modifications may include cross-linking, stabilization reactions, phophorylations, and hydrolyzations. Stabilization reactions may include alkylation and esterification.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The cationically modified starch polymers in the present invention may be incorporated into the composition in the form of hydrolyzed starch (e.g., acid, enzyme, or alkaline degradation), oxidized starch (e.g., peroxide, peracid, hypochlorite, alkaline, or any other oxidizing agent), physically/mechanically degraded starch (e.g., via the thermo-mechanical energy input of the processing equipment), or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An optimal form of the starch is one which is readily soluble in water and forms a substantially clear (% Transmittance&#x2267;80 at 600 nm) solution in water. The transparency of the composition is measured by Ultra-Violet/Visible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometry, which determines the absorption or transmission of UV/VIS light by a sample, using a Gretag Macbeth Colorimeter Color i 5 according to the related instructions. A light wavelength of 600 nm has been shown to be adequate for characterizing the degree of clarity of cosmetic compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Suitable cationically modified starch for use in compositions of the present invention is available from known starch suppliers. Also suitable for use in the present invention is nonionic modified starch that could be futher derivatized to a cationically modified starch as is known in the art. Other suitable modified starch starting materials may be quaternized, as is known in the art, to produce the cationically modified starch polymer suitable for use in the invention.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">B. Anionic Surfactant System&#x2014;Ethoxylate Level and Anion Level</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise an anionic surfactant system. The anionic surfactant system is included to provide cleaning performance to the composition. The anionic surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant, and optionally an amphoteric surfactant, a zwitterionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a combination thereof. Such surfactants should be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or should not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics, or performance.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Suitable anionic surfactant components for use in the personal care composition herein include those that are known for use in hair care or other personal care compositions. The concentration of the anionic surfactant system in the personal care composition should be sufficient to provide the desired cleaning and lather performance, and generally ranges from about 5% to about 50%, preferably from about 8% to about 30%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, by weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In considering the performance characteristics of a personal care composition, such as coacervate formation, wet conditioning performance, dry conditioning performance, and conditioning ingredient deposition on hair, it is necessary to optimize the levels and types of surfactants in order to maximize the performance potential of polymer systems. The anionic surfactant system for use in the personal care compositions of the present invention has an ethoxylate level and an anion level, wherein the ethoxylate level is from about 1 to about 6, and wherein the anion level is from about 1 to about 6. The combination of such an anionic surfactant system with the cationically modified starch polymers of the present invention in personal care compositions provide enhanced deposition of conditioning agents to hair and/or skin without reducing cleansing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An optimal ethoxylate level can be calculated based on the stoichiometry of the surfactant structure, which in turn is based on a particular molecular weight of the surfactant where the number of moles of ethoxylation is known. Likewise, given a specific molecular weight of a surfactant and an anionization reaction completion measurement, the anion level can be calculated. Analytical techniques have been developed to measure ethoxylation or anionization within surfactant systems. The Level of Ethoxylate and the Level of Anion representative of a particular surfactant system are calculated from the percent ethoxylation and percent anion of individual surfactants in the following manner:</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Level of Ethoxylate in a composition=percent ethoxylation multiplied by percent active ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the composition).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Level of Anion in a composition=percent anion in ethoxylated surfactant multiplied by percent active ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the composition) plus percent anion in non-ethoxylated surfactant multiplied by percent active non-ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the composition).
<br/>
If a composition comprises two or more surfactants having different respective anions (e.g., surfactant A has a sulfate group and surfactant B has a sulfonate group), the Level of Anion in the composition is the sum of the molar levels of each respective anion as calculated above.
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Sample Calculation:</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Example 1 shows an ethoxylated surfactant that contains 0.294321% ethoxylate and 0.188307% sulfate as the anion and a non-ethoxylated surfactant that contains 0.266845% sulfate as an anion. Both surfactants are 29% active.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Level of Ethoxylate in Example 1=0.294321 multiplied by 14 (% active ethoxylated surfactant). Thus, the Level of Ethoxylate in the composition of Example 1 is approximately 4.12.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Level of Anion in Example 1=0.188307 multiplied by 14 (% active ethoxylated surfactant) plus 0.266845 multiplied by 2 (% active non-ethoxylated surfactant). Thus, the Level of Anion in the composition of Example 1 is approximately 3.17.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The anionic surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant comprising an anion selected from the group consisting of sulfates, sulfonates, sulfosuccinates, isethionates, carboxylates, phosphates, and phosphonates. Preferably, the anion is a sulfate.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Preferred anionic surfactants suitable for use in the personal care compositions are alkyl sulfates and alkyl ether sulfates. These materials have the respective formulae ROSO<sub>3</sub>M and RO(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O)<sub>x</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>M, wherein R is alkyl or alkenyl of from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, x is an integer having a value of from about 1 to about 10, and M is a cation such as ammonium, an alkanolamine such as triethanolamine, a monovalent metal such as sodium and potassium, or a polyvalent metal cation such as magnesium and calcium. Solubility of the surfactant will depend upon the particular anionic surfactants and cations chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Preferably, R has from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms, even more preferably from about 12 to about 14 carbon atoms, in both the alkyl sulfates and alkyl ether sulfates. The alkyl ether sulfates are typically made as condensation products of ethylene oxide and monohydric alcohols having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms. The alcohols can be synthetic or they can be derived from fats, e.g., coconut oil, palm kernel oil, tallow. Lauryl alcohol and straight chain alcohols derived from coconut oil or palm kernel oil are preferred. Such alcohols are reacted with from about 0 to about 10, preferably from about 2 to about 5, more preferably about 3, molar proportions of ethylene oxide, and the resulting mixture of molecular species having, for example, an average of 3 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol is sulfated and neutralized.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Specific non-limiting examples of alkyl ether sulfates which may be used in the personal care compositions of the present invention include sodium and ammonium salts of coconut alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate, tallow alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate, and tallow alkyl hexa-oxyethylene sulfate. Highly preferred alkyl ether sulfates are those comprising a mixture of individual compounds, wherein the compounds in the mixture have an average alkyl chain length of from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms and an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 1 to about 4 moles of ethylene oxide. Such a mixture also comprises from about 0% to about 20% by weight C<sub>12-13 </sub>compounds; from about 60% to about 100% by weight of C<sub>14-15-16 </sub>compounds; from about 0% to about 20% by weight of C<sub>17-18-19 </sub>compounds; from about 3% to about 30% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of 0; from about 45% to about 90% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation from about 1 to about 4; from about 10% to about 25% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation from about 4 to about 8; and from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation greater than about 8.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another suitable class of anionic surfactants are the water-soluble salts of the organic, sulfuric acid reaction products of the general formula R<sub>1</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>-M wherein R<sub>1 </sub>is chosen from the group consisting of a straight or branched chain, saturated aliphatic hydro-carbon radical having from 8 to 24, preferably 12 to 18, carbon atoms; and M is a cation. Important examples are the salts of an organic sulfuric acid reaction product of a hydrocarbon of the methane series, including iso-, neo-, ineso-, and n-paraffins, having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms, and a sulfonating agent e.g., SO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, oleum, obtained according to known sulfonation methods, including bleaching and hydrolysis. Preferred are alkali metal and ammonium sulfonated C<sub>12-18</sub>-n-paraffins.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Still other suitable anionic surfactants are the reaction products of fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralized with sodium hydroxide where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut oil or palm kernel oil, and sodium or potassium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl tauride where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut oil or palm kernel oil.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other anionic surfactants suitable for use in the shampoo compositions are the succinnates, examples of which include disodium N-octadecylsulfosuccinnate, disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, diammonium lauryl sulfosuccinate, tetrasodium N-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-N-octadecylsulfosuccinnate, diamyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid, dihexyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid, and dioctyl esters of sodium sulfosuccinic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Other suitable anionic surfactants include olefin sulfonates having about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms. In this context, the term &#x201c;olefin sulfonates&#x201d; refers to compounds which can be produced by the sulfonation of alpha-olefins by means of uncomplexed sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization of the acid reaction mixture in conditions such that any sulfones which have been formed in the reaction are hydrolyzed to give the corresponding hydroxy-alkanesulfonates. The alpha-olefins from which the olefin sulfonates are derived are mono-olefins having from about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms. Preferably, they are straight chain olefins.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition to the sulfates, isethionates, sulfonates, sulfosuccinates described above, other potential anions for the anionic surfactant include phosphonates, phosphates, and carboxylates.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The personal care compositions of the present invention may also include one or more additional surfactants selected from the group consisting of amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, and nonionic surfactants. Suitable amphoteric, zwitterionic, cationic, or nonionic surfactants for use in the personal care compositions herein include those which are known for use in hair care or other personal care compositions. The concentration of such surfactants preferably ranges from about 0.5% to about 20%, preferably from about 1% to about 10%, by weight of the composition. Non-limiting examples of suitable surfactants are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,104,646 and 5,106,609, both to Bolich, Jr. et al.</p>

These steps can be repeated as many times as desired to achieve the desired cleansing and conditioning benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">For use in methods of the present invention, the personal care composition may be in various forms, for example, shampoos, body washes, gels, lotions, creams, mousses, and sprays. For some of these forms, the personal care composition may be packaged in a pump-dispenser bottle or in an aerosol container. In other useful forms, the personal care composition may be dried to a film or a powder, or it may be applied to a substrate which is then used for application to the hair or skin.</p>
