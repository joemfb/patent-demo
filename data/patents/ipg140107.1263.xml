<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The door latch mechanism independently operated by first and second handles of the door handle assembly comprising a cam member having a cam surface which facilitates translation of movement of the handles to displacement of the cam member. The cam member can be coupled to a latch member and move the latch member between an extended and retracted position. A door lock mechanism can prevent displacement of the second door handle while simultaneously allowing displacement of the first door handle.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/741,938 filed on Apr. 30, 2007. The entire disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to door handle assemblies and, in particular, to door latch mechanisms for door handle assemblies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of door handle assemblies are known in the art to selectively secure a door relative to a door frame. In particular, door frame assemblies having push-pull operation are known. However, it would be desirable for a new door handle assembly with push-pull operation having a door latch mechanism providing independent operation of opposing door handles, adjustable translation of door handle motion to latch displacement, and/or a relatively compact configuration.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a door latch mechanism. In some embodiments, the door latch mechanism includes a base having a first channel and a second channel oriented substantially perpendicular to each other and first and second rack components disposed in the first channel. Each of said first and second rack components is independently movable along the first channel. The door latch mechanism further includes a cam member adapted to be coupled to a latch for a door handle assembly. The cam member is disposed in the second channel and is movable along the second channel. The cam member includes a protrusion extending away from the second channel, the protrusion defining a cam surface oblique relative to each of the first and second channels. The door latch mechanism also includes an intermediate component defining an outer surface. The intermediate component is disposed between the first and second rack components with the outer surface engaging the cam surface. Each of the first and second rack components independently moves the intermediate component in a first direction along the first channel toward the cam member to displace the cam member in a second direction along the second channel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure further provides a door handle assembly. In some embodiments, the door handle assembly includes first and second housing components secured on opposing side of a door, first and second handles pivotally coupled to the first and second housing components, respectively, and a latch assembly extending within the door. The latch assembly includes a latch member movable between an extended position outside of the door and a retracted position inside the door. The door handle assembly further has a door latch mechanism extending between the first and second handles within the door. The door latch mechanism includes a base having a first channel and a second channel oriented substantially perpendicular to each other and first and second rack components disposed in the first channel. The first rack component is coupled to the first handle, and the second rack component is coupled to the second handle. Each of the first and second rack components is independently movable along the first channel. The door latch mechanism further includes a cam member coupled to the latch member, the cam member being disposed in the second channel and being movable along the second channel. The cam member includes a protrusion extending away from the second channel, the protrusion defining a cam surface oblique relative to each of the first and second channels. The door latch mechanism also includes an intermediate component defining an outer surface, the intermediate component being disposed between the first and second rack components with the outer surface engaging the cam surface. Each of the first and second rack components independently moves the intermediate component in a first direction along the first channel toward the cam member to displace the cam member in a second direction along the second channel away from the latch assembly. Furthermore, the cam member moves the latch member from the extended position to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure also provides a lock assembly that is supported by the first and second housing components and works together with the door latch mechanism and door handle assembly to provide a door locking feature. The lock assembly includes an actuator lever that can be rotated to a lock position and thereby cause a lock pawl to restrict movement of the second rack components as may be desired. The lock assembly can also include an unlock pawl that is operable by the first rack components to rotate door lock assembly to an unlocked position and thereby allow subsequent movement of first rack components.</p>

First rack component <b>150</b> can further include a cylindrical end section <b>224</b> extending from base section <b>220</b> opposite prongs <b>222</b>. Similarly, second rack component <b>152</b> can include a base section <b>226</b> and a pair of elongate prongs <b>228</b> extending away from base section <b>226</b> substantially parallel to each other. Second rack component <b>152</b> can further include a cylindrical end section <b>230</b> extending from base section <b>226</b> opposite prongs <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Prongs <b>222</b>, <b>228</b> can be spaced-apart so as to define gaps <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) therebetween. In some embodiments, gap <b>232</b> of first rack component <b>150</b> can be larger than gap <b>234</b> of second rack component <b>152</b>. As such, first rack component <b>150</b> can extend over second rack component <b>152</b> such that prongs <b>222</b> sandwich prongs <b>228</b> with a clearance therebetween. Furthermore, gap <b>234</b> can be large enough so that prongs <b>228</b> of second rack component <b>152</b> sandwich middle section <b>172</b> of cam member <b>148</b> with a clearance therebetween. Additionally, in some embodiments, prongs <b>222</b> each include a slot <b>236</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) therein, and prongs <b>228</b> each include a slot <b>238</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) therein. As described in more detail below, roller <b>154</b> is also disposed between prongs <b>222</b>, <b>228</b> and extends into slots <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, first and second rack components <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> further include pins <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> supported within cylindrical end sections <b>224</b>, <b>230</b>, respectively. Pins <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> can engage coupling features <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of first and second handles <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, respectively. For example, pin <b>240</b> of first rack component <b>150</b> can be disposed within a U-shaped slot <b>254</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of coupling feature <b>250</b>. With this configuration, movement of first handle <b>30</b> is translated to first rack component <b>150</b>. However, pin <b>240</b> can slide along slot <b>254</b> so that rotation of first handle <b>30</b> only causes movement of first rack component <b>150</b> along the length thereof. As such, the rotation of first handle <b>30</b> does not displace first rack component <b>150</b> out of position. The further operation of door handle assembly <b>20</b> is described in more detail herein. Pin <b>242</b> of second rack component <b>152</b> can be disposed within a U-shaped slot <b>256</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of coupling feature <b>252</b> and can have a similar interaction with second handle <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally, in some embodiments, first rack component <b>150</b> can include a pair of locking tabs <b>260</b> disposed on opposing sides of base section <b>220</b>, and second rack component can include a pair of locking tabs <b>262</b> disposed on opposing sides of base section <b>226</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Locking tabs <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> can work together with lock assembly <b>130</b> to lock and unlock door handle assembly <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, door handle assembly <b>20</b> can be locked by rotating actuator lever <b>138</b> towards a lock position. Rotating actuator lever <b>138</b> can cause lock pawl <b>140</b> to rotate towards locking tabs <b>262</b>. In the locked position, lock pawl <b>140</b> can be located at a position adjacent locking tabs <b>262</b> so that lock pawl <b>140</b> prohibits translational movement of second rack component <b>152</b> as second handle <b>32</b> is rotated away from the home position. Conversely, door handle assembly <b>20</b> can be unlocked by rotating actuator lever <b>138</b> towards an unlock position, causing lock pawl <b>140</b> to be located at a position away from locking tabs <b>262</b> such that second rack component <b>152</b> can translate in response to the rotation of second handle <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, lock assembly <b>130</b> can further include an unlock pawl <b>264</b> to automatically unlock door handle assembly <b>20</b> as second handle <b>32</b> is rotated away from the home position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, unlock pawl <b>264</b> can be disposed between connector shaft <b>132</b> and inner housing component <b>50</b> and can be operably connected to first lock shaft <b>134</b>. Specifically, first lock shaft <b>134</b> can extend through a keyed opening <b>266</b> in unlock pawl <b>264</b>. In this manner, actuator lever <b>138</b> can be actuated to cause unlock pawl <b>264</b> to rotate between a lock and unlock position in same manner as previously described for lock pawl <b>140</b>. In the lock position, unlock pawl <b>264</b> can be located at a position adjacent locking tabs <b>260</b> such that the translational movement of first rack component <b>150</b> corresponding to rotating first handle <b>30</b> away from the home position can cause locking tabs <b>260</b> to engage a cam face <b>268</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of unlock pawl <b>264</b>. First handle <b>30</b> can be rotated further to cause locking tabs <b>260</b> to impart a force on cam face <b>268</b> and thereby rotate lock assembly <b>130</b> towards the unlock position. In this manner, unlock pawl <b>264</b> can work together with first rack component <b>150</b> to permit door handle assembly <b>20</b> to be unlocked by rotating first handle <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be appreciated that due to the symmetrical arrangement of first and second inner housing components <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and locking tabs <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, first and second inner housing components <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and lock assembly <b>130</b> can be installed in an opposite arrangement to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> to lock door handle assembly <b>20</b>. Accordingly, lock assembly <b>130</b> can be used to prohibit translational movement of first rack component <b>150</b> as first handle <b>30</b> is rotated away from the home position and to allow translational movement of second rack component <b>152</b> to unlock door handle assembly <b>20</b> as second handle <b>32</b> is rotated away from the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in some embodiments, roller <b>154</b> of door latch mechanism <b>34</b> can have a tiered cylindrical shape. For example, roller <b>154</b> can include a rod portion <b>280</b> and a disk portion <b>282</b> extending from rod portion <b>280</b>. Rod portion <b>280</b> can have a smaller diameter than disk portion <b>282</b>. In some embodiments, rod portion <b>280</b> extends into slots <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> of first and second rack components <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>. Furthermore, in some embodiments, disk portion <b>282</b> defines an outer surface <b>284</b> which engages cam surface <b>192</b> of cam member <b>148</b>. In particular, in some embodiments, roller <b>154</b> is disposed with disk portion <b>282</b> sandwiched between prongs <b>228</b> of second rack component <b>152</b>, which are sandwiched between prongs <b>222</b> of first rack component <b>150</b>, so that rod portion <b>280</b> extends into slots <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> and outer surface <b>284</b> engages cam surface <b>192</b>. As described in further detail herein, roller <b>154</b> can function as an intermediate component between cam member <b>148</b> and first and second rack components <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> to translate movement of the rack components in a first direction to displacement of the cam member in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, base <b>156</b> of door latch mechanism <b>34</b> can include first and second channels <b>300</b>, <b>302</b> formed therein. In some embodiments, first and second channels <b>300</b>, <b>302</b> are oriented substantially perpendicular to each other. First channel <b>300</b> can support and guide first and second rack components <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and second channel <b>302</b> can support and guide cam member <b>148</b>. Furthermore, in some embodiments, second channel <b>302</b> can include a groove <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) therein complementary to a tab <b>306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) extending from bottom section <b>174</b> of cam member <b>148</b>. Groove <b>304</b> and tab <b>306</b> can engage to help guide and align cam member <b>148</b> in second channel <b>302</b>. Furthermore, in some embodiments, door latch mechanism <b>34</b> can include one or more bearings <b>307</b> disposed within bearing slots <b>309</b> adjacent first channel <b>300</b> and/or second channel <b>302</b> (shown) to enhance smooth operation of the door handle assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, latch assembly <b>36</b> of door handle assembly <b>20</b> can include a latch member <b>320</b> disposed in a housing <b>322</b>. Furthermore, a biasing member <b>324</b> can be disposed between latch member <b>320</b> and housing <b>322</b>. In some embodiments, latch member <b>320</b> includes a main section <b>330</b> and a coupling section <b>332</b> extending therefrom. Coupling section <b>332</b> can have a slot <b>334</b> formed therein which receives post <b>194</b> of cam member <b>148</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>8</b>A). As such, cam member <b>148</b> and latch member <b>320</b> can be coupled and, thus, door latch mechanism <b>34</b> and latch assembly <b>36</b> can be coupled. Furthermore, in some embodiments, main section <b>330</b> of latch member <b>320</b> includes a sloped outer surface <b>336</b> and a protrusion <b>338</b> formed therein. Biasing member <b>324</b> can be coupled between protrusion <b>338</b> and a protrusion <b>340</b> of housing <b>322</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, biasing member can be in the form of a coil spring. Furthermore, in some embodiments, a stop member <b>339</b>, such as a pin, can engage main section <b>330</b> and operably contact a portion of housing <b>322</b> (through a slot <b>323</b>) to serve as a device to limit the motion of main section <b>330</b>. In this way, latch assembly <b>36</b> can be essentially self-contained and capable of being modularly inserted and/or removed without complete disassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>, the operation of door handle assembly <b>20</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure is illustrated. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> illustrate that door latch mechanism <b>34</b> can operate to retract latch member <b>320</b> in response to the pulling of first handle <b>30</b>. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> illustrate that door latch mechanism <b>34</b> can also operate to retract latch member <b>320</b> in response to the pushing of second handle <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, first handle <b>30</b> is in a home position. Furthermore, latch member <b>320</b> is in an extended position, and roller <b>154</b> is positioned proximate the end of cam member <b>148</b> opposite latch member <b>320</b>. As first handle <b>30</b> is pulled (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), the bottom portion of first handle <b>30</b> moves closer to the housing components, and first rack component <b>150</b> moves inwardly. The ends of slots <b>236</b> engage rod portion <b>280</b> of roller <b>154</b> and pushes roller <b>154</b> in a first direction along first channel <b>300</b> of base <b>156</b> toward cam member <b>148</b>. As outer surface <b>284</b> of roller <b>154</b> is engaged with cam surface <b>192</b> of cam member <b>148</b> and as cam member <b>148</b> is disposed in second channel <b>302</b>, cam member <b>148</b> is displaced in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction along second channel <b>302</b> while roller <b>154</b> moves relative to cam surface <b>192</b>. In particular, roller <b>154</b> rolls on outside surface <b>284</b> along cam surface <b>192</b>. Cam member <b>148</b> is displaced away from latch member <b>320</b> along second channel <b>302</b> so that the pulling of first handle <b>30</b> retracts latch member <b>320</b>. When roller <b>154</b> moves into engagement with concave end portion <b>193</b> of cam surface <b>192</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>), latch member <b>320</b> is in a fully retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As first rack component <b>150</b> pushes roller <b>154</b>, roller <b>154</b> moves within slot <b>238</b> of second rack component <b>152</b>. Furthermore, as first and second rack components are independently supported in first channel <b>300</b>, second rack component <b>152</b> and second handle <b>32</b> are not affected by the pulling of first handle <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally, it should also be understood that, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, pushing first handle <b>30</b> does not operate door latch mechanism <b>34</b>.

As such, door handle assembly <b>20</b> can be configured so that first handle <b>30</b> is only functional in a single direction, such as in correspondence with the direction of movement of door <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, second handle <b>32</b> is in a home position, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Furthermore, latch member <b>320</b> is in an extended position, and roller <b>154</b> is positioned proximate the end of cam member <b>148</b> opposite latch member <b>320</b>. As second handle <b>32</b> is pushed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), the bottom portion of second handle <b>32</b> moves away from the housing components, and second rack component <b>152</b> moves outwardly. The ends of slots <b>238</b> engage rod portion <b>280</b> of roller <b>154</b> and pulls roller <b>154</b> in the same first direction along first channel <b>300</b> of base <b>156</b> toward cam member <b>148</b>. As outer surface <b>284</b> of roller <b>154</b> is engaged with cam surface <b>192</b> of cam member <b>148</b> and as cam member <b>148</b> is disposed in second channel <b>302</b>, cam member <b>148</b> is displaced in the same second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction along second channel <b>302</b> while roller <b>154</b> moves relative to cam surface <b>192</b>.

For example, cam surface <b>192</b> can be shaped so that second handle <b>32</b> only has to be pushed a small amount to retract latch member <b>320</b>. By way of non-limiting example, cam surface <b>192</b> and first and second handles <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> can be configured so that only &#xbd; inch of motion of either of first and second handles <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> retracts latch member <b>320</b>. As such, door handle assembly <b>20</b> can provide clearance between gripping portion <b>45</b> of second handle <b>32</b> and door <b>22</b> during operation and prevent the pinching of a hand of an operator between second handle <b>32</b> and door <b>22</b>. It should be understood that cam surface <b>192</b> can be shaped in a variety of ways for a variety of applications of door handle assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The operation of latch assembly <b>36</b> is well known in the art and, as such, will not be described in detail herein.
