A magnetic field sensor that is produced using the proposed method and/or using the claimed device is likewise the subject matter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">DE 101 29 222 A1 made known a magnetic field sensor and a method for its manufacture by encapsulating, via injection molding, a carrier that contains a sensor element. The sensor element is situated on a carrier element which is composed of metal, and it is fixed in a defined position relative to a rotating sensor element by encapsulating it in plastic via injection molding. The position of the sensor element is established by a stop that defines the distance between the sensor and the encoder; neither this distance nor the angular position of the sensor relative to the encoder are changeable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, DE patent application 10 2006 050 177.2 has already proposed a magnetic field sensor that is designed as a rotational speed sensor and/or a direction of rotation sensor for a motor vehicle, in which a sensor element that is sensitive to a magnetic field, and its carrier, are encapsulated in plastic via injection molding. The plastic injection-molded coating also encapsulates the end of a connecting cable, and is designed such that the injection-molded part forms a connecting tab having a fastening socket in which a sensor is installed. As a result, it is possible to adjust the angular position of the sensor, within narrow limits, relative to a sensor ring by rotating it about the central axis of the fastening socket, without changing the axial positioning of the sensor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast, a sensor which is manufactured according to the proposed method and/or using the device according to the present invention has the advantage that, in accordance with the particular installation conditions of the sensor, the longitudinal position and the angular position of the fastening tab, and therefore, the position of the sensor relative to a transmitter element are changeable, thereby making it possible to manufacture sensors for different installation situations without changing tool inserts or even the entire injection mold.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is particularly advantageous if a core-type insertion part, which has been produced in a first injection step, is held, in a second injection step, in a tool insert which is longitudinally displaceable and/or rotatable in the injection mold. In this manner, the insertion part may be positioned exactly and easily before the second injection step, and the fastening tab may be integrally formed thereon, via injection molding, in the specified longitudinal and angular position. Advantageously, the core-type insertion part is substantially cylindrical in shape, and is positioned in a bore, thereby further simplifying the insertion and orientation of the insertion part that includes the electrical assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In terms of the design of the device, according to the present invention, for manufacturing a magnetic field sensor that includes a fastening tab that determines the installation position of the sensor, it is particularly advantageous when, in order to integrally extrude the fastening tab, a tool insert is situated in an injection mold such that it is longitudinally displaceable and/or rotatable, in order to accommodate a core-type insertion part which was manufactured in a previous working step and contains the electrical assembly. It is thereby possible to manufacture sensors, which are based on the same basic design, for use in different installation conditions having different longitudinal and angular positions relative to a transmitter element without the need to make expensive changes to the injection mold.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Advantageously, the tool insert is continually displaceable in the injection mold, and it may be locked in different longitudinal and/or angular positions. The tool insert and the core-type insertion part which includes the electrical assembly are preferably designed cylindrical or hollow-cylindrical in shape, thereby simplifying installation and positioning.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows electrical assembly <b>10</b> of a magnetic field sensor <b>13</b>, which is to be encapsulated in thermoplastic according to the proposed method, magnetic field sensor <b>13</b> being designed as a rotational speed sensor for use to detect the wheel speed of a motor vehicle. It contains an IC component <b>11</b> which includes a sensor element and an integrated circuit for preparing the measurement signals and the measured value output. The magnetic field which is used to generate the measured signals is provided by a cylindrical permanent magnet <b>12</b> which is located directly adjacent to IC component <b>11</b>. Two conductor tracks <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> of integrated circuit <b>11</b> are bridged by a capacitor <b>18</b> in order to reduce signal spikes, and are connected via crimp connections <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to connecting lines <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of a cable <b>28</b>, the front end of which is encapsulated in plastic together with lines <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, capacitor <b>18</b>, permanent magnet <b>12</b>, and integrated circuit <b>11</b> to create the finished magnetic field sensor, the design and mode of operation of which is known. The individual parts that are encapsulated in plastic are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> using dashed lines, and they are described in greater detail in the figures that follow.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, in a perspective view, a core-type insertion part <b>30</b> that contains electrical assembly <b>10</b>, which is connected to connecting cable <b>28</b>, in a cylindrical injection-molded coating <b>32</b>. A bore <b>34</b> marks the position of IC component <b>11</b> of electrical assembly <b>10</b> as the sensing element, based on which magnetic field sensor <b>13</b> is oriented during assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a metallic socket <b>36</b> in the position in which it is connected to insertion part <b>30</b> in the second injection step.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows, likewise in a perspective view, finished magnetic field sensor <b>30</b> after the second injection step, in which a fastening tab <b>38</b> was integrally extruded on core-type insertion part <b>30</b> in a specifiable longitudinal and angular position. In this second injection step, insertion part <b>30</b> is positioned via bore <b>34</b> in terms of the longitudinal and angular position in an injection mold, which is explained further below, and in which fastening tab <b>38</b> is then integrally extruded in the position that is specified for subsequent installation of sensor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Metallic socket <b>36</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is injected into fastening tab <b>38</b> in order to increase the stability of the sensor attachment. In addition, a centering sleeve <b>40</b>, which partially overlaps plastic injection-molded coating <b>32</b> of insertion part <b>30</b>, is integrally extruded onto the fastening tab; centering sleeve <b>40</b> includes four ribs <b>42</b> which are evenly distributed around the circumference of the centering sleeve, and which are used to center entire sensor <b>13</b> during installation. Furthermore, an annular flange <b>44</b> is also integrally extruded on fastening tab <b>38</b>, opposite to centering sleeve <b>40</b>; annular flange <b>44</b> encloses connecting cable <b>38</b> and stabilizes the transition from the cable to insertion part <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a perspective view of bottom part <b>46</b> of an injection mold, including tool insert <b>48</b> for receiving insertion part <b>30</b>. Tool insert <b>48</b> is cylindrical in shape, and includes a cylindrical bore <b>52</b> for receiving cylindrical insertion part <b>30</b>. The tool insert is situated in the injection mold and in a carrier <b>50</b> such that it is continually longitudinally displaceable and rotatable into any position, and may then be locked into the selected position, as will be explained in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in particular. For adjustment purposes, a handle <b>53</b> is integrally formed thereon in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After carrier <b>50</b> has been positioned in bottom part <b>46</b> of the injection mold, insertion part <b>30</b>, together with connecting cable <b>28</b>, is positioned in injection mold <b>46</b> and in tool insert <b>48</b> in a functional length and angular position as required for subsequent installation, and the tool insert is locked in position in the injection mold. Socket <b>36</b>, which will be injected into fastening tab <b>38</b>, is slid via a sliding mechanism <b>54</b> and a mandrel <b>55</b> into its position, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in the region of fastening tab <b>38</b> which will be integrally extruded, and sliding mechanism <b>54</b> is subsequently retracted. The plastic mass to be used to integrally extrude fastening tab <b>38</b> is supplied via a channel <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the injection mold, which has been opened after the injection step. The sensor is located in bottom part <b>46</b> of the injection mold. In this illustration, fastening tab <b>38</b> has already been integrally extruded onto insertion part <b>30</b>, and so finished magnetic field sensor <b>13</b> may be ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cross section through the injection mold, including bottom part <b>46</b>, sliding mechanism <b>54</b>, which is designed as an angled slide, and a top part <b>58</b>. Carrier <b>50</b>, in which tool insert <b>48</b> is held in a manner such that it is longitudinally displaceable as indicated by arrow <b>60</b>, and is rotatable about its central axis, is located via a portion of its extension in bottom part <b>46</b> and in top part <b>58</b>. Tool insert <b>48</b> is fastened in carrier <b>50</b> using a locking part <b>62</b>. Insertion part <b>30</b> is slid into bore <b>52</b> in tool insert <b>48</b> in its specified angular position until it reaches the end of bore <b>52</b>. The insertion part is locked in position using a retaining pin <b>64</b> which secures the angular position that is defined upon insertion, and which holds the insertion part, including connecting cable <b>28</b>, in its position; the retaining pin engages in marking bore <b>34</b> in insertion part <b>30</b> and secures the position which is defined by the position of IC component <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The different possibilities for positioning fastening tab <b>38</b> become clear by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, fastening tab <b>38</b> is located on the cable-side end of insertion part <b>30</b>, whereas, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is located further in the middle of insertion part <b>30</b> and thereby determines another functional length of the sensor. The positioning is determined by the longitudinal displacement as indicated by arrow <b>60</b>, and optionally via rotation of tool insert <b>48</b>; insertion part <b>30</b> is inserted completely into bore <b>52</b> in both cases. The position of fastening tab <b>38</b> in the injection mold is fixedly specified.</p>
