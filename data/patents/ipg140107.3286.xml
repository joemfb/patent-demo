<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter of the present application relates to semiconductor devices. More specifically, the present application relates to reinforcing the edge of an integrated circuit to obviate cracks in layers of the integrated circuit during separation.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microelectronic elements, e.g., semiconductor chips, are thin, flat elements which can incorporate integrated circuits including active semiconductor devices such as transistors, diodes, etc., and wiring which provides electrical interconnections. Semiconductor chips may also or alternatively include passive devices such as capacitors, inductors or resistors. In particular constructions, a microelectronic element can include one or more semiconductor chips and have electrically conductive elements electrically connected with contacts of the one or more semiconductor chips, the contacts being exposed at a surface of the microelectronic element.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microelectronic elements are typically manufactured in wafer form. Once the wafer is formed, the wafer may then be diced to free the individually packaged microelectronic elements, i.e., die. One of the complications that arise when the wafer is separated is the presence of microdefects. Microdefects commonly occur around the periphery of each microelectronic element, e.g., semiconductor chip, due to stresses at the edge surfaces of each of the microelectronic elements. For example, without limitation, such defects can include cracks in the microelectronic element, surface roughness, sharp edge points, uneven surfaces, and the like. Such microdefects can occur in the microelectronic element at any point it time. For example, the dicing process produces microdefects that can develop into cracks and more serious defects. These microdefects may occur at any time later in the lifecycle of the chip, i.e., during processes for packaging, or testing the chip, or later in actual operation of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various structures and methods have been devised to minimize crack stresses. For example, internal seal rings have been used in the prior art to prevent cracking at the exterior edges of the semiconductor chip. Methods that have been used to separate wafers into individual chips include mechanical blade dicing; mechanical scribing and then breaking; dicing before grinding; laser scribing and breaking; stealth dicing; laser full-cut dicing, and plasma dicing. Nonetheless, despite these and other improvements in the art, there is still room for improved microelectronic elements and methods of making microelectronic elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect of the presently disclosed embodiments, a microelectronic element includes a semiconductor chip and a continuous monolithic metallic edge-reinforcement ring. The semiconductor chip has front and rear opposed surfaces. A plurality of contacts are exposed at its front surface. Edge surfaces extend between the front and rear surfaces and the semiconductor chip embodies at least one of active devices or passive devices. The continuous monolithic metallic edge-reinforcement ring covers each of the plurality of edge surfaces and extends onto the front surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the semiconductor chip has at least one crack at at least one of its edge surfaces. The edge-reinforcement ring extends into the at least one crack.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a cross-sectional view of a microelectronic element <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the microelectronic element <b>100</b> includes a semiconductor chip <b>102</b>, e.g., integrated circuit, and a metallic or metal edge-reinforcement ring <b>120</b> that covers at least a portion of edge surfaces <b>108</b> of the chip <b>102</b>. Chip <b>102</b> may be a semiconductor chip having a plurality of active circuit elements. In other embodiment, chip <b>100</b> may be a wafer or a portion of a wafer containing a plurality of semiconductor chips. In still another example, chip <b>100</b> may be reconstituted wafer or panel including a plurality of active chips arranged in an array and held together for processing simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the chip <b>102</b> includes a front surface <b>104</b>, an opposed rear surface <b>106</b>, and peripheral edge surfaces <b>108</b> that extend between the front and rear surfaces <b>104</b>,<b>106</b> and around the periphery of the chip <b>102</b>. The chip <b>102</b> may include a plurality of contacts, e.g., bond pads <b>110</b> exposed at the front surface.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The metal or metallic ring <b>120</b> is shown extending around the peripheral edge <b>108</b> of the chip <b>102</b>. The metal ring <b>120</b> is continuous and monolithic and helps to reinforce the peripheral edge <b>108</b> of the chip <b>102</b>. In certain embodiments, the presence of the metal ring <b>120</b> can increase the resistance of the chip <b>102</b> to cracking and help to minimize brittle fracture initiation defects. This can also help to improve chip handling, assembly, and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the metal ring may be comprised of known metals, including, without limitation, aluminum (Al), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), or alloys of one or more of the aforementioned metals. A thin layer of a different metal or conductive compound of a metal may in some cases contact the semiconductor material at the peripheral edge surfaces to promote adhesion or to act as a barrier between the semiconductor material and a thicker layer of metal making up a bulk of the metal ring <b>120</b>. For example, a thin layer of metal nitrides can be provided for this purpose. In this embodiment, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outer surface <b>123</b> of the first end <b>422</b> of the metal ring <b>120</b> lies in the same plane or is substantially flush with the front surface <b>104</b> of the chip <b>102</b>. Similarly, the outer surface <b>125</b> of second end <b>124</b> of the metal ring <b>120</b> lies in the same plane or is substantially flush with the rear surface <b>106</b> of the chip <b>102</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the metal ring <b>120</b> may have a thickness T ranging from 50 nanometers to 10 microns. In a particular embodiment, the metal ring <b>120</b> can serve as a ground reference for the chip <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an enlarged portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, chip <b>102</b> is shown having two microcracks extending away from its peripheral edge surface <b>108</b>. As shown, metal from the metal ring <b>120</b> can extend into each of the two cracks. The deposited material may have properties that can help to avoid the microdefects which they coat or fill from developing into such larger defects. For example, deposited material can be selected that has higher fracture toughness or higher ductility than the material of which the chip essentially consists. This can help to further prevent or minimize microdefects. It may also have these properties relative to a dielectric material in which one or more wiring layers of the chip are disposed. For example, low-K dielectric materials provided as interlayer dielectric materials tend to be relatively brittle, prone to cracking and delaminating. In alternative embodiments, there may be no cracks, one or more cracks, or cracks with no metal within them or only partially filled with metal.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Turning now to alternative embodiments, it is to be appreciated that similar reference numerals will be used to indicate similar elements. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an alternative microelectronic element <b>200</b>, a monolithic metal ring <b>220</b> is shown extending continuously along the outer peripheral edge surfaces <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b>. In contrast to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in addition to the metal ring <b>220</b> extending adjacent the peripheral edge <b>208</b> of the chip, the metal ring <b>220</b> also extends along at least one other surface of the chip <b>202</b>. In this embodiment, the metal ring <b>220</b> extends onto the front surface <b>204</b> of the chip <b>202</b> as a continuous rectangular ring structure that appears to &#x201c;wrap around&#x201d; from the peripheral edge surface <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown, the metal ring <b>220</b> may extend a distance X<b>1</b> inwardly along the front surface <b>204</b> from peripheral edge surfaces <b>208</b> of the chip <b>202</b>, for example, a distance X<b>1</b> ranging from 1 to 50 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an alternative microelectronic element <b>300</b> is shown. In this exemplary embodiment, the monolithic metal ring <b>320</b> extends onto both the front surface <b>304</b> and the opposed rear surface <b>306</b> of the chip <b>302</b>. As in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the metal ring <b>320</b> may extend along the rear surface <b>206</b> of the chip <b>302</b> a distance X<b>2</b>, which may range from 1 to 50 microns. The distance X<b>1</b>&#x2032; can be substantially equal to the distance X<b>2</b>. This is commonly due to overlay tolerances and design. In alternative embodiments, the distances X<b>1</b>&#x2032; and X<b>2</b> may differ.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, alternative arrangements of microelectronic elements are shown, wherein a dielectric layer is disposed between the monolithic metal ring and the semiconductor material of the chip <b>402</b>. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a semiconductor chip <b>402</b> is shown. An insulating layer, such as a dielectric layer <b>430</b> surrounds the peripheral edge <b>408</b> of the chip <b>402</b>. In one embodiment, the outer surface <b>433</b> of the first end <b>432</b> of dielectric layer <b>430</b> is planar with the front surface <b>404</b> of the chip <b>402</b>. The surface <b>435</b> of the second end <b>434</b> dielectric layer <b>430</b> may also be planar with the rear surface <b>406</b> of the chip <b>402</b>. The dielectric layer <b>430</b> may also fill microdefects in the chip <b>402</b> to help avoid the microdefects which they coat or fill from developing into such larger defects. The dielectric layer <b>430</b> can be comprised of known dielectric materials, such as, without limitation, polymer. Metal ring <b>420</b> is provided adjacent the dielectric layer. The outer surface <b>423</b> of the first end <b>422</b> of the metal ring <b>420</b> may be substantially planar with the surface <b>435</b> of the first end <b>432</b> of dielectric layer <b>430</b>. The surface <b>425</b> of the second end <b>424</b> of the metal ring <b>420</b> may also be planar with the outer surface <b>435</b> of the second end <b>434</b> of the dielectric layer <b>430</b>. The dielectric layer may be deposited, without limitation, by electrophoretic deposition, spin-coating, (such as paralyne), dry deposition techniques: e.g., to form a layer of SiOx, SiN, or CVD (chemical vapor deposition) or plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), or by siloxane-based polymer deposition, or organosilicon polymer deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an alternative microelectronic element <b>500</b> is shown with dielectric layer <b>530</b> wrapping around at least one surface of the chip <b>502</b>. In this embodiment, the dielectric layer <b>530</b> extends adjacent the peripheral edge <b>508</b> of the chip <b>502</b>. A first end <b>532</b> of the dielectric layer may extend onto or &#x201c;wrap around&#x201d; to the front surface <b>504</b> of the chip <b>502</b>. Second end <b>534</b> of the dielectric layer may in some cases be co-planar or flush with the rear surface <b>506</b> of the chip <b>502</b>. In this cross-sectional view, the dielectric layer is wrapped around the chip <b>502</b> in an L-shape. The metal ring <b>520</b> is provided around the dielectric layer <b>530</b>. As shown, monolithic metal ring <b>520</b> covers and extends along the outer peripheral edge surfaces <b>536</b> of the dielectric layer <b>530</b>, and may form a continuous ring fully circumscribing the area of the front face <b>504</b> of the semiconductor chip. The metal ring <b>520</b> also wraps around the first end <b>532</b> of the dielectric layer <b>530</b>. In this embodiment, the first end <b>522</b> of the metal ring <b>520</b> does not completely overlie the first end <b>532</b> of the dielectric layer. The interior peripheral edge <b>538</b> of the dielectric layer <b>530</b> may in some cases be spaced apart from the interior peripheral edge <b>528</b> of the metal ring <b>520</b>, thereby creating a step between the two interior peripheral edges <b>538</b>, <b>528</b>. The staggering of the metal ring <b>520</b> and dielectric layer <b>530</b> can be accomplished using two different masks, a first mask (not shown) during deposition of the dielectric layer <b>530</b> and a second mask (not shown) during deposition of the metal ring <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an alternative embodiment, the edges <b>538</b> of the dielectric layer <b>530</b> and the edge <b>522</b> of the metal ring <b>520</b> metal can be aligned, such as when a single mask is used to pattern both. Also, in a variation of that shown, the metal layer can contact the front surface <b>504</b> of the chip <b>502</b> beyond an edge of the dielectric layer <b>530</b>, particularly when the chip <b>502</b> has a dielectric layer at the front surface <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The alternative microelectronic element <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except that the second end <b>634</b> of the dielectric layer <b>630</b> and second end <b>624</b> of the metal ring <b>620</b> are not co-planar with the rear surface <b>606</b> of the chip <b>602</b>. As shown, the second end <b>634</b> of the dielectric layer <b>630</b> may extend onto the rear surface <b>606</b> of the chip <b>602</b>. The second end <b>624</b> of the metal ring <b>620</b> may also extend onto the dielectric layer <b>634</b>. As in the previous embodiment, the first interior edge <b>638</b> of the dielectric layer <b>634</b> can in some cases be spaced apart from the first interior edge <b>628</b> of the metal ring <b>620</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second ends <b>622</b>,<b>624</b> of the metal ring <b>630</b> will extend over the respective first and second ends <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> of the dielectric layer <b>634</b> an equal amount, such that the metal plate <b>620</b> symmetrically wraps around the dielectric layer <b>634</b>. Similarly, the first and second ends <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> of the dielectric layer <b>634</b> may be symmetrically provided around the chip <b>602</b>. Alternatively, edges <b>628</b> of the metal ring can be aligned with, i.e., not spaced apart from, corresponding edges <b>638</b> of the dielectric layer <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, alternative microelectronic elements are described that include two dielectric layers separated by a metal ring. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a microelectronic element is shown with a metal ring disposed between a first dielectric layer <b>730</b> and a second dielectric layer <b>750</b>. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first dielectric layer <b>730</b> is adjacent and closest to the chip <b>702</b>, and the metal ring <b>720</b> is adjacent and wraps around the first dielectric layer <b>730</b>. In this embodiment, there is a second dielectric layer <b>750</b> that is provided around the outer peripheral edge <b>726</b> of the metal ring <b>720</b>. The first end <b>750</b> of the second dielectric layer <b>750</b> is planar or flush with the respective first ends <b>722</b>, <b>732</b> of the metal ring <b>720</b> and first dielectric layer <b>732</b></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in this embodiment, the first end <b>832</b> of the first dielectric layer <b>830</b> extends over the front surface <b>804</b> of the chip <b>802</b>. The second end <b>834</b> is planar with the rear surface <b>806</b> of the chip. Similarly, the first end <b>822</b> of the metal ring extends over a portion of the first dielectric layer <b>832</b>. As shown, the interior edge <b>838</b> of the first dielectric layer <b>830</b> is spaced away from the interior edge <b>828</b> of the metal ring <b>820</b>. The second dielectric layer <b>850</b> is provided around and covers the metal ring <b>820</b>. As shown, the second dielectric layer <b>850</b> is flush or planar with the outer edge surface <b>823</b> of the first end <b>822</b> of the metal ring <b>820</b>, as well as the outer edge surface <b>823</b> of the second end <b>824</b> of the metal ring <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an alternative microelectronic element <b>900</b> is shown. As in the previous embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is a first dielectric layer <b>830</b> with first and second ends wrapping around the chip <b>902</b>. First and second ends <b>822</b>,<b>824</b> of metal ring <b>920</b> wrap around respective first and second ends <b>832</b>,<b>834</b> of the first dielectric layer <b>930</b>. In contrast to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a second dielectric layer <b>950</b> is provided adjacent the outer peripheral edge of the second dielectric layer <b>950</b>. The first end of the second dielectric layer may be planar with the top edge of the metal ring. Similarly, the second end <b>854</b> of the second dielectric layer <b>950</b> is flush with the second end <b>824</b> of the metal ring <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>, in alternative embodiments, the angle between the outer peripheral edge of the chip and the rear surface (or front surface) of the chip does not always need to be at a substantially right angle (i.e., a 90 degree angle). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>between the front surface <b>1004</b> of the chip <b>1002</b> and peripheral edge is greater than 90 degrees. In this embodiment, the angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>may be 100 degrees, although it may range anywhere from 30 to 150 degrees (between the front surface <b>1004</b> and the outer peripheral edge surfaces <b>1008</b> of the chip). Metal ring <b>1120</b> will then likewise wrap around the chip <b>1102</b> at a similar angle. The peripheral edge surfaces <b>1108</b>&#x2032; of the chip <b>1002</b>&#x2032; may also be rounded, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In this alternative embodiment, the angle &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>between the front surface <b>1106</b>&#x2032; and the outer peripheral edge <b>1108</b>&#x2032; will also range from 30 to 150 degrees between the front surface <b>1104</b> and peripheral edge <b>1108</b>, and may in some cases be less than 90 degrees, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The metal ring <b>1120</b>&#x2032; will wrap around the outer peripheral edge <b>1108</b>&#x2032; at a similar angle.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-12G</figref>, a method of making the microelectronic element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with one embodiment is shown. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a top plan view of a wafer subassembly <b>170</b> is shown. When a wafer-level fabrication method is used to produce the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as contemplated in one embodiment herein, the structure at this stage of fabrication can include a device wafer <b>171</b> with a photoresist <b>180</b> patterned on the top surface <b>104</b> thereof.

In this embodiment, the channels <b>172</b> intersect one another. Dicing lanes may typically be 30-40 microns wide.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B-C</figref>, grooves <b>174</b> may be formed in the wafer by removing material exposed within the channels <b>172</b> of the resist mask. In one embodiment, the grooves can be formed by sawing or scribing partially through a thickness of the wafer <b>171</b> to a depth D. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, the grooves <b>174</b> are created to a desired depth D. In one embodiment, the depth of the grooves will be equal to or greater than the final thickness T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12G</figref>) of the final chip. For example, the grooves <b>174</b> may have a depth D ranging from 10 to 200 microns deep. In this embodiment, the outermost edge portion <b>180</b>A of the photoresist material may be spaced a distance L<b>1</b> away from the edge of the grooves <b>174</b>. In one example, the distance L<b>1</b> is 1 to 50 microns. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>12</b>A, once the grooves <b>174</b> are formed, a metal <b>182</b> may be deposited within the grooves <b>182</b> and onto the top surface <b>173</b> of the device wafer <b>171</b>. The metal may be deposited using any known means, such as plating, electrophoretic deposition or the like. The device wafer <b>171</b> may then be thinned to separate the device wafer <b>171</b> into individual components <b>171</b>A-E. As described above, in a particular example, the metal deposition can be a plurality of depositions resulting in a plurality of component layers, e.g., one or more of a catalyst, seed layer, adhesion layer, barrier layer, and a primary layer typically having greater thickness. Thereafter, the photoresist material <b>180</b> can be removed resulting in a plurality of microelectronic elements <b>171</b>A-E, which are identical to the microelectronic element described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In particular examples, a dielectric layer <b>430</b> or <b>530</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <b>5</b>) can be formed in the grooves <b>174</b> prior to forming the metal layer therein. Alternatively, they may be formed on a surface of a diced microlectronic element as the dielectric layer <b>630</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In yet another example, a dielectric layer <b>750</b>, <b>850</b> or <b>950</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>) can be formed after forming the metal ring-forming layer <b>182</b> or after separating the wafer into individual microelectronic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-13C</figref>, a method of making the microelectronic element <b>1002</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> in accordance with one embodiment is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a wafer subassembly <b>1070</b> is shown with photoresist <b>1080</b> patterned on the front surface <b>1073</b> of the device wafer <b>1171</b> and grooves <b>1074</b> formed within the device wafer <b>1071</b>. Unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12-12G</figref>, the grooves <b>1074</b> have inclined surfaces <b>1075</b> that meet at one end to form an edge <b>1061</b>. A metal <b>1082</b> may then be deposited on the inclined surfaces <b>1075</b> within the grooves <b>174</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the device wafer <b>1071</b> may be thinned from the rear surface <b>1076</b> of the wafer <b>1071</b> so that device wafer components <b>1071</b>A-<b>1071</b><i>e </i>may be separated from one another and individually formed. The photo resist <b>1180</b> may be removed, thereby resulting in a plurality of microelectronic elements that have edges reinforced with a monolithic metal ring <b>1020</b>. In alternative embodiments, a dielectric layer may be provided before and/or after the step of providing a metal layer on the inclined surfaces <b>1075</b> of the groove <b>1074</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-14D</figref>, a method of making the microelectronic element <b>1102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in accordance with one embodiment is shown. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a wafer subassembly <b>170</b> is shown that includes a wafer <b>1171</b>, photoresist <b>1180</b> patterned thereon, and grooves <b>1174</b>. The grooves <b>1174</b> are initially formed with relative straight edge surfaces <b>1175</b> that extend vertically between the first and second surfaces <b>1173</b>,<b>1176</b> of the wafer <b>1171</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the grooves <b>1175</b> are further shaped to provide slightly angled surfaces <b>1175</b> that extend away from one another and rounded corner edges <b>177</b>. To achieve this shape, the grooves <b>1175</b> may be formed using any known conventional methods of formation, such as, without limitation, use of a special saw blade, use of a laser, or sand blasting. A metal may be provided within the groove (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>) and the wafer <b>1171</b> separated into individual microelectronic components <b>1171</b> A-E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>). Photoresist <b>1180</b> may then be removed to provide for microelectronic elements <b>1171</b> A-E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-15C</figref>, a method of making the microelectronic element <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in accordance with an alternative embodiment is shown. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a dicing tape <b>1294</b> or the like is used to support a wafer <b>1270</b>. As in the previous embodiments, a resist mask <b>1280</b> can be patterned over the front surface <b>1204</b> of the wafer <b>1270</b> to define channels <b>1272</b> coincident with dicing lanes <b>1272</b>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the wafer <b>1271</b> is diced along dicing lanes <b>1272</b> into individual microelectronic elements, e.g., semiconductor chips <b>1271</b>A,<b>1271</b>B,<b>1271</b>C, <b>1271</b>D,<b>1271</b>E. As shown, the wafer <b>1270</b> can be cut so that there is gap <b>1295</b> between the edge surfaces <b>1208</b> of the chips and the edges <b>1209</b> of the resist mask <b>1280</b>, but the tape <b>1294</b> remains to support the diced semiconductor chips. Thereafter, a metal can be plated onto the edge surfaces <b>1208</b> of the chip and the exposed front surfaces <b>1204</b> of the chips <b>1271</b>A-E to form the metal ring <b>1220</b>. The resist <b>1280</b> and tape <b>1294</b> can then be removed to reveal individual microelectronic elements <b>1271</b>A-E.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The microelectronic elements discussed in the embodiments above can be utilized in construction of diverse electronic systems. For example, referring back to the microelectronic elements according to any one of the embodiments previously discussed, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, such microelectronic element can be incorporated into a system, such as the system <b>1300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. For example, a microelectronic element can be incorporated in a microelectronic package <b>1306</b> or structure <b>1306</b> which is combined with other electronic components <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b> in a system or structure <b>1300</b>. In the example depicted, component <b>1308</b> is a semiconductor chip, whereas component <b>1310</b> is a display screen, but any other components can be used. Of course, although only two additional components are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> for clarity of illustration, the system may include any number of such components. The structure <b>1306</b> as described above may be, for example, a composite chip or a structure incorporating plural chips. In a further variant, both may be provided, and any number of such structures may be used. Structure <b>1306</b> and components <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b> are mounted in a common housing <b>1301</b>, schematically depicted in broken lines, and are electrically interconnected with one another as necessary to form the desired circuit. In the exemplary system shown, the system includes a circuit panel <b>1302</b> such as a flexible printed circuit board, and the circuit panel includes numerous conductors <b>1304</b>, of which only one is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, interconnecting the components with one another. However, this is merely exemplary; any suitable structure for making electrical connections can be used. The housing <b>1301</b> is depicted as a portable housing of the type usable, for example, in a cellular telephone or personal digital assistant, and screen <b>1310</b> is exposed at the surface of the housing. Where structure <b>1306</b> includes a light-sensitive element such as an imaging chip, a lens <b>1311</b> or other optical device also may be provided for routing light to the structure. Again, the simplified system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is merely exemplary; other systems, including systems commonly regarded as fixed structures, such as desktop computers, routers and the like can be made using the structures discussed above.</p>
