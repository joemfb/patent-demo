<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the remarkable development in information and telecommunication technology and semiconductor technology, popularization of various mobile terminals is increasing rapidly. Mobile terminals are developing to a level of convergence at which each mobile terminal is able to challenge markets of other mobile terminals by expanding outside its original market. In particular, a mobile phone provides various multimedia functions such as watching TV (for example, Digital Multimedia Broadcasting Digital (DMB) and Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB)), playing music (for example, MPEG<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)), and photographing, in addition to its basic functions of voice communication and message transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A display unit of the mobile terminal outputs information stored in the mobile terminal, information received from an external source, and user input information by using a visual means. The display unit is a portion of the mobile terminal used by a user most frequently, and thereby greatly affects the degree of user satisfaction with the mobile terminal. The importance of the display unit becomes even greater as more multimedia functions are added to the mobile terminal. Most of all, the size and quality of the display unit must be excellent to provide a better multimedia environment with the display unit. However, the mobile terminal has various limitations such as a limited size and dimensions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example in which an MP3 play function is assigned to the shortcut button <b>153</b>, upon changing a display screen, the menu screen <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> is displayed in the front display unit <b>110</b> instead of the menu screen <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. As described above, the menu screen in the multimedia mode may be displayed in different forms according to the type of a multimedia function to be executed. Additionally, a plurality of shortcut buttons, each having a different multimedia function, may be formed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, or a multimedia function may be assigned to a function key of the rear input unit <b>140</b> instead of to the shortcut button <b>153</b> of the side input unit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If the shortcut button <b>153</b> is pressed for a short time duration in the waiting screen <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the pop-up window <b>123</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> notifying a screen change is displayed and, when a time duration has elapsed, the multimedia execution screen <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is displayed without displaying the menu screen <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. At this moment, the execution screen <b>111</b> shows an execution screen of the most recently executed multimedia function.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed instead of the shortcut button <b>153</b> in the waiting screen <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the pop-up window <b>123</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, notifying a screen change, is displayed in the same way as when the shortcut button <b>151</b> is pressed for an extended time duration, and, when a time duration has elapsed, the menu screen <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> or the menu screen <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> is displayed according to the type of the multimedia function. At this moment, the menu screen shows the most recently executed multimedia function. Subsequently, the multimedia execution screen <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> or the multimedia execution screen <b>113</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> is displayed according to the multimedia item selected from the menu screen <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> or from the menu screen <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The steps of changing a display screen according to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been briefly described in a user position.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> includes a front display unit <b>110</b>, rear display unit <b>120</b>, front input unit <b>130</b>, rear input unit <b>140</b>, side input unit <b>150</b>, control unit <b>160</b> having a screen control module <b>162</b>, and storage unit <b>170</b>. The mobile terminal <b>100</b> may further include a Radio Frequency (RF) communication unit, audio processing unit, audio input/output unit, mobile broadcasting receiver for executing a multimedia function, and camera. Since, these units are conventionally used in a mobile terminal, therefore detailed descriptions are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the front display unit <b>110</b> provides a multimedia mode and the rear display unit <b>120</b> provides a normal mode. The front display unit <b>110</b> has a relatively larger screen size and a higher resolution than the rear display unit <b>120</b>. For example, the front display unit <b>110</b> and the rear display unit <b>120</b> may be formed with a large QVGA LCD and a small QCIF LCD respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The input units <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>150</b> generate a signal according to a user operation and output the signal to the control unit <b>160</b>. The front input unit <b>130</b> and the rear input unit <b>140</b> are formed with a touchpad and a keypad respectively, and the side input unit <b>150</b> is formed with a plurality of buttons. Preferably, the side input unit <b>150</b> includes the screen change button <b>151</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) and at least one shortcut button <b>153</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), and a shortcut function is assigned to a key of the rear input unit <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The control unit <b>160</b> controls the general operation of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and includes one or two microprocessors. In the case that the control unit <b>160</b> includes two microprocessors, one of the microprocessors is a chip for controlling a multimedia function. In particular, the control unit <b>160</b> includes a screen control module <b>162</b>. The screen control module <b>162</b> receives an input signal for executing a multimedia function from the rear input unit <b>140</b> or from the side input unit <b>150</b> in a state that the rear display unit <b>120</b> is turned on. The screen control module <b>162</b> controls the display of an execution screen of a multimedia function in the front display unit <b>110</b> by turning off the rear display unit <b>120</b> and turning on the front display unit <b>110</b>. The screen control module <b>162</b> further performs various control functions related to a screen change between the front display unit <b>110</b> and the rear display unit <b>120</b>. Detailed functions of the screen control module <b>162</b> are described later in relation to methods of changing a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The storage unit <b>170</b> stores various programs to be executed and data processed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and may include at least one volatile memory and one non-volatile memory. The storage unit <b>170</b> may permanently or temporarily store an operating system of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, programs and data related to the operation of the screen control module <b>162</b>, and application programs and data related to execution of a multimedia function.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, in a state that the rear display unit <b>120</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is turned on and a menu screen (for example, <b>121</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) is displayed, the screen control module <b>162</b> receives an input signal from a user for selecting a multimedia function from a menu screen of the rear input unit <b>140</b> in step S<b>11</b>. For example, in a state that a menu screen and a focus are displayed in the rear display unit <b>120</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> receives an input signal if the user moves the focus by using 4 direction keys of the rear input unit <b>140</b> and inputs a confirmation key.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the selected multimedia function supports a normal mode in step S<b>12</b>. Whether a multimedia function supports a normal mode is predetermined by settings. If the selected multimedia function is supported by a normal mode, the screen control module <b>162</b> displays an execution screen (for example, <b>126</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the corresponding multimedia function in the rear display unit <b>120</b> in step S<b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">While executing the multimedia function, the screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the screen change button <b>151</b> of the side input unit <b>150</b> is pressed in step S<b>14</b>. If the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed, or if the selected multimedia function does not support the normal mode in step S<b>12</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> displays a pop-up window notifying a screen change (for example, <b>123</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>) in the rear display unit <b>120</b> in step S<b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When a predetermined time duration has elapsed after displaying the pop-up window notifying a screen change in step S<b>16</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> changes the display screen by turning off the rear display unit <b>120</b> and turning on the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>17</b>, and displays an execution screen of the selected multimedia function (for example, <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> or <b>113</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>) in the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While executing the multimedia function in the front display unit <b>110</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed in step S<b>19</b>. If the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed, the screen control module <b>162</b> displays a pop-up window notifying a screen change (for example, <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>) in the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>20</b>. When a time duration has elapsed after displaying the pop-up window in step S<b>21</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> changes the display screen again by turning off the front display unit <b>110</b> and turning on the rear display unit <b>120</b> in step S<b>22</b>. At this moment, a waiting screen (for example, <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) is displayed in the rear display unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, in a state that the rear display unit <b>120</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is turned on and a waiting screen (for example, <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) is displayed, the screen control module <b>162</b> determines whether a shortcut button <b>153</b> is input in step S<b>31</b>. The shortcut button <b>153</b> is used for entering a multimedia function in a waiting screen, and is formed in the side input unit <b>150</b>. Alternatively, a shortcut function of the shortcut button <b>153</b> may be assigned to a function key of the rear input unit <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the shortcut button <b>153</b> is pressed, the screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the multimedia function assigned to the shortcut button <b>153</b> supports a normal mode in step S<b>32</b>. If the input multimedia function supports a normal mode, the screen control module <b>162</b> displays an execution screen of the multimedia function in the rear display unit <b>120</b> in step S<b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">While executing the multimedia function, the screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the screen change button <b>151</b> of the side input unit <b>150</b> is pressed in step S<b>34</b>. If the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed, or if the multimedia function assigned to the shortcut button <b>153</b> does not support a normal mode in step S<b>32</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> displays a pop-up window notifying a screen change in the rear display unit <b>120</b> in step S<b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When a time duration has elapsed after displaying the pop-up window notifying a screen change, the screen control module <b>162</b> changes the display screen by turning off the rear display unit <b>120</b> and turning on the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>36</b>. Subsequently, the screen control module <b>162</b> displays an execution screen of the corresponding multimedia function in the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to this exemplary embodiment, between steps S<b>36</b> and S<b>38</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> may selectively display a menu screen of multimedia functions (for example, <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>) according to a time duration time of an input by identifying whether the shortcut button <b>153</b> is pressed for an extended time duration or for a short time duration in step S<b>37</b>. For example, if the shortcut button <b>153</b> is pressed for a short time duration upon changing the display screen, the execution screen of the multimedia function is immediately displayed in the front display unit <b>110</b>. If the shortcut button <b>153</b> is pressed for an extended time duration, upon changing the display screen, the multimedia menu screen is displayed for selection of a multimedia function. Upon selections, the execution screen of the selected multimedia function is then displayed. In another example, the shortcut button <b>153</b> may be set to perform in a converse manner; that is, if the shortcut button <b>153</b> is pressed for an extended time duration, the execution screen is immediately displayed, and if pressed for a short time duration, the multimedia menu is first displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">While executing the multimedia function in the front display unit <b>110</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed. If the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed, the screen control module <b>162</b> changes the display screen back to the rear display unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>, in a state that the rear display unit <b>120</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is turned on and a waiting screen is displayed, the screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the screen change button <b>151</b> of the side input unit <b>150</b> is pressed in step S<b>41</b>. If the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed, the screen control module <b>162</b> displays a pop-up window notifying a screen change in the rear display unit <b>120</b> in step S<b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When a time duration has elapsed after displaying the pop-up window notifying a screen change, the screen control module <b>162</b> changes the display screen by turning off the rear display unit <b>120</b> and turning on the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>43</b>. The screen control module <b>162</b> stores the last state of multimedia execution and displays the corresponding multimedia function menu screen in the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether a multimedia function is selected from the menu screen in step S<b>45</b>. If a multimedia function is selected from the menu screen, an execution screen of the selected multimedia function is displayed in the front display unit <b>110</b> in step S<b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Subsequently, while executing the multimedia function in the front display unit <b>110</b>, the screen control module <b>162</b> identifies whether the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed. If the screen change button <b>151</b> is pressed, the screen control module <b>162</b> changes the display screen to the rear display unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention provides a mobile terminal having a dual display unit, and a method of changing a display screen from a rear display unit supporting a normal mode to a front display unit supporting a multimedia mode, and returning to the rear display unit, when execution of a multimedia function is required in the rear display unit. Such a method of changing a display screen provides an optimum environment in a mobile terminal having additional multimedia functions, and may be applied widely according to the screen state of the rear display unit and the multimedia function to be executed.
