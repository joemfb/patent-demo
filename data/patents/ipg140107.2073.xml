<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A formliner, sheet, system, and methods of use and manufacture are provided in order to provide a product that can minimize and/or eliminate visible seaming between interconnected formliners during fabrication of a pattern on a curable material. In some embodiments, the formliner can comprise raised sections that define interrelated inner and outer dimensions. Thus, a plurality of formliners can be interconnected by overlaying raised sections thereof. Further, the formliner can comprise one or more detents and one or more protrusions to enable engagement between interconnected formliners without requiring adhesives. In this manner, formliners can be interconnected in a nested manner such that visible seaming between the interconnected formliners is reduced and/or eliminated.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/406,896, filed Mar. 18, 2009, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/238,294, filed Sep. 25, 2008, which is pending, the entirety of the contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Inventions</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present inventions relate generally to concrete formliners and methods of using the same. More specifically, the present inventions relate to an improved formliner with snap fitting components that eliminates the need for using adhesives for interconnecting a plurality of formliners in a pattern. Further, the formliner is configured to reduce and/or eliminate visible seams in order to create a more natural appearance in a finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Decorative masonry and concrete construction have become increasingly popular in recent years. The fa&#xe7;ades of homes and other buildings that had previously been constructed in very simple and plain concrete are now being replaced with either decorative stone and brick or decorative concrete construction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a result of the increased demand for stone and brick work, various improvements have been made in stone and brick masonry and concrete construction. These improvements have lowered the cost for such construction by decreasing the time or skill requirements previously needed to perform such work.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in stone and brick masonry, facings and floors have traditionally constructed by skilled artisans from individual units. However, recent advances have been made in the masonry art which allow artisans to more quickly and accurately perform stone or brick work. In particular, various panels, forms, and mounting systems have been developed that allow individual units to be placed in precise geometric patterns, thus eliminating much of the painstaking effort usually expended by the artisan. This now allows generally unskilled artisans, such as the do-it-yourselfer, to create a high-quality product.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Perhaps more importantly for projects with a tighter budget, advances in concrete construction now allow artisans to create a faux stone or brick appearance in concrete with a formliner. As a result, one may achieve the appearance of stone or brick without the associated cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A concrete formliner generally comprises an interior surface onto which concrete is poured. The interior surface of the formliner typically includes a desired pattern or shape that will be transferred to the concrete to form a cured concrete casting. In many cases, the formliner is lined up with additional formliners to create a pattern over a wide area. The concrete casting can be created in a horizontal (such as for tilt up construction) or vertical casting process, and can be pre-cast, or cast-at-site construction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">After the concrete has cured, the formliners are removed from the exposed surface of the concrete, thus revealing the desired pattern or shape. Such patterns or shapes can include faux stone or brick, wave patterns, emblems, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As noted above, in recent years, significant advances have been made in the art of concrete laying. Various techniques and equipment have been developed that allow for the creation of decorative patterns in the concrete, especially a faux stone or brick appearance. The results of such techniques and equipment provide the appearance of stone or brick without the cost.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, according to at least one of the embodiments disclosed herein is the realization that in using multiple formliners, seams are created between the formliners where the formliners meet. For example, in order to create a large pattern or casting with prior art formliners, the formliners are merely placed together using butt joints, thus creating significant visible seams between the formliners. As a result, the appearance of the exposed surface of the concrete is compromised. An unsightly seam is very easy to notice and takes a substantial amount of time and effort to remove from cured concrete. Further, in large-scale projects, it is simply too cost prohibitive to re-work the cured concrete in order to remove the seams. As such, the seams are simply left in place resulting in an inferior concrete product.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, the present inventions provide for formliners and methods of use. For example, the formliner can have one or more cells and one or more raised sections or ribs, wherein the formliner is shaped and configured to be interconnected with other such formliners to create a pattern or array of formliners which nest with each other such that an applied material provides a natural appearance and does not show seaming between the formliners that were interconnected to create the pattern. As discussed herein, there are various features that can be incorporated into this broad conception of the formliner in order to provide various combinations and embodiments of the formliner. In the present description, the disclosed features can be optionally incorporated into the above-noted formliner and its method of use in any combination. Additionally, Applicants describe these features and methods in copending patent applications, International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/058489, filed Sep. 25, 2009, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/406,896, filed Mar. 18, 2009, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/238,294, filed Sep. 25, 2008, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with yet another embodiment, a method is provided for transferring a decorative pattern to an exposed surface of a curable material. The method comprise providing a plurality of formliners, each formliner comprising one or more shaped regions being bounded by ridges, each formliner defining overlapped ridges and overlapping ridges. The method can comprise engaging a first formliner with a second formliner by overlaying overlapping ridges of the first formliner onto overlapped ridges of the second formliner. For example, the method can comprise abutting an opening formed in the overlapping ridge of the first formliner with a transition zone formed in the second formliner, the transition zone being formed between the overlapped ridge and a non-overlap ridge of the second formliner. The method can also comprise placing the curable material against the first and second formliners, for example, to transmit a decorative pattern formed by the shaped regions of the first and second formliners to the curable material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, each formliner can comprise non-overlap ridges and at least one opening formed in the overlapping ridges. Thus, the method can further comprise overlaying the overlapping ridges of the first formliner onto the overlapped ridges of the second formliner with a non-overlap ridge of the second formliner extending from an opening of the overlapping ridges of the first formliner. The non-overlap ridge of the second formliner can be interconnected with and extend from the overlapped ridge of the second formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the non-overlap ridge of the second formliner can be separated from the overlapped ridge of the second formliner by a transition zone formed in the second formliner, and the method further comprises abutting the opening of the first formliner with the transition zone of the second formliner. In some embodiments, the overlapping ridge and the non-overlap ridge can have generally the same exterior cross-sectional profile. The opening can be formed as an open end of the overlapping ridge of the first formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The overlapping ridges of the first formliner can define an interior cross-sectional profile that is greater than an exterior cross-sectional profile of the overlapped ridges of the second formliner. In such embodiments, the method can comprise engaging a third formliner with the first formliner and the second formliner. The third formliner can comprise overlapping ridges and overlapped ridges. One of the first, second, and third formliners can comprise a sub-overlapped ridge section that defines an exterior cross-sectional profile that is less than an interior cross-sectional profile of the overlapped ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, the sub-overlapped ridge section can be formed along a corner of a periphery of the third formliner. The method can comprise overlaying an overlapped ridge onto the sub-overlapped ridge section. Thus, in some embodiments, the third formliner can comprise the sub-overlapped ridge section formed along a corner of a periphery of the third formliner, and the first formliner and the second formliner can overlap the third formliner at the sub-overlapped ridge section of the third formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments of the method, the first formliner and the second formliner can each comprise at least one row with a projecting cell bordered in at least one adjacent row with a non-projecting cell, and the method can comprise engaging the first formliner and the second formliner with a projecting cell in a first row of the first formliner being positioned adjacent to a non-projecting cell in a first row of the second formliner and a projecting cell in a second row of the second formliner being positioned adjacent to a non-projecting cell in a second row of the first formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, in some embodiments, edges the overlapping ridges of the first formliner can extend downwardly toward a bottom portion of respective shaped regions located adjacent to overlapped ridges of the second formliner. The method can comprise placing the curable material against the overlapping ridges of the first formliner such that the edges of the overlapping ridges of the first formliner are urged adjacent to the bottom portion of respective shaped regions to minimize and/or eliminate a seam formed between the edges and the bottom portion of the respective shaped regions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method can also comprise: interconnecting a first formliner with a second formliner by overlaying a first section of a rib of the first formliner onto a second section of a rib of the second formliner such that the second section of the rib of the second formliner is nested within a recess of the first section of the rib of the first formliner; and positioning an exterior surface of the first section of the rib of the first formliner flush with an exterior surface of a first section of the rib of the second formliner upon nesting of the second section of the second formliner within the first section of the first formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In such embodiments, the method can further comprise interconnecting a third formliner with the first and second formliners by overlaying the first section of the rib of the first formliner and the second section of the rib of the second formliner onto a third section of a rib of the third formliner. Further, the method can comprise positioning an exterior surface of a first section of the rib of the third formliner flush with the exterior surface of the first section of the rib of one of the first and second formliners upon nesting of the third section of the rib of the third formliner within the first section of the rib of the first formliner and the second section of the rib of the second formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, the method can further comprise mating an opening in the first section of the first formliner against a transition zone of the second formliner such that visible seams in the decorative pattern are minimized when the first formliner and the second formliner are interconnected in use. The transition zone can be formed between the first and second sections of the rib of the second formliner. Further, the opening can be formed as an open end of the first section of the first formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the method can comprise engaging a first formliner with a second formliner by overlaying overlapping ridges of the first formliner on to overlapped ridges of the second formliner and causing engagement between a protrusion of one of the overlapping ridges with a detent of one of the overlapped ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One of the unique aspects of such a method is that it can be implemented such that no adhesive is used to engage the first formliner with the second formliner. In some implementations, the step of causing engagement between a protrusion of one of the overlapping ridges with a detent of one of the overlapped ridges can be completed prior to placing the curable material against the first and second formliners. Further, the step of causing engagement between a protrusion of one of the overlapping ridges with a detent of one of the overlapped ridges can comprise engaging a pair of protrusions of an overlapping ridge with a pair of detents of the overlapped ridge. In this regard, the pair of protrusions can be disposed on opposing sides of the overlapping ridge and the pair of detents can be disposed on opposing sides of the overlapped ridge.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, the method can also comprise the step of engaging a third formliner with the first formliner and the second formliner. The third formliner can comprise overlapping ridges and overlapped ridges, and one of the first, second, and third formliner comprising a sub-overlapped ridge section. The sub-overlapped ridge section can define an exterior geometry that can be less than an interior geometry of the overlapped ridges. In this regard, the method can further comprise overlaying an overlapped ridge onto the sub-overlapped ridge section. Additionally, the sub-overlapped ridge section can be formed along a corner of a periphery of the first formliner, and the method can comprise overlaying the second formliner and the third formliner onto the first formliner at the sub-overlapped ridge section of the first formliner.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">While the present description sets forth specific details of various embodiments, it will be appreciated that the description is illustrative only and should not be construed in any way as limiting. Furthermore, various applications of such embodiments and modifications thereto, which may occur to those who are skilled in the art, are also encompassed by the general concepts described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As generally discussed above, embodiments of the present inventions are advantageously configured in order to enhance the aesthetic finish of a concrete structure. In particular, embodiments disclosed herein can be used to create a natural, seamless appearance of brick, stone, and other types of materials in a concrete structure.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In contrast to prior art formliners that produce an inferior quality product, the structures of embodiments of the formliner disclosed herein, which can also be referred to as a panel or sheet, allow the formliner to create decorative patterns that are visually superior to results provided through the prior art. These significant advantages are due at least in part to the nesting arrangement of the variable size channels of embodiments of the formliner disclosed herein. In particular, the formliner can comprise one or more large interconnection sections and one or more small interconnection sections such that a plurality of formliners can be interconnected at their respective large and small interconnection sections. When interconnected, the plurality of formliners can define one or more generally continuous dimensions or shapes of raise portions thereof. For example, the large and small interconnection sections can configured as nesting semi-cylinders that form a rib structure. Additional advantages and features of embodiments of the formliner are discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the formliner can be attached to another formliner and/or a form work by means of an adhesive. The adhesive can be disposed on a rear surface or back of the formliner and/or onto a front surface of the formliner. For example, the adhesive can be disposed on the front surface along a rib or ridge that will be overlaid by a portion of another formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the adhesive can be applied to the formliner at the site. For example, the adhesive can be applied or sprayed onto the formliner. However, in other embodiments, the formliner can comprise an adhesive that can be activated or exposed in order to enable adhesive attachment of the formliner to another formliner or to a form work. In such embodiments, the adhesive can be pre-applied to the formliner and can be exposed by removing a cover strip or activated by dampening with a liquid such as water or otherwise. As such, by peeling away a cover strip or by providing moisture to the adhesive, the adhesive can be activated to adhesively attach the formliner to another formliner or to a form work. As noted above In this manner, the formliner can be securely attached another formliner in a pattern and/or to a form work to facilitate handling and placement of the formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Embodiments of the formliner and formliner components disclosed herein can be manufactured using any of a variety of processes. For example, it is contemplated that some embodiments can be formed using a sheet and a vacuum forming operation. Other manufacturing processes such as injection molding, stamping, extrusion, etc. can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">With reference now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a formliner, panel, or sheet <b>100</b>. The formliner <b>100</b> can comprise a plurality of ribs, ridges, or channels <b>102</b>. The ribs <b>102</b> can be a raised portion of the formliner <b>100</b>. The ribs <b>102</b> can define an outer perimeter of the formliner <b>100</b>. Additionally, the ribs <b>102</b> can extend inwardly to form one or more cells or recesses <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the cells <b>104</b> can comprise a recessed portion of the formliner <b>100</b>. The recessed portion of the cell <b>104</b> can be configured to receive a curable material to which a pattern of the formliner can be conferred or transferred. The cells <b>104</b> can be uniformly sized. For example, the cells <b>104</b> can be rectangularly shaped. As discussed below, embodiments of the formliner <b>100</b> can implement other shapes, depths, and sizes of the cells <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cells or recesses <b>104</b> can be arranged in rows. As will be discussed further below, the cells or recesses <b>104</b> of a given row can be offset with respect to cells or recesses of an adjacent or neighboring row. In this regard, a plurality of formliners <b>100</b> can be interconnected along ends thereof in such a way as to reduce any visible appearance of a seam between interconnected formliners. The offset configuration of the cells or recesses <b>104</b> in some embodiments can aid in concealing or hiding any seaming between formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Additionally, the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that the cells <b>104</b> of adjacent rows can be offset from each other such that at opposing ends of the formliner <b>100</b>, some of the cells <b>104</b> protrude at the end. In this regard, the rows can be formed to include projecting and non-projecting cells <b>104</b>. The projecting cells can be considered to be complete or whole cells. In other words, the projecting cells are not smaller in size than other cells <b>104</b> of the pattern even though the offset configuration of the cells <b>104</b> causes the projecting cells to protrude at one side or end of the formliner <b>100</b>. As will be discussed further below, the projecting cells of the pattern can be interconnected with projecting cells of another formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be used to create a faux brick pattern on a concrete structure. The formliner <b>100</b> can define a panel periphery bounding the plurality of cells <b>104</b> by a plurality of sides. The formliner <b>100</b> defines an upper surface <b>110</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the formliner <b>100</b> also defines a lower surface. In use, the upper surface <b>110</b> of the formliner <b>100</b> would be positioned such that it can be pressed into fresh concrete. This can be accomplished by placing the upper surface <b>110</b> of the formliner <b>100</b> against an exposed surface of fresh concrete. Otherwise, this can be accomplished by affixing the lower surface of the formliner <b>100</b> to an interior wall of a pattern, casting, or formwork before concrete is poured into the pattern, casting, or formwork. In either case, a material, such as concrete can be placed against the decorative pattern of the formliner <b>100</b> defined by the ribs <b>102</b> and the cells <b>104</b> in order to transfer the decorative pattern to the exposed surface of the material as the material cures.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In many cases, the exposed surface of a given structure, such as a wall, walking area, or the like, consists of a large surface area. In order to cover the entire area, several formliners must be used. As shown in the formliner assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, several formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b> can be interconnected in order to transfer a decorative pattern onto a large surface area. The interconnection of these formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b> provides a distinct advantage over prior art to formliners because the seams between the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b> are insubstantial and/or eliminated compared to prior art formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that the formliner <b>120</b> can comprise projecting cells <b>125</b> in the formliner <b>122</b> can comprise one or more projecting cells <b>126</b>. These projecting cells <b>125</b>, <b>126</b> can be positioned in different rooms of the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. Thus, the projecting cells <b>125</b> can be positioned adjacent to non-projecting cells of the formliner <b>122</b> in the projecting cell <b>126</b> can be positioned adjacent to a non-projecting cell of the formliner <b>120</b>. Thus, the cells of the formliner <b>120</b> can be offset with respect to each other and with respect to cells above the formliner <b>122</b>. Moreover, the interconnection of the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> can be accomplished using offset projecting cells <b>125</b>, <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In accordance with some embodiments, the formliner <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be configured such that a plurality of formliners <b>100</b> can be interconnected at their top and bottom ends and sides. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates this principle. The formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b> are each interconnected and overlap each other. This interconnection allows the formliners to be easily handled and assembled to a given size. Importantly however, the formliner is configured such that portions thereof can overlap and create a generally uniform and seamless rib structure on the upper surface <b>110</b> of the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b>. In other words, the shape and depth of the rib structure formed in the exposed surface of the concrete structure can be generally constant and the transition from a given formliner to another given formliner can be generally imperceptible.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Moreover, in some embodiments, edges of each of the respective formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b> can lie along a corner or edge feature of the decorative pattern. As such, when a curable material is placed in against the formliners and takes the shape, in this case of a rectangle having right-angle corners, an edge <b>127</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> forms a portion of the corner of the molded or formed rectangle and becomes nearly imperceptible. Accordingly, the overlapping edges <b>127</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> create minimal visible seaming, if at all, between the formliners <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>. This principle is illustrated in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Additionally, transition zones or joints <b>128</b> are formed where upper surfaces of ribs the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b> meet. In this regard, the transition zones or joints <b>128</b> can be toleranced in order to define an extremely narrow gap between interconnected formliners. Thus, any seaming at the transition zones or joints <b>128</b> can also be greatly reduced in order to reduce and/or eliminate visible seaming.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this regard, the formliner <b>100</b> can be configured such that the plurality of ribs <b>102</b> includes one or more overlapping portions <b>130</b> and one or more overlapped portions <b>132</b>. In some embodiments, the plurality of ribs <b>102</b> of the formliner <b>100</b> can be configured to comprise one or more non-overlap portions <b>134</b>. The overlapping portions <b>130</b> can be configured to include an internal cavity with an internal geometry that accommodates the external geometry of the overlapped portions <b>132</b>. Thus, the overlapped portions <b>132</b> can be received within the internal cavities of the overlapping portions <b>130</b>. The non-overlap portions <b>134</b> can extend between overlapping portions <b>130</b> and overlapped portions <b>132</b>. However, the non-overlap portions <b>134</b> will not overlap or be overlapped by portions of another formliner win a plurality of formliners are interconnected. When a plurality of formliners is interconnected, the external surface of the overlapping portions <b>130</b> can be flush with the external surface of the non-overlap portions <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">An illustration of this principle is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7B</figref> and described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> it is a cross-sectional side view taken along Section <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that a right side <b>140</b> of the formliner <b>120</b> overlaps with a left side <b>142</b> of the formliner <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an overlapping portion <b>144</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> rests on top of an overlapped portion <b>146</b> of the formliner <b>120</b>. The cross-sectional side view also illustrates a cell <b>150</b> of the formliner <b>120</b>. Further, the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> are configured such that the overlapping portion <b>144</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> defines an outer surface that matches an outer surface of the ribs <b>102</b> of the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b>. In other words, the overlapping portions of a formliner can have an outer dimension that is equal to an outer dimension of the non-overlap portions of the ribs of the formliner. Thus, the overall rib structure of interconnected formliners will seem continuous in shape and dimension because the overlapping portions and the non-overlap portions (and not the overlapped portions) of the ribs of the formliners are the only portions of the ribs that are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition, as discussed below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, one of the significant advantages of embodiments disclosed herein is that they are able to reduce and/or eliminate seams between adjacent formliners using the significant compressive stresses created by the weight of a curable material, such as concrete, poured onto a formliner assembly or formliner mold cavity. In other words, the configuration of the overlapped and overlapping portions of adjacent formliners enabled the weight of the material to press down upon the overlapping portions of a formliner in order to optimize the fit between overlapping portions and overlapped portions of adjacent formliners to thereby reduce any visible seaming between the formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rib structure of the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> can be generally defined by a semicylindrical or arch shape. Accordingly, the overlapping portions <b>144</b> and the overlapped portions <b>146</b> can be defined by a radius. In particular, a lower surface <b>160</b> of the overlapping portion <b>144</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> can be defined by a first radius. Similarly, an upper surface <b>162</b> of the overlapped portion <b>146</b> of the formliner <b>120</b> can be defined by a second radius. The first radius can be greater than the second radius in order to allow the overlapped portion <b>146</b> to be nested within the overlapping portion <b>144</b>. As such, the overlapped portions <b>146</b> can define a smaller cross-sectional profile than the interior cavity of the overlapping portions <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Furthermore, although the rib structure is illustrated as being formed by semicylindrical or arch shaped channels, the rib structure can be formed by a rectangular cross-section. In this regard, any variety of shapes can be used. For example, while an embodiment of the formliners discussed herein is generally intended to create an appearance of faux brick, other embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein can be designed to create an appearance of faux stone, including any of various commercial stone such as cut stone, castle rock, sand stone, ledgestone, fieldstone, etc., as well as, wood, river rock, slate, or other materials and variations, which is merely an exemplary and non-limiting list of potential appearances and applications. Thus, the rib structure can be varied and diverse. The dimensions of the rib structure can be variable and allow for irregular patterns as may be seen in natural settings of stone, brick, wood, or other materials.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In addition, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the formliner <b>100</b> can comprise a plurality of rib openings <b>180</b>. The rib openings <b>180</b> can be positioned along the ribs <b>102</b> of the rib structure of the formliner <b>100</b>. The location of the openings <b>180</b> can correspond to a location of a corresponding rib of another formliner to which the formliner <b>100</b> is interconnected. The rib openings <b>180</b> can facilitate precise alignment of a plurality of formliners. Further, the rib openings <b>180</b> can further contribute to the natural appearance of the faux brick pattern created in the concrete structure. The formation and configuration of rib openings <b>180</b> is shown and described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top view of a formliner <b>200</b> in accordance with an embodiment. As with the formliner <b>100</b>, the formliner <b>200</b> comprises a plurality of ribs <b>202</b> that form a ribs structure. The ribs <b>202</b> can comprise one or more overlapping portions <b>204</b> and one or more overlapped portions <b>206</b>. Additionally, the formliner <b>200</b> can comprise non-overlap portions <b>208</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates that the overlapping portions <b>204</b> and the non-overlap portions <b>208</b> can define a common outer dimension <b>1</b>. Thus, when a plurality of the formliners <b>200</b> are interconnected, the overlapping portions <b>204</b> overlap with the overlapped portions <b>206</b> and the resulting rib structure of the interconnected formliners has a common outer dimension <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In this regard, as discussed above, the overlapped portions <b>206</b> can define an outer dimension <b>2</b>. The outer dimension <b>2</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>1</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapping portions <b>204</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>2</b> of the overlapped portions <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Moreover, it is contemplated that in using a formliner that defines a generally rectangular perimeter, there may be sections of interconnected formliners in which more than two formliners overlap. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the formliner <b>200</b> can be configured to define a sub-overlapped section <b>210</b>. As illustrated in the upper and lower right corners of the formliner <b>200</b>, the sub-overlapped sections <b>210</b> can define an outer dimension <b>3</b>. The outer dimension <b>3</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>2</b> and the outer dimension <b>1</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapped portions <b>206</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>3</b> of the sub-overlapped portions <b>210</b>. Additionally, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the formliner <b>200</b> can also be configured to include a plurality of rib openings <b>220</b>. As similarly described above, the plurality of rib openings <b>220</b> can be located and configured to correspond with corresponding ribs of adjacent interconnected formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this manner, a single configuration of a formliner can be used to create a continuous decorative pattern that can be used for any size concrete structure. Advantageously, in contrast to prior art formliners, embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein can be interconnected to create a dimensionally continuous, precise assembly of formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an end view of the sub-overlapped section <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is illustrated. As shown, the sub-overlapped section <b>210</b> defines an outer dimension <b>3</b> that is less than the outer dimension <b>2</b> of the overlapped section <b>206</b> (shown in dashed lines). Additionally, the outer dimension <b>1</b> of the overlapping sections <b>204</b> is also shown dashed lines and illustrated as being greater than both the outer dimension <b>2</b> and the outer dimension <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of the formliner assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In particular, the formliner <b>122</b> and the formliner <b>120</b> are shown in a pre-assembled state. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates that the overlapped sections <b>146</b> of the formliner <b>120</b> are received within cavities of the overlapping sections <b>144</b> of the formliner <b>122</b>. As discussed below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the upper surfaces of the overlapping sections <b>144</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> can be generally flush with the upper surfaces of non-overlap sections <b>148</b> of the formliner <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a partial perspective view of the formliner <b>200</b>, illustrating the sub-overlapped portion <b>210</b> thereof. As shown, the sub-overlapped portion <b>210</b> defines a smaller cross-sectional profile or dimension than the overlapped portion <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of the formliner assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrating the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b>. In this view, the ribs structure of the formliner <b>120</b> comprises overlapping portions <b>300</b>, overlapped portions <b>302</b>, and a sub-overlapped portion <b>304</b>. The formliner <b>124</b> is first placed onto the overlapped portion <b>302</b> of the formliner <b>120</b>. As can be appreciated, an overlapping portion <b>310</b> of the formliner <b>124</b> is placed onto an overlapped portion <b>302</b> of the formliner <b>120</b>. Additionally, an overlapped portion <b>312</b> (shown as a T-connection) of the formliner <b>124</b> is placed onto the sub-overlapped portion <b>304</b> of the formliner <b>120</b>. Finally, overlapping portions <b>320</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> are placed onto the overlapped portions <b>302</b> of the formliner <b>120</b> and the overlapped portion <b>312</b> of the formliner <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">One of the unique features of embodiments disclosed herein is the inclusion of rib openings that allow the overlapped portions of the ribs to be nested within overlapping portions of other ribs and to extend through the rib openings. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, rib openings <b>150</b> can be provided in the overlapping sections <b>144</b> of the formliner <b>122</b>. Further, with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a rib opening <b>322</b> is provided in the overlapping portions <b>320</b> of the formliner <b>122</b>. This rib opening <b>322</b> allows the overlapping portions <b>320</b> to be overlaid onto the overlapped portion <b>312</b> with the overlapped portion <b>312</b> extending through the rib opening <b>322</b>. Similarly, a rib opening <b>324</b> allows the overlapped portions <b>302</b> the past therethrough thus enabling the overlapping portions <b>320</b> to be overlaid onto the overlapped portions <b>302</b>. Finally, the illustrated embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also shows a rib opening <b>326</b> formed in the overlapped portion <b>312</b>, which enables the sub-overlapped portion <b>304</b> to extend therethrough. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the rib openings of some embodiments disclosed herein uniquely allow overlapping formliners to minimize visible seaming by allowing the overlapping portions of the formliners to fit tightly and closely together.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, once assembled, the overlapping portions <b>300</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>320</b> each define a common outer dimension or shape. Thus, when the formliner assembly is pressed into an exposed surface of fresh concrete or when concrete is poured thereagainst, the impressions of the rib structure of the formliner assembly will appear seamless and uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In addition, as will be appreciated, once the formliners <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b> are assembled, an edge <b>330</b> of the overlapping portion <b>310</b> of the formliner <b>124</b> will be disposed into a corner <b>332</b> formed between the overlapped portion <b>302</b> and a cell <b>334</b> of the formliner <b>120</b>. As such, any seaming between the overlapping portion <b>310</b> of the formliner <b>124</b> and the cell <b>334</b> of the formliner <b>120</b> will be reduced and/or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Similarly, an edge <b>340</b> of the overlapping portion <b>320</b> of the formliner <b>122</b> will be disposed into a corner <b>342</b> formed by the overlapped portion <b>302</b> and the cell <b>334</b>. Thus, seaming between the formliner <b>120</b> and formliner <b>122</b> will be greatly reduced and/or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates many of the above-discussed principles. In this figure, a first formliner <b>400</b> is mated with a second formliner <b>402</b>. And overlapping portion <b>406</b> of the first formliner <b>400</b> is placed onto an overlapped portion <b>408</b> of the second formliner <b>402</b>. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the mating of an edge <b>410</b> of the overlapping portion <b>406</b> with <b>412</b> of the second formliner <b>402</b> can create an imperceptible seam between the first and second formliners <b>400</b>, <b>402</b>. Further, transition zones or joints <b>420</b> between the overlapping portion <b>406</b> of the first formliner <b>400</b> and an overlapping portion <b>422</b> of the second formliner <b>402</b> can be minimized so as to reduce and/or eliminate any visible seaming at the transition zones or joints <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an enlarged view of a transition zone or joint <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is illustrated. As shown, the transition zone or joint <b>420</b> can comprise a simple step <b>430</b> from a first dimension to a second dimension. In some embodiments, this may be an immediate increase in the dimension along the rib of the second formliner, specifically from the overlapped portion <b>408</b> to the overlapping portion <b>422</b>. However, in other embodiments, it is contemplated that the step <b>430</b> can be a tapered transition between the overlapped portion <b>408</b> in the overlapping portion <b>422</b>. Additionally, a side edge <b>432</b> of the overlapping portion <b>406</b> of the first formliner <b>400</b> can be configured to correspond to the shape and dimension of the step <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also illustrates the nesting arrangement of the overlapping portion <b>406</b> of the first formliner <b>400</b> is shown with respect to the overlapped portion <b>408</b> of the second formliner <b>402</b>. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also illustrates the orientation of the edge <b>410</b> of the overlapping portion <b>406</b> of the formliner <b>400</b> is shown with respect to the cell <b>412</b> of the second formliner <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it will be appreciated that a seam <b>440</b> formed between the edge <b>410</b> and the cell <b>412</b> can be reduced as the fit between the first formliner <b>400</b> and the second formliner <b>402</b> are optimized. In this regard, the internal geometry of the overlapping portion <b>406</b> can be specifically configured to match the external geometry of the overlapped portion <b>408</b>, thus reducing any seam (whether along the edge <b>410</b> or the side edge <b>432</b>) between the overlapping portion <b>406</b> and the overlapped portion <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As noted above, one of the advantages of embodiments disclosed herein is that seams of overlapped portions of adjacent formliners can be minimized and/or eliminated. In this regard, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the seam <b>440</b> is created along a corner at or along a bottom portion of the cell <b>412</b> of the formliner <b>402</b> which forms part of a prepared formliner mold cavity. In this regard, the seam <b>440</b> is positioned such that the weight of a curable material, such as concrete, against the first formliner <b>400</b> causes the overlapping portion <b>406</b> of the first formliner <b>400</b> to be pressed against the overlapped portion <b>408</b> of the second formliner <b>402</b> with great force thereby causing the edge <b>410</b> to be positioned as close as possible relative to the cell <b>412</b> in order to minimize and/or eliminate the seam <b>440</b> between the adjacent formliners <b>400</b>, <b>402</b>. This innovative feature of embodiments disclosed herein, which allows seams to be created along the bottom faces or portions of the mold allows the weight of the curable material to act as a compressive agent in reducing and/or eliminating seams between adjacent formliners. For example, a common curable material such as concrete generally weighs 150 pounds per cubic foot, and embodiments of the present inventions are able to take advantage of the significant force of such a material in order to create an aesthetically superior product.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Furthermore, the tolerances between the overlapping portion <b>406</b> and the overlapped portion <b>408</b> can also define a seam <b>442</b>. Specifically, the distance between the edge <b>432</b> and the step <b>430</b> can define the seam <b>442</b>. It is contemplated that the overlapping portion <b>406</b> can be toleranced with a longitudinal length such that the edge <b>432</b> thereof abuts the step <b>430</b>. It is also contemplated that as with the seam <b>440</b>, the compressive forces of the material against the first formliner <b>400</b> and the second formliner <b>402</b> can serve to reduce the size of the seam <b>442</b> to thereby create a superior finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref>, it is noted that the above-discussed embodiments of the formliner and formliner components provide for a distinct shelf or step between rib sections having differing geometries or configurations. For example, as noted above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the step <b>430</b> is a transition zone, shelf, or shoulder between the overlapping portion <b>422</b> and the overlapped portion <b>408</b> of the second formliner <b>402</b>. as briefly mentioned above, the step <b>430</b> can provide a gradual transition from the overlapping portion <b>422</b> to the overlapped portion <b>408</b>. however, in some embodiments, it is contemplated that the formliner can be formed with ribs or ridges that taper from a first geometry or configuration to a second geometry or configuration. As such, the shoulder <b>430</b> can be eliminated from such embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, referring generally to a side view similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is contemplated that a rib can taper from a first dimension or configuration in an overlapping portion to a second dimension or configuration in an overlapped portion. In yet other embodiments, it is contemplated that the rib can taper from the second dimension or configuration to a third dimension or configuration. The tapering of the rib from one dimension to another can comprise a generally constant taper or a variable taper.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, in some embodiments, overlapping portions of the ribs of the formliner can be configured to define a variable thickness corresponding to the tapering of the overlapped portions onto which the overlapping portions will be overlaid. As such, the cumulative dimension or configuration of nested or overlaid rib portions can be generally constant. However, it is likewise contemplated that the thickness of overlapping or interconnecting formliners can be generally constant along their respective ribs or ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Additionally, in accordance with at least one of the embodiments disclosed herein is the realization that in forming a pattern of interconnected formliners, the edges along the top, bottom, left, and right sides of a pattern or casting can be carefully arranged in order to ensure a natural appearance. Commonly, a plurality of formliners must be used in order to form a pattern or casting larger than a few square feet in size. Typically, in arranging or interconnecting the formliners, an artisan may begin from a top left corner and work down and across toward the bottom right corner. Thus, the left side and the top side of the pattern or casting can generally be comprised of whole or entire formliners that are interconnected vertically and horizontally. Additionally, formliners located in the center portions of the pattern or casting are also whole or entire formliners. However, according to at least one of the embodiments disclosed herein is the realization that formliners located along the bottom and right sides of the pattern or casting may only be partial sheets. In some embodiments, this deficiency can be overcome by providing alternative embodiments of a formliner that enable the artisan to create desirable bottom and right side edges and/or that can be interconnected with other formliners along a partial length thereof in order to form a clean edge, whether it is a straight edge, curved edge, angled edge, or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Accordingly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>, alternative formliner embodiments are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a formliner end portion <b>500</b> is shown. The formliner end portion <b>500</b> can comprise many of the same features as discussed above with respect to the other formliner embodiments. However, the formliner end portion <b>500</b> can also optionally comprise a generally straight side <b>502</b> that is configured to mate with a corresponding formliner end portion. In this regard, it is contemplated that in use, the formliner end portion <b>500</b> can be used at a far side or end of the desired pattern. For example, the formliner end portion <b>500</b> can be used for a left side boundary or a right side boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some embodiments, the formliner end portion <b>500</b> can be configured to mate with another formliner to form a corner of a pattern, casting, or formwork. In such an embodiment, the formliner end portion <b>500</b> can also optionally comprise a ledge recess <b>522</b>, as described below. For example, the ledge recess <b>522</b> can be forwarded by a length of the ribs <b>504</b> which comprises a reduced geometry or dimension, as shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Accordingly, some embodiments of the formliner end portion <b>500</b> can be provided in which the side <b>502</b> can mate with corresponding formliner components or portions.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">For example, an exemplary mating arrangement of the formliner end portion <b>500</b> with a formliner component or portion is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As shown therein, the formliner end portion <b>500</b> can receive a corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b>. The formliner end portion <b>500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b> can be interconnected or positioned such that they form a corner in a pattern, casting, or formwork.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In accordance with the embodiments of the formliner end portion <b>500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b> can define a plurality of recesses <b>512</b> formed at the ends of rib members <b>514</b>. The recesses <b>512</b> can be configured to allow the rib members <b>514</b> to fit over the ribs <b>504</b> of the formliner end portion <b>500</b>. Thus, the formliner end portion <b>500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b> can be positioned relative to each other at a right angle such that a right angle corner in the pattern or casting is produced. However, it is contemplated that the recesses <b>512</b> can define other shapes that allowed the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b> to be oriented at any variety of angles relative to the formliner end portion <b>500</b>. In this regard, the side <b>502</b> can be oriented generally perpendicularly relative to the ribs <b>504</b>, or the side <b>502</b> can be disposed at an angle relative to the ribs <b>504</b>, thereby facilitating a desired angular interconnection between the formliner end portion <b>500</b> and the corresponding formliner and portion <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Additionally, in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b> can also comprise a mating ledge <b>520</b>. In some embodiments, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be connected to both the ribs <b>514</b> and the planar portions of the cells above the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b>. As such, the mating ledge <b>520</b> could be generally rigidly positioned relative to the ribs <b>514</b>. Such an embodiment could be advantageous in facilitating the alignment between the formliner end portion <b>500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b>. In this regard, as mentioned above with respect to the side <b>502</b>, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be oriented at a given angle relative to the ribs <b>514</b>. As illustrated, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be oriented at approximately a right angle relative to the ribs <b>514</b>. However, it is contemplated that the mating ledge <b>520</b> can also be oriented at any variety of angles relative to the ribs <b>514</b>. In some embodiments, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be configured to fit into or be received in the ledge recess <b>522</b> formed along the formliner and portion <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">However, in other embodiments, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be hingedly or moveably attached to the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b>. For example, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be attached to the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b> along the length of the cells thereof, but not connected to the ribs <b>514</b>. In other words, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be separated or cut from the ribs <b>514</b> by means of a slit <b>530</b>. Thus, the slit <b>530</b> can allow the mating ledge <b>520</b> to be generally flexible or movable relative to the corresponding formliner end portion <b>510</b>. In such embodiments, the mating ledge <b>520</b> can be folded under a portion of the formliner end portion <b>500</b>. Optionally, the side <b>502</b> of the formliner and portion <b>500</b> can be eliminated in order to allow the mating ledge <b>520</b> to extend to underneath the formliner end portion <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">However, in other embodiments, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it is contemplated that the ledge recess can be eliminated and that the ribs define a generally constant cross-sectional geometry. For example, the cross-sectional geometry of the ribs can be generally constant along central portions and end portions of the ribs adjacent the side of the formliner end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a formliner end portion <b>550</b> can comprise one or more ribs <b>552</b>. Optionally, the formliner end portion can also comprise a side <b>554</b>. However, as described above, the side <b>554</b> can also be eliminated in some embodiments. Additionally, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>560</b> can be configured to mate with the formliner end portion <b>550</b>. The embodiment of the corresponding formliner and portion <b>560</b> does not include the mating ledge of the embodiment discussed in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As will be appreciated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, openings <b>562</b> in ribs <b>564</b> of the corresponding formliner end portion <b>560</b> can be mated against the ribs <b>522</b> of the formliner end portion <b>550</b> to create a corner of a desired angle measurement for a pattern or casting. Further, the openings <b>562</b> are preferably configured such that an edge <b>566</b> of the corresponding formliner end portion <b>560</b> can be positioned against the top surface of the cells of the formliner end portion <b>550</b>. Optionally, the openings <b>562</b> can be configured to be manipulated in order to allow varying angles of orientation between the formliner end portion <b>550</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>560</b>. For example, a portion of the ribs <b>564</b> can be configured as a &#x201c;tear away&#x201d; that allows the openings <b>562</b> to be enlarged. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> can facilitate a tight fit between the formliner end portion <b>550</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, another embodiment of a formliner end portion <b>570</b> can be provided which comprises one or more ribs <b>572</b>. As noted above, the formliner end portion <b>570</b> is an embodiment in which no side is used. Similar to the other embodiments disclosed herein, the formliner end portion <b>570</b> can be configured to mate with a corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b>. The embodiment of the corresponding formliner and portion <b>580</b> does not include the mating ledge of the embodiment discussed in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As will be appreciated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, openings <b>582</b> in ribs <b>584</b> of the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b> can be mated against the ribs <b>572</b> of the formliner end portion <b>570</b> to create a corner of a desired angle measurement for a pattern or casting.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Additionally, as illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b> can comprise a flange <b>586</b> extending from an edge thereof. The flange <b>586</b> can be monolithically formed with the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b>. The flange <b>586</b> can be flexible relative to other portions of the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b>. For example, the flange <b>586</b> can be folded underneath the formliner end portion <b>570</b> when the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b> is fitted onto the formliner end portion <b>570</b>. In this manner, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b> can be placed against and/or interconnected with the formliner end portion <b>570</b>. Further, in some embodiments it is contemplated that the formliner end portion <b>570</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b> can be attached along the flange <b>586</b> by means of an adhesive. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> can facilitate a tight fit between the formliner end portion <b>570</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>580</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">It is contemplated that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref> can aid the artisan in creating a dimensionally accurate and seamless corner of a faux brick mold. It is contemplated also that other such features, such as three-point corners, convex arches, and concave arches can be formed using similar principles.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-16</figref> illustrate other embodiments of a formliner, sheet, or panel having other shapes and geometries for imparting different patterns onto the treated or exposed surface. As discussed above, such patterns can be of stone, wood, slate, or other materials. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a representation of a formliner <b>600</b> used to produce a stone pattern on an exposed surface six or <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a representation of a formliner used to produce a rock pattern on an exposed surface.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a formliner, sheet, or panel <b>700</b> having a pattern configured to provide the appearance of cut stone. As shown therein, first rib portions <b>702</b> of the formliner <b>700</b> can be configured to define a first geometry or configuration, and second rib portions <b>704</b> can define a second geometry or configuration that corresponds to the first geometry or configuration and enables multiple formliners <b>700</b> to be interconnected along the rib portions <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments, the formliner <b>700</b> can comprise one or more third rib portions <b>706</b> that can define a third geometry or configuration that corresponds to one of the first and second geometries or configurations. For example, the first rib portion <b>702</b>, the second rib portion <b>704</b>, and the third rib portion <b>706</b> can allow the formliner <b>700</b> to be overlaid with other formliners <b>700</b> in a similar manner as to the formliner <b>100</b> described above, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As mentioned above with respect to the embodiments disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref>, the first rib portions <b>702</b>, the second rib portions <b>704</b>, and the third read portions <b>706</b>, can each comprise rib portions having a generally constant geometry or configuration, such as a cross-sectional geometry. However, it is also contemplated that the first rib portions <b>702</b>, the second rib portions <b>704</b>, and the third read portions <b>706</b> of the formliner <b>700</b> can taper from one geometry or configuration to another. In other words, the ribs or ridges of the formliner <b>700</b> can taper from the first geometry or configuration to the second geometry or configuration. In yet other embodiments, the ribs or ridges of the formliner <b>700</b> can also taper from the second geometry or configuration to the third geometry or configuration. The tapering in any such embodiment can be formed as a constant taper from one geometry or configuration to another, from one corner to another or along lengths of the ribs or ridges. The tapering in other embodiments can also be formed over discrete sections of the ribs or ridges. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the ribs or bridges can be formed without a distinct shelf or step from a given geometry or configuration to another geometry or configuration. Further, it is contemplated that overlapping portions of adjacent formliners can be configured to define variable thicknesses that taper along with the dimension or configuration of that portion of the ribs or ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Moreover, the formliner <b>700</b> can also comprise one or more openings <b>710</b> in one or more of the first, second, or third rib portions <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> in order to allow nesting and overlaying of the rib portions with each other, as similarly described above with respect to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref>. In this manner, a plurality of the formliners <b>700</b> can be used to create a desirable cut stone pattern while eliminating any appearance of seaming between the formliner <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Additionally, in accordance various embodiments, no adhesive is required to interconnect a plurality of the formliners during set up. As noted above, one of the inventive realizations disclosed herein is that the set up and interconnection of formliners can also be expedited by eliminating the need to apply adhesives to the overlapping joints of interconnected formliners. Thus, the assembly time for a setting up a large pattern of interconnected formliners can be substantially reduced, as well as the cost and parts required, by eliminating the need for adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In order to provide such a superior benefit, embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein can comprise a snap-fit arrangement that allows overlapping formliners to form an interlocking joint. Thus, the formliners can be securely connected without using adhesives. Further, such embodiments also result in reduced seaming between the formliners where the formliners meet. Furthermore, another of the unique advantages of such an interlocking joint is that the joint is further stabilized and strengthened through the application of force to the overlapping formliners, such as the application of a curable material such as concrete. Therefore, such an interlocking joint not only allows for the elimination of adhesives, but also provides several structural benefits that ultimately create an aesthetically superior product.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Another unique benefit of embodiments disclosed herein is that the interlocking joint can be formed by encasing a rib or ridge of an overlapped formliner with a rib or ridge of an overlapping formliner. In other words, the rib of the overlapping formliner can comprise a recess or cavity into which the rib of the overlapped formliner can be received. The cavity can comprise an opening that is less than the cross-sectional size or passing profile of the rib of the overlapped formliner. Thus, the opening of the cavity must be expanded when the rib of the overlapped formliner is inserted therein. Such expansion can occur through deflection or elastic deformation of the opening. The rib of the overlapped formliner can be inserted into the cavity until being fully received therein such that the opening of the cavity returns to its normal size, thus collapsing around a lower portion or base of the rib of the overlapped formliner. In this manner, the rib of the overlapped formliner is encased within the cavity. The term &#x201c;snap-fit&#x201d; can refer to the interference fit, deformation, and subsequent collapsing of the opening to its normal size around the base of the rib of the overlapped formliner. Additionally, the encasing of the rib of the overlapped formliner thereby prevents horizontal and vertical relative movement between the overlapped and overlapping formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In this regard, the interlocking joint and encasing disclosed above is distinct from various other prior art systems, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,858,410, issued to Goldman (hereinafter &#x201c;Goldman&#x201d;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-C</figref> are the original FIGS. 20-22 taken from the Goldman reference and illustrate a modular brickwork form <b>802</b> that is disclosed in Goldman.

A first edge <b>807</b> of first form <b>808</b> overlaps a second edge <b>809</b> of a second form <b>810</b>. Dimples <b>806</b> on the first edge <b>807</b> nest within the dimples <b>806</b> on the second edge <b>809</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>). Goldman indicates that the dimples <b>806</b> are concave up/convex down depressions on the edge <b>804</b>. The shape and location of the dimples, raised dividers and edges allow nesting of the forms when stacked. Further, the notches or dimples <b>806</b> are also placed to overlap and nest within adjoining dimples (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of the dimples <b>806</b> of the Goldman brickwork form. Goldman indicates that the forms are stacked such that the first form <b>808</b> is placed on top of second form <b>810</b>. Dividers <b>806</b> provide a spacing &#x201c;a&#x201d; between bricks (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>). The dividers and dimpled edges <b>804</b> are tapered by an angle &#x201c;b&#x201d; to allow nesting when stacked. The edge dimension &#x201c;c&#x201d; is slightly smaller than &#x201c;a&#x201d; and is selected to provide a spaced apart dimension &#x201c;a&#x201d; between adjoining bricks when first form <b>808</b> is placed on top of the second form <b>810</b>. The depth &#x201c;d&#x201d; of dimples <b>806</b> is a function of the need to retain adjoining forms. If the forms are to be laid out on a flat horizontal surface, the dimples function only as locators, requiring a nominal projection into the adjoining edge. The depth &#x201c;d&#x201d; of the preferred embodiment in this case is less than 3 cm (0.125 inches) in comparison to the overall raised edge dimension &#x201c;e&#x201d; which is approximately 9 cm (0.375 inches).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Thus, although the Goldman reference discloses a brickwork form with dimples, the dimples thereof do not comprise any protrusion or detent, for example, to interlock the dimples <b>806</b> of the first form <b>808</b> with the dimples of the second form <b>810</b>. The dimples <b>806</b> serve only a locating function when positioning the forms to align the ridges of the forms relative to each other. However, the dimples can easily be dislodged or shifted. Further, it is apparent that loading on the edges of the forms can create deformation of the edges. Because the dimples do not serve to restrict separation between the forms in a vertical direction, such loading can cause the forms to be disengaged and become misaligned. The dimples simply do not interlock the forms or provide any meaningful engagement between the forms that can eliminate the need for adhesives. Indeed, adhesives are required in order to properly adjoin the forms disclosed in the Goldman reference.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In contrast, embodiments disclosed herein provide a secure interconnection and engagement between overlapping formliners. For example, as discussed herein, an embodiment of the formliner can comprise a protrusion and a detent such that a plurality of formliners can be interconnected with the protrusions engaging respective detents such that the formliners are not only restrained in a horizontal direction, but also in a vertical direction. As such, these features can effectively eliminate the need for glues and adhesives required by inferior prior art designs. The Goldman reference simply does not disclose such features and provides no teaching or suggestion of such features.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Embodiments of the formliner and formliner components disclosed herein can be manufactured using any of a variety of processes. For example, it is contemplated that some embodiments can be formed using a sheet and a vacuum forming operation. Other manufacturing processes such as injection molding, stamping, extrusion, etc. can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-35</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a formliner, panel, or sheet <b>1100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present inventions. The formliner <b>1100</b> can comprise a plurality of ribs, ridges, or channels <b>1102</b>. The ribs <b>1102</b> can be a raised portion of the formliner <b>1100</b>. The ribs <b>1102</b> can define an outer perimeter of the formliner <b>1100</b>. Additionally, the ribs <b>1102</b> can extend inwardly to form one or more cells or recesses <b>1104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, the cells <b>1104</b> can comprise a recessed portion of the formliner <b>1100</b>. The recessed portion of the cell <b>1104</b> can be configured to receive a curable material to which a pattern of the formliner can be conferred or transferred. The cells <b>1104</b> can be uniformly sized. For example, the cells <b>1104</b> can be rectangularly shaped. As discussed below, embodiments of the formliner <b>1100</b> can implement other shapes, depths, and sizes of the cells <b>1104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the cells or recesses <b>1104</b> can be arranged in rows. As will be discussed further below, the cells or recesses <b>1104</b> of a given row can be offset with respect to cells or recesses of an adjacent or neighboring row. In this regard, a plurality of formliners <b>1100</b> can be interconnected along ends thereof in such a way as to reduce any visible appearance of a seam between interconnected formliners. The offset configuration of the cells or recesses <b>1104</b> in some embodiments can aid in concealing or hiding any seaming between formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Additionally, the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates that the cells <b>1104</b> of adjacent rows can be offset from each other such that at opposing ends of the formliner <b>1100</b>, some of the cells <b>1104</b> protrude at the end. In this regard, the rows can be formed to include projecting and non-projecting cells <b>1104</b>. The projecting cells can be considered to be complete or whole cells. In other words, the projecting cells are not smaller than other cells <b>1104</b> of the pattern even though the offset configuration of the cells <b>1104</b> causes the projecting cells to protrude at one side or end of the formliner <b>1100</b>. As will be discussed further below, the projecting cells of the pattern can be interconnected with projecting cells of another formliner.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> can be used to create a faux brick pattern on a concrete structure. The formliner <b>1100</b> can define a panel periphery bounding the plurality of cells <b>1104</b> by a plurality of sides. The formliner <b>1100</b> defines an upper surface <b>1110</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the formliner <b>1100</b> also defines a lower surface. In use, the upper surface <b>1110</b> of the formliner <b>1100</b> would be positioned such that it can be pressed into fresh concrete. This can be accomplished by placing the upper surface <b>1110</b> of the formliner <b>1100</b> against an exposed surface of fresh concrete. Otherwise, this can be accomplished by affixing the lower surface of the formliner <b>1100</b> to an interior wall of a pattern, casting, or formwork before concrete is poured into the pattern, casting, or formwork. In either case, a material, such as concrete can be placed against the decorative pattern of the formliner <b>1100</b> defined by the ribs <b>1102</b> and the cells <b>1104</b> in order to transfer the decorative pattern to the exposed surface of the material as the material cures.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In many cases, the exposed surface of a given structure, such as a wall, walking area, or the like, consists of a large surface area. In order to cover the entire area, several formliners must be used. As shown in the formliner assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, several formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b> can be interconnected in order to transfer a decorative pattern onto a large surface area. The interconnection of these formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b> provides a distinct advantage over prior art to formliners because the seams between the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b> are insubstantial and/or eliminated compared to prior art formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates that the formliner <b>1120</b> can comprise projecting cells <b>1125</b> in the formliner <b>1122</b> can comprise one or more projecting cells <b>1126</b>. These projecting cells <b>1125</b>, <b>1126</b> can be positioned in different rooms of the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>. Thus, the projecting cells <b>1125</b> can be positioned adjacent to non-projecting cells of the formliner <b>1122</b> in the projecting cell <b>1126</b> can be positioned adjacent to a non-projecting cell of the formliner <b>1120</b>. Thus, the cells of the formliner <b>1120</b> can be offset with respect to each other and with respect to cells above the formliner <b>1122</b>. Moreover, the interconnection of the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b> can be accomplished using offset projecting cells <b>1125</b>, <b>1126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In accordance with some embodiments, the formliner <b>1100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> can be configured such that a plurality of formliners <b>1100</b> can be interconnected at their top and bottom ends and sides. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates this principle. The formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b> can be interconnected and overlap each other. This interconnection allows the formliners to be easily handled and assembled to a given size. Importantly however, the formliner is configured such that portions thereof can overlap and create a generally uniform and seamless rib structure on the upper surface <b>1110</b> of the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b>. In other words, the shape and depth of the rib structure formed in the exposed surface of the concrete structure can be generally constant and the transition from a given formliner to another given formliner can be generally imperceptible.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Moreover, in some embodiments, edges of each of the respective formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b> can lie along a corner or edge feature of the decorative pattern. As such, when a curable material is placed in against the formliners and takes the shape, in this case of a rectangle having right-angle corners, an edge <b>1127</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> forms a portion of the corner of the molded or formed rectangle and becomes nearly imperceptible. Accordingly, the overlapping edges <b>1127</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> create minimal visible seaming, if at all, between the formliners <b>1120</b> and <b>1122</b>. This principle is illustrated in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Additionally, transition zones or joints <b>1128</b> are formed where upper surfaces of ribs the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b> meet. In this regard, the transition zones or joints <b>1128</b> can be toleranced in order to define an extremely narrow gap between interconnected formliners. Thus, any seaming at the transition zones or joints <b>1128</b> can also be greatly reduced in order to reduce and/or eliminate visible seaming.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In this regard, the formliner <b>1100</b> can be configured such that the plurality of ribs <b>1102</b> includes one or more overlapping portions <b>1130</b> and one or more overlapped portions <b>1132</b>. The overlapping portions <b>1130</b> can be configured to include an internal cavity with an internal geometry that accommodates the external geometry of the overlapped portions <b>1132</b>. Thus, the overlapped portions <b>1132</b> can be received within the internal cavities of the overlapping portions <b>1130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The formliner <b>1100</b> can be configured to comprise a protrusion and a detent in order to facilitate interconnection between a plurality of formliners. For example, the ribs <b>1102</b> can be configured to comprise one or more protrusions <b>1136</b> and/or detents <b>1138</b>. In some embodiments, as shown in FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>21</b>A-C, the protrusion <b>1136</b> and/or the detent <b>1138</b> can be disposed on the rib <b>1102</b>. The protrusion <b>1136</b> and/or detent <b>1138</b> can extend along less than the entire length of a respective rib <b>1102</b> such that the protrusion <b>1136</b> and/or detent <b>1138</b> is offset from a corner or end of the respective rib. Indeed, a series of the protrusions <b>1136</b> and/or detents <b>1138</b> can extend along a length of the rib, with a series of breaks between respective protrusions <b>1136</b> and/or detents <b>1138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">For example, the protrusion <b>1136</b> can be disposed on overlapping portions <b>1130</b> of the rib <b>1102</b>, and the detent <b>1138</b> can be disposed on overlapped portions <b>1132</b> of the rib <b>1102</b>. As such, when the formliner <b>1100</b> is interconnected with other formliners, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the protrusions and the detents can engage each other to interlock the formliners in an assembled state. Due to the superior engagement created by the protrusions and detents, no adhesives need be used to secure the formliners to each other. Thus, the assembled formliner system can be placed in a form and a curable material can be placed thereon without worry of having the edges or ribs of the formliners become disengaged from each other. Moreover, no adhesive is required for such exceptional performance. As noted above, these advantages are not present or taught in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments, the plurality of ribs <b>1102</b> of the formliner <b>1100</b> can be configured to comprise one or more non-overlap portions <b>1134</b>. The non-overlap portions <b>1134</b> can extend between overlapping portions <b>1130</b> and overlapped portions <b>1132</b>. However, the non-overlap portions <b>1134</b> will not overlap or be overlapped by portions of another formliner win a plurality of formliners are interconnected. When a plurality of formliners is interconnected, the external surface of the overlapping portions <b>1130</b> can be flush with the external surface of the non-overlap portions <b>1134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">An illustration of this principle is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-C</figref> and <b>24</b> and described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> it is a cross-sectional side view taken along Section <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates that a right side <b>1140</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b> overlaps with a left side <b>1142</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, an overlapping portion <b>1144</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> rests on top of an overlapped portion <b>146</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. The cross-sectional side view also illustrates a cell <b>1150</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. Further, the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b> are configured such that the overlapping portion <b>1144</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> defines an outer surface that matches an outer surface of the ribs <b>1102</b> of the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b>. In other words, the overlapping portions of a formliner can have an outer dimension that is equal to an outer dimension of the non-overlap portions of the ribs of the formliner. Thus, the overall rib structure of interconnected formliners will seem continuous in shape and dimension because the overlapping portions and the non-overlap portions (and not the overlapped portions) of the ribs of the formliners are the only portions of the ribs that are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In addition, as discussed below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, one of the significant advantages of embodiments disclosed herein is that they are able to reduce and/or eliminate seams between adjacent formliners using the significant compressive stresses created by the weight of a curable material, such as concrete, poured onto a formliner assembly or formliner mold cavity. In other words, the configuration of the overlapped and overlapping portions of adjacent formliners enabled the weight of the material to press down upon the overlapping portions of a formliner in order to optimize the fit between overlapping portions and overlapped portions of adjacent formliners to thereby reduce any visible seaming between the formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> also illustrates that in some embodiments, the overlapping portions <b>1144</b> can comprise the protrusions <b>1136</b> that engage with detents <b>1138</b> of the overlapped portions <b>1146</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-C</figref>, the protrusions <b>1136</b> and the detents <b>1138</b> can define a generally trapezoidal cross-sectional profile. However, as described below, the protrusions and detents in some embodiments can define a variety of cross-sexual profiles. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> indicates that in some embodiments, the ribs of the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> can each comprise free side edges and corner portions wherealong the rib interconnects with the cell of the formliner. For example, the ribs of the formliner <b>1120</b> can comprise a corner portion <b>1170</b> and a free side edge <b>1172</b>. Additionally, the ribs of the formliner <b>1122</b> can comprise a corner portion <b>1174</b> and a free side edge <b>1176</b>. Likewise, the ribs of the formliner <b>1124</b> can also comprise a corner portion and a free side edge.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As illustrated, some embodiments can be configured such that the corner portions of the ribs are formed to include a protrusion or a detent. Similarly, embodiments can be configured such that the free side edges are formed to include a protrusion or a detent. The arrangement of the protrusions and detents along the corner portions or free side edges can be determined based on the pattern, for example. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, in some embodiments, if the rib portion of the formliner <b>1120</b> is configured to be overlapped by the rib portion of formliner <b>1122</b>, and therefore of a smaller profile, the corner portion <b>1170</b> of that rib portion and the free side edge <b>1172</b> can each comprise a detent <b>1138</b>. Further, if a rib portion of the formliner <b>1122</b> is configured to be overlapping the rib portion of the formliner <b>1120</b>, and is therefore of a larger profile, the corner portion <b>1174</b> and the cancel free side edge <b>1176</b> can each comprise a protrusion <b>1136</b>. However, although the rib portions are shown as comprising a pair of protrusions or detents disposed on opposing sides of the rib portion (whether overlapping or overlapped), it is also contemplated that a single protrusion or detent can be used on a side of the rib portion (whether overlapping or overlapped). Further, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, the overlapped portion of the rib (such as the rib of the formliner <b>120</b>) can contact only a portion of the internal surface of the overlapping portion of the rib (such as the rib of the formliner <b>122</b>). In this regard, some embodiments can be configured such that the interlocking or overlapping of the formliners can be accomplished by complete or partial surface contact between the external and internal surfaces of overlapping rib portions.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In this regard, one of the unique features of some embodiments disclosed herein is that an overlapping rib can define a recess or interior cavity whereinto an overlapped rib of an adjacent formliner can be placed. However, in order to insert the overlapped rib into the recess or interior cavity, an opening of the recess can be expanded to receive the overlapped rib. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref> illustrates that a recess <b>1180</b> of a rib <b>1178</b> of formliner <b>1122</b> comprises an inner diameter, profile, or dimension <b>1182</b> that is sufficiently large to accommodate the outer diameter, profile, or dimension <b>1184</b> of a rib <b>1179</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. However, the recess <b>1180</b> comprises an opening <b>1186</b> having a passing profile or width <b>1188</b> that is less than the outer diameter, profile, or dimension <b>1184</b> of the rib <b>1179</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. Thus, the rib <b>1179</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b> must cause the opening <b>1186</b> to expand in order to be fitted within the recess <b>1180</b>. Further, the rib <b>1179</b> can comprise a base profile <b>1190</b> that is less than the passing profile or width <b>1188</b> of the rib <b>1178</b>. In this regard, once the rib <b>1179</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b> is received into the recess <b>1180</b> of the rib <b>1178</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b>, the opening <b>1186</b> can converge or snap onto the base profile <b>1190</b> of the rib <b>1179</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Further, the formliner <b>1122</b> can be fabricated from a resilient material such that after the rib of the formliner <b>1120</b> is inserted within the cavity <b>1180</b>, the opening <b>1180</b> elastically returns to its original dimension <b>1188</b>. In this manner, the opening <b>1180</b> closes around a base of the rib of the formliner <b>1120</b>. In other words, with the rib of the formliner <b>1120</b> received within the recess <b>1180</b>, the width <b>1188</b> of the opening <b>1180</b> will return to less than the outer diameter, profile, or dimension <b>1184</b> of the rib of the formliner <b>1120</b>, thus encasing the rib within the recess <b>1180</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>. Further, as noted herein, such encasing or snap-fit between the ribs allows the formliner <b>1122</b> to restrict not only horizontal, but also vertical movement of the formliner <b>1120</b> with respect to the formliner <b>1122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The protrusions and the detents can be configured to extend inwardly toward an interior of the rib. It is contemplated that in some implementations, the protrusions and detents can be formed into the formliner during the molding process. For example, the formliner can be vacuum formed with such features included therein. However, it is also contemplated that the protrusions and detents can be formed subsequent to the initial forming operations. Further, although the protrusions and detents can be formed integrally with the formliner, such as by forming the formliner and protrusions and detents of a common sheet of material, these features could potentially be added to the formliner in a finishing step.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, the rib structure of the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b> can be generally defined by a semicylindrical or arch shape. Accordingly, the overlapping portions <b>1144</b> and the overlapped portions <b>1146</b> can be defined by a radius. In particular, a lower surface <b>1160</b> of the overlapping portion <b>1144</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> can be defined by a first radius. Similarly, an upper surface <b>1162</b> of the overlapped portion <b>1146</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b> can be defined by a second radius. The first radius can be greater than the second radius in order to allow the overlapped portion <b>1146</b> to be nested within the overlapping portion <b>1144</b>. As such, the overlapped portions <b>1146</b> can define a smaller cross-sectional profile than the interior cavity of the overlapping portions <b>1144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Furthermore, although the rib structure is illustrated as being formed by semicylindrical or arch shaped channels, the rib structure can be formed by a generally rectangular or polygonal cross-section, to provide the appearance of a &#x201c;rake joint.&#x201d; In this regard, any variety of shapes can be used. For example, while an embodiment of the formliners discussed herein is generally intended to create an appearance of faux brick, other embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein can be designed to create an appearance of faux stone, including any of various commercial stone such as cut stone, castle rock, sand stone, ledgestone, fieldstone, etc., as well as, wood, river rock, slate, or other materials and variations, which is merely an exemplary and non-limiting list of potential appearances and applications. Thus, the rib structure can be varied and diverse. The dimensions of the rib structure can be variable and allow for irregular patterns as may be seen in natural settings of stone, brick, wood, or other materials.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">For example, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, the rib structure in some embodiments can be configured to define arcuate protrusions and detents formed therealong. This type of structure is often referred to in masonry as a &#x201c;tool joint.&#x201d; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> illustrates an overlapping rib <b>1192</b> having a pair of opposing protrusions <b>1194</b> and an overlapped rib <b>1196</b> having a pair of opposing detents <b>1198</b> that are configured to receive the protrusions <b>1194</b> of the rib <b>1192</b>. The protrusions <b>1194</b> and the detents <b>1198</b> can comprise a shape that is formed using a transition between convex and concave. In some embodiments, the configuration can be described as an &#x201c;S&#x201d; shape. In this regard, the arcuate shape of the surfaces can facilitate interlocking between the ribs <b>1192</b>, <b>1196</b>. Further, as illustrated therein, the protrusions <b>1194</b> and the recesses <b>1198</b> can be configured to extend inwardly to a lesser degree than the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-C</figref>. Accordingly, it is contemplated that the embodiment of the rib structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> can be substituted for that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-C</figref> and implemented with the embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional side view of another embodiment of a formliner. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, the rib structure of the formliner is provided with a polygonal geometry to provide the appearance of a &#x201c;rake joint,&#x201d; mentioned above. As illustrated, an overlapped rib <b>1250</b> can comprise a generally trapezoidal cross-section. The overlapped rib <b>1250</b> can define an external geometry or profile that is less than an internal geometry or profile of an overlapping rib <b>1252</b>. In this regard, the overlapping rib <b>1252</b> can be overlaid onto the overlapped rib <b>1250</b>, as illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, the overlapped rib <b>1250</b> generally makes contact with the internal surface of the overlapping rib <b>1252</b>. However, in accordance with some of the embodiments disclosed herein, it is contemplated that the overlapped rib <b>1250</b> contact only a portion of the internal surface of the overlapping rib <b>1252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional side view of another embodiment of a formliner. Similar to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> can provide the appearance of a &#x201c;rake joint.&#x201d; However, in addition to the aesthetic distinction, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> can also provide enhanced engagement through the use of protrusions and recesses. As illustrated, an overlapped rib <b>1260</b> can comprise one or more recesses <b>1262</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the recesses <b>1262</b> can be oriented along a lower portion or lower edge of the rib <b>1260</b>. However, as with other embodiments disclosed herein, the recesses can be disposed on other portions of the rib. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, and overlapping rib <b>1270</b> can comprise one or more protrusions <b>1272</b> that can engage the one or more recesses <b>1262</b>. In this manner, when the overlapping rib <b>1270</b> is overlaid onto the overlapped rib <b>1260</b>, the protrusions <b>1272</b> can engage the recesses <b>1262</b> in order to facilitate interlocking engagement between the ribs <b>1260</b>, <b>1270</b> of the formliners. As noted herein, this interlocking engagement provides several advantages in assembling and using the formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In addition, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the formliner <b>1100</b> can comprise a plurality of rib openings <b>1180</b>. The rib openings <b>1180</b> can be positioned along the ribs <b>1102</b> of the rib structure of the formliner <b>1100</b>. The location of the openings <b>1180</b> can correspond to a location of a corresponding rib of another formliner to which the formliner <b>1100</b> is interconnected. The rib openings <b>1180</b> can facilitate precise alignment of a plurality of formliners. Further, the rib openings <b>1180</b> can further contribute to the natural appearance of the faux brick pattern created in the concrete structure. The formation and configuration of rib openings <b>1180</b> is shown and described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Various methods are also provided for manufacturing embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein. Generally, many of the embodiments disclosed herein can be manufactured using material to formation processes such as vacuum or thermoforming, injection molding, and other such processes. Thermoforming with the vacuum assist can be used to achieve superior results for thick or thin gauge formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the thermoforming process begins with a blank that is heated and placed over a mold. Often, a mating mold can be placed over the heated blank to trap the blank between the mold and the mating mold. Vacuum pressure can also be applied to remove any air between the mold and the blank and thereby further draw the blank into the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In accordance with a unique aspect of some of the methods disclosed herein, the formed sheet can be formed to include excess material length. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> below, a formliner <b>1800</b> is shown in a nearly completed state. As shown, the formliner <b>1800</b> can include rib protrusions <b>1804</b> that can extend from the left and/or right sides of a formliner <b>1800</b>. In this manner, using a subsequent cutting step, the rib protrusions <b>1804</b> can be removed or trimmed such that the left and/or right sides of the formliner <b>1800</b> are prepared to receive or be overlaid with other formliners. The trimming of the rib protrusions <b>1804</b> can be used to create one or more rib openings discussed above. In this manner, the initial forming operation can be simplified while allowing a precise edge to be cut in order to define the rib openings. Therefore, in accordance with some embodiments disclosed herein, the forming step can comprise forming one or more rib protrusions in the formed sheet during manufacturing of the formliner. Subsequently, the method of manufacturing the formliner can comprise trimming or otherwise removing the one or more rib protrusions from the formliner in order to define one or more rib openings.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Once a blank has been formed into a formed sheet using a thermoforming machine, the formed sheet can be further processed using cutting equipment. In some embodiments, the process can employ a laser-cutting device. A laser can provide superior results by exact dimensioning and tolerancing; however, other cutting devices can also be used. The cutting operation or step allows the rib openings discussed above to be formed for those embodiments in which rib openings are used. However, in all embodiments, the cutting operation or step can be used to remove excess material from the edges of the formed sheet in order to produce a prepared formliner. The cutting operation or step can be particularly important in order to ensure that mating edges properly align with corresponding portions of other formliners. Additionally, the cutting operation or step can be particularly important in ensuring that protrusions and recesses of formliners can be properly engaged in assembling a plurality of formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a top view of a formliner <b>1200</b> in accordance with an embodiment. As with the formliner <b>1100</b>, the formliner <b>1200</b> comprises a plurality of ribs <b>1202</b> that form a rib structure. The ribs <b>1202</b> can comprise one or more overlapping portions <b>1204</b> and one or more overlapped portions <b>1206</b>. Additionally, the formliner <b>1200</b> can comprise non-overlap portions <b>1208</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates that the overlapping portions <b>1204</b> and the non-overlap portions <b>1208</b> can define a common outer dimension <b>1001</b>. Thus, when a plurality of the formliners <b>1200</b> are interconnected, the overlapping portions <b>1204</b> overlap with the overlapped portions <b>1206</b> and the resulting rib structure of the interconnected formliners has a common outer dimension <b>1001</b>. Further, the protrusions and detents can be placed on a single side or both sides of a peripheral rib, in accordance with some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In this regard, as discussed above, the overlapped portions <b>1206</b> can define an outer dimension <b>1002</b>. The outer dimension <b>1002</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>1001</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapping portions <b>1204</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>1002</b> of the overlapped portions <b>1206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Moreover, it is contemplated that in using a formliner that defines a generally rectangular perimeter, there may be sections of interconnected formliners in which more than two formliners overlap. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the formliner <b>1200</b> can be configured to define a sub-overlapped section <b>1210</b>. As illustrated in the upper and lower right corners of the formliner <b>1200</b>, the sub-overlapped sections <b>1210</b> can define an outer dimension <b>1003</b>. The outer dimension <b>1003</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>1002</b> and the outer dimension <b>1001</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapped portions <b>1206</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>1003</b> of the sub-overlapped portions <b>1210</b>. Additionally, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the formliner <b>1200</b> can also be configured to include a plurality of rib openings <b>1220</b>. As similarly described above, the plurality of rib openings <b>1220</b> can be located and configured to correspond with corresponding ribs of adjacent interconnected formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As noted above, in some embodiments, the overlapped portions can comprise one or more detents, and the overlapping portions can comprise one or more protrusions. In this regard, it is contemplated the protrusions and detents can extend along any length of a respective rib. For example, the protrusions and detents can extend along less than the entire length of a respective rib such that the protrusion and/or detent is offset from a corner or end of the respective rib. It is also contemplated that the protrusions and detents can extend continuously or discontinuously along the respective rib. Moreover, it is appreciated that the design and interlocking profile of the formliner can dictate the arrangement, length, and pattern of the protrusions and detents.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In this manner, a single formliner can be used to create a continuous decorative pattern that can be used for any size concrete structure. Advantageously, in contrast to prior art formliners, embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein can be interconnected to create a dimensionally continuous, precise assembly of formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, an end view of the sub-overlapped section <b>1210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is illustrated. As shown, the sub-overlapped section <b>1210</b> defines an outer dimension <b>1003</b> that is less than the outer dimension <b>1002</b> of the overlapped section <b>1206</b> (shown in dashed lines). Additionally, the outer dimension <b>1001</b> of the overlapping sections <b>1204</b> is also shown dashed lines and illustrated as being greater than both the outer dimension <b>1002</b> and the outer dimension <b>1003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a perspective view of the formliner assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In particular, the formliner <b>1122</b> and the formliner <b>1120</b> are shown in a pre-assembled state. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates that the overlapped sections <b>1146</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b> are received within cavities of the overlapping sections <b>1144</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b>. As discussed below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the upper surfaces of the overlapping sections <b>1144</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> can be generally flush with the upper surfaces of non-overlap sections <b>1148</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> also illustrates another view of the engagement between the protrusions <b>1136</b> formed on the free side edges <b>1176</b> and the corner portions <b>1174</b> of the overlapping sections <b>1144</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> and the detents <b>1138</b> formed on the free side edges <b>1172</b> and the corner portions <b>1170</b> of the overlapped sections <b>1146</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. As shown therein, the corner portions of the rib are formed wherealong the rib and the cell meet.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a partial perspective view of the formliner <b>1200</b>, illustrating the sub-overlapped portion <b>1210</b> thereof. As shown, the sub-overlapped portion <b>1210</b> defines a smaller cross-sectional profile or dimension than the overlapped portion <b>1206</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> also illustrated detents <b>1212</b> formed along corner portions <b>1214</b> and outer side edges <b>1216</b> of the formliner <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a perspective view of the formliner assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrating the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b>. In this view, the ribs structure of the formliner <b>1120</b> comprises overlapping portions <b>1300</b>, overlapped portions <b>1302</b>, and a sub-overlapped portion <b>1304</b>. The formliner <b>1124</b> is first placed onto the overlapped portion <b>1302</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. As can be appreciated, an overlapping portion <b>1310</b> of the formliner <b>1124</b> is placed onto an overlapped portion <b>1302</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. Additionally, an overlapped portion <b>1312</b> (shown as a T-connection) of the formliner <b>1124</b> is placed onto the sub-overlapped portion <b>1304</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. Finally, overlapping portions <b>1320</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> are placed onto the overlapped portions <b>1302</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b> and the overlapped portion <b>1312</b> of the formliner <b>1124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">One of the unique features of embodiments disclosed herein is the inclusion of rib openings that allow the overlapped portions of the ribs to be nested within overlapping portions of other ribs and to extend through the rib openings. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, rib openings <b>1150</b> can be provided in the overlapping sections <b>1144</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b>. Further, with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a rib opening <b>1322</b> is provided in the overlapping portions <b>1320</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b>. This rib opening <b>1322</b> allows the overlapping portions <b>1320</b> to be overlaid onto the overlapped portion <b>1312</b> with the overlapped portion <b>1312</b> extending through the rib opening <b>1322</b>. Similarly, a rib opening <b>1324</b> allows the overlapped portions <b>1302</b> the past therethrough thus enabling the overlapping portions <b>1320</b> to be overlaid onto the overlapped portions <b>1302</b>. Finally, the illustrated embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also shows a rib opening <b>1326</b> formed in the overlapped portion <b>1312</b>, which enables the sub-overlapped portion <b>1304</b> to extend therethrough. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the rib openings of some embodiments disclosed herein uniquely allow overlapping formliners to minimize visible seaming by allowing the overlapping portions of the formliners to fit tightly and closely together.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, once assembled, the overlapping portions <b>1300</b>, <b>1310</b>, and <b>1320</b> each define a common outer dimension or shape. Thus, when the formliner assembly is pressed into fresh concrete or when concrete is poured thereagainst, the impressions of the rib structure of the formliner assembly will appear seamless and uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In addition, as will be appreciated, once the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, and <b>1124</b> are assembled, an edge <b>1330</b> of the overlapping portion <b>1310</b> of the formliner <b>1124</b> will be disposed into a corner <b>1332</b> formed between the overlapped portion <b>1302</b> and a cell <b>1334</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b>. As such, any seaming between the overlapping portion <b>1310</b> of the formliner <b>1124</b> and the cell <b>1334</b> of the formliner <b>1120</b> will be reduced and/or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Similarly, an edge <b>1340</b> of the overlapping portion <b>1320</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b> will be disposed into a corner <b>1342</b> formed by the overlapped portion <b>1302</b> and the cell <b>1334</b>. Thus, seaming between the formliner <b>1120</b> and formliner <b>1122</b> will be greatly reduced and/or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Further, the seaming can further be reduced in some embodiments wherein the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b> comprise detents and protrusions that facilitate engagement between the formliners <b>1120</b>, <b>1122</b>, <b>1124</b>. As illustrated, the formliner <b>1120</b> can comprise detents <b>1350</b> that can be engaged by protrusions <b>1352</b> of the formliner <b>1124</b>. Further, the formliner <b>1120</b> can comprise detents <b>1354</b> that can be engaged by protrusions <b>1356</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b>. Finally, the formliner <b>1124</b> can comprise detents <b>1358</b> that can be engaged by protrusions <b>1360</b> of the formliner <b>1122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates many of the above-discussed principles. In this figure, a first formliner <b>1400</b> is mated with a second formliner <b>1402</b>. And overlapping portion <b>1406</b> of the first formliner <b>1400</b> is placed onto an overlapped portion <b>1408</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b>. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the mating of an edge <b>1410</b> of the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> with <b>1412</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b> can create an imperceptible seam between the first and second formliners <b>1400</b>, <b>1402</b>. Further, transition zones or joints <b>1420</b> between the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> of the first formliner <b>1400</b> and an overlapping portion <b>1422</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b> can be minimized so as to reduce and/or eliminate any visible seaming at the transition zones or joints <b>1420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Furthermore, upon application of a curable material to the formliner assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>, protrusions <b>1424</b> of the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> of the first formliner <b>1400</b> can be further engaged with detents <b>1426</b> of the overlapped portions <b>1408</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b>. This enhanced engagement further prevents dislodging or misalignment between the formliners <b>1400</b>, <b>1402</b>. Again, such a superior benefit is not disclosed or taught by prior art formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, an enlarged view of a transition zone or joint <b>1420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is illustrated. As shown, the transition zone or joint <b>1420</b> can comprise a simple step <b>1430</b> from a first dimension to a second dimension. In some embodiments, this may be an immediate increase in the dimension along the rib of the second formliner, specifically from the overlapped portion <b>1408</b> to the overlapping portion <b>1422</b>. However, in other embodiments, it is contemplated that the step <b>1430</b> can be a tapered transition between the overlapped portion <b>1408</b> and the overlapping portion <b>1422</b>. Additionally, a side edge <b>1432</b> of the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> of the first formliner <b>1400</b> can be configured to correspond to the shape and dimension of the step <b>1430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> also illustrates the nesting arrangement of the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> of the first formliner <b>1400</b> is shown with respect to the overlapped portion <b>1408</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b>. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> also illustrates the orientation of the edge <b>1410</b> of the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> of the formliner <b>1400</b> is shown with respect to the cell <b>1412</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, it will be appreciated that a seam <b>1440</b> formed between the edge <b>1410</b> and the cell <b>1412</b> can be reduced as the fit between the first formliner <b>1400</b> and the second formliner <b>1402</b> are optimized. In this regard, the internal geometry of the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> can be specifically configured to match the external geometry of the overlapped portion <b>1408</b>, thus reducing any seam (whether along the edge <b>1410</b> or the side edge <b>1432</b>) between the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> and the overlapped portion <b>1408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">As noted above, one of the advantages of embodiments disclosed herein is that seams of overlapped portions of adjacent formliners can be minimized and/or eliminated. In this regard, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the seam <b>1440</b> is created along a corner at or along a bottom portion of the cell <b>1412</b> of the formliner <b>1402</b> which forms part of a prepared formliner mold cavity. In this regard, the seam <b>1440</b> is positioned such that the weight of a curable material, such as concrete, against the first formliner <b>1400</b> causes the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> of the first formliner <b>1400</b> to be pressed against the overlapped portion <b>1408</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b> with great force thereby causing the edge <b>1410</b> to be positioned as close as possible relative to the cell <b>1412</b> in order to minimize and/or eliminate the seam <b>1440</b> between the adjacent formliners <b>1400</b>, <b>1402</b>. This innovative feature of embodiments disclosed herein, which allows seams to be created along the bottom faces or portions of the mold allows the weight of the curable material to act as a compressive agent in reducing and/or eliminating seams between adjacent formliners. For example, a common curable material such as concrete generally weighs 150 pounds per cubic foot, and embodiments of the present inventions are able to take advantage of the significant force of such a material in order to create an aesthetically superior product.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Furthermore, the tolerances between the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> and the overlapped portion <b>1408</b> can also define a seam <b>1442</b>. Specifically, the distance between the edge <b>1432</b> and the step <b>1430</b> can define the seam <b>1442</b>. It is contemplated that the overlapping portion <b>1406</b> can be toleranced with a longitudinal length such that the edge <b>1432</b> thereof abuts the step <b>1430</b>. It is also contemplated that as with the seam <b>1440</b>, the compressive forces of the material against the first formliner <b>1400</b> and the second formliner <b>1402</b> can serve to reduce the size of the seam <b>1442</b> to thereby create a superior finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-29</figref>, it is noted that the above-discussed embodiments of the formliner and formliner components provide for a distinct shelf or step between rib sections having differing geometries or configurations. For example, as noted above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the step <b>1430</b> is a transition zone, shelf, or shoulder between the overlapping portion <b>1422</b> and the overlapped portion <b>1408</b> of the second formliner <b>1402</b> as briefly mentioned above, the step <b>1430</b> can provide a gradual transition from the overlapping portion <b>1422</b> to the overlapped portion <b>1408</b>. however, in some embodiments, it is contemplated that the formliner can be formed with ribs or ridges that taper from a first geometry or configuration to a second geometry or configuration. As such, the shoulder <b>1430</b> can be eliminated from such embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">For example, referring generally to a side view similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, it is contemplated that a rib can taper from a first dimension or configuration in an overlapping portion to a second dimension or configuration in an overlapped portion. In yet other embodiments, it is contemplated that the rib can taper from the second dimension or configuration to a third dimension or configuration. The tapering of the rib from one dimension to another can comprise a generally constant taper or a variable taper.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Further, in some embodiments, overlapping portions of the ribs of the formliner can be configured to define a variable thickness corresponding to the tapering of the overlapped portions onto which the overlapping portions will be overlaid. As such, the cumulative dimension or configuration of nested or overlaid rib portions can be generally constant. However, it is likewise contemplated that the thickness of overlapping or interconnecting formliners can be generally constant along their respective ribs or ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Additionally, in accordance with at least one of the embodiments disclosed herein is the realization that in forming a pattern of interconnected formliners, the edges along the top, bottom, left, and right sides of a pattern or casting can be carefully arranged in order to ensure a natural appearance. Commonly, a plurality of formliners must be used in order to form a pattern or casting larger than a few square feet in size. Typically, in arranging or interconnecting the formliners, an artisan may begin from a top left corner and work down and across toward the bottom right corner. Thus, the left side and the top side of the pattern or casting can generally be comprised of whole or entire formliners that are interconnected vertically and horizontally. Additionally, formliners located in the center portions of the pattern or casting are also whole or entire formliners. However, according to at least one of the embodiments disclosed herein is the realization that formliners located along the bottom and right sides of the pattern or casting may only be partial sheets. In some embodiments, this deficiency can be overcome by providing alternative embodiments of a formliner that enable the artisan to create desirable bottom and right side edges and/or that can be interconnected with other formliners along a partial length thereof in order to form a clean edge, whether it is a straight edge, curved edge, angled edge, or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Accordingly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref>, alternative formliner embodiments are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, a formliner end portion <b>1500</b> is shown. The formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can comprise many of the same features as discussed above with respect to the other formliner embodiments. For example, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can comprise the protrusions and/or detents discussed above. However, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can also optionally comprise a generally straight side <b>1502</b> that is configured to mate with a corresponding formliner end portion. In this regard, it is contemplated that in use, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can be used at a far side or end of the desired pattern. For example, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can be used for a left side boundary or a right side boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can be configured to mate with another formliner to form a corner of a pattern, casting, or formwork. In such an embodiment, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can also optionally comprise a ledge recess <b>1522</b>, as described below. For example, the ledge recess <b>1522</b> can be forwarded by a length of the ribs <b>1504</b> which comprises a reduced geometry or dimension, as shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. Accordingly, some embodiments of the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can be provided in which the side <b>1502</b> can mate with corresponding formliner components or portions.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">For example, an exemplary mating arrangement of the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> with a formliner component or portion is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. As shown therein, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> can receive a corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b>. The formliner end portion <b>1500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b> can be interconnected or positioned such that they form a corner in a pattern, casting, or formwork.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In accordance with the embodiments of the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b> can define a plurality of recesses <b>1512</b> formed at the ends of rib members <b>1514</b>. The recesses <b>1512</b> can be configured to allow the rib members <b>1514</b> to fit over the ribs <b>1504</b> of the formliner end portion <b>1500</b>. Thus, the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b> can be positioned relative to each other at a right angle such that a right angle corner in the pattern or casting is produced. However, it is contemplated that the recesses <b>1512</b> can define other shapes that allowed the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b> to be oriented at any variety of angles relative to the formliner end portion <b>1500</b>. In this regard, the side <b>1502</b> can be oriented generally perpendicularly relative to the ribs <b>1504</b>, or the side <b>1502</b> can be disposed at an angle relative to the ribs <b>1504</b>, thereby facilitating a desired angular interconnection between the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> and the corresponding formliner and portion <b>1510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Additionally, in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b> can also comprise a mating ledge <b>1520</b>. In some embodiments, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be connected to both the ribs <b>1514</b> and the planar portions of the cells above the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b>. As such, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> could be generally rigidly positioned relative to the ribs <b>1514</b>. Such an embodiment could be advantageous in facilitating the alignment between the formliner end portion <b>1500</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b>. In this regard, as mentioned above with respect to the side <b>1502</b>, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be oriented at a given angle relative to the ribs <b>1514</b>. As illustrated, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be oriented at approximately a right angle relative to the ribs <b>1514</b>. However, it is contemplated that the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can also be oriented at any variety of angles relative to the ribs <b>1514</b>. In some embodiments, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be configured to fit into or be received in the ledge recess <b>1522</b> formed along the formliner and portion <b>1500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">However, in other embodiments, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be hingedly or moveably attached to the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b>. For example, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be attached to the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b> along the length of the cells thereof, but not connected to the ribs <b>1514</b>. In other words, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be separated or cut from the ribs <b>1514</b> by means of a slit <b>1530</b>. Thus, the slit <b>1530</b> can allow the mating ledge <b>1520</b> to be generally flexible or movable relative to the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1510</b>. In such embodiments, the mating ledge <b>1520</b> can be folded under a portion of the formliner end portion <b>1500</b>. Optionally, the side <b>1502</b> of the formliner and portion <b>1500</b> can be eliminated in order to allow the mating ledge <b>1520</b> to extend to underneath the formliner end portion <b>1500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Nevertheless, in other embodiments, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, it is contemplated that the ledge recess can be eliminated and that the ribs define a generally constant cross-sectional geometry. For example, the cross-sectional geometry of the ribs can be generally constant along central portions and end portions of the ribs adjacent the side of the formliner end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, in some embodiments, the formliner end portion <b>1510</b> can comprise one or more protrusions <b>1540</b> disposed at the recesses <b>1512</b> for engaging corresponding detents <b>1542</b> formed in the ribs <b>1504</b>. As such, the interconnection of the formliner end portions <b>1500</b>, <b>1510</b> can be sufficiently secure so as not to require an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, a formliner end portion <b>1550</b> can comprise one or more ribs <b>1552</b>. Optionally, the formliner end portion can also comprise a side <b>1554</b>. However, as described above, the side <b>1554</b> can also be eliminated in some embodiments. Additionally, the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1560</b> can be configured to mate with the formliner end portion <b>1550</b>. The embodiment of the corresponding formliner and portion <b>1560</b> does not include the mating ledge of the embodiment discussed in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. As will be appreciated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, openings <b>1562</b> in ribs <b>1564</b> of the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1560</b> can be mated against the ribs <b>1522</b> of the formliner end portion <b>1550</b> to create a corner of a desired angle measurement for a pattern or casting. Further, the openings <b>1562</b> are preferably configured such that an edge <b>1566</b> of the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1560</b> can be positioned against the top surface of the cells of the formliner end portion <b>1550</b>. Optionally, the openings <b>1562</b> can be configured to be manipulated in order to allow varying angles of orientation between the formliner end portion <b>1550</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1560</b>. For example, a portion of the ribs <b>1564</b> can be configured as a &#x201c;tear away&#x201d; that allows the openings <b>1562</b> to be enlarged. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> can facilitate a tight fit between the formliner end portion <b>1550</b> and the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, in some embodiments, the formliner end portion <b>1560</b> can comprise one or more protrusions <b>1572</b> disposed at the recesses <b>1562</b> for engaging corresponding detents <b>1574</b> formed in the ribs <b>1522</b>. As such, the interconnection of the formliner end portions <b>1550</b>, <b>1560</b> can be sufficiently secure so as not to require an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, another embodiment of a formliner end portion <b>1570</b> can be provided which comprises one or more ribs <b>1572</b>. As noted above, the formliner end portion <b>1570</b> is an embodiment in which no side is used. Similar to the other embodiments disclosed herein, the formliner end portion <b>1570</b> can be configured to mate with a corresponding formliner end portion <b>1580</b>. The embodiment of the corresponding formliner and portion <b>1580</b> does not include the mating ledge of the embodiment discussed in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. As will be appreciated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, openings <b>1582</b> in ribs <b>1584</b> of the corresponding formliner end portion <b>1580</b> can be mated against the ribs <b>1572</b> of the formliner end portion <b>1570</b> to create a corner of a desired angle measurement for a pattern or casting.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">It is contemplated that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref> can aid the artisan in creating a dimensionally accurate and seamless corner of a faux brick mold. It is contemplated also that other such features, such as three-point corners, convex arches, and concave arches can be formed using similar principles.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-34</figref> illustrate other embodiments of a formliner, sheet, or panel having other shapes and geometries for imparting different patterns to a curable material. As discussed above, such patterns can be of stone, wood, slate, or other materials. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a representation of a formliner <b>1600</b> used to produce a stone pattern on an exposed surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is a representation of a formliner <b>1650</b> used to produce a rock pattern on an exposed surface. As discussed herein, the formliners <b>1600</b>, <b>1650</b> can also be formed to include one or more protrusions and/or detents for enhancing engagement of interconnected formliners so as to eliminate the need for adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a formliner, sheet, or panel <b>1700</b> having a pattern configured to provide the appearance of cut stone. As shown therein, first rib portions <b>1702</b> of the formliner <b>1700</b> can be configured to define a first geometry or configuration, and second rib portions <b>1704</b> can define a second geometry or configuration that corresponds to the first geometry or configuration and enables multiple formliners <b>1700</b> to be interconnected along the rib portions <b>1702</b>, <b>1704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In some embodiments, the formliner <b>1700</b> can comprise one or more third rib portions <b>1706</b> that can define a third geometry or configuration that corresponds to one of the first and second geometries or configurations. For example, the first rib portion <b>1702</b>, the second rib portion <b>1704</b>, and the third rib portion <b>1706</b> can allow the formliner <b>1700</b> to be overlaid with other formliners <b>1700</b> in a similar manner as to the formliner <b>1100</b> described above, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">As mentioned above with respect to the embodiments disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-29</figref>, the first rib portions <b>1702</b>, the second rib portions <b>1704</b>, and the third rib portions <b>1706</b>, can each comprise rib portions having a generally constant geometry or configuration, such as a cross-sectional geometry. However, it is also contemplated that the first rib portions <b>1702</b>, the second rib portions <b>1704</b>, and the third read portions <b>1706</b> of the formliner <b>1700</b> can taper from one geometry or configuration to another. In other words, the ribs or ridges of the formliner <b>1700</b> can taper from the first geometry or configuration to the second geometry or configuration. In yet other embodiments, the ribs or ridges of the formliner <b>1700</b> can also taper from the second geometry or configuration to the third geometry or configuration. The tapering in any such embodiment can be formed as a constant taper from one geometry or configuration to another, from one corner to another or along lengths of the ribs or ridges. The tapering in other embodiments can also be formed over discrete sections of the ribs or ridges. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the ribs or bridges can be formed without a distinct shelf or step from a given geometry or configuration to another geometry or configuration. Further, it is contemplated that overlapping portions of adjacent formliners can be configured to define variable thicknesses that taper along with the dimension or configuration of that portion of the ribs or ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Furthermore, the formliner <b>1700</b> can comprise one or more detents <b>1708</b> and one or more protrusions <b>1709</b>. As discussed above with respect to the various other embodiments disclosed herein, the protrusions and detents can enhance the interlocking connection between formliners so as to eliminate the need for adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Finally, the formliner <b>1700</b> can also comprise one or more openings <b>1710</b> in one or more of the first, second, or third rib portions <b>1702</b>, <b>1704</b>, <b>1706</b> in order to allow nesting and overlaying of the rib portions with each other, as similarly described above with respect to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-29</figref>. In this manner, a plurality of the formliners <b>1700</b> can be used to create a desirable cut stone pattern while eliminating any appearance of seaming between the formliner <b>1700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">In accordance with some embodiments, any of the embodiments of the formliner or combinations thereof can be used in a method of creating a decorative pattern in a curable material, such as a casting, whether vertical or horizontal, a wall, etc. The method can comprise assembling a plurality of any of the formliners disclosed herein to form an assembly. Further, a curable material can be positioned against the assembly, such as by pouring. In this manner, the seams between portions of adjacent formliners can be lessened due to the weight of the material. As the material cures, the seams between the adjacent formliners are reduced and/or eliminated compared to the prior art methods and formliners. As such, one may obtain an aesthetically superior product. Further, any of the embodiments herein provides the additional benefit that the artisan need not perform additional finishing steps to eliminate unsightly seams, thus resulting in a tremendous cost and time savings and efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a top view of yet another embodiment of an alternative configuration of a formliner <b>1800</b>, according to another embodiment. The illustrated embodiment of the formliner <b>1800</b> differs from other embodiments, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 19</figref>. For example, the formliner <b>1800</b> comprise a larger number of cells <b>1802</b>. Accordingly, the formliner <b>1800</b> can be interconnected with other such formliners and be utilized to cover large areas more efficiently than a smaller formliner, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Additionally, as discussed above, the formliner <b>1800</b> is also shown in a nearly finished state. In other words, the formliner <b>1800</b> can still be trimmed in order to produce a finished or prepared formliner. In accordance with some embodiments, the formliner <b>1800</b> can comprise one or more rib protrusions <b>1804</b> that extend from left and/or right sides of the formliner <b>1800</b>. As discussed above, these rib protrusions <b>1804</b> can be removed prior to use in order to form a rib openings, which are discussed above with respect to other embodiments and shown, for example, in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Further, as in the other embodiments disclosed herein, the formliner <b>1800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> also comprises one or more overlapping portions <b>1850</b> and one or more overlapped portions <b>1852</b>. Additionally, the formliner <b>1800</b> can comprise non-overlap portions <b>1854</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> illustrates that the overlapping portions <b>1850</b> and the non-overlap portions <b>1854</b> can define a common outer dimension <b>1860</b>. Thus, when a plurality of the formliners <b>1800</b> are interconnected, the overlapping portions <b>1850</b> overlap with the overlapped portions <b>1852</b> and the resulting rib structure of the interconnected formliners has a common outer dimension <b>1860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In this regard, as discussed above, the overlapped portions <b>1852</b> can define an outer dimension <b>1862</b>. The outer dimension <b>1862</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>1860</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapping portions <b>1850</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>1862</b> of the overlapped portions <b>1852</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Moreover, as discussed above, it is contemplated that in using a formliner that defines a generally rectangular perimeter, there may be sections of interconnected formliners in which more than two formliners overlap. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the formliner <b>1800</b> can be configured to define one or more sub-overlapped sections <b>1870</b>. Similar to the embodiments discussed above, the sub-overlapped sections <b>1870</b> can be provided in the upper and lower right corners of the formliner <b>1800</b>. Further, the sub-overlapped sections <b>1870</b> can define an outer dimension <b>1872</b>. The outer dimension <b>1872</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>1862</b> and the outer dimension <b>1860</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapped portions <b>1852</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>1870</b> of the sub-overlapped portions <b>1870</b>. Additionally, as described above, the formliner <b>1800</b> can also be configured to include a plurality of rib openings that are formed upon removal of the rib protrusions <b>1804</b>. As similarly described above, the plurality of rib openings can be located and configured to correspond with corresponding ribs of adjacent interconnected formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In accordance with some embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein, the sub-overlapped section (such as <b>210</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>1210</b>, <b>1304</b>, and <b>1870</b>) can also be configured such that a length of the sub-overlapped section, as measured along the longitudinal direction of the rib, varies to provide optimal fit between overlapping formliners. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the sub-overlapped section <b>1870</b> can be disposed along a length of the rib, not just at the corner of the formliner. In particular, the sub-overlapped section <b>1870</b> can extend along the rib for approximately one-half of the total width of the cell <b>1802</b>. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the sub-overlapped section <b>1870</b> can extend along the rib for one-fourth or one-third of the total width of the cell <b>1802</b>. Additionally, in configurations where the cells <b>1802</b> are offset, the length of the sub-overlapped section can correspond to the length of the offset of the cell <b>1802</b> from the formliner <b>1800</b>. In other words, the length of the sub-overlapped section can correspond to the amount of protrusion of a cell from the formliner. In this manner, the fit and nesting of the ribs is optimized when a plurality of formliners are fitted together, such as with an overlapping section of a first formliner, an overlapped section of a second formliner, and a sub-overlapped section of a third formliner being overlaid onto each other.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> is a top view of a formliner that has been modified to be a mold corner <b>1900</b>, according to another embodiment.

The mold corner <b>1900</b> can be configured to be folded along the central folding zone <b>1910</b> such that a rear face of the mold corner <b>1900</b> can be positioned against an interior corner of a form. In this regard, the ribs <b>1914</b> of the mold corner <b>1900</b> can also be formed to include overlapped portions <b>1920</b> and overlapping portions <b>1922</b>. As disclosed generally herein, the overlapped portions <b>1920</b> can be received within or made with overlapping portions of one or more other formliners in order to form a system of formliners. Further, the overlapping portions <b>1922</b> can be overlaid onto overlapped portions of one or more other formliners in order to form a system of formliners. Other features disclosed with respect to other embodiments can also be incorporated into embodiments of the mold corner <b>1900</b>, such as sub-overlapped portions, interlocking protrusions and recesses, and other such features.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">One of the unique advantages of the mold corner <b>1900</b> is that the mold corner <b>1900</b> helps to reduce the number of scenes and components in a system of formliners used to create a final molded product. In this regard, it is contemplated that the mold corner <b>1900</b> can be configured to bend along the folding line <b>1912</b> to achieve one of a variety of angular orientations between a first portion <b>1930</b> and a second portion <b>1932</b> of the mold corner <b>1900</b>. In this regard, the folding line <b>1912</b> can be configured as a thinned area of the mold corner <b>1900</b>. Further, the folding line <b>1912</b> can be configured as a perforated area of the mold corner <b>1900</b>.

<p id="p-0228" num="0227">For example, it is contemplated that the mold corner <b>1900</b> can be configured to provide a 90&#xb0; bend between the first portion <b>1930</b> and the second portion <b>1932</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</figref> illustrates a top view of a recess <b>1916</b> formed in a rib in <b>1914</b> of the mold corner <b>1900</b>. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref> is a side view of the portion of the mold corner <b>1900</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">As illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A-B</figref>, the recess <b>1916</b> can comprise a generally 45&#xb0; angle indentation from a top portion of the rib <b>1914</b> downwardly toward the folding line <b>1912</b>. Accordingly, when the first portion <b>1930</b> is folded towards the second portion <b>1932</b>, interior surfaces <b>1940</b>, <b>1942</b> of the recess <b>1916</b> can collapse towards each other and contact each other to complete an interior profile of the folded mold corner <b>1900</b>. In this regard, the interior surfaces <b>1940</b>, <b>1942</b> can be oriented at first and second angles <b>1950</b>, <b>1952</b> relative to a bottom surface or section of the rib <b>1914</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second angles <b>1950</b>, <b>1952</b> are approximately 45&#xb0;. However, as necessary, other embodiments can be implemented that use greater or lesser angles, thus enabling the first portion <b>1932</b> form a variety of different angles relative to the second portion <b>1932</b>, such that the mold corner <b>1902</b> can be used in various applications having a variety of different geometries.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-38B</figref>, upper surfaces of the first and second portions <b>1930</b>, <b>1932</b> can fold inwardly toward each other. As discussed herein, this inward folding is facilitated in some embodiments by the formation of the recess in the rib. However, it is also contemplated that other implementations can be provided in which bottom surfaces of the first and second portions <b>1930</b>, <b>1932</b> fold inwardly toward each other. As such, instead of forming an interior mold corner that is inserted into a corner of a mold (which can constitute an angle of less than 180&#xb0;), and embodiment of the mold corner can also provide an exterior mold corner that is folded around a corner of a mold (such as folding the bottom surfaces of the first and second portions <b>1930</b>, <b>1932</b> toward each other to accommodate an angle of greater than 180&#xb0;). In such embodiments, the central folding zone could be reversed so as to provide a continuous upper surface of the rib while providing a recess along a lower portion of the rib and a gap in the material so as to allow the bottom surfaces of the first and second portions <b>1930</b>, <b>1932</b> fold inwardly toward each and be folded around a corner of the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, as noted above, the mold corner <b>1900</b> can comprise one or more overlapping portions <b>1922</b> and one or more overlapped portions <b>1920</b>. Additionally, the mold corner <b>1900</b> can comprise non-overlap portions <b>1954</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> illustrates that the overlapping portions <b>1922</b> and the non-overlap portions <b>1954</b> can define a common outer dimension <b>1960</b>. Thus, when a plurality of the formliners <b>1900</b> are interconnected, the overlapping portions <b>1922</b> overlap with the overlapped portions <b>1920</b> and the resulting rib structure of the interconnected formliners has a common outer dimension <b>1960</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">In this regard, as discussed above, the overlapped portions <b>1920</b> can define an outer dimension <b>1962</b>. The outer dimension <b>1962</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>1960</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapping portions <b>1922</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>1962</b> of the overlapped portions <b>1920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Moreover, as discussed above, it is contemplated that in interconnecting formliners with the mold corner and/or mold corners with mold corners and formliners, there are certain points where one or more formliner(s) overlap with one or more mold corner(s). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the mold corner <b>1900</b> can be configured to define one or more sub-overlapped sections <b>1970</b>. Similar to the embodiments discussed above, the sub-overlapped sections <b>1970</b> can be provided in the upper and lower right corners of the mold corner <b>1900</b>. Further, the sub-overlapped sections <b>1970</b> can define an outer dimension <b>1972</b>. The outer dimension <b>1972</b> can be less than the outer dimension <b>1962</b> and the outer dimension <b>1960</b>. Further, an inner dimension of the overlapped portions <b>1920</b> can also be greater than the outer dimension <b>1970</b> of the sub-overlapped portions <b>1970</b>. Additionally, as described above, the mold corner <b>1900</b> can also be configured to include a plurality of rib openings that are formed upon removal of the rib protrusions <b>1904</b>. As similarly described above, the plurality of rib openings can be located and configured to correspond with corresponding ribs of adjacent interconnected formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">In accordance with some embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein, the sub-overlapped section (such as <b>210</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>1210</b>, <b>1304</b>, <b>1870</b>, <b>1970</b>) can also be configured such that a length of the sub-overlapped section, as measured along the longitudinal direction of the rib, varies to provide optimal fit between overlapping formliner(s)/mold corner(s). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the sub-overlapped section <b>1970</b> can be disposed along a length of the rib, not just at the corner of the mold corner. In particular, the sub-overlapped section <b>1970</b> can extend along the rib for approximately one-half of the total width of the cell <b>1902</b>. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the sub-overlapped section <b>1970</b> can extend along the rib for one-fourth or one-third of the total width of the cell <b>1902</b>. Additionally, in configurations where the cells <b>1902</b> are offset, the length of the sub-overlapped section can correspond to the length of the offset of the cell <b>1902</b> from the mold corner <b>1900</b>. In other words, the length of the sub-overlapped section can correspond to the amount of protrusion of a cell from the mold corner. In this manner, the fit and nesting of the ribs is optimized when a plurality of mold corner(s) and/or formliner(s) are fitted together, such as with an overlapping section of a first formliner, an overlapped section of a first mold corner, and a sub-overlapped section of a second mold corner being overlaid onto each other.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Moreover, the formliners, mold corners, and other components can be formed in any variety of shapes and the ribs or ridges formed in the formliners can serve to provide strength against the weight of the curable material positioned thereagainst without requiring that the formliner be exceedingly bulky, thick, or otherwise heavy. In this regard, embodiments of the formliner can advantageously be used, for example, in tilt-up assemblies that require heavy materials such as rebar without contributing significantly, if even much at all, to the overall weight of the assembly. As such, the formliners allow for the use of less rigorous machinery, such as smaller cranes, etc. Accordingly, the light weight of embodiments of the formliner can allow for additional reductions in cost, time, and labor.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">As discussed above, embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein allows the artisan to eliminate and/or reduce any visible seaming between interconnected formliners. Some embodiments of the formliners disclosed herein are able to effectively eliminate such seaming by converging formliner edges into corners above an interconnected formliner and using tight tolerances in mating exposed surfaces of the interconnected formliners.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Although these inventions have been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present inventions extend beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the inventions and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. In addition, while several variations of the inventions have been shown and described in detail, other modifications, which are within the scope of these inventions, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art based upon this disclosure.
