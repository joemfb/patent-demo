<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to the communication field, and more particularly, to a method for updating location information of User Equipment (UE) under an enhanced network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system structure of System Architecture Evolution (SAE) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A UE <b>101</b> is a terminal device for receiving data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (EUTRAN) <b>102</b> is a wireless access network in evolution system SAE, also referred to as Evolved Node B or eNodeB (eNB), which provides Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile phones with an interface for accessing a wireless network. The EUTRAN <b>102</b> connects to a Mobile Management Entity (MME) <b>103</b> and a user plane entity Serving Gateway <b>104</b> via an interface S1.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">MME <b>103</b> is used for managing mobile context of the UE <b>101</b>, session context, and saving user information on security.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The Serving Gateway (S-GW) <b>104</b> primarily provides a function of user plane. An interface S1-MME is responsible for establishing a radio access bearer, forwarding messages from the UE <b>101</b> to the MME <b>103</b> through the wireless access network. The combined function of the MME <b>103</b> and the Serving Gateway <b>104</b> is similar to that of an original General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Supporting Node (SGSN) <b>106</b>. It is possible for both the MME <b>103</b> and the Serving Gateway <b>104</b> to be located at the same physical entity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway <b>105</b> is used for functions such as accounting, legally monitoring, etc. It is possible for both the Serving Gateway <b>104</b> and the PDN Gateway <b>105</b> to be located at the same physical entity. The SGSN <b>106</b> provides routing for data transmissions in an existing Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The existing SGSN finds corresponding Gateway (GPRS) Supporting Nodes (GGSN) according to Access Point Name (APN).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Home Subscription Subsystem (HSS) <b>107</b> is used for storing user information such as current location of the UE <b>101</b>, an address of the serving node, security related information for the user, an activated Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context for the UE, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) <b>108</b> provides Quality of Service (QoS0 policy and accounting rules through an interface S7.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In general, a user data stream is transmitted to the Serving Gateway <b>104</b> through the PDN Gateway <b>105</b>. Then, via a GPRS Tunnel Protocol (GTP) channel, data is sent by the Serving Gateway <b>104</b> to the ENB <b>102</b> in which the UE <b>101</b> is located, and the data is sent by the ENB <b>102</b> to the UE <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a structure of an S1 interface in the SAE where the MME is a mobile management entity and the S-GW is a data plane entity in an evolved core network. Each ENB connects with several MMEs in an MME pool. Each ENB connects with several S-GWs in the S-GW Pool. The interface between ENBs is called an X2 interface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to avoid transmitting an uplink signaling, such as a Tracking Area (TA) update message, by the UE in an idle mode when the UE frequently moves between ENBs, a multi-TA list is used. When the UE is under a TA updated process, the MME notifies the UE of adjacent multi-TA lists that the UE can access via TA update response messages. The UE saves such TA lists upon the receipt. Thus, UE will not initiate TA update process when moving among several TAs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention has been made to address at least the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention provides a method for updating location information of a UE.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for path switching between an eNB and an MME. The eNB transmits a Path Switch Request message informing that a UE has changed cells, to the MME. The Path Switch Request message includes an eNB UE S1AP ID, a Tracking Area Identifier (TAI), and cell Identifier (ID). The eNB UE S1AP ID uniquely identifies UE association over an S1 interface within the eNB. The eNB receives a Path Switch Request Acknowledge message including an MME UE S1AP ID and the eNB UE S1AP ID, from the MME. The MME UE S1AP ID uniquely identifies UE association over an S1 interface within the MME. The TAI corresponds to a cell in which the UE is located.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for path switching between an eNB and an MME. The MME receives a Path Switch Request message informing that a UE has changed cells, from the eNB. The Path Switch Request message includes an eNB UE S1AP ID, a TAI, and cell ID. The eNB UE S1AP ID uniquely identifies UE association over an S1 interface within the eNB. The MME transmits a Path Switch Request Acknowledge message including an MME UE S1AP ID and the eNB UE S1AP ID, to the eNB. The MME UE S1AP ID uniquely identifies UE association over an S1 interface within the MME. The TAI corresponds to a cell in which the UE is located.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an additional aspect of the present invention, an eNB is provided for path switching between the eNB and an MME. The eNB includes a transmitter for transmitting a Path Switch Request message informing that a UE has changed cells, to the MME.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that the similar components are designated by similar referenced numerals although they are illustrated in different drawings. Detailed descriptions of constructions or processes known in the art may be omitted to avoid obscuring the subject matter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a diagram illustrates the UE switched for an X2 interface, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The UE sends a measuring report message to node B in step <b>301</b>, in which there may be one or more cells. One cell serves the user and becomes a current cell for the user. The measuring report message includes a measurement for adjacent cells.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The node B determines to switch the user to a cell with a higher quality based on the measuring report of the UE and resource management information in destination cells. If source and destination cells are located in different node Bs, the node B where original cells are located is referred to as a source node B, while the node B for new destination cells is referred to as a destination node B. If there is an X2 interface between source and destination node Bs, source cell determines to switch for the X2 interface and then the source node B sends a switching request message to the destination node B in step <b>302</b>. The switching request message includes an ID that source cells allocate to the user, a destination cell ID, information that data connection shall be established, data connection (SAE Bearer) ID and QoS information etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The destination node B determines whether the user can be accessed based on QoS information for data connection. If the destination cells can provide a required resource, the destination cells will configure the required resource, allocate user ID Cell-Radio Network Temporary Identifier (C-RNTI) used for air interface and eNB UE X2AP Id used for X2 interface, then send a switching response message to the source node B in step <b>303</b>. This message contains the above mentioned information, successfully established data connection information and an ID for releasing a data connection. The message also contains a switching command that will be sent to the UE and transmitted to source node B through an information element of a container from source node B to destination node B?. The source node B sends the switching command to UE in step <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the UE carries out a synchronization process in destination cells successfully, it will send a switching completed message to destination node B in step <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The destination node B sends a path switching request message to an MME in step <b>306</b>, which includes a transmission stratum address for a new data connection that is also an address for downlink data receipt (eNB UE S1AP Id is used for the S1 interface that destination node B allocates to users) together with location information, such as a Tracking Area Identifier (TAI) in current cell where the UE is located.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">MME sends an answer to path switching message to the destination node B in step <b>307</b>. This message contains a user MME UE S1AP Id and an eNB UE S1AP Id used in the S1 interface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternative embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Specifically, the alternative embodiments differ in steps <b>405</b> and <b>410</b>, but are similar in the remaining steps.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The UE sends the measuring report message to node B in step <b>401</b>. The message includes the measurement for adjacent cells.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The source node B determines to switch the user to a cell with a higher quality based on the measuring report and resource management information in cells. If source and destination cells are located in different node Bs, the source node B determines to make a switch for the S1 interface and sends the switching requirement message to the source MME in step <b>402</b>. The way of determining is related to the actual implementation, for example the source node B finds no X2 interface between itself and the destination node B. The switching requirement message may include information elements such as, source node B and destination node B information, a container from source node B to destination node B, a user ID used for S1 interface, etc. Destination node B ID and specific-cell ID contained in the message are included in the container. The container is transmitted to the destination node B through MME transparent transmission and contains a user C-RNTI and access stratum information. There are two user IDs used for the S1 interface, i.e., MME UE S1AP Id that the source MME allocates to the user and eNB UE S1AP Id that the source node B allocates to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The source MME finds the MME in corresponding destination node B. Source service MME sends a forward resetting request message to MME that is connected to the destination node B in step <b>403</b>. The message includes the information that a data connection shall be established.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The destination MME finds the corresponding node B according to the destination node B ID and sends the switching request message to the destination node B in step <b>404</b>. The switching request includes QoS information for a data connection and container information of Step <b>402</b>. The message also includes the user MME UE S1AP Id used for the new S1 interface that destination MME allocates to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The destination node B finds destination cells on the node B based on destination cell ID in the container, and determines whether this user can be accessed according to QoS information for data connection. If destination cells can provide a required resource, destination cells configure the required resource, and allocate the user ID used for air interface and the eNB UE S1AP Id used for new S1 interface. The destination node B sends the answer to switching request message to destination MME, which contains the above information, in step <b>405</b>. The message also includes a switching command, which shall be sent to the UE and transmitted to the source node B through the container's information elements sent from the destination node B to the source node B via MME transparent transmission in which new C-RNTI and access stratum information are contained. In another embodiment of the present invention, the answer to switching request message also includes location information of destination cells such as the TAI.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The destination MME sends the forward resetting response message to the source MME in step <b>406</b>. The message includes container in Step <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The source MME sends the switching command to the source node B. The message includes information of a successfully established SAE data connection and an ID for releasing a data connection. Moreover, it also includes the container of step <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Cells on source node B send the switching command to UE in step <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The UE stores the message, then carries out synchronization process in destination cells successfully and sends a switching completed message to the destination node B in step <b>409</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The destination node B sends a switching notification message to the destination MME, which includes a user ID used for S1, based on which MME is able to find context messages in the corresponding UE. In an embodiment of the present invention, the switching notification message also includes location information of destination cells such as the TAI.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The destination MME sends a forward resetting completed message to the source MME in step <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The source MME sends an answer to forward resetting completed message to the destination MME in step <b>412</b>. Thus, the resetting process is completed. After the resetting process, a domain update process is initiated by the UE. During the domain update process, UE information is released of the source MME terminal and MME information contained in the HSS is updated. In absence of a domain update process, the MME can carry out the methods shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Another alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In step <b>501</b> the MME sends a location report request message to the node B. The MME can initiate this message anytime or regularly. The message includes a user ID used for the S1 interface. Based on another method for implementation, the MME sends a message in step <b>501</b>, carries out configuration to allow the node B to report the location information of the UE, and then node B sends the message in step <b>502</b> regularly or each time a new domain is switched based on configuration information in step <b>501</b>. Specifically, the messages in step <b>501</b> can also be transmitted once, and those in step <b>502</b> can be transmitted several times.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In step <b>502</b> the node B finds location information in a current cell in which the user is presently located, such as TAI. Then it sends the location report response message to the MME, which includes the user ID used for the S1 interface and a domain ID of a current cell where the user is located, such as TAI. Next, the MME can perform the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The UE moves into a new MME from the source MME, where the new MME is the destination MME. The destination MME obtains location information of the cells in which the UE is currently located, such as TAI, based on the embodiment of the present invention described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In step <b>601</b>, the MME sends a location update request message to HSS, database entity of operation and maintenance, which includes MME information for the current UE, such as an MME address or ID.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The HSS sends a response message, location update request confirmation, to the destination MME in step <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The HSS sends a UE context release request message to the source MME to request deletion of the context information of UE in step <b>603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In step <b>604</b>, the source MME deletes the UE information and then sends a UE context release response message to HSS.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in step <b>701</b>, the MME sends the UE location report message to the MSC. The message includes current location information of the UE, such as TAI.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The MSC stores location information of the UE and sends a UE location report confirmation to the MME in step <b>702</b>. Location information described in this invention can correspond not only to TAI, but also to other location information related to the cells where UE is located.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When users in a connection mode move to a domain outside a TA list, they need to initiate a domain update process. Conventionally, during the domain update process, the UE will obtain a new temporary ID for use in an idle mode. If the domain update process is prevented for users in a connection mode, it effectively reduces signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Circuit signaling needs to be transmitted through an evolved network, and an MSC is a control entity for a circuit domain that serves in a certain domain. The domain location where the UE is currently located is known to understand whether circuit domain signaling is sent to the MSC correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The embodiments of the present invention provide methods for updating location information of the UE to support the UE in a connection mode moving among different geographical domains without implementing the domain update process. It also supports signaling in the circuit domain to be transmitted in a newly evolved network.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
