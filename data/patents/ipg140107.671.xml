<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An exhaust gas treatment device for a diesel engine is capable of smoothly starting the generation of a combustible gas and is provided with a small combustible gas generator. A core material is fitted in the center portion of an annular wall to form an air-fuel mixing chamber between the inner peripheral surface of the annular wall and the outer peripheral surface of the core material. An air-fuel mixture gas in the air-fuel mixing chamber is adapted to be supplied from the end of the air-fuel mixing chamber to a combustible gas generating catalyst to a portion near the center thereof. A heater is used as the core material, the heat dissipating outer peripheral surface of the heater is exposed to the air-fuel mixing chamber. Heat is dissipated directly from the heat dissipating outer peripheral surface of the heater to the air-fuel mixing chamber when starting the generation of the combustible gas.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Section 371 of International Application No. PCT/JP2010/063066, filed Aug. 3, 2010, which was published in the Japanese language on Mar. 10, 2011, under International Publication No. WO 2011/027639 A1 and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an exhaust gas treatment device for a diesel engine and, more particularly, to an exhaust gas treatment device for a diesel engine, which can smoothly start the generation of a combustible gas and also reduce the size of a combustible gas generator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From among the terms of this specification and claims, a &#x201c;DPF&#x201d; is an abbreviation of a diesel particulate filter, and a &#x201c;PM&#x201d; is an abbreviation of a particulate matter included in an exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a conventional device in which a combustible gas is generated by a combustible gas generator, the combustible gas is discharged from a combustible gas discharge port to an exhaust passage in the upper stream of a DPF, a temperature of an exhaust gas is raised by combustion heat generated by burning the combustible gas using oxygen in the exhaust gas, and a PM accumulated in the DPF is burnt and removed by the heat of the exhaust gas (refer to Patent Document 1 below).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This type of a device is advantageous in that the PM accumulated in the DPF can be burnt and removed by raising the temperature of the exhaust gas by using the combustible gas even when the temperature of the exhaust gas is low.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The conventional technology, however, is problematic in that a thermal conduction plate and the central wall of an air-fuel mixing chamber are interposed between the heat-dissipating outer peripheral surface of a heater and the air-fuel mixing chamber and thus heat is indirectly radiated from the heat-dissipating outer peripheral surface of the heater to the air-fuel mixing chamber sequentially through the thermal conduction plate and the central wall of the air-fuel mixing chamber when the generation of the combustible gas is started.

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">There is the case in which the generation of a combustible gas is not smoothly started.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">When the generation of a combustible gas is started, heat is indirectly radiated from the heat-dissipating outer peripheral surface of the heater to the air-fuel mixing chamber sequentially through the thermal conduction plate and the central wall of the air-fuel mixing chamber. Accordingly, it is difficult for the heat of the heater to be transferred to the air-fuel mixing chamber and the generation of the combustible gas may not be smoothly started because the formation of an air-fuel mixture gas is delayed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">There is the case in which the size of the combustible gas generator may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">There is the case in which the size of the combustible gas generator is increased because the thermal conduction plate or the inner circumferential wall of the air-fuel mixing chamber is interposed between the heater and the air-fuel mixing chamber.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">An objective of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is to provide an exhaust gas treatment device for a diesel engine, which can smoothly start the generation of a combustible gas and also reduce the size of a combustible gas generator.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 13</figref> are diagrams illustrating an exhaust gas treatment device for a diesel engine according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, a vertical (upright type) multi-cylinder exhaust gas treatment device for a diesel engine is described.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">An outline of the exhaust gas treatment device is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 13</figref>, an exhaust manifold <b>113</b> is mounted on the lateral side of the cylinder head <b>112</b>, a super charger <b>75</b> is mounted over the exhaust manifold <b>113</b>, and a DPF casing <b>67</b> is coupled to the exhaust turbine <b>76</b> of the super charger <b>75</b> through an exhaust pipe <b>66</b>. A combustible gas generator <b>1</b> is installed in the exhaust pipe <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a combustible gas <b>4</b> is generated by the combustible gas generator <b>1</b>, the combustible gas <b>4</b> is discharged from a combustible gas discharge port <b>6</b> to an exhaust passage <b>7</b> in the upper stream of a DPF <b>5</b>, the combustible gas <b>4</b> is burnt by oxygen within the exhaust gas <b>8</b>, a temperature of the exhaust gas <b>8</b> is raised by heat of the combustion, and a PM accumulated in the DPF <b>5</b> is burnt and removed by the heat of the exhaust gas <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a DOC <b>100</b> is accommodated on the upper stream of the DPF casing <b>67</b> and the DPF <b>5</b> is accommodated on the lower stream of the DPF casing <b>67</b>. The DOC is an abbreviation of a diesel oxidation catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">The DPF <b>5</b> is a honeycomb carrier of ceramics and is a wall flow monolith in which the end parts of adjacent cells <b>5</b><i>a </i>are alternately blocked. The PM of an exhaust gas, passing through the inside of the cells <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the walls <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the cells <b>5</b><i>a</i>, is captured by the walls <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the cells <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">The DOC <b>100</b> is a honeycomb carrier of ceramics. The DOC <b>100</b> has a flow-through structure in which an oxidation catalyst is supported and both ends of the cells <b>100</b><i>a </i>are opened. The exhaust gas <b>8</b> passes through the inside of the cells <b>100</b><i>a</i>. When the combustible gas <b>4</b>, together with the exhaust gas <b>8</b>, passes through the DOC <b>100</b>, the combustible gas <b>4</b> is subject to catalyst combustion by oxygen within the exhaust gas <b>8</b> by means of the DOC <b>100</b>, a temperature of the exhaust gas <b>8</b> is raised, and the PM accumulated in the DPF <b>5</b> is burnt and removed by the heat of the exhaust gas <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">The construction of the combustible gas generator is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a combustible gas generation catalyst chamber <b>11</b> is installed in the combustible gas generator <b>1</b>, a combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> is accommodated in the combustible gas generation catalyst chamber <b>11</b>, a ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> is disposed in the starting end portion (top end portion) of the combustible gas generation catalyst chamber <b>11</b>, an air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> is formed on the inside of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b>, and air <b>3</b> and liquid fuel <b>2</b> are supplied to the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b>. Accordingly, an air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> is formed in the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b>, the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> is supplied to the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b>, and the combustible gas <b>4</b> is generated by using the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">The liquid fuel <b>2</b> is diesel oil (i.e., diesel fuel) and supplied from a liquid fuel supply source <b>22</b>. The air <b>3</b> is supplied from an air supply source <b>21</b>. The liquid fuel supply source <b>22</b> is a fuel tank, and the air supply source <b>21</b> is an air cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">The combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> supports a partial oxidation catalyst component in a carrier of ceramics. The combustible gas <b>4</b> including hydrogen or carbon monoxide is generated by partially oxidizing the liquid fuel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">A carrier made of a metal line having a cubic crosshatch structure or a carrier supporting an oxidation catalyst component may be used as the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b>. If the oxidation catalyst component is used, the liquid fuel <b>2</b> is evaporated by heat generated by oxidizing part of the liquid fuel <b>2</b>, whereby the combustible gas <b>4</b> is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a core material <b>15</b> is inwardly inserted into the center portion of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> so that the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> is formed between the inner peripheral surface <b>16</b> of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> and the outer peripheral surface <b>18</b> of the core material <b>15</b>, and the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> of the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> is supplied from the terminal end portion (bottom end portion) of the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> to a portion near the center portion of the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">Accordingly, the combustible gas <b>4</b> can be efficiently generated in the portion near the center portion of the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> where high catalyst activity is obtained because it is difficult for heat to escape and a high temperature state is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the heat-dissipating outer peripheral surface <b>26</b> of a heater <b>25</b> is exposed to the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> by using the heater <b>25</b> as the core material <b>15</b>, and when the combustible gas <b>4</b> starts being generated, heat is directly radiated from the heat-dissipating outer peripheral surface <b>26</b> of the heater <b>25</b> to the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">Accordingly, the generation of the combustible gas <b>4</b> can be smoothly started because the heat of the heater <b>25</b> is rapidly transferred to the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> and the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> is rapidly formed. Furthermore, the size of the combustible gas generator <b>1</b> can be reduced because an intervening substance does not exist between the heater <b>25</b> and the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">The heater <b>25</b> is an electric heater for performing heating when the combustible gas <b>4</b> starts being generated. A sheathed heater in which an electric heat wire is accommodated in a metal pipe is used as the heater <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an air-fuel mixture gas inlet face <b>27</b> is installed in the inner circumference of the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> of an annular form, the core material <b>15</b> is inwardly inserted into the center portion of the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> so that an air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b> is formed between the air-fuel mixture gas inlet face <b>27</b> and the outer peripheral surface <b>18</b> of the core material <b>15</b>, and the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> of the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> is introduced from the terminal end portion (bottom end portion) of the air-fuel mixing chamber <b>12</b> to the air-fuel mixture gas inlet face <b>27</b> near the center portion of the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> through the air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">Accordingly, the combustible gas <b>4</b> can be efficiently generated at the air-fuel mixture gas inlet face <b>27</b> in a portion near the center portion of the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> where high catalyst activity is obtained because it is difficult for heat to escape and a high temperature state is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">Furthermore, thermal damage to the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> or the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> can be prevented because the occurrence of flaming combustion of the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> is suppressed by the anti-inflammation function of the air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the heat-dissipating outer peripheral surface <b>26</b> of the heater <b>25</b> used in the core material <b>15</b> is exposed to the air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b> so that, when the combustible gas <b>4</b> starts being generated, the heat is directly radiated from the heat-dissipating outer peripheral surface <b>26</b> of the heater <b>25</b> to the air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">Accordingly, the generation of the combustible gas <b>4</b> can be smoothly started because the heat of the heater <b>25</b> is rapidly transferred to the air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b> and the dew condensation of the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> in the air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b> is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0115">Furthermore, the size of the combustible gas generator <b>1</b> can be reduced without an intervening substance between the heater <b>25</b> and the air-fuel mixture gas introduction gap <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0116">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, an air-fuel mixture gas supply throttle part <b>17</b> is installed in the terminal end portion (bottom end portion) of the inner peripheral surface <b>16</b> of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> and the air-fuel mixture gas supply throttle gap <b>20</b> is formed between the air-fuel mixture gas supply throttle part <b>17</b> and the outer peripheral surface <b>18</b> of the core material <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0117">Accordingly, thermal damage to the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> or the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> can be prevented because the occurrence of flaming combustion of the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> is suppressed by the anti-inflammation function of the air-fuel mixture gas supply throttle gap <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, a spacer protrusion <b>29</b> is formed in the inner peripheral surface <b>16</b> of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> and the spacer protrusion <b>29</b> is brought into contact with the outer peripheral surface <b>18</b> of the core material <b>15</b>. Accordingly, the inner peripheral surface <b>16</b> of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> and the outer peripheral surface <b>18</b> of the core material <b>15</b> are mutually positioned and the air-fuel mixture gas supply throttle part <b>17</b> and the outer peripheral surface <b>18</b> of the core material <b>15</b> are also mutually positioned, through the spacer protrusion <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0119">Accordingly, the assembly of the combustible gas generator <b>1</b> can be easily performed because this positioning can be accurately performed without a tool.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0120">The ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> and the spacer protrusion <b>29</b> are molded into one metal product.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0122">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> of an annular form is inwardly inserted into the combustible gas generation catalyst chamber <b>11</b> so that a position adjustment protrusion unit <b>30</b> is installed in the terminal end portion of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b>, and the position adjustment protrusion unit <b>30</b> is inwardly inserted into the starting end portion (top end portion) of the circumferential wall <b>10</b> of the combustible gas generation catalyst chamber <b>11</b> so that the air-fuel mixture gas inlet face <b>27</b> of the combustible gas generation catalyst <b>13</b> and the outer peripheral surface <b>18</b> of the core material <b>15</b> are mutually positioned through the circumferential wall <b>10</b> of the combustible gas generation catalyst chamber <b>11</b>, the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b>, and the spacer protrusion <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">Accordingly, the assembly of the combustible gas generator <b>1</b> can be easily performed because this positioning can be accurately performed without a tool.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0125">Accordingly, the leakage of gas between the placement face <b>31</b> and the subject placement face of the ring-shaped wall <b>14</b> can be suppressed because the leakage of the air-fuel mixture gas <b>23</b> or the combustible gas <b>4</b> from the starting end portion (top end portion) of the combustible gas generation catalyst chamber <b>11</b> is suppressed by the tight fitting of the position adjustment protrusion unit <b>30</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0173" num="0173">The structure of the exhaust pipe is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0174">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the exhaust pipe <b>66</b> is mounted on an exhaust pipe mounting place <b>65</b> in the exhaust path, and the DPF casing <b>67</b> in which the DPF <b>5</b> is accommodated is disposed in the lower stream of the exhaust pipe <b>66</b>.

<p id="p-0175" num="0175">Accordingly, the combustible gas <b>4</b> flowing along the passage axial line <b>74</b><i>a </i>of the passage terminal end portion <b>74</b> of the combustible gas guidance passage <b>70</b> toward the strained unit <b>69</b> does not directly come into contact with the exhaust gas <b>8</b> passing through the exhaust passage <b>7</b>, but the combustible gas <b>4</b> is gently discharged from the combustible gas discharge port <b>6</b> to the passage starting end portion <b>71</b> of the exhaust passage <b>7</b>. For this reason, back pressure can become small because a deviation in the flow of the exhaust gas <b>8</b> by the combustible gas <b>4</b> is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0176">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the exhaust pipe <b>66</b> that is bent or straight on the side of the passage terminal end <b>63</b> of the exhaust passage <b>7</b> can be selectively used, and a deviation in the exhaust gas <b>8</b> is suppressed even when the arrangement of the DPF casing <b>67</b> is changed. Accordingly, a difference in back pressure due to the difference of the shape of the exhaust pipe <b>66</b> is small and a constant exhaust gas performance is assured. For this reason, the degree of freedom in the arrangement of the DPF casing <b>67</b> can be increased by changing a shape on the side of the passage terminal end portion <b>63</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0177">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the exhaust pipe mounting place of the exhaust turbine <b>76</b> of the super charger <b>75</b> is used as the exhaust pipe mounting place <b>65</b>, the exhaust outlet passage of the exhaust turbine <b>76</b> is used as the exhaust outlet passage <b>68</b>, and the waste gate valve <b>77</b> of the exhaust turbine <b>76</b> and a valve mounting unit <b>78</b> thereof are used as the strained unit <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0178">Accordingly, the exhaust pipe <b>66</b> can be mounted by using the super charger <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0179">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the outlet-side end face <b>79</b> of the combustion catalyst <b>46</b> is spaced apart from the combustible gas discharge port <b>6</b> toward the starting end side of the combustible gas guidance passage <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0180">This makes it difficult for the exhaust gas <b>8</b> to come into contact with the combustion catalyst <b>46</b> even when the exhaust gas <b>8</b> enters from the combustible gas discharge port <b>6</b> to the combustible gas guidance passage <b>70</b> by the pulsation of the exhaust gas <b>8</b>.

<p id="p-0185" num="0185">Accordingly, the secondary air mixing gas <b>49</b> flowed out from the secondary air mixing gas outlet <b>61</b> is widely diffused in the secondary air mixing gas inlet chamber <b>81</b> toward the inlet-side end face <b>80</b> of the combustion catalyst <b>46</b> and then introduced from the entire area of the inlet-side end face <b>80</b> of the combustion catalyst <b>46</b> to the combustion catalyst <b>46</b> smoothly.
