<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">When a semiconductor wafer is preheated by halogen lamps, the temperature of a peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer is lower than that of a central portion thereof. A laser light emitting part disposed immediately under the center of the semiconductor wafer is rotated about the center line of the semiconductor wafer, while laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer. Thus, the irradiation spot of the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part swirls around along the peripheral portion of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer so as to draw a circular trajectory. As a result, the entire peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer at a relatively low temperature is uniformly heated. This achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heat treatment apparatus for heating a thin plate-like precision electronic substrate such as a semiconductor wafer and a glass substrate for a liquid crystal display device (hereinafter referred to simply as a &#x201c;substrate&#x201d;) by irradiating the substrate with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the process of manufacturing a semiconductor device, impurity doping is an essential step for forming a pn junction in a semiconductor wafer. At present, it is common practice to perform impurity doping by an ion implantation process and a subsequent annealing process. The ion implantation process is a technique for causing ions of impurity elements such as boron (B), arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P) to collide against the semiconductor wafer with high acceleration voltage, thereby physically implanting the impurities into the semiconductor wafer. The implanted impurities are activated by the subsequent annealing process. When annealing time in this annealing process is approximately several seconds or longer, the implanted impurities are deeply diffused by heat. This results in a junction depth much greater than a required depth, which might present a problem in good device formation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, attention has been given to flash lamp annealing (FLA) that is an annealing technique for heating a semiconductor wafer in an extremely short time. The flash lamp annealing is a heat treatment technique in which xenon flash lamps (the term &#x201c;flash lamp&#x201d; as used hereinafter refers to a &#x201c;xenon flash lamp&#x201d;) are used to irradiate the surface of a semiconductor wafer with flashes of light, thereby raising the temperature of only the surface of the semiconductor wafer doped with impurities in an extremely short time (several milliseconds or less).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The xenon flash lamps have a spectral distribution of radiation ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared regions. The wavelength of light emitted from the xenon flash lamps is shorter than that of light emitted from conventional halogen lamps, and approximately coincides with a fundamental absorption band of a silicon semiconductor wafer. Thus, when a semiconductor wafer is irradiated with flashes of light emitted from the xenon flash lamps, the temperature of the semiconductor wafer can be raised rapidly, with only a small amount of light transmitted through the semiconductor wafer. Also, it has turned out that the irradiation of a semiconductor wafer with flashes of light in an extremely short time of several milliseconds or less allows a selective temperature rise only near the surface of the semiconductor wafer. Therefore, the temperature rise in an extremely short time with the xenon flash lamps allows only the activation of impurities to be achieved without deep diffusion of the impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Heat treatment apparatuses including such xenon flash lamps, in which pulsed light emitting lamps such as flash lamps are disposed on the front surface side of a semiconductor wafer and lamps that stay lit continuously such as halogen lamps are disposed on the back side thereof so that a desired heat treatment is performed using a combination of these lamps, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,649,261 and International Publication No. WO 2003/085343. In these disclosed heat treatment apparatuses, the semiconductor wafer is preheated to a certain degree of temperature by the halogen lamps and the like, and is then raised in temperature to a desired treatment temperature by pulse heating from the flash lamps. Also, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0291835 discloses an apparatus in which a semiconductor wafer placed on a hot plate is preheated to a predetermined temperature, and is then raised in temperature to a desired treatment temperature by irradiation with a flash of light from flash lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When a semiconductor wafer is preheated by the hot plate as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0291835, a relatively uniform in-plane distribution of the wafer temperature is achieved by the precise temperature control of the hot plate. In particular, the hot plate disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0291835 is divided into concentric zones which are individually temperature-controllable. This achieves the uniform in-plane distribution of the wafer temperature easily. On the other hand, the preheating using the halogen lamps as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,649,261 and International Publication No. WO 2003/085343 provides a process-related advantage in that the temperature of the semiconductor wafer is raised to a relatively high preheating temperature in a short time, but is prone to present a problem in that the temperature of a peripheral portion of the wafer is lower than that of a central portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> are graphs showing in-plane temperature distributions of a semiconductor wafer in a conventional heat treatment apparatus including flash lamps and preheating halogen lamps in combination. The graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> show results obtained by preheating the semiconductor wafer implanted with impurities to a certain degree of temperature by the halogen lamps, irradiating the semiconductor wafer with flashes of light from the flash lamps to perform a pulse heating treatment, and then measuring a sheet resistance to determine a wafer temperature achieved. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, good temperature distribution uniformity is achieved in an inner region of the semiconductor wafer, rather than in a peripheral portion thereof, but the temperature falls rapidly in the peripheral portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the amount of light directed from the halogen lamps onto the peripheral portion of the wafer for preheating is increased for the purpose of solving the problem of the temperature fall in the peripheral portion, the temperature of part of the peripheral portion rises, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, but the temperature distribution uniformity in the inner region, rather than in the peripheral portion, is impaired. Additionally, the temperature fall in an outermost edge portion of the semiconductor wafer still remains unsolved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is intended for a heat treatment apparatus for heating a substrate by irradiating the substrate with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect of the present invention, the heat treatment apparatus comprises: a holder for holding a substrate in a horizontal position from below; a flash lamp for irradiating the substrate held by the holder with flashes of light from above; and an auxiliary irradiation part for directing light onto a local region of the substrate held by the holder which is lower in temperature than other regions of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The heat treatment apparatus includes the auxiliary irradiation part which directs light onto a local region of the substrate held by the holder which is lower in temperature than other regions of the substrate. This raises the temperature of the local region to achieve a uniform in-plane temperature distribution throughout the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the holder is made of quartz, and the heat treatment apparatus further comprises a halogen lamp for irradiating the substrate held by the holder with light from below to preheat the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The heat treatment apparatus includes the halogen lamp which irradiates the substrate held by the holder made of quartz with light from below to preheat the substrate. This eliminates the nonuniformity of the temperature distribution when the local region lower in temperature than other regions is produced by preheating.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the laser light irradiation part includes a laser light emitting part disposed immediately under the center of the substrate held by the holder and configured to emit laser light toward a peripheral portion of the substrate, and a rotating part for rotating the laser light emitting part about the center line of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This raises the temperature of the peripheral portion to achieve a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the substrate, when the temperature of the peripheral portion of the substrate is lower than that of other regions.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the laser light irradiation part further includes an elevating part for reciprocatingly upwardly and downwardly moving the laser light emitting part rotated by the rotating part.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This increases the width of a region irradiated with laser light in the peripheral portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a second aspect of the present invention, the heat treatment apparatus comprises: a chamber for receiving a substrate; a holder for holding the substrate in a horizontal position from below within the chamber; a flash lamp for irradiating the substrate held by the holder with flashes of light from above; an auxiliary irradiation part for directing light onto a lower surface of a local region of the substrate held by the holder which is lower in temperature than other regions of the substrate; and a reflective part for further reflecting light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part and reflected from the lower surface of the substrate to cause the further reflected light to reach the local region.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The heat treatment apparatus includes the reflective part which further reflects light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part and reflected from the lower surface of the substrate to cause the further reflected light to reach the local region which is lower in temperature than other regions. This raises the temperature of the local region to achieve a uniform in-plane temperature distribution throughout the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the light reflected from the lower surface of the substrate enters the reflective part at an incident angle of zero degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This allows the reflected light to precisely reach the local region irradiated with light from the auxiliary irradiation part.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the heat treatment apparatus further comprises an angle adjusting mechanism for adjusting an incident angle at which the light reflected from the lower surface of the substrate enters the reflective part.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This makes fine adjustments of the position reached by the reflected light from the reflective part to achieve a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the substrate with higher accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the reflective part is a mirror-finished portion of an inner wall surface of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This eliminates the need to provide the space for placement of the purpose-built reflective part, and also simplifies the configuration of the heat treatment apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The chamber <b>6</b> is configured such that upper and lower chamber windows <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> made of quartz are mounted to the top and bottom, respectively, of a tubular chamber side portion <b>61</b>. The chamber side portion <b>61</b> has a generally tubular shape having an open top and an open bottom.

The upper chamber window <b>63</b> forming the ceiling of the chamber <b>6</b> is a disk-shaped member made of quartz, and serves as a quartz window that transmits light emitted from the flash heating part <b>5</b> therethrough into the chamber <b>6</b>. The lower chamber window <b>64</b> forming the floor of the chamber <b>6</b> is also a disk-shaped member made of quartz, and serves as a quartz window that transmits light emitted from the halogen heating part <b>4</b> therethrough into the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">An upper reflective ring <b>68</b> is mounted to an upper portion of the inner wall surface of the chamber side portion <b>61</b>, and a lower reflective ring <b>69</b> is mounted to a lower portion thereof. Both the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are in the form of an annular ring. The upper reflective ring <b>68</b> is mounted by being inserted downwardly from the top of the chamber side portion <b>61</b>. The lower reflective ring <b>69</b>, on the other hand, is mounted by being inserted upwardly from the bottom of the chamber side portion <b>61</b> and fastened with screws not shown. In other words, the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are removably mounted to the chamber side portion <b>61</b>. An interior space of the chamber <b>6</b>, i.e. a space surrounded by the upper chamber window <b>63</b>, the lower chamber window <b>64</b>, the chamber side portion <b>61</b>, and the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b>, is defined as a heat treatment space <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A recessed portion <b>62</b> is defined in the inner wall surface of the chamber <b>6</b> by mounting the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> to the chamber side portion <b>61</b>. Specifically, the recessed portion <b>62</b> is surrounded by a middle portion of the inner wall surface of the chamber side portion <b>61</b> where the reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are not mounted, a lower end surface of the upper reflective ring <b>68</b>, and an upper end surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b>.

When the transport opening <b>66</b> is closed by the gate valve <b>185</b>, the heat treatment space <b>65</b> in the chamber <b>6</b> is an enclosed space.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At least one gas supply opening <b>81</b> for supplying a treatment gas (in this preferred embodiment, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas) therethrough into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is provided in an upper portion of the inner wall of the chamber <b>6</b>. The gas supply opening <b>81</b> is provided above the recessed portion <b>62</b>, and may be provided in the upper reflective ring <b>68</b>. The gas supply opening <b>81</b> is connected in communication with a gas supply pipe <b>83</b> through a buffer space <b>82</b> provided in the form of an annular ring inside the side wall of the chamber <b>6</b>. The gas supply pipe <b>83</b> is connected to a nitrogen gas supply source <b>85</b>. A valve <b>84</b> is inserted at some midpoint in the gas supply pipe <b>83</b>. When the valve <b>84</b> is opened, nitrogen gas is fed from the nitrogen gas supply source <b>85</b> to the buffer space <b>82</b>. The nitrogen gas flowing in the buffer space <b>82</b> flows in a spreading manner within the buffer space <b>82</b> which is lower in fluid resistance than the gas supply opening <b>81</b>, and is supplied through the gas supply opening <b>81</b> into the heat treatment space <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the other hand, at least one gas exhaust opening <b>86</b> for exhausting a gas from the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is provided in a lower portion of the inner wall of the chamber <b>6</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the holder <b>7</b>. The holder <b>7</b> includes a susceptor <b>70</b> and a holding plate <b>74</b>. The susceptor <b>70</b> is made of quartz, and includes a ring part <b>71</b> in the form of an annular ring, and a plurality of lugs <b>72</b> (in this preferred embodiment, four lugs) mounted upright on the ring part <b>71</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view of the holding plate <b>74</b>. The holding plate <b>74</b> is a circular planar member made of quartz. The diameter of the holding plate <b>74</b> is greater than that of a semiconductor wafer W. In other words, the holding plate <b>74</b> has a size, as seen in plan view, greater than that of the semiconductor wafer W. Multiple bumps <b>75</b> are mounted upright on the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b>. In this preferred embodiment, a total of six bumps <b>75</b> spaced at intervals of 60 degrees are disposed upright along the circumference of a circle concentric with the outer circumference of the holding plate <b>74</b>. The diameter of the circle on which the six bumps <b>75</b> are disposed (a distance between circumferentially opposed ones of the bumps <b>75</b>) is less than the diameter of the semiconductor wafer W, and is 280 mm in this preferred embodiment. Each of the bumps <b>75</b> is a support pin made of quartz. It should be noted that the number of bumps <b>75</b> is not limited to six, but it is only necessary that at least three bumps <b>75</b> capable of supporting a semiconductor wafer W with stability are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Multiple (in this preferred embodiment, five) guide pins <b>76</b> are mounted upright on the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b> concentrically with the six bumps <b>75</b>. The diameter of a circle on which the five guide pins <b>76</b> are disposed is slightly greater than the diameter of the semiconductor wafer W. The guide pins <b>76</b> are made of quartz. An annular ring member having a tapered surface which forms a predetermined angle with a horizontal plane so as to flare upwardly may be provided in place of the multiple guide pins <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The ring part <b>71</b> is placed on the bottom surface of the recessed portion <b>62</b>, whereby the susceptor <b>70</b> is mounted to the chamber <b>6</b>. The holding plate <b>74</b> is placed on the lugs <b>72</b> of the susceptor <b>70</b> mounted to the chamber <b>6</b>. A semiconductor wafer W transported into the chamber <b>6</b> is placed in a horizontal position on the holding plate <b>74</b> held by the susceptor <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged view of one of the bumps <b>75</b> and its vicinities when a semiconductor wafer W is placed on the holding plate <b>74</b>. A support rod <b>73</b> is mounted upright on each of the lugs <b>72</b> of the susceptor <b>70</b>. An upper end portion of the support rod <b>73</b> is fitted in a recessed portion provided in the lower surface of the holding plate <b>74</b>, whereby the holding plate <b>74</b> is held by the susceptor <b>70</b> without misregistration.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Each of the bumps <b>75</b> and the guide pins <b>76</b> is fitted in a recessed portion provided in the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b> and is mounted upright thereon. The upper end of each of the bumps <b>75</b> and the guide pins <b>76</b> mounted upright on the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b> protrudes from the upper surface thereof. A semiconductor wafer W is placed on the holding plate <b>74</b> in such a manner as to be supported in point contacting relationship by the multiple bumps <b>75</b> mounted upright on the holding plate <b>74</b>. A distance from the vertical position of the upper end of each of the bumps <b>75</b> to the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b> is in the range of 0.5 to 3 mm (in this preferred embodiment, 1 mm). Thus, the semiconductor wafer W is supported by the multiple bumps <b>75</b> at a distance ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm apart from the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b>. The vertical position of the upper end of each of the guide pins <b>76</b> is higher than the vertical position of the upper end of each of the bumps <b>75</b>. Thus, the multiple guide pins <b>76</b> prevent the horizontal misregistration of the semiconductor wafer W. The bumps <b>75</b> and the guide pins <b>76</b> may be made of quartz integrally with the holding plate <b>74</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing a driving circuit for each flash lamp FL.

The waveform setting part <b>32</b> sets the waveform of a pulse signal, based on an input from the input part <b>33</b>, and the pulse generator <b>31</b> generates the pulse signal in accordance with that waveform.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The multiple (in this preferred embodiment, 40) halogen lamps HL are incorporated in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> provided under the chamber <b>6</b>. The halogen lamps HL direct light from under the chamber <b>6</b> through the lower chamber window <b>64</b> toward the heat treatment space <b>65</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plan view showing an arrangement of the halogen lamps HL. In this preferred embodiment, 20 halogen lamps HL are arranged in an upper tier, and 20 halogen lamps HL are arranged in a lower tier. Each of the halogen lamps HL is a rod-shaped lamp having an elongated cylindrical shape. The 20 halogen lamps HL in the upper tier and the 20 halogen lamps HL in the lower tier are arranged so that the longitudinal directions thereof are in parallel with each other along a main surface of a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> (that is, in a horizontal direction). Thus, a plane defined by the arrangement of the halogen lamps HL in each of the upper and lower tiers is also a horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the halogen lamps HL in each of the upper and lower tiers are disposed at a higher density in a region opposed to the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> than in a region opposed to the central portion thereof. In other words, the halogen lamps HL in each of the upper and lower tiers are arranged at shorter intervals near the ends of the lamp arrangement than in the central portion thereof. This allows a greater amount of light to impinge upon the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W where a temperature fall is prone to occur when the semiconductor wafer W is heated by the irradiation thereof with light from the halogen heating part <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The group of halogen lamps HL in the upper tier and the group of halogen lamps HL in the lower tier are arranged to intersect each other in a lattice pattern. In other words, the 40 halogen lamps HL in total are disposed so that the longitudinal direction of the halogen lamps HL in the upper tier and the longitudinal direction of the halogen lamps HL in the lower tier are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Each of the halogen lamps HL is a filament-type light source which passes current through a filament disposed in a glass tube to make the filament incandescent, thereby emitting light. A gas prepared by introducing a halogen element (iodine, bromine and the like) in trace amounts into an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon and the like is sealed in the glass tube. The introduction of the halogen element allows the temperature of the filament to be set at a high temperature while suppressing a break in the filament. Thus, the halogen lamps HL have the properties of having a longer life than typical incandescent lamps and being capable of continuously emitting intense light. In addition, the halogen lamps HL, which are rod-shaped lamps, have a long life. The arrangement of the halogen lamps HL in a horizontal direction provides good efficiency of radiation to the semiconductor wafer W over the halogen lamps HL.</p>

The laser light emitting part <b>45</b> is disposed immediately under the center of a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>. Specifically, the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b </i>extends along a center line CX passing vertically through the center of the semiconductor wafer W held in a horizontal position by the holder <b>7</b>, and the light emitting part <b>45</b><i>a </i>is provided on the upper end of the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b </i>and extends obliquely upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The laser light emitting part <b>45</b> is rotatable about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W by the rotary motor <b>44</b> provided under the halogen heating part <b>4</b>.

The light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b </i>extends further through a gap between the arranged halogen lamps HL, and has an upper end provided at least above the halogen lamps HL in the upper tier. The light emitting part <b>45</b><i>a </i>is provided in continuation to the upper end of the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b </i>so as to extend obliquely upwardly (at an angle of less than 90 degrees with respect to the center line CX). This prevents the light emitting part <b>45</b><i>a </i>and the halogen lamps HL from coming into contact with each other even when the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> rotates.

The shutter plate <b>21</b> is a plate opaque to halogen light (light from a halogen light source), and is made of titanium (Ti), for example. The sliding drive mechanism <b>22</b> causes the shutter plate <b>21</b> to slidably move in a horizontal direction, thereby bringing the shutter plate <b>21</b> into and out of a light shielding position lying between the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and the holder <b>7</b>.

Thus, light directed from the plurality of halogen lamps HL toward the holder <b>7</b> in the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is intercepted. On the other hand, when the sliding drive mechanism <b>22</b> moves the shutter plate <b>21</b> backward, the shutter plate <b>21</b> is retracted from the light shielding position lying between the chamber <b>6</b> and the halogen heating part <b>4</b> to open the space lying under the lower chamber window <b>64</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The controller <b>3</b> controls the aforementioned various operating mechanisms provided in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> further includes, in addition to the aforementioned components, various cooling structures to prevent an excessive temperature rise in the halogen heating part <b>4</b>, the flash heating part <b>5</b> and the chamber <b>6</b> because of the heat energy generated from the halogen lamps HL and the flash lamps FL during the heat treatment of a semiconductor wafer W. As an example, a water cooling tube (not shown) is provided in the walls of the chamber <b>6</b>. Also, the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and the flash heating part <b>5</b> have an air cooling structure for forming a gas flow therein to exhaust heat. Air is supplied to a gap between the upper chamber window <b>63</b> and the lamp light radiation window <b>53</b> to cool down the flash heating part <b>5</b> and the upper chamber window <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, a procedure for the treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> will be described. A semiconductor wafer W to be treated herein is a semiconductor substrate doped with impurities (ions) by an ion implantation process. The impurities are activated by the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> performing the process of heating (annealing) the semiconductor wafer W by irradiation with flashes of light. The procedure for the treatment in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> which will be described below proceeds under the control of the controller <b>3</b> over the operating mechanisms of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">First, the valve <b>84</b> is opened for supply of gas, and the valves <b>89</b> and <b>192</b> for exhaust of gas are opened, so that the supply and exhaust of gas into and out of the chamber <b>6</b> start. When the valve <b>84</b> is opened, nitrogen gas is supplied through the gas supply opening <b>81</b> into the heat treatment space <b>65</b>. When the valve <b>89</b> is opened, the gas within the chamber <b>6</b> is exhausted through the gas exhaust opening <b>86</b>. This causes the nitrogen gas supplied from an upper portion of the heat treatment space <b>65</b> in the chamber <b>6</b> to flow downwardly and then to be exhausted from a lower portion of the heat treatment space <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The gas within the chamber <b>6</b> is exhausted also through the transport opening <b>66</b> by opening the valve <b>192</b>. Further, the exhaust mechanism not shown exhausts an atmosphere near the drivers of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b>. It should be noted that the nitrogen gas is continuously supplied into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> during the heat treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>. The amount of nitrogen gas supplied into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is changed as appropriate in accordance with processing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>185</b> is opened to open the transport opening <b>66</b>. A transport robot outside the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> transports an ion-implanted semiconductor wafer W through the transport opening <b>66</b> into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> in the chamber <b>6</b>. The semiconductor wafer W transported into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> by the transport robot is moved forward to a position lying immediately over the holder <b>7</b> and is stopped thereat. Then, the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> are moved horizontally from the retracted position to the transfer operation position and are then moved upwardly, whereby the lift pins <b>12</b> pass through the through holes <b>79</b> and protrude from the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b> to receive the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">After the semiconductor wafer W is placed on the lift pins <b>12</b>, the transport robot moves out of the heat treatment space <b>65</b>, and the gate valve <b>185</b> closes the transport opening <b>66</b>. Then, the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> move downwardly to transfer the semiconductor wafer W from the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> to the holding plate <b>74</b> of the holder <b>7</b>, so that the semiconductor wafer W is held in a horizontal position from below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view showing the holding plate <b>74</b> that holds the semiconductor wafer W. The semiconductor wafer W is supported by the six bumps <b>75</b> in point contacting relationship, and is held at a distance ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm (in this preferred embodiment, 1 mm) from the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b>. Thus, a layer of gas having a thickness of 1 mm is sandwiched between the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W and the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b>. The pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> moved downwardly below the holding plate <b>74</b> are moved back to the retracted position, i.e. to the inside of the recessed portion <b>62</b>, by the horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">After the semiconductor wafer W is held in a horizontal position from below by the holder <b>7</b> made of quartz, the 40 halogen lamps HL in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> turn on simultaneously. Halogen light emitted from the halogen lamps HL is transmitted through the lower chamber window <b>64</b> and the holding plate <b>74</b> both made of quartz, and impinges upon the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W. The semiconductor wafer W which is irradiated with the halogen light from the halogen lamps HL is preheated, so that the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W rises. It should be noted that the transfer arms <b>11</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b>, which are retracted to the inside of the recessed portion <b>62</b>, do not become an obstacle to the heating using the halogen lamps HL.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">During the preheating using the halogen lamps HL, the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W is measured with the contact-type thermometer <b>130</b>. Specifically, the contact-type thermometer <b>130</b> incorporating a thermocouple comes through the notch <b>77</b> of the holding plate <b>74</b> into contact with the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> to measure the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W which is on the increase. The measured temperature of the semiconductor wafer W is transmitted to the controller <b>3</b>. The controller <b>3</b> monitors whether the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W which is on the increase by the irradiation with halogen light from the halogen lamps HL reaches a predetermined preheating temperature T<b>1</b> or not. The preheating temperature T<b>1</b> shall be on the order of 200 to 800&#xb0; C., preferably on the order of 350 to 600&#xb0; C., (in the present preferred embodiment, 600&#xb0; C.) at which there is no apprehension that the impurities implanted in the semiconductor wafer W are diffused by heat. It should be noted that, when the temperature of a semiconductor wafer W is raised by the irradiation with halogen light from the halogen lamps HL, the temperature is not measured with the radiation thermometer <b>120</b>. This is because the halogen light emitted from the halogen lamps HL enters the radiation thermometer <b>120</b> in the form of disturbance light to obstruct the precise measurement of the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A semiconductor wafer W during the preheating shows a tendency to be lower in temperature in a peripheral portion thereof, as compared with the temperature in a central portion thereof. Conceivable causes of such a phenomenon include heat radiation from the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W, convection occurring between the holding plate <b>74</b> which is relatively low in temperature and the vicinity of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W, and heat conduction from the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W to the holding plate <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">To prevent such a phenomenon, the halogen lamps HL in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> are disposed at a higher density in a region opposed to the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W than in a region opposed to the central portion thereof, so that a greater amount of light is directed toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W than toward the central portion thereof. Additionally, the inner peripheral surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b> mounted to the chamber side portion <b>61</b> is provided as a mirror surface. Thus, a greater amount of light is reflected from the inner peripheral surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Even though the amount of halogen light impinging upon the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W is made greater than that impinging upon the central portion thereof, it has still been difficult to solve the problem of the decrease in the temperature of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. This tendency becomes more pronounced as a distance between the halogen lamps HL and the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> increases. Also, further increase in the amount of light directed from the halogen heating part <b>4</b> onto the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W might further impair the uniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">To solve such a problem, the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> for additionally irradiating the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> with light is provided in the first preferred embodiment. The laser unit <b>41</b> in the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> emits visible laser light having a wavelength of 800 to 820 nm with a power output of 80 to 120 W. The laser light emitted from the laser unit <b>41</b> and guided through the optical fiber <b>42</b> to the lens <b>43</b> comes through the lens <b>43</b> into the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b </i>of the laser light emitting part <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view showing an optical path of laser light in the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> according to the first preferred embodiment. The laser light exits the lens <b>43</b> vertically upwardly, and enters the lower end surface of the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b </i>perpendicularly thereto. In the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b </i>extending in a vertical direction, the incoming laser light travels in a straight line vertically upwardly, i.e., along the length of the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b</i>. The laser light traveling in a straight line vertically upwardly is totally reflected from an inclined surface <b>45</b><i>c </i>provided at the upper end of the light guiding part <b>45</b><i>b</i>, so that the optical path of the laser light is bent obliquely upwardly. As indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the laser light is reflected so as to be directed toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>. The laser light totally reflected from the inclined surface <b>45</b><i>c </i>exits the light emitting part <b>45</b><i>a </i>toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The visible laser light having a wavelength of 800 to 820 nm and exiting the light emitting part <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> is transmitted through the holder <b>7</b> made of quartz, and reaches the peripheral portion of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W. On the other hand, the semiconductor wafer W made of silicon which is raised in temperature to a certain degree by the halogen heating part <b>4</b> absorbs the laser light having a wavelength of 800 to 820 nm. Thus, the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> is directed onto and absorbed by the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W to raise the temperature of the irradiated region of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the first preferred embodiment, the rotary motor <b>44</b> rotates the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W as indicated by the arrow AR<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, while the laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. As a result, an irradiation spot LP of the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> swirls around along the peripheral portion of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W so as to draw a circular trajectory as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. It should be noted that the rotary motor <b>44</b> causes the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> to make 5 to 200 rotations per second (in the present preferred embodiment, 20 rotations per second).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, the laser light is directed onto the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W where a relative temperature decrease has occurred in a preheating stage to raise the temperature of the peripheral portion, thereby improving the uniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution. The start of the irradiation with laser light from the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> may be timed to coincide with the turning on of the halogen lamps HL or to be a predetermined time period later than the turning on of the halogen lamps HL.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The flash lamps FL emit flashes of light at the point in time when a predetermined time period has elapsed since the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W reached the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>. For the emission of flashes of light from the flash lamps FL, the capacitor <b>93</b> is charged in advance by the power supply unit <b>95</b>. Then, with the capacitor <b>93</b> in the charged state, the pulse generator <b>31</b> in the controller <b>3</b> outputs a pulse signal to the IGBT <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The waveform of the pulse signal outputted from the pulse generator <b>31</b> is specified by inputting from the input part <b>33</b> a recipe that is a sequence of defined parameters including a time interval (ON time) equivalent to the pulse width and a time interval (OFF time) between pulses. After an operator inputs the recipe containing descriptions of such parameters from the input part <b>33</b> to the controller <b>3</b>, the waveform setting part <b>32</b> in the controller <b>3</b> sets a pulse waveform having repeated ON and OFF time intervals in accordance with the recipe. Then, the pulse generator <b>31</b> outputs the pulse signal in accordance with the pulse waveform set by the waveform setting part <b>32</b>. As a result, the pulse signal having the waveform including the repeated ON and OFF time intervals is applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, so that the turning ON and OFF of the IGBT <b>96</b> are controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In synchronism with the turning ON of the pulse signal outputted from the pulse generator <b>31</b>, the controller <b>3</b> controls the trigger circuit <b>97</b> to apply a high voltage to the trigger electrode <b>91</b>. Thus, when the pulse signal inputted to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> is ON, a current inevitably flows across the electrodes of the glass tube <b>92</b>, and the resultant excitation of xenon atoms or molecules induces light emission. The controller <b>3</b> outputs the pulse signal to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, and also applies the trigger voltage to the trigger electrode <b>91</b> in synchronization with the turning ON of the pulse signal, thereby producing a flow of current having a sawtooth waveform in the circuit including a flash lamp FL. In other words, the value of the current flowing through the glass tube <b>92</b> of the flash lamp FL increases when the pulse signal inputted to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> is ON, and the current value decreases when the pulse signal is OFF. It should be noted that an individual current waveform corresponding to each pulse is defined by the constant of the coil <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The flow of a current in the circuit including the flash lamp FL causes the flash lamp FL to emit light. The emission intensity of the flash lamp FL is roughly proportional to the current flowing through the flash lamp FL. As a result, the waveform of the emission intensity of the flash lamp FL versus time is close to a sawtooth waveform. The semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> is irradiated with flashes of light in accordance with such an intensity waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">If a flash lamp FL emits light without using a switching element such as the IGBT <b>96</b>, the electrical charges stored in the capacitor <b>93</b> are consumed momentarily by emitting light only once, so that the waveform of the emission intensity of the flash lamp FL exhibits a single pulse having a width on the order of 0.1 to 10 milliseconds between a rapid rising edge and a rapid falling edge.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">On the other hand, when the IGBT <b>96</b> is connected in the circuit and the pulse signal is outputted to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> as in the present preferred embodiment, this circuit is turned ON and OFF intermittently by the IGBT <b>96</b>, so that the current flowing from the capacitor <b>93</b> to the flash lamp FL is chopper-controlled. As a result, the light emission from the flash lamp FL is accordingly chopper-controlled, which allows the electrical charges stored in the capacitor <b>93</b> to be discharged intermittently and consumed in a divided manner at the flash lamp FL. This enables the flash lamp FL to repeatedly flash ON and OFF in an extremely short time. It should be noted that, before the value of the current flowing through the flash lamp FL reaches exactly zero, the next pulse is applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> to increase the current value again. For this reason, the emission intensity never reaches exactly zero even while the flash lamp FL repeatedly flashes ON and OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The waveform of the emission intensity of the flash lamp FL versus time may be appropriately changed by adjusting the waveform of the pulse signal applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>. The waveform of the emission intensity versus time may be determined in accordance with the purpose of the flash heating treatment (e.g., the activation of implanted impurities, and the process of recovering crystal defects created during impurity implantation). It should, however, be noted that the total light emission time of the flash lamp FL for a single heating treatment is not greater than one second, no matter what configuration the waveform of the emission intensity of the flash lamp FL versus time has. The waveform of the pulse signal applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> is adjustable by the time interval equivalent to the pulse width and the time interval between pulses, which are inputted from the input part <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The irradiation of the semiconductor wafer W with flashes of light from the flash lamps FL in this manner causes the surface temperature of the semiconductor wafer W to increase slowly from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to an intended treatment temperature T<b>2</b>, and then to decrease slowly. However, the surface temperature of the semiconductor wafer W can be said to increase slowly and then to decrease slowly, as compared with that obtained by conventional flash lamp annealing, and the light emission time of the flash lamps FL is not greater then one second. Thus, the increase and decrease in the surface temperature according to this preferred embodiment occur in a significantly short time, as compared with those caused by the heating by irradiation with light using halogen lamps and the like. In the first preferred embodiment, the in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W is made uniform in the preheating stage by the irradiation of the semiconductor wafer W with the laser light from the laser light emitting part <b>45</b>. This makes the in-plane temperature distribution of the surface of the semiconductor wafer W also uniform during the irradiation with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">After a predetermined time period has elapsed since the completion of the flash heating treatment, the halogen lamps HL turn off. The irradiation with the laser light from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> also stops. This increases the speed at which the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases. At the same time that the halogen lamps HL turn off, the shutter mechanism <b>2</b> inserts the shutter plate <b>21</b> into the light shielding position lying between the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and the chamber <b>6</b>. The temperatures of filaments and tube walls of the halogen lamps HL do not decrease immediately after the halogen lamps HL turn off, but radiant heat is continuously emitted from the filaments and the tube walls at elevated temperature for a short time interval to obstruct the temperature decrease of the semiconductor wafer W. The insertion of the shutter plate <b>21</b> interrupts the radiant heat emitted from the halogen lamps HL immediately after the turning off toward the heat treatment space <b>65</b> to increase the speed at which the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">After the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases to a predetermined temperature or below, the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> are moved horizontally again from the retracted position to the transfer operation position and are then moved upwardly, whereby the lift pins <b>12</b> protrude from the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b> to receive the heat-treated semiconductor wafer W from the holding plate <b>74</b>. Subsequently, the transport opening <b>66</b> which has been closed is opened by the gate valve <b>185</b>, and the transport robot outside the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> transports the semiconductor wafer W placed on the lift pins <b>12</b> to the outside. Thus, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> completes the heating treatment of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the first preferred embodiment, the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> irradiates a semiconductor wafer W with laser light to correct the nonuniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W resulting from the preheating from the halogen lamps HL. When a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> is preheated by the halogen lamps HL, the semiconductor wafer W shows a tendency to be lower in temperature in a peripheral portion thereof than in a central portion thereof. The irradiation of the peripheral portion with laser light from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> selectively heats the peripheral portion to achieve a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In particular, the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> is rotated about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W in the first preferred embodiment, while the laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> disposed immediately under the center of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. Thus, the irradiation spot LP of the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> swirls around along the peripheral portion of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W so as to draw a circular trajectory. As a result, the entire peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W at lowered temperature is uniformly heated. This achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present invention includes the three types of heat sources of light irradiation type. Specifically, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> includes the flash lamps FL which perform flash heating for the activation of impurities, the halogen lamps HL for preheating a semiconductor wafer W prior to the irradiation with flashes of light, and the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> which irradiates the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W with laser light. The irradiation with the laser light from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> is performed to compensate for the decrease in temperature of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W which is inevitably caused when only the amount of light from the halogen lamps HL is adjusted. This improves the uniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W in the preheating stage to consequently finally achieve the uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W during the irradiation with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">&#x3c;Second Preferred Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Next, a second preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a view showing a configuration of the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> according to the second preferred embodiment. Like reference numerals and characters are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to designate components identical with those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> according to the second preferred embodiment includes a cam mechanism in addition to the components of the first preferred embodiment. Specifically, the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> according to the second preferred embodiment includes a cam-follower <b>47</b> fixedly provided on the rotary motor <b>44</b>, and a cam <b>46</b> abutting against the cam-follower <b>47</b>. The configuration of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the second preferred embodiment is similar to that according to the first preferred embodiment except that the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> includes the cam mechanism. A procedure for the treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the second preferred embodiment is also generally similar to that according to the first preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The cam <b>46</b> is rotated by a rotary drive mechanism not shown, and the center of rotation of the cam <b>46</b> is eccentric. Thus, a distance from the center of rotation of the cam <b>46</b> to the point of contact between the cam-follower <b>47</b> and the cam <b>46</b> is periodically varied as the cam <b>46</b> is rotated. The rotation of the cam <b>46</b> moves the cam-follower <b>47</b> upwardly and downwardly to consequently move the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> reciprocatingly in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the second preferred embodiment, the rotary motor <b>44</b> rotates the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W as indicated by the arrow AR<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, while laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. At the same time, the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> rotated by the rotary motor <b>44</b> is moved reciprocatingly in a vertical direction by the cam <b>46</b> and the cam-follower <b>47</b>, as indicated by the arrow AR<b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The upward and downward movement of the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> which directs laser light obliquely upwardly causes the position reached by the laser light on the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W to move reciprocatingly in a radial direction. As a result, the irradiation spot LP of the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> swirls around along the peripheral portion of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W so as to draw a substantially circular trajectory, and also moves reciprocatingly in the radial direction of the semiconductor wafer W, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In other words, the irradiation spot LP of the laser light draws a substantially circular trajectory while meandering in the peripheral portion of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">This allows the swirling trajectory of the irradiation spot LP of the laser light in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W to have a width, as compared with the first preferred embodiment. The irradiation spot LP of the laser light itself has a circular or elliptic shape having a diameter on the order of several millimeters. Reciprocatingly moving the irradiation spot LP in the radial direction of the semiconductor wafer W while swirling the same around along the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W allows the swirling trajectory to have a width increased to approximately tens of millimeters. Thus, when the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W where a relative temperature decrease has occurred due to the preheating using the halogen lamps HL has a large width, the entire peripheral portion is scanned uniformly with the irradiation spot LP of the laser light, so that the temperature of the entire peripheral portion is increased. This achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">&#x3c;Third Preferred Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Next, a third preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a view showing a configuration of the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> according to the third preferred embodiment. Like reference numerals and characters are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> to designate components identical with those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> according to the third preferred embodiment includes a galvanometer mirror <b>49</b> in place of the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> of the first and second preferred embodiments. The galvanometer mirror <b>49</b> includes two mirrors individually rotatable through an angle dependent upon a driving voltage to allow incident laser light to scan a two-dimensional surface (in X and Y directions) while reflecting the incident laser light. The configuration of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the third preferred embodiment is similar to that according to the first preferred embodiment except that the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> includes the galvanometer mirror <b>49</b> in place of the laser light emitting part <b>45</b>. A procedure for the treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the third preferred embodiment is also generally similar to that according to the first preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the third preferred embodiment, laser light emitted from the laser unit <b>41</b> is guided through the optical fiber <b>42</b> to the lens <b>43</b>. The laser light exiting the lens <b>43</b> enters the galvanometer mirror <b>49</b>. The galvanometer mirror <b>49</b> causes the two mirrors thereof to reflect the laser light coming from the lens <b>43</b> toward the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>, and also individually drives the two mirrors to scan the semiconductor wafer W within the surface thereof in the X and Y directions with the irradiation spot LP of the laser light exiting the galvanometer mirror <b>49</b>. This enables the laser light to be directed at any position on the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The third preferred embodiment provides a high degree of flexibility in the position of irradiation with laser light, as compared with the first and second preferred embodiments. Thus, when a relative temperature decrease, for example, has occurred in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W due to the preheating using the halogen lamps HL, the peripheral portion of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W is scanned with the irradiation spot LP of the laser light drawing a circular trajectory. This achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W, as in the first and second preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Also, when the semiconductor wafer W has what is called a cold spot which is a local region at a temperature lower than that of other regions, laser light may be directed only onto the lower-temperature local region to eliminate the cold spot. On the other hand, when the semiconductor wafer W has what is called a hot spot which is a local region at a temperature higher than that of other regions, laser light may be directed onto the other regions than the higher-temperature local region to eliminate the hot spot. In other words, the third preferred embodiment is capable of directing laser light onto any region of the semiconductor wafer W. Thus, if there is a nonuniform temperature distribution asymmetrical with respect to the center of the semiconductor wafer W, laser light may be directed onto a region at a relatively low temperature to achieve a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W. This is accomplished by introducing the concept of trimming into the heating treatment of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>

A procedure for the treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the fourth preferred embodiment is also generally similar to that according to the first preferred embodiment.</p>

The auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> further includes a lens <b>144</b> disposed outside the elliptical mirror <b>142</b>. The arc lamp <b>141</b> is a xenon lamp which utilizes arc discharge, and is provided at a first focal position of the elliptical mirror <b>142</b>. Arc light emitted from the arc lamp <b>141</b> at the first focal position is reflected from the inner surface of the elliptical mirror <b>142</b>, and is then collected at a second focal position. The lens <b>144</b> is provided at the second focal position of the elliptical mirror <b>142</b>.

<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>has an upper end portion extending through the bottom wall of the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and a reflector not shown for the halogen lamps HL. The light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>may be provided with a bearing in a location where the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>passes through the bottom wall of the halogen heating part <b>4</b>. The light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>extends further through a gap between the arranged halogen lamps HL (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), and has an upper end provided at least above the halogen lamps HL in the upper tier. The light emitting part <b>245</b><i>a </i>is provided in continuation to the upper end of the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b</i>. This prevents the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and the halogen lamps HL from coming into contact with each other even when the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, laser light emitted from the laser unit <b>41</b>, passing through the lens <b>43</b>, and entering the lower end surface of the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>of the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> perpendicularly thereto travels in a straight line along the length of the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>extending in a vertical direction. In other words, the incoming laser light is guided in parallel with the central axis of the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>toward the light emitting part <b>245</b><i>a </i>provided over the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b</i>. Then, the laser light guided in the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>is totally reflected from the reflective surface <b>245</b><i>c </i>of the light emitting part <b>245</b><i>a </i>toward the exit surface <b>245</b><i>d</i>, and is then directed from the exit surface <b>245</b><i>d </i>toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>. The laser light is slightly refracted when exiting the light emitting part <b>245</b><i>a </i>made of quartz into the atmosphere. As a result, the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> forms an angle &#x3b2; of approximately 35 degrees with a horizontal plane. The angle &#x3b2; which shall be approximately 35 degrees in the fifth preferred embodiment, may take an appropriate value in accordance with the arrangement and configuration of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> (e.g., a positional relationship between the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and the semiconductor wafer W). More specifically, the angle &#x3b2; may be adjusted depending on the angle &#x3b1; formed by the reflective surface <b>245</b><i>c </i>and a horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The rotary motor <b>44</b> rotates the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> about the center line CX, while the laser light is directed outwardly from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b>. Thus, an irradiation spot of the laser light swirls around along the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. The irradiation of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W with laser light by means of the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> will be further described later.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the fifth preferred embodiment further includes the reflective part <b>19</b> for further reflecting the laser light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> and reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a perspective view of the reflective part <b>19</b>. For adaptation to the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> which rotates while directing the laser light obliquely upwardly, the reflective part <b>19</b> in the form of an annular ring is provided under the outside of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>. The center of the reflective part <b>19</b> in the form of an annular ring coincides with the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>. The reflective part <b>19</b> may be provided, for example, in the recessed portion <b>62</b> of the chamber <b>6</b> (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The reflective part <b>19</b> has a mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>in opposed relation to the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>. The mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>is a tapered surface in the form of an annular ring, and is mirror-finished to have a high reflectance. The angle which the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>forms with a horizontal plane is designed so that the angle of incidence at which the laser light reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W enters the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>is zero degrees. In the fifth preferred embodiment, the angle which the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>forms with a horizontal plane is approximately 55 degrees because the angle &#x3b2; formed by the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and a horizontal plane is approximately 35 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">A procedure for the treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the fifth preferred embodiment is also generally similar to that according to the first preferred embodiment. Specifically, a semiconductor wafer W to be treated herein is a semiconductor substrate doped with impurities (ions) by an ion implantation process. The impurities are activated by the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> performing the process of heating (annealing) the semiconductor wafer W by irradiation with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the fifth preferred embodiment, an ion-implanted semiconductor wafer W is also transported into the chamber <b>6</b>, is held by the holder <b>7</b>, and is preheated by the halogen lamps HL. As in the first preferred embodiment, the semiconductor wafer W during the preheating shows a tendency to be lower in temperature in a peripheral portion thereof, as compared with the temperature in a central portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">To prevent such a phenomenon, the halogen lamps HL in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> are disposed at a higher density in a region opposed to the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W than in a region opposed to the central portion thereof, so that a greater amount of light is directed toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W than toward the central portion thereof. Additionally, the inner peripheral surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b> mounted to the chamber side portion <b>61</b> is provided as a mirror surface. Thus, a greater amount of light is reflected from the inner peripheral surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Even though the amount of halogen light impinging upon the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W is made greater than that impinging upon the central portion thereof, it has still been difficult to solve the problem of the decrease in the temperature of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. This tendency becomes more pronounced as a distance between the halogen lamps HL and the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> increases. Also, further increase in the amount of light directed from the halogen heating part <b>4</b> onto the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W might further impair the uniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">To solve such a problem, the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> for additionally irradiating the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> with light is provided in the fifth preferred embodiment. The laser unit <b>41</b> in the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> emits visible laser light having a wavelength of 800 to 820 nm with a power output of 80 to 500 W. The laser light emitted from the laser unit <b>41</b> and guided through the optical fiber <b>42</b> to the lens <b>43</b> comes through the lens <b>43</b> into the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>of the laser light emitting part <b>245</b>. The laser light exits the lens <b>43</b> vertically upwardly, and enters the lower end surface of the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>perpendicularly thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the laser light entering the lower end surface of the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b </i>perpendicularly thereto is guided to the light emitting part <b>245</b><i>a </i>provided over the light guiding part <b>245</b><i>b</i>. After being reflected from the reflective surface <b>245</b><i>c</i>, the laser light exits the exit surface <b>245</b><i>d </i>toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> (obliquely upwardly). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a view showing the irradiation of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W with laser light by the use of the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> and the reflective part <b>19</b>. The visible laser light having a wavelength of 800 to 820 nm and exiting the light emitting part <b>245</b><i>a </i>of the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> reaches the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>, as indicated by the arrow AR<b>1</b>. It should be noted that the holder <b>7</b>, which is entirely made of quartz, allows the visible laser light having a wavelength of 800 to 820 nm and exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> to pass therethrough. On the other hand, the semiconductor wafer W made of silicon which is raised in temperature to a certain degree by the halogen heating part <b>4</b> absorbs the laser light having a wavelength of 800 to 820 nm. Thus, the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> is directed onto and absorbed by the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W to raise the temperature of the irradiated region of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">However, even the semiconductor wafer W raised in temperature to a certain degree does not absorb all of the laser light directed thereonto but reflects approximately 40% of the laser light. Specifically, part of the laser light directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> onto the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W is absorbed by the semiconductor wafer W, but part of the laser light is reflected from the semiconductor wafer W, as indicated by the arrow AR<b>2</b>. In the fifth preferred embodiment, the angle formed by the laser light reflected from the semiconductor wafer W and the semiconductor wafer W held in a horizontal position is approximately 35 degrees because the angle &#x3b2; formed by the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and the semiconductor wafer W is approximately 35 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The laser light directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and reflected from the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W reaches the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the reflective part <b>19</b>, and is further reflected therefrom. The mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>is a tapered surface such that the angle of incidence at which the laser light reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W enters the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>is zero degrees. In other words, the laser light reflected from the semiconductor wafer W enters the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>perpendicularly thereto. Thus, the angle of reflection at which the laser light is reflected from the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>is also zero degrees. As a result, the laser light reflected from the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>reaches the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W again, as indicated by the arrow AR<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In this manner, the reflective part <b>19</b> further reflects the laser light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> and reflected from a local region of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W to cause the laser light to reach the local region. Thus, the direct light from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and the reflected light from the reflective part <b>19</b> in overlapping relation impinge upon the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W to thereby raise the temperature of the irradiated region with higher efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Also, part of the laser light reflected from the reflective part <b>19</b> is further reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W. Since the angle of reflection from the reflective part <b>19</b> is zero degrees, the laser light reflected from the reflective part <b>19</b> travels along the same optical path as the light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> in the reverse direction, and is reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W back to the laser light emitting part <b>245</b>. This prevents a harmful effect such that the laser light reflected from the reflective part <b>19</b> is repeatedly reflected multiple times within the chamber <b>6</b> to heat an unintended area. Part of the light reflected back to the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> passes through the optical fiber <b>42</b> to reach the laser unit <b>41</b>. There is, however, no apprehension that this reflected light, which is attenuated to a considerable degree after being repeatedly reflected between the semiconductor wafer W and the reflective part <b>19</b>, exerts influence on the laser unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the fifth preferred embodiment, the rotary motor <b>44</b> rotates the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 22</figref>, while the laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. As a result, an irradiation spot LP of the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> swirls around along the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W so as to draw a circular trajectory as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The laser light directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W accordingly swirls around so as to draw a circular trajectory. The reflective part <b>19</b> is in the form of an annular ring, and the center of the reflective part <b>19</b> coincides with the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>. Thus, the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the reflective part <b>19</b> in the form of an annular ring, the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W, and the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> rotated about the center line CX are always in a constant positional relationship relative to each other in a circumferential direction of the semiconductor wafer W. Thus, the light reflected from the reflective part <b>19</b> always impinges upon the irradiation spot LP, and swirls around as the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> is rotated. It should be noted that the rotary motor <b>44</b> causes the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> to make 5 to 200 rotations per second (in this preferred embodiment, 20 rotations per second).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Thus, the laser light (the direct light and the reflected light) is directed onto the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W where a relative temperature decrease has occurred in a preheating stage to raise the temperature of the peripheral portion, thereby improving the uniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution. The start of the irradiation with laser light from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> may be timed to coincide with the turning on of the halogen lamps HL, or to be a predetermined time period later or earlier than the turning on of the halogen lamps HL.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The flash lamps FL emit flashes of light at the point in time when a predetermined time period has elapsed since the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W reached the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>. The irradiation of the semiconductor wafer W with flashes of light in the fifth preferred embodiment is similar to that in the first preferred embodiment. The irradiation of the semiconductor wafer W with flashes of light from the flash lamps FL causes the surface temperature of the semiconductor wafer W to increase slowly from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to the intended treatment temperature T<b>2</b>, and then to decrease slowly. However, the surface temperature of the semiconductor wafer W can be said to increase slowly and then to decrease slowly, as compared with that obtained by conventional flash lamp annealing, and the light emission time of the flash lamps FL is not greater then one second. Thus, the increase and decrease in the surface temperature according to this preferred embodiment occur in a significantly short time, as compared with those caused by the heating by irradiation with light using halogen lamps and the like. In the fifth preferred embodiment, the in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W is made uniform in the preheating stage by the irradiation of the semiconductor wafer W with the direct laser light from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and with the reflected laser light from the reflective part <b>19</b>. This makes the in-plane temperature distribution of the surface of the semiconductor wafer W also uniform during, the irradiation with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">After a predetermined time period has elapsed since the completion of the flash heating treatment, the halogen lamps HL turn off. The irradiation with the laser light from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> also stops. This stops the irradiation with the reflected light from the reflective part <b>19</b> as a matter of course to increase the speed at which the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases. At the same time that the halogen lamps HL turn off, the shutter mechanism <b>2</b> inserts the shutter plate <b>21</b> into the light shielding position lying between the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and the chamber <b>6</b>. The temperatures of filaments and tube walls of the halogen lamps HL do not decrease immediately after the halogen lamps HL turn off, but radiant heat is continuously emitted from the filaments and the tube walls at elevated temperature for a short time interval to obstruct the temperature decrease of the semiconductor wafer W. The insertion of the shutter plate <b>21</b> interrupts the radiant heat emitted from the halogen lamps HL immediately after the turning off toward the heat treatment space <b>65</b> to increase the speed at which the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases. It should be noted that the irradiation with the laser light from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> may be stopped before the halogen lamps HL turn off.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">After the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases to a predetermined temperature or below, the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> are moved horizontally again from the retracted position to the transfer operation position and are then moved upwardly, whereby the lift pins <b>12</b> protrude from the upper surface of the holding plate <b>74</b> to receive the heat-treated semiconductor wafer W from the holding plate <b>74</b>. Subsequently, the transport opening <b>66</b> which has been closed is opened by the gate valve <b>185</b>, and the transport robot outside the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> transports the semiconductor wafer W placed on the lift pins <b>12</b> to the outside. Thus, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> completes the heating treatment of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In the fifth preferred embodiment, the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> irradiates a semiconductor wafer W with laser light to correct the nonuniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W resulting from the preheating from the halogen lamps HL. When a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> is preheated by the halogen lamps HL, the semiconductor wafer W shows a tendency to be lower in temperature in a peripheral portion thereof than in a central portion thereof. The irradiation of the peripheral portion with laser light from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> selectively heats the peripheral portion to achieve a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In particular, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the fifth preferred embodiment includes the reflective part <b>19</b> which further reflects the laser light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> and reflected from a local region of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W to cause the laser light to reach the local region. This causes the laser light reflected from the semiconductor wafer W to impinge upon the same region again, thereby allowing the reuse of the laser light. Thus, the efficiency of the use of the laser light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> is enhanced. As a result, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the fifth preferred embodiment is capable of heating the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W which tends to be lower in temperature than the central portion thereof with higher efficiency, thereby achieving a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Also, the light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> and reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W enters the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the reflective part <b>19</b> at an incidence angle of zero degrees. Thus, the light reflected from the reflective part <b>19</b> finally returns to the laser light emitting part <b>245</b>. This prevents the laser light reflected from the reflective part <b>19</b> from heating an unintended area within the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Also, the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> is rotated about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W in the fifth preferred embodiment, while the laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> disposed immediately under the center of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. Thus, the irradiation spot LP of the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> swirls around along the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W so as to draw a circular trajectory. As a result, the entire peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W at lowered temperature is uniformly heated. This achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W. It should be noted that, even when the irradiation spot LP of the laser light swirls around along the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W so as to draw a circular trajectory, the reflective part <b>19</b> which is in the form of an annular ring is capable of always reflecting the laser light reflected from the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W toward the peripheral portion of the lower surface.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present invention includes the three types of heat sources of light irradiation type. Specifically, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> includes the flash lamps FL which perform flash heating for the activation of impurities, the halogen lamps HL for preheating a semiconductor wafer W prior to the irradiation with flashes of light, and the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> which irradiates the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W with laser light. The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the fifth preferred embodiment further includes the reflective part <b>19</b> which further reflects the laser light reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W toward the peripheral portion thereof. The irradiation with the direct laser light from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> and with the reflected laser light from the reflective part <b>19</b> is performed to compensate for the decrease in temperature of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W which is inevitably caused when only the amount of light from the halogen lamps HL is adjusted. This improves the uniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W in the preheating stage to consequently finally achieve the uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W during the irradiation with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">&#x3c;Sixth Preferred Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Next, a sixth preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a view showing a configuration of the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> according to the sixth preferred embodiment. Like reference numerals and characters are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> to designate components identical with those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 19</figref>. The auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> according to the sixth preferred embodiment includes a cam mechanism similar to that of the second preferred embodiment in addition to the components of the fifth preferred embodiment. Specifically, the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> according to the sixth preferred embodiment includes the cam-follower <b>47</b> fixedly provided on the rotary motor <b>44</b>, and the cam <b>46</b> abutting against the cam-follower <b>47</b>. The configuration of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the sixth preferred embodiment is similar to that according to the fifth preferred embodiment except that the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> includes the cam mechanism. A procedure for the treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the sixth preferred embodiment is also generally similar to that according to the fifth preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The cam <b>46</b> is rotated by a rotary drive mechanism not shown, and the center of rotation of the cam <b>46</b> is eccentric. Thus, a distance from the center of rotation of the cam <b>46</b> to the point of contact between the cam-follower <b>47</b> and the cam <b>46</b> is periodically varied as the cam <b>46</b> is rotated. The rotation of the cam <b>46</b> moves the cam-follower <b>47</b> upwardly and downwardly to consequently move the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> reciprocatingly in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In the sixth preferred embodiment, the rotary motor <b>44</b> rotates the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W, while laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. At the same time, the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> rotated by the rotary motor <b>44</b> is moved reciprocatingly in a vertical direction by the cam <b>46</b> and the cam-follower <b>47</b>. The upward and downward movement of the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> which directs laser light obliquely upwardly causes the position reached by the laser light on the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W to move reciprocatingly in a radial direction. As a result, the irradiation spot LP of the laser light exiting the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> swirls around along the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W so as to draw a substantially circular trajectory, and also moves reciprocatingly in the radial direction of the semiconductor wafer W in a manner similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In other words, the irradiation spot LP of the laser light draws a substantially circular trajectory while meandering in the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W. The laser light reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W accordingly draws a substantially circular trajectory while meandering. It is hence preferable that the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the reflective part <b>19</b> has a width not less than the amplitude of the meandering of the reflected laser light.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">This allows the swirling trajectory of the irradiation spot LP of the laser light in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W to have a width, as compared with the fifth preferred embodiment. The irradiation spot LP of the laser light itself has a circular or elliptic shape having a diameter on the order of several millimeters. Reciprocatingly moving the irradiation spot LP in the radial direction of the semiconductor wafer W while swirling the same around along the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W allows the swirling trajectory to have a width increased to approximately tens of millimeters. Thus, when the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W where a relative temperature decrease has occurred due to the preheating using the halogen lamps HL has a large width, the entire peripheral portion is scanned uniformly with the irradiation spot LP of the laser light, so that the temperature of the entire peripheral portion is increased. This achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">&#x3c;Seventh Preferred Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Next, a seventh preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a view showing a reflective part according to the seventh preferred embodiment. Like reference numerals and characters are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> to designate components identical with those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Although the reflective part <b>19</b> according to the fifth and sixth preferred embodiments is a purpose-built member provided in the form of an annular ring and including the mirror surface <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the seventh preferred embodiment uses part of the inner wall surface of the chamber <b>6</b> as a reflective part <b>195</b>. More specifically, the lower corner of the recessed portion <b>62</b> constituting the side wall of the chamber <b>6</b> is used as the reflective part <b>195</b>. Since the recessed portion <b>62</b> is provided in the form of an annular ring so as to surround the holder <b>7</b>, the reflective part <b>195</b> according to the seventh preferred embodiment is also provided in the form of an annular ring under the outside of a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> as in the fifth preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In the seventh preferred embodiment, at least the lower corner of the recessed portion <b>62</b> provided in the inner side surface of the side wall of the chamber <b>6</b> and positioned under the outside of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> is mirror-finished by electrolytic polishing. Thus, the lower corner of the recessed portion <b>62</b> becomes the reflective part <b>195</b> including a first mirror surface <b>195</b><i>a </i>extending in a horizontal direction, and a second mirror surface <b>195</b><i>b </i>extending in a vertical direction. The remaining structure of the seventh preferred embodiment except the reflective part is similar to that of the fifth preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Also, the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> is rotated about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W in the seventh preferred embodiment, while the laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. The laser light directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> reaches the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>, and part of the laser light is reflected from the peripheral portion toward the reflective part <b>195</b>. In the seventh preferred embodiment, the laser light directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and reflected from the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W is further reflected from the reflective part <b>195</b>, and then reaches the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W again, as indicated by the arrow AR<b>15</b>. To be more precise, each of the first and second mirror surfaces <b>195</b><i>a </i>and <b>195</b><i>b </i>perpendicular to each other reflects the laser light once, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, whereby the reflective part <b>195</b> further reflects the laser light reflected from a local region of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W to cause the laser light to reach the local region. Although the susceptor <b>70</b> of the holder <b>7</b> is placed on the first mirror surface <b>195</b><i>a</i>, there is no apprehension that the susceptor <b>70</b> interrupts the laser light because the holder <b>7</b> including the susceptor <b>70</b> is entirely made of quartz.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In this manner, the direct light from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and the reflected light from the reflective part <b>195</b> impinge upon the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W to thereby raise the temperature of the irradiated region with higher efficiency. The configuration in the seventh preferred embodiment also causes the laser light reflected from the semiconductor wafer W to impinge upon the same region again, thereby allowing the reuse of the laser light. Thus, the efficiency of the use of the laser light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> is enhanced. As a result, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the seventh preferred embodiment is capable of heating the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W which tends to be lower in temperature than the central portion thereof with higher efficiency, thereby achieving a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W, as in the fifth preferred embodiment. Additionally, the seventh preferred embodiment, in which the purpose-built reflective part <b>19</b> is not provided, eliminates the need to provide the space for placement of the reflective part <b>19</b>, and also simplifies the configuration of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">&#x3c;Eighth Preferred Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Next, an eighth preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a view showing a reflective part according to the eighth preferred embodiment. Like reference numerals and characters are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> to designate components identical with those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In the eighth preferred embodiment, a reflective part <b>290</b> includes mirror surfaces <b>291</b> having a variable surface angle.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The reflective part <b>290</b> according to the eighth preferred embodiment is configured such that the multiple mirror surfaces <b>291</b> are arranged in the form of an annular ring under the outside of a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> (e.g., in the recessed portion <b>62</b>). Each of the mirror surfaces <b>291</b> is provided with an inclining mechanism <b>295</b> mounted thereto. The inclining mechanism <b>295</b> adjusts the surface angle of each of the mirror surfaces <b>291</b> (the angle formed by the normal to each of the mirror surfaces <b>291</b> and a vertical direction). Various known mechanisms having an angle adjusting capability may be used as the inclining mechanism <b>295</b>. The remaining structure of the eighth preferred embodiment except the reflective part <b>290</b> is similar to that of the fifth preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Also, the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> is rotated about the center line CX of the semiconductor wafer W in the eighth preferred embodiment, while the laser light is directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. The laser light directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> reaches the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b>, and part of the laser light is reflected from the peripheral portion toward the reflective part <b>290</b>. The laser light directed from the laser light emitting part <b>245</b> and reflected from the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W is further reflected from the mirror surfaces <b>291</b> of the reflective part <b>290</b>, and then reaches the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W again.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In the eighth preferred embodiment, the inclining mechanisms <b>295</b> are capable of varying the surface angle of the respective mirror surfaces <b>291</b>. On the other hand, the direction in which the laser light reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W travels toward the reflective part <b>290</b> is the same as that in the first preferred embodiment, and is fixed. Thus, the inclining mechanisms <b>295</b> vary the surface angle of the respective mirror surfaces <b>291</b> of the reflective part <b>290</b>, whereby the angle of incidence of the laser light reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W is varied. A change in angle of incidence entails a change in angle of reflection (i.e., the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) because regular reflection occurs at the mirror surfaces <b>291</b>. As a result, as indicated by the arrows AR<b>16</b> and AR<b>17</b>, the reflective part <b>290</b> is capable of changing the direction in which the laser light reflected from the mirror surfaces <b>291</b> travels, to adjust the position reached by the laser light on the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The configuration in the eighth preferred embodiment also causes the laser light reflected from the semiconductor wafer W to impinge upon the same region again, thereby allowing the reuse of the laser light. Thus, the efficiency of the use of the laser light directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>240</b> is enhanced. As a result, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the eighth preferred embodiment is capable of heating the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W which tends to be lower in temperature than the central portion thereof with higher efficiency, thereby achieving a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W, as in the fifth preferred embodiment. In particular, the inclining mechanisms <b>295</b> in the eighth preferred embodiment adjust the angle of incidence at which the laser light reflected from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W enters the mirror surfaces <b>291</b> of the reflective part <b>290</b>. This accordingly changes the angle of reflection. Thus, the reflective part <b>290</b> is capable of directing the reflected light onto any concentric region about the center line CX in the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W to heat the concentric region. This achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W with higher accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">&#x3c;Modifications&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">While the preferred embodiments according to the present invention have been described hereinabove, various modifications of the present invention in addition to those described above may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, although the cam mechanism is used to move the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> (or <b>245</b>) upwardly and downwardly in the second and sixth preferred embodiments described above, the present invention is not limited thereto. Other elevating drive mechanisms such as an air cylinder and an actuator may be used to move the laser light emitting part <b>45</b> reciprocatingly in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">An AOM (acoustic optical modulator) or a KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) may be used to allow laser light to pass therethrough for the scanning, in place of the galvanometer mirror <b>49</b> used to reflect laser light for the scanning of the back surface of a semiconductor wafer W. The AOM and the KDP are optical devices which are capable of bending the optical path of incident laser light upon application of voltage to emit the bent optical path, thereby scanning the back surface of a semiconductor wafer W with the irradiation spot LP of the laser light.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In summary, the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> used herein may be of the type which directs light onto a local region of a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> which is lower in temperature than other regions thereof to raise the temperature of the local region, thereby providing a uniform in-plane temperature distribution throughout the semiconductor wafer W. Laser light is directed onto the local region in the first to third preferred embodiments, whereas arc light is continuously directed onto the local region in the fourth preferred embodiment. The laser light emitting part <b>45</b> which directs laser light obliquely upwardly is rotated in the first and second preferred embodiments, whereby the laser light is directed onto the peripheral portion of a semiconductor wafer W where a relative temperature decrease has occurred. On the other hand, the galvanometer mirror <b>49</b> is used in the third preferred embodiment to scan a two-dimensional surface with laser light, whereby the laser light is directed onto the local region.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In place of the optical fiber <b>42</b> guiding the laser light emitted from the laser unit <b>41</b> toward the lens <b>43</b>, a collimating lens and a total reflection mirror may be used to guide the laser light emitted from the laser unit <b>41</b> toward the lens <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In the seventh preferred embodiment, the lower corner of the recessed portion <b>62</b> of the chamber <b>6</b> is mirror-finished by electrolytic polishing. Alternatively, the lower corner of the recessed portion <b>62</b> of the chamber <b>6</b> may be mirror-finished by a plating process to form the reflective part <b>195</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Also, the IGBT <b>96</b> is incorporated in the driving circuit for a flash lamp FL to chopper-control the current flowing through the flash lamp FL in the aforementioned preferred embodiments. The technique according to the present invention, however, may be applied to a driving circuit that does not include the IGBT <b>96</b>. Specifically, light is directed from the auxiliary irradiation part <b>40</b> onto a local region of the semiconductor wafer W which is relatively low in temperature in the preheating stage to raise the temperature of the local region, thereby improving the uniformity of the in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W. In that state, the semiconductor wafer W is irradiated with flashes of light in accordance with a single-pulse waveform such that the passage of current is not chopper-controlled. This also achieves a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W when the semiconductor wafer W is finally irradiated with flashes of light.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Although the IGBT <b>96</b> is used as a switching element in the aforementioned preferred embodiments, another transistor capable of turning ON and OFF the circuit in accordance with the signal level inputted to the gate thereof may be used in place of the IGBT <b>96</b>. It is, however, preferable to use an IGBT and a GTO (gate turn-off) thyristor which are suitable for handling high power as a switching device because the emission of light from the flash lamps FL consumes considerably high power.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The method of setting the waveform of the pulse signal is not limited to inputting the parameters including the pulse width and the like one by one from the input part <b>33</b>. For example, the setting of the waveform is done by an operator inputting the waveform directly in graphical form from the input part <b>33</b>, by reading the waveform previously set and stored in a storage part such as a magnetic disk and the like, or by downloading the waveform from outside the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Although the 30 flash lamps FL are provided in the flash heating part <b>5</b> according to the aforementioned preferred embodiments, the present invention is not limited to this. Any number of flash lamps FL may be provided. The flash lamps FL are not limited to the xenon flash lamps, but may be krypton flash lamps. Also, the number of halogen lamps HL provided in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> is not limited to 40. Any number of halogen lamps HL may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Also, in the aforementioned preferred embodiments, the semiconductor wafer W is preheated by irradiating the semiconductor wafer W with halogen light from the halogen lamps HL. The technique for preheating is not limited to this, but the semiconductor wafer W may be preheated by placing the semiconductor wafer W on a hot plate. The hot plate includes concentric zones which are individually temperature-controllable, and the problem of the temperature decrease in the peripheral portion of a semiconductor wafer W is solved by zone control. Thus, more pronounced effects are produced by the application of the technique according to the present invention to an apparatus that preheats a semiconductor wafer W by irradiation with light as in the aforementioned preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Moreover, a substrate to be processed or treated by the heat treatment apparatus according to the present invention is not limited to a semiconductor wafer, but may be a glass substrate for use in a flat panel display for a liquid crystal display apparatus, and a substrate for a solar cell. Also, the technique according to the present invention may be applied to the joining of metal and silicon, and to the crystallization of polysilicon.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">While the invention has been described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is understood that numerous other modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
