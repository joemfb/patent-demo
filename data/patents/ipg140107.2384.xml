<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0013340, filed on Feb. 15, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a battery module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A high-power battery module using a non-aqueous electrolyte with high energy density has recently been developed. The high-power battery module is configured as a large-capacity battery module manufactured by connecting a plurality of battery cells in series so as to be used in driving motors of devices requiring high power, e.g., electric vehicles and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A battery cell typically includes an electrolyte and an electrode assembly composed of a positive plate and a negative electrode plate, and generates energy through an electrochemical reaction of these electrode plates and the electrolyte. Gas may be generated as a side reaction of the electrochemical reaction in the interior of the battery cell, and the generated gas may change the external shape of the battery cell. Further, the change in the external shape of the battery cell has influence on the shape of a battery module formed by aligning a plurality of battery cells, and therefore, the battery cells may not be firmly fixed in the battery module. Accordingly, various types of battery modules have been developed to minimize a change in the external shape of battery cells and to enhance productivity of the battery modules.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments provide a battery module capable of improving reliability by strengthening a housing of the battery module. Embodiments also provide a battery module capable of minimizing the size and weight of the battery module by distributing the load of a plurality of battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A battery module including a plurality of battery cells stacked together; first and second end plates located at a first end and a second end, respectively, of the stacked battery cells; and side plates and a bottom plate coupled to the first and second end plates, wherein at least one of the first end plate and the second end plate has a bent support portion that overlaps with at least a portion of the bottom plate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the bent support portion extends from a bottom portion of the first or second end plate generally towards the battery cells and the bottom plate connects the first and second end plates to each other and is located between the first and second plates. Additionally, the first or second end plate may have a first fastening hole on a portion that contacts an end of the bottom plate, and wherein the bottom plate has a second fastening hole that is generally aligned with the first fastening hole. In one embodiment, the first and second fastening holes accommodate a fixing member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the first or second end plate includes a base plate contacting a peripheral one of the battery cells and at least one flange portion bent away from the battery cells from at least one of a side portion or a bottom portion of the base plate. Further, in one embodiment, the bottom plate contacts the base plates of the first and second end plates and is mounted on the bent support portions of at least one of the first end plate or the second end plate. The bent support portion may further include a third fastening hole through which a fastener extends to fix the bottom plate to the bent support portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the flange portions comprise at least two lower flange portions spaced from each other on the base plate, and wherein the bent support portion is located between the flange portions. A width of the bent support portion may be substantially identical to the base plate and at least a portion of the flange portion may be coupled to an end of the side plate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, according to embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to provide a battery module including a housing capable of firmly fixing a plurality of battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also, it is possible to provide a battery module capable of reducing the size and weight of the battery module by effectively distributing the load of a plurality of battery cells.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the first or second end plate <b>110</b> or <b>120</b> may include the bent support portions <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> that overlap with at least portions of the bottom plate <b>140</b>. The bottom plate <b>140</b> connects the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> to each other and is provided between the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Each end <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> of the bottom plate <b>140</b> contacts the base plates <b>113</b> and <b>123</b> of the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, the flange portions <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> may include at least two lower flange portions <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>, respectively, spaced from each other at the bottom portions of the base plates <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>. The bent support portions <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> may be provided between the lower flange portions <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Since the bottom plate <b>140</b> supports the load of the plurality battery cells <b>10</b>, it typically has a higher rigidity than the side plates <b>130</b> or the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. The fastening force between the bottom plate <b>140</b> and the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> is sufficient to support the load of the plurality of the battery cells <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the bent support portions <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> are provided on the respective first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> so that the bottom plate <b>140</b> can distribute the load of the battery cells <b>10</b> concentrated on the bottom plate <b>140</b> to the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Since stress applied to portions at which the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are fastened to the bottom plate <b>140</b> can be distributed, it is possible to improve the stability of the battery module <b>100</b> against an external impact such as a vibration or impact.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Generally, the bottom plate <b>140</b> is made of a material such as SUS with high rigidity to support the load concentrated on the bottom plate <b>140</b>. However, the battery module <b>100</b> according to this embodiment is not limited thereto. For example, in the battery module <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the bottom plate <b>140</b> may be made of plastic or the like, which has relatively low rigidity. The bottom plate <b>140</b> made of a plastic resin material has a lower rigidity than the SUS or the like, but minimizes the weight and size of the battery module and has plasticity, and thus the design of the battery module can be more easily modified. Further, the plastic resin bottom plate <b>140</b> has excellent insulation properties, and thus the stability of the battery module can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bottom plate <b>140</b> may be provided to contact the base plates <b>113</b> and <b>123</b> of the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> and to be mounted on the bent support portions <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> of the first and second plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. The first or second end plate <b>110</b> or <b>120</b> is provided with a first fastening hole <b>113</b><i>a </i>or <b>123</b><i>a </i>at a portion that contacts the one or the other end <b>141</b> or <b>142</b> of the bottom plate <b>140</b>. The bottom plate <b>140</b> may have a second fastening hole <b>141</b><i>a </i>or <b>142</b><i>a </i>generally corresponding to the first fastening hole <b>113</b><i>a </i>or <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first and second fastening holes <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>123</b><i>a</i>, <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>a </i>are provided so that corresponding first and second fastening holes are aligned with each other. The first and second fastening holes <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>123</b><i>a</i>, <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>a </i><b>30</b> receive fixing members <b>30</b> to improve the fastening force between the bottom plate <b>140</b> and the first and second end plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. For example, the fixing member <b>30</b> may include a bolt or stud.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Since the first and second fastening holes <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>123</b><i>a</i>, <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>a </i>are fastened to be generally perpendicular to the load of the battery cells <b>10</b> which is concentrated on the bottom plate <b>140</b>, the load of the battery cells <b>10</b> can be distributed.</p>
