<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a touch panel including a photo sensor and a driving method thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to a touch panel including a plurality of pixels each of which is provided with a photo sensor and relates to a driving method thereof. Further, the invention relates to electronic devices including the touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, a display device provided with a touch sensor has attracted attention. The display device provided with the touch sensor is called a touch panel a touch screen, and the like (hereinafter simply referred to as a &#x201c;touch panel&#x201d;). Examples of the touch sensor include a resistive touch sensor, a capacitance touch sensor, and an optical touch sensor, depending on its operation principle. In any of the sensors, when an object to be detected is in contact with a display device or in the vicinity of the display device, data can be input.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By providing of a sensor (also referred to as a &#x201c;photo sensor&#x201d;) that detects light as an optical touch sensor for a touch panel, a display screen serves as an input region. As an example of a device including such an optical touch sensor, a display device having an image capturing function, which is provided with a contact type area sensor that captures an image, is given (e.g., see Patent Document 1). In the case of a touch panel including an optical touch sensor, light is emitted from a touch panel. In the case where an object to be detected exists at an arbitrary position of the touch panel, light at the region where the object to be detected exists is blocked by the object to be detected, and part of light is reflected. A photo sensor (also referred to as a &#x201c;photoelectric conversion element&#x201d;) which can detect light is provided in a pixel of the touch panel, and the photo sensor detects the reflected light, so that the existence of the object to be detected in the region where light is detected can be recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, providing a personal authentication function or the like for an electronic device such as a mobile phone or a portable information terminal has been attempted (e.g., see Patent Document 2). A fingerprint, a face, a handprint, a palm print, a pattern of a hand vein, and the like are used for personal authentication. In the case where a portion different from the display portion has a personal authentication function, the number of components increases, and the weight or price of the electronic device could possibly increase.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, in touch sensor systems, a technique for selecting an image processing method by which the position of a finger-tip is detected in accordance with brightness of external light has been known (e.g., see Patent Document 3).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, since embodiments described below can be embodied in many different modes, it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that the mode and the detail can be variously changed without departing from the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the description of the embodiments below. In the drawings for describing the embodiments, the same parts or parts having a similar function are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description of such parts is not repeated.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">In this embodiment, a structure of a touch panel in one embodiment of the present invention and a driving method thereof are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">An example of a structure of a touch panel is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A touch panel <b>100</b> includes a pixel circuit <b>101</b>, a display element control circuit <b>102</b>, and a photo sensor control circuit <b>103</b>. The pixel circuit <b>101</b> includes a plurality of pixels <b>104</b> arranged in a matrix of rows and columns. Each of the pixels <b>104</b> includes a display element <b>105</b> and a photo sensor <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">Each of the display elements <b>105</b> includes a thin film transistor (TFT), a storage capacitor, a liquid crystal element including a liquid crystal layer, and the like. The thin film transistor has a function of controlling injection or ejection of charge to/from the storage capacitor. The storage capacitor has a function of holding charge which corresponds to voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer. Utilizing the change in the direction of a polarization due to a voltage application to the liquid crystal layer, tone of light passing through the liquid crystal layer is made (gray scale display is performed), so that image display is realized. Light that a light source (a backlight) emits from the rear side of a liquid crystal display device is used as the light passing through the liquid crystal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">Note that methods of displaying color images include a method in which a color filter is used, that is, a color filter method. This method makes it possible to perform the gray scale display of a particular color (e.g., red (R), green (G), or blue (B)) when light that has passed through the liquid crystal layer passes through a color filter.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">Methods of displaying color images also include a method in which respective light sources of particular colors (e.g., red (R), green (G), and blue (B)) are used as a backlight, and are sequentially lit, that is, a field-sequential method. In the field-sequential method, the gray scale display of each of the colors can be performed by making the tone of light passing through the liquid crystal layer while the light source thereof is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">The case where the display elements <b>105</b> include liquid crystal elements is described above; however, other elements such as light emitting elements may be included as the display elements <b>105</b>. The light emitting element is an element in which the luminance is controlled by current or voltage. Specifically, light emitting diode, organic light emitting diode (OLED), and the like are given.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The photo sensors <b>106</b> each include an element such as a photodiode, which has a function of generating an electrical signal when receiving light, and a thin film transistor. Note that as light which is received by the photo sensors <b>106</b>, reflected light obtained when light from a backlight is delivered to an object to be detected is used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The display element control circuit <b>102</b> controls the display elements <b>105</b> and includes a display element driver circuit <b>107</b> (also referred to as a signal line driver circuit for display elements <b>107</b>) and a display element driver circuit <b>108</b> (also referred to as a scan line driver circuit for display elements <b>108</b>). The display element driver circuit <b>107</b> inputs a signal to the display elements <b>105</b> through signal lines (also referred to as &#x201c;source signal lines&#x201d;) such as video data signal lines. The display element driver circuit <b>108</b> inputs a signal to the display elements <b>105</b> through scanning lines (also referred to as &#x201c;gate signal lines&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">For example, the scan line driver circuit for display elements <b>108</b> has a function of selecting display elements <b>105</b> included in the pixels <b>104</b> placed in a particular row. Further, the signal line driver circuit for display elements <b>107</b> has a function of giving a predetermined potential to the display elements <b>105</b> included in the pixels <b>104</b> placed in the selected row. Note that in the pixels to which the scan line driver circuit for display elements <b>108</b> gives a high potential, the thin film transistors are brought into conduction and charges given by the signal line driver circuit for display elements <b>107</b> are supplied to the display elements.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The photo sensor control circuit <b>103</b> controls the photo sensor <b>106</b> and includes a photo sensor readout circuit <b>109</b> connected to a photo sensor output signal line and a photo sensor reference signal line, and a photo sensor driver circuit <b>110</b>. The photo sensor driver circuit <b>110</b> has a function of performing reset operation and selecting operation on the photo sensors <b>106</b> included in the pixels <b>104</b> placed in a particular row, which are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">Further, the photo sensor readout circuit <b>109</b> has a function of taking out output signals of the photo sensors <b>106</b> included in the pixels <b>104</b> in the selected row. Note that the photo sensor readout circuit <b>109</b> can have a system in which an output, which is an analog signal, of the photo sensor <b>106</b> is extracted as an analog signal to the outside of the touch panel by an OP amplifier; or a system in which the output is converted into a digital signal by an A/D converter circuit and then extracted to the outside of the touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">An example of a circuit diagram of the pixel <b>104</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The pixel <b>104</b> includes the display element <b>105</b> including a transistor <b>201</b>, a storage capacitor <b>202</b>, and a liquid crystal element <b>203</b>, and the photo sensor <b>106</b> including a photodiode <b>204</b>, a transistor <b>205</b>, and a transistor <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">A gate of the transistor <b>201</b> is electrically connected to a gate signal line <b>207</b>, one of a source and a drain of the transistor <b>201</b> is electrically connected to a video data signal line <b>210</b>, and the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>201</b> is electrically connected to one electrode of the storage capacitor <b>202</b> and one electrode of the liquid crystal element <b>203</b>. The other electrode of the storage capacitor <b>202</b> and the other electrode of the liquid crystal element <b>203</b> are each held at a certain potential. The liquid crystal element <b>203</b> is an element including a pair of electrodes and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the pair of electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">When a potential at a high level &#x201c;H&#x201d; is applied to the gate signal line <b>207</b>, the transistor <b>201</b> applies the potential of the video data signal line <b>210</b> to the storage capacitor <b>202</b> and the liquid crystal element <b>203</b>. The storage capacitor <b>202</b> holds the applied potential. The liquid crystal element <b>203</b> changes light transmittance in accordance with the applied potential.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">One electrode of the photodiode <b>204</b> is electrically connected to a photodiode reset signal line <b>208</b>, and the other electrode of the photodiode <b>204</b> is electrically connected to a gate of the transistor <b>205</b> through a gate signal line <b>213</b>. One of a source and a drain of the transistor <b>205</b> is electrically connected to a photo sensor reference signal line <b>212</b>, and the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>205</b> is electrically connected to one of a source and a drain of the transistor <b>206</b>.

<p id="p-0079" num="0080">In this embodiment, a structure of a touch panel in one embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of a cross-sectional view of the touch panel. In the touch panel illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a photodiode <b>502</b>, a transistor <b>503</b>, a storage capacitor <b>504</b>, and a liquid crystal element <b>505</b> are formed over a substrate <b>501</b> (a TFT substrate) having an insulating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">The photodiode <b>502</b> and the storage capacitor <b>504</b> can be formed concurrently with the transistor <b>503</b> in a manufacturing process of the transistor <b>503</b>. The photodiode <b>502</b> is a lateral-junction pin diode. A semiconductor film <b>506</b> included in the photo diode <b>502</b> has a region having p-type conductivity (a p-type layer), a region having i-type conductivity (an i-type layer), and a region having n-type conductivity (an n-type layer). Note that although the touch panel in which the photodiode <b>502</b> is a pin diode is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the photodiode <b>502</b> may be a pn diode. Lateral pin junction or lateral pn junction can be formed by adding an impurity element imparting p-type conductivity and an impurity element imparting n-type conductivity to respective particular regions in the semiconductor film <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">In addition, by processing (patterning) one semiconductor film formed over the substrate <b>501</b> into a desired shape by etching or the like, an island-like semiconductor film of the photodiode <b>502</b> can be formed together with an island-like semiconductor film of the transistor <b>503</b>. As a result, cost can be reduced because a process for forming part of the photodiode does not need to be added to a normal process for forming a panel in which pixels including transistors and the like are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">The liquid crystal element <b>505</b> includes a pixel electrode <b>507</b>, liquid crystal <b>508</b>, and a counter electrode <b>509</b>. The pixel electrode <b>507</b> is formed over the substrate <b>501</b> and is electrically connected to the transistor <b>503</b> through the storage capacitor <b>504</b> and a conductive film <b>510</b>. In addition, the counter electrode <b>509</b> is formed on the substrate <b>513</b> (a counter substrate) and the liquid crystal <b>508</b> is interposed between the pixel electrode <b>507</b> and the counter electrode <b>509</b>. Note that although a transistor used for a photo sensor is not illustrated in the touch panel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the transistor can be formed over the substrate <b>501</b> together with the transistor <b>503</b> in the manufacturing process for the transistor <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">A cell gap between the pixel electrode <b>507</b> and the counter electrode <b>509</b> can be controlled by using a spacer <b>516</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cell gap is controlled by using the columnar spacer <b>516</b> selectively formed by photolithography. Alternatively, the cell gap can be controlled by dispersing spherical spacers between the pixel electrode <b>507</b> and the counter electrode <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">In addition, the liquid crystal <b>508</b> is surrounded by a sealing material between the substrate <b>501</b> and the substrate <b>513</b>. The liquid crystal <b>508</b> may be injected by a dispenser method (droplet method) or a dipping method (pumping method).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">For the pixel electrode <b>507</b>, a light-transmitting conductive material such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium tin oxide containing silicon oxide (ITSO), organic indium, organic tin, indium zinc oxide (IZO) containing zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc oxide containing gallium (Ga), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), indium oxide containing tungsten oxide, indium zinc oxide containing tungsten oxide, indium oxide containing titanium oxide, indium tin oxide containing titanium oxide, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">In addition, since the transparent liquid crystal element <b>505</b> is given as an example in this embodiment, the above-described light-transmitting conductive material can be used also for the counter electrode <b>509</b> as in the case of the pixel electrode <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">An alignment film <b>511</b> is provided between the pixel electrode <b>507</b> and the liquid crystal <b>508</b>, and an alignment film <b>512</b> is provided between the counter electrode <b>509</b> and the liquid crystal <b>508</b>. The alignment film <b>511</b> and the alignment film <b>512</b> can be formed using an organic resin such as polyimide or polyvinyl alcohol. An alignment treatment such as rubbing is performed on their surfaces in order to align liquid crystal molecules in certain direction. Rubbing can be performed by rolling a roller wrapped with cloth of nylon or the like while applying pressure on the alignment film so that the surface of the alignment film is rubbed in certain direction. Note that by using an inorganic material such as silicon oxide, the alignment film <b>511</b> and the alignment film <b>512</b> each having an alignment property can be directly formed by evaporation method without performing an alignment treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">Further, a color filter <b>514</b> through which light in a particular wavelength range can pass is formed over the substrate <b>513</b> so as to overlap with the liquid crystal element <b>505</b>. The color filter <b>514</b> can be selectively formed by photolithography after application of an organic resin such as an acrylic-based resin in which colorant is dispersed on the substrate <b>513</b>. Alternatively, the color filter <b>514</b> can be selectively formed by etching after application of a polyimide-based resin in which colorant is dispersed on the substrate <b>513</b>. Alternatively, the color filter <b>514</b> can be selectively formed by a droplet discharge method such as an ink jet method.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">Furthermore, a shielding film <b>515</b> which can block light is formed over the substrate <b>513</b> so as to overlap with the photodiode <b>502</b>. By providing the shielding film <b>515</b>, light from a backlight that passes through the substrate <b>513</b> and enters the touch panel can be prevented from being directly delivered to the photodiode <b>502</b>. Further, disclination due to disorder of alignment of the liquid crystal <b>508</b> among pixels can be prevented from being viewed. An organic resin containing black colorant such as carbon black or titanium lower oxide in which the number of oxides is smaller than that of titanium dioxide can be used for the shielding film <b>515</b>. Alternatively, a film formed using chromium can be used for the shielding film <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">Furthermore, a polarizing plate <b>517</b> is provided on a surface which is the opposite side of a surface of the substrate <b>501</b> over which the pixel electrode <b>507</b> is formed, and a polarizing plate <b>518</b> is provided on a surface which is the opposite side of a surface of the substrate <b>513</b> on which the counter electrode <b>509</b> is formed.</p>

In the touch panel illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a photodiode <b>602</b> differs from a photodiode <b>502</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in having a shielding film <b>603</b> formed using a conductive film that is used for a gate electrode of a transistor <b>503</b>. By providing the shielding film <b>603</b> in the photodiode <b>602</b>, light from the backlight can be prevented from directly entering a region that has i-type conductivity (an i-type layer), and only light reflected by the object to be detected <b>521</b> can be efficiently detected.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">In addition, in the case where the photodiode <b>602</b> serves as a lateral pin diode, a region that has p-type conductivity (a p-type layer) and a region that has n-type conductivity (an n-type layer) can be formed in a self-aligned manner by using the shielding film <b>603</b> as a mask.

<p id="p-0101" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example of a perspective view showing the structure of a liquid crystal display device including the touch panel in one embodiment of the present invention.

Thus, the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b> is uniformly irradiated with light from the counter substrate side (the side on which the light guide plate <b>1605</b> and the like are provided).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">Although the first diffusing plate <b>1602</b> and the second diffusing plate <b>1604</b> are used in this embodiment, the number of diffusing plates is not limited thereto. The number of diffusing plates may be one, or may be three or more. It is acceptable as long as the diffusing plate is provided between the light guide plate <b>1605</b> and the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b>. Therefore, a diffusing plate may be provided only on the side closer to the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b> than the prism sheet <b>1603</b>, or may be provided only on the side closer to the light guide plate <b>1605</b> than the prism sheet <b>1603</b>.</p>

However, the above control circuits may be formed in the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b>; in this case, the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b> and the light sources <b>1607</b> are connected via an FPC or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of an edge-light type light source in which the light sources <b>1607</b> are disposed in an end portion of the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b>, a touch panel in one embodiment of the present invention may be a direct type that includes the light sources <b>1607</b> disposed directly below the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">For example, when a finger <b>1612</b>, which is an object to be detected, becomes close to the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b> from the TFT substrate side (the side over the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b>, which is opposite to the backlight <b>1608</b>), light from the backlight <b>1608</b> passes through the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b>, and part of the light reflected by the finger <b>1612</b> and enters the liquid crystal panel <b>1601</b> again.
