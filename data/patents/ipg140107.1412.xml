<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bicycle brake light controlling assembly, and more particularly to a bicycle brake light controlling assembly that quickly and conveniently activates a flash light with one act.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional bicycle brake light controlling assembly has a lamp device and a controller device. The lamp device is mounted securely on a seat bracket of a bicycle and has a brake light. The controller device is mounted securely on a handle bar of the bicycle, is electrically connected with the lamp device and has a brake button. When the brake button is pressed, the brake light flashes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a bicycle rider has to press both of the brake button and a brake lever when the rider wants to brake. Two acts of pressing are required and this is inconvenient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention tends to provide a bicycle brake light controlling assembly to mitigate the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The main objective of the invention is to provide a bicycle brake light controlling assembly that quickly and conveniently activates a flash light with one act.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A bicycle brake light controlling assembly has a lamp device, a controller device and a trigger device. The lamp device has a brake light and a wireless receiving unit. The controller device is capable of wirelessly emitting a controlling signal to the lamp device and has a wireless emitting unit. The trigger device is electrically connected with the controller device and is capable of being mounted securely on a brake lever of a bicycle. When the brake lever is pressed, the trigger device is simultaneously pressed and the brake light spontaneously flashes. With a single act of pressing, the brake light is activated and this is convenient for a user.</p>
