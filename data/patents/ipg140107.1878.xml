<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Degenerative changes of the spinal column are the most common underlying cause of chronic back pain. The peak incidence of symptoms occurs between the ages of 30 and 50, a period of life during which the most strenuous job and sports-related activities occur. As individuals age, degenerative changes accumulate, affecting the vertebral discs, vertebra, facet joints, and ligaments in the thoracic and lumbar region and can lead to compression of spinal nerves and spinal nerve roots.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It can be desirable to reduce the compression of spinal nerves and spinal nerves by stabilizing the spinal column. The spinal column can be stabilized by isolating spinal motion segment and restricting relative motion between adjacent vertebrae. Alternatively, when conservative treatment fails to control the pain of degenerative disc disease, stenosis and spondylolisthesis, a common surgical approach is spinal fusion; over 200,000 spinal fusions are performed each year. The disc and other material that may be compressing nerve roots are removed and the vertebrae superior and inferior to the removed disc are fused. During the fusion process it is also desirable to restrict relative motion between vertebrae undergoing fusion while bone grows and fusion is complete.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following description is of the best modes presently contemplated for practicing various embodiments of the present invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the invention. The scope of the invention should be ascertained with reference to the claims. In the description of the invention that follows, like numerals or reference designators will be used to refer to like parts or elements throughout. In addition, the first digit of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears. Reference numerals used in a drawing may or may not be referenced in the detailed description specific to such drawing if the associated element is described elsewhere. Further, the terms &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; are used throughout the detailed description to describe general orientation of structures relative to the spine of a human patient that is standing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The disclosed systems and methods of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods to stabilize a spinal column. In an embodiment of an invention, a spinolaminar locking plate includes a pre-contoured anatomical plate utilizing locking screws for posterior stabilization of the thoracolumbar spine. The disclosed systems and methods of the present invention may also be used with systems and methods to restrict relative motion of vertebral segments for example to assist in spinal fusion procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective posterior view of an embodiment of an anchoring plate <b>101</b> for use in a system and method to stabilize a spinal column in accordance with the present invention. The anchoring plate <b>101</b> has a shape that is generally conformal with the outer surface of the targeted vertebra and generally spans the surface of the lamina (obscured by the anchoring plate <b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) from near a location where the pedicle <b>14</b> joins the lamina to a location near where the lamina joins the spinous process <b>2</b>. Optionally, the anchoring plate <b>101</b> can extend to the inferior articular process <b>8</b> of the targeted vertebra. The shape of the anchoring plate <b>101</b> allows the anchoring plate <b>101</b> to span multiple structures of the vertebra while being generally confined to the surface of the vertebra. The shape of the anchoring plate <b>101</b> further allows the anchoring plate <b>101</b> to be secured to the structures so that a load applied to the anchoring plate <b>101</b> during extension motion and flexion motion of the spinal column is distributed across the multiple structures to reduce a concentration of compressive or tensile force. Reducing compressive or tensile force can be particularly useful where the bone of one or more of the structures has degenerated or otherwise been weakened, for example in osteoporotic patients. The anchoring plate <b>101</b> includes a mounting bracket <b>104</b> extending therefrom. The mounting bracket <b>104</b> in the embodiment extends about perpendicular to the anchoring plate <b>101</b> and is fixed relative to the anchoring plate <b>101</b>. In the embodiment the mounting bracket <b>104</b> extends from the superior (cranial) end of the anchoring plate <b>101</b>. In other embodiments the bracket can extend from the inferior (caudal) end of the anchoring plate <b>101</b>. Still alternatively, the mounting bracket <b>104</b> can extend from any position on the upper surface <b>109</b> of the anchoring plate <b>101</b>. Additionally the mounting bracket <b>104</b> can mounted so that it may move such as by rotation relative to the anchoring plate <b>101</b>. As shown, the anchoring plate <b>101</b> is positioned to be secured to the vertebra at structures to the right of the spinous process <b>2</b>; however, as described in more detail below, additional or alternative implantation sites can be located at structures to the left of the spinous process <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a detailed view of the anchoring plate <b>101</b> is shown. The anchoring plate <b>101</b> includes multiple through-holes for receiving bone screws to secure the anchoring plate to multiple structures. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> (which includes through-holes that vary slightly in arrangement from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) there are four through-holes <b>110</b> exposing the spinous process <b>2</b> at or above where the lamina joins the spinous process (i.e., the spinolaminar junction), two through-holes <b>112</b> exposing the lamina, a through-hole <b>114</b> exposing a location where the lamina joins the pedicle, and a through-hole <b>116</b> exposing the facet joint where the inferior articular process <b>8</b> mates with the superior articular process <b>16</b> of a vertebra below the targeted vertebra along the spinal column. The through-holes <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> extend through the anchoring plate <b>101</b> at angles appropriate to direct a bone screw to the respective structures so that a shank of a bone screw is oriented at a desired angle relative to the sagittal plane. The bone screw is directed to penetrate and seat within the structure in a predictable fashion. Predictability of implantation reduces the opportunity for damage, for example by reducing the opportunity to penetrate the vertebral foramen and damage nerves when driving a pedicle screw into the pedicle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In preferred embodiments, the through-holes can be threaded so as to engage the threads of the shank and further restrict the range of angles at which the bone screw penetrates and seats within the structure, increasing the precision of the trajectory of the bone screw as it seats within the bone. Optionally, one or more of the bone screws can be a locking screw that includes a threaded head to resist backing out of a seated position in the through-holes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-section of a locking screw <b>222</b> partially seated at the lamina. The threads of the shank <b>234</b> engage complementary threads of the through-hole <b>112</b>. A portion of the through-hole <b>112</b> includes an expanded diameter that complements finely pitched threads of the head <b>232</b> of the locking screw <b>222</b>. As the locking screw <b>222</b> seats within the bone of the lamina, the threads of the head <b>232</b> engage the threads of the expanded diameter of the through-hole <b>112</b> so that the locking screw <b>222</b> resists backing out of the bone. The locking screw <b>222</b> can be particularly useful where the bone stock at an implantation site has degenerated or is otherwise of poor quality.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As will be appreciated, the angle of orientation of the shanks of the different bone screws relative to the sagittal plane vary and/or the range of angles of orientation of the shanks of the first, second, and third screws relative to the sagittal plane do not overlap. The splayed arrangement of the bone screw shanks provides improved resistance to pull-out force, thereby, reducing or eliminating the need to notch or remove portions of the bone and/or provide additional hooks or grafted structures.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inferior articular process <b>8</b> of the targeted vertebra and the superior articular process <b>16</b> of the vertebra directly below the targeted vertebra along the spinal column mate at the facet joint to guide and limit movement of the spinal motion segment. In the lumbar region, for example, the facet joint prevents rotation in the transverse plane, while allowing sagittal rotation (flexion and extension) and a small amount of frontal rotation (lateral bending). A through-hole <b>116</b> of the anchoring plate <b>101</b> can direct a facet screw so that the facet screw penetrates and seats within both the superior and inferior facets, restricting all movement at the facet joint to further stabilize the spinal column. Placement of locking facet screws can enhance facet fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an oblique view of the anchor plate <b>101</b> illustrating a mounting bracket <b>104</b> that extends from the anchoring plate (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but removed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). The mounting bracket <b>104</b> can be fixedly connected with the anchoring plate <b>110</b>, or alternatively the mounting bracket <b>104</b> can be removably attached to the anchoring plate <b>110</b>, for example by way of a screw thread that engages threads of a mount point on the anchoring plate <b>110</b>. Additionally an anchoring plate <b>101</b> can have multiple mounting points, so that the bracket can be selectively located in various positions on the anchoring plate. Further with multiple mounting points, multiple brackets can be mounted on one anchoring plate. By including a mount point separated from the mounting bracket <b>104</b>, the surgeon can select a mounting bracket <b>104</b> appropriate for the procedure. For example, if the procedure isolates multiple spinal motion segments, a surgeon can choose to connect a mounting bracket for the middle vertebra that is adapted to grip a single rod spanning all three vertebrae, or the surgeon can choose a mounting bracket for the middle vertebra that is adapted to grip two rods independently, each rod spanning two adjacent vertebrae. As shown, the mounting bracket <b>104</b> includes a polyaxial head resembling the head of a polyaxial screw. Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a rod positioned within the saddle of the mounting bracket can be held in place by a locking set screw mated with threads of the polyaxial head. In other embodiments, the mounting bracket <b>104</b> can be some other structure, such as a clamp. One of ordinary skill in the art upon reflecting on the teachings providing herein will appreciate the myriad different techniques and geometries with which mounting brackets for gripping a rod can applied to secure the rod to the anchoring plate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an oblique view of an embodiment of a system <b>400</b> to stabilize a spinal column in accordance with the present invention by restricting relative motion at a spinal motion segment. The system includes a first anchoring plate <b>401</b> and second anchoring plate <b>402</b> each resembling the anchor plates <b>101</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The anchoring plates <b>401</b>, <b>402</b> are pre-contoured to generally conform to the outer surface of the corresponding targeted vertebra and generally span the surface of the lamina. Generally speaking, anatomic shapes of vertebrae vary by level, between the sexes and between adolescents and adults. Pre-contoured adapter plates can be designed and shaped for all seventeen thoracolumbar vertebrae, for four categories (adult male, adolescent male, adult female, adolescent female). Alternatively, anchoring plates can be customized based on a given patient's anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown, the anchoring plates <b>401</b>, <b>402</b> include four threaded holes to guide bone screws <b>420</b> into the base of the spinous process, at or above the spinolaminar junction, a threaded hole to guide a bone screw <b>422</b> into the lamina, a threaded hole to guide a pedicle screw <b>424</b> into the pedicle and a threaded hole to guide a bone screw <b>426</b> into the lamina and/or inferior articular process. It is noted that in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the anchoring plate <b>401</b> is not shaped to direct a bone screw through a facet joint. Mounting brackets <b>404</b> extend from the anchoring plates <b>401</b>, <b>402</b> and rigidly secure a rod <b>406</b> between the mounting brackets <b>404</b> using locking set screws <b>408</b>, preventing relative motion between the adjacent vertebrae. Where desired, additional adjacent spinal motion segments can be stabilized by rigidly connecting three or more levels of vertebrae. As described above a single rod can span multiple levels, or each spinal motion segment can be isolated with separate rods.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate alternative embodiments of anchor plates in accordance with the present invention. The anchor plate <b>501</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes curved guides <b>540</b> that follow the rounded contour of the edges of the lamina, approaching or abutting the ligamenta flava. The curved guides <b>540</b> act as registration features and allow the surgeon to precisely position the anchoring plate <b>501</b> during implantation to provide addition precision when implanting bone screws. The anchor plate <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes hooks <b>640</b> that pierce and/or distract and/or curve around the ligamenta flava to also act as registration features to allow the surgeon to precisely position the anchoring plate <b>601</b> during implantation with very little movement of the anchoring plate <b>601</b> to provide addition precision when implanting bone screws.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate a further embodiment of an anchoring plate <b>701</b> in accordance with the present invention having a generally triangular shape and comprising three threaded holes <b>710</b>, <b>714</b>, <b>716</b> for securing the anchoring plate <b>701</b> to a targeted vertebra and a center threaded hole for receiving a mounting bracket (not shown). The anchoring plate <b>701</b> is shaped to be secured to structures of the vertebra generally to the right of the spinous process <b>2</b>. As shown, the anchoring plate <b>701</b> can have a typical thickness of about 3.5 mm. Phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrate the trajectory to which bone screws will be guided by threaded holes <b>710</b>, <b>714</b>, <b>716</b> of the anchoring plate <b>701</b>. A first threaded hole <b>710</b> is formed to guide a bone screw into the base of the spinous process <b>2</b> roughly at a junction of the lamina (obscured by the anchoring plate) and spinous process <b>2</b>. A second threaded hole <b>716</b> is formed to guide a bone screw into the inferior articular process <b>8</b> of the targeted vertebra and optionally into the superior articular process of a vertebra inferior to the targeted vertebra (not shown). A third threaded hole <b>714</b> is formed to guide a bone screw into the pedicle <b>14</b> of the targeted vertebra. Before, during or after the anchoring plate <b>701</b> has been secured, a mounting bracket (not shown) can be mated with the anchoring plate at a mounting point <b>718</b>. The mounting bracket can include, for example, a polyaxial head, a rotatable head, or some other structure for securing a rod.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is noted that, the anchoring plate <b>701</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> includes fewer threaded holes relative to previously described embodiments, overlapping a reduced surface area of the targeted vertebra. As will be appreciated, an anchoring plate can be selected by a surgeon in accordance with the patient's needs. For example, if a patient is osteoporotic or otherwise has poor bone purchase across the targeted vertebral structures, a surgeon may desire to select an anchoring plate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. Still further, the surgeon may decide not to fuse the spinal motion segment at the facet joint, thereby selecting an anchoring plate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A patient may have generally healthy bone structure; therefore a surgeon may desire to select an anchoring plate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Further, a surgeon can combine different sizes and/or shapes where multiple anchoring plates are used to isolate one or more spinal motion segments. One of ordinary skill in the art, upon reflecting on the teachings contained herein, will appreciate the myriad different shapes and sizes of anchoring plates in accordance with the present invention and/or techniques for selecting appropriate anchoring plates for use in embodiments of method to stabilize a spinal column in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a triangular shaped anchoring plate <b>901</b> similar to the anchoring plate <b>701</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, partially rotated to illustrate curvature of the anchoring plate generally conforming with the curvature of the spinolaminar junction of the targeted vertebra. Bone screws <b>920</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>926</b> are shown seated within threaded holes of the anchoring plate <b>901</b>. The angle of orientation of the shanks of the bone screws <b>920</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>926</b> relative to the sagittal plane (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) vary and/or the range of angles of orientation of the shanks of the first, second, and third screws relative to the sagittal plane do not overlap. As noted above, the splayed configuration of the bone screws distribute loads applied to a mounting bracket mated with the anchoring plate <b>901</b> at a mounting point <b>918</b> across selected structures of the targeted vertebra.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a triangular shaped anchoring plate <b>1001</b> similar to the anchoring plate <b>901</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, illustrating more aggressive curvature of the anchoring plate generally conforming with the curvature of the spinolaminar junction of the targeted vertebra. The anchoring plate <b>1001</b> includes threaded holes <b>1010</b>, <b>1014</b>, <b>1016</b> adapted to guide bone screws along trajectories to the structures describe above. As above, the anchoring plate <b>1001</b> includes a mounting point <b>1018</b>, although in other embodiments a mounting bracket (not shown) can be fixedly attached to the anchoring plate or integrally formed with the anchoring plate. As will be appreciated, the shape of the anchoring plate can be made conformal with an outer surface of the targeted vertebra based on myriad different variables, for example the level of the vertebra targeted, the sex of the patient, or alternatively the specific anatomical shape of the targeted vertebra based on imaging (i.e., customized).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention comprising four anchoring plates <b>1101</b>, <b>1102</b>, <b>1151</b>, <b>1152</b> for resisting relative motion at a spinal motion segment is shown. The anchoring plates <b>1101</b>, <b>1102</b>, <b>1151</b>, <b>1152</b> are each secured to structures of the respective targeted vertebras as described above (e.g., the spinous process <b>2</b>, the inferior articular process <b>8</b>, and the pedicle <b>14</b>). Relative motion is resisted by mounting a right rod <b>1106</b> between two anchoring plates <b>1101</b>, <b>1102</b> secured along the right side of the targeted vertebrae and mounting a left rod <b>1156</b> between two anchoring plates <b>1151</b>, <b>1152</b> secured along the left side of the targeted vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> illustrate further embodiments of anchoring plates <b>1201</b>, <b>1301</b> for use in a system to stabilize a spinal column in accordance with the present invention. The anchoring plate <b>1201</b>, <b>1301</b> are shaped such that they resemble a butterfly with threaded holes <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1264</b>, <b>1266</b> exposing portions of the target vertebra on both sides of the spinous process for securing the anchoring plate <b>1201</b>, <b>1301</b>. Use of the anchoring plate <b>1201</b> requires removing the spinous process associated with the targeted vertebra. Threaded holes <b>1216</b>, <b>1266</b> at an inferior end of the anchoring plate <b>1201</b>, <b>1301</b> guide bone screws <b>1326</b>, <b>1376</b> along a trajectory seating the bone screws <b>1326</b>, <b>1376</b> into the inferior articular processes <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and facet joints of the target vertebra. Threaded holes <b>1214</b>, <b>1264</b> at the superior end of the anchoring plate <b>1201</b>, <b>1301</b> guide bone screws <b>1324</b>, <b>1374</b> along a trajectory seating the bone screws into the pedicles <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the target vertebra. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a centrally-located mounting bracket <b>1384</b> extends from and is either removably or fixedly connected with the anchoring plate <b>1301</b>. The mounting bracket <b>1384</b> is generally aligned with the removed spinous process and secures a rod <b>1382</b> spanning the distance of one or more spinal motion segments from the superior targeted vertebra to one or more inferior targeted vertebra (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in that additional mounting points <b>1218</b>, <b>1268</b> are provided in addition to a mounting point <b>1280</b> for connecting a mounting bracket. As described above, mounting brackets can be removably connected with the additional mounting points <b>1218</b>, <b>1268</b> to supplement a centrally-located mounting bracket or in substitution of a centrally-located mounting bracket, or alternatively, the mounting points <b>1218</b>, <b>1268</b>, <b>1280</b> can be used to secure rods spanning different spinal motion segments (e.g., the outer mounting points can be used to connect mounting brackets connecting the anchoring plate <b>1301</b> with mounting brackets (not shown) secured to an anchoring plate at a vertebra superior to the targeted vertebra. Alternatively, the anchoring plate <b>1201</b> can include still additional mounting points for securing additional mounting brackets. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, upon reflecting on the teachings herein, the myriad different arrangements of mounting points and mounting brackets that can be associated with an anchoring plate to secure rods spanning one or more additional vertebra superior and inferior to the target vertebra.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The pre-contoured design of the anchoring plates described above ease placement by providing complementary shapes that conform to the generally more easily accessible structures of a given vertebra. Further, the area of the lateral pars (<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the intertransverse interval is free of hardware, providing more area for fusion and bone grafting. The anchoring plates further simplify securing the anchoring plate by providing targeted screw placement. The use of multiple structures can further allow a surgeon to avoid damaged structures. For example, a surgeon may avoid placing hardware (such as pedicle screws) into a site of infection such as the anterior and middle columns for a patient with vertebral spondylodiskitis. The surgeon can further avoid compromised pedicles (type D pedicles, pedicle fracture, intra-operative breach or previous surgery) and primary or metastatic tumors of the vertebral body. The anchor plates can also be used concomitantly with pedicle screws for increased construct rigidity (for instance, in short-segment posterior fusion for burst fractures)</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the anchoring plate <b>101</b> is made of titanium. However, other biocompatible materials such as stainless steel and/or PEEK and/or other related polymers can be used. As will be appreciated upon reflecting on the different embodiments, the structures described herein can vary in size and shape based on factors such as material of construction, anatomical structure of the implantation site, implantation technique and targeted system performance (e.g., stiffness).</p>
