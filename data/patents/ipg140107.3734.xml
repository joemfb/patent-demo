<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from an application earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on 10 Nov. 2010, and there duly assigned Serial No. 10-2010-0111465 by that Office.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD) and a driving method thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD) using an ALS driving method, and a driving method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a representative display device, a liquid crystal display (LCD) includes two display is panels provided with pixel electrodes and a common electrode, and a liquid crystal layer having dielectric anisotropy interposed between the two panels. The pixel electrodes are arranged in a matrix format and are connected to a switch such as a thin film transistor (TFT) to sequentially receive a data voltage by row. The common electrode is formed over the entire surface of the display panel to receive a common voltage. The pixel electrodes, the common electrode, and the liquid crystal layer interposed between the pixel electrodes and the common electrode form a liquid crystal capacitor from a circuital view, and the liquid crystal capacitor and a switch connected thereto become a basic unit forming a pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the liquid crystal display (LCD), an electric field is generated in the liquid crystal layer by applying voltages to the two electrodes, and transmittance of light passing through the liquid crystal layer is controlled by controlling the electric field to thereby display a desired image. At this time, in order to prevent a degradation phenomenon caused by long application of an electric field in one direction to a liquid crystal layer, polarity of the data voltage with respect to the common voltage is inverted for respective frames, respective rows, or respective pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ALS driving method as a driving method for boosting a voltage of a pixel boosts the voltage of a pixel electrode that is floated after a gate voltage is turned off by coupling it with the voltage of an ALS line. The boosting of the voltage of the pixel electrode may be induced by increasing or decreasing the voltage of the boost line during one frame. The ALS driving method may reduce a source output voltage of a driving circuit, thereby reducing power consumption. Also, the ALS driving method may increase the pixel voltage, and the response speed of the liquid crystal may be improved through the application of the high pixel voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the boost line accords with the direction of a scan line and overlaps the data line, such that the voltage of the boost line may have noise because of coupling with the data voltage applied to the data line.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, when the scan line is applied with a gate-on voltage such that the data line is applied with the data voltage, the noise voltage is generated in the boost line by the coupling with the data line. The noise voltage generated in the boost line must be restored until the gate-off voltage is applied and the boost voltage is applied. If the noise voltage generated in the boost line is not restored until the boost voltage is applied, the output signal of the boost line is changed and output by the noise voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the gate-off voltage is applied, the deviation of the noise voltage that is not restored in the boost line causes a difference of the pixel voltage, and thereby crosstalk may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A technical object of the present invention provides a liquid crystal display (LCD) reducing crosstalk due to a noise generated in a boost line by coupling along with a data line in an ALS driving method, and a driving method thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The boost driver may apply the primary boost voltage at a predetermined time that is delayed from a time that the scan signal of the gate-off voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The boost driver may apply the secondary boost voltage at a time that is delayed by the clock signal controlling the output of the boost voltage after the primary boost voltage is applied.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The signal controller <b>100</b> processes the input video signals R, G, and B for operation conditions of the liquid crystal display panel assembly <b>600</b> and the data driver <b>300</b> based on the input video signals R, G, and B and the input control signals, and generates a scan control signal CONT<b>1</b>, a data control signal CONT<b>2</b>, and a boost control signal CONT<b>3</b>.

The boost control signal CONT<b>3</b> includes at least one clock signal controlling the output of the boost voltage Vboost.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The scan driver <b>200</b> is connected to the plurality of scan lines S<b>1</b> to Sn of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>600</b> to apply a scan signal to the plurality of scan lines S<b>1</b> to Sn. The scan signal is formed of a combination of the gate-on voltage that turns on a switching transistor M<b>1</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a gate-off voltage that turns off the switching transistor M<b>1</b> according to the scan control signal CONT<b>1</b>. The scan driver <b>200</b> applies the scan signal in synchronization with at least one clock signal controlling the output of the scan signal.</p>

The gray voltage generator <b>350</b> may provide a predetermined number of reference gray voltages rather than providing voltages for all the grays, and in this case, the data driver <b>300</b> may generate gray voltages for all grays by dividing the reference gray voltages and selecting a data voltage Vdat corresponding to the data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The boost driver <b>400</b> transmits the boost voltage Vboost to the plurality of boost lines B<b>1</b>-Bn of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>600</b> according to the boost control signal CONT<b>3</b>.

That is, a clock signal controlling the output of the boost voltage may have different synchronization from a clock signal controlling the output of the scan signal. Here, the clock signal controlling the output of the boost voltage is referred to as a boost clock signal, and the clock signal controlling the output of the scan signal is referred to as a scan clock signal.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of one pixel PX of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>600</b> includes a thin film transistor array panel <b>10</b> and a common electrode panel <b>20</b> facing each other, a liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> interposed therebetween, and a spacer (not shown) forming a gap between the two panels <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and compressed to some degree.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to one pixel PX of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>600</b>, the pixel PX connected to the i-th (i=1&#x2212;n) scan line Si, the boost line Bi, and the j-th (j=1&#x2212;m) data line Dj includes a switching transistor M<b>1</b>, a liquid crystal capacitor Clc and a storage capacitor Cst connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The switching transistor M<b>1</b> as a three terminal element such as a thin film transistor provided in the thin film transistor array panel <b>10</b> includes a gate electrode connected to the scan line is S<b>1</b>, an input terminal connected to the data line D<b>1</b>, and an output terminal connected to a pixel electrode PE of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc. Here, the thin film transistor may include amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The switching transistor M<b>1</b> may be an n-channel field effect transistor. Here, the gate-on voltage turning on the switching transistor M<b>1</b> is a voltage of a logic high level, and the gate-off voltage turning off the switching transistor M<b>1</b> is a voltage of a logic low level. Or, the switching transistor M<b>1</b> may be a p-channel field effect transistor. Here, the gate-on voltage turning on the switching transistor M<b>1</b> is a voltage of a logic low level, and the gate-off voltage turning off the switching transistor M<b>1</b> is a voltage of a logic high level.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Hereafter, it is assumed that the switching transistor M<b>1</b> is the n-channel field effect transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The liquid crystal capacitor Clc includes the pixel electrode PE of the thin film transistor array panel <b>10</b> and a common electrode CE of the common electrode panel <b>20</b> facing thereto. That is, the liquid crystal capacitor Clc has the pixel electrode PE of the thin film transistor array panel <b>10</b> and the common electrode CE of the common electrode display panel <b>20</b> as two terminals, and the liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> between the pixel electrode PE and the common electrode CE functions as a dielectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The pixel electrode PE is connected to the switching transistor M<b>1</b>, and the common electrode CE is formed on the whole surface of the common electrode panel <b>20</b> and receives a common voltage Vcom. On the other hand, the common electrode CE may be provided on the thin film transistor array panel <b>10</b>. In this case, at least one of the two electrodes PE and CE may be is made in the form of a line or a bar. The common voltage Vcom may be a constant voltage of a predetermined level, and may be a voltage of about 0V.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A color filter CF may be formed on a portion of the region of the common electrode CE of the common electrode panel <b>20</b>. In order to realize color display, each pixel PX uniquely displays one of primary colors (spatial division), or each pixel PX temporally and alternately displays primary colors (temporal division). Then, the primary colors are spatially or temporally synthesized, and thus a desired color is recognized. An example of the primary colors may be three primary colors of red, green, and blue.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As an example of the spatial division, each pixel PX has a color filter CF that represents one of the primary colors in a region of the common electrode panel <b>20</b>. Unlike this, the color filter CF may be formed above or below the subpixel electrode PE of the thin film transistor array panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The storage capacitor Cst includes one terminal connected to the pixel electrode PE and the other terminal connected to the boost line Bi. The boost line Bi may be provided in the thin film transistor array panel <b>10</b>, and the boost line Bi and the pixel electrode PE may overlap each other via an insulator interposed therebetween. The boost line Bi may be applied with a predetermined to voltage such as the common voltage Vcom.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram to explain an operation of the liquid crystal display (LCD) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pixel PX is connected to the i-th scan line Si, the i-th boost line Bi and the j-th data line Dj.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the scan line Si is applied with the gate-on voltage, the switching transistor M<b>1</b> is turned on. During the time that the scan line Si is applied with the gate-on voltage, the data voltage Vdat is applied to the data line Dj and is transmitted to a node A. The storage (or sustain) capacitor Cst is charged according to a difference between the voltage of the node A and the common voltage Vcom to generate an electric field to the liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc. The storage capacitor Cst constantly maintains the electric field generated to the liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the scan line Si is applied with the gate-off voltage, the switching transistor M<b>1</b> is turned off and the node A becomes a floating state. Here, if the boost line Bi is applied with the boost voltage Vboost of a predetermined level, the voltage of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc is boosted corresponding to the boost voltage Vboost by the coupling. For example, if the boost voltage Vboost is increased to a positive voltage with respect to the common voltage Vcom, the voltage of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc is also increased. If the boost voltage Vboost is decreased to a negative voltage with respect to the common voltage Vcom, the voltage of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc is also decreased. The degree that the voltage of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc is boosted according to the level of the boost voltage Vboost is determined according to the capacitance ratio of the storage capacitor Cst and the liquid crystal capacitor Clc.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The boost voltage Vboost may be divided into a primary boost voltage and a secondary boost voltage. The primary boost voltage may be applied at a time that a predetermined time is delayed from the time that the scan line Si is applied with the gate-off voltage and that the application of the data voltage Vdat to the pixel is finished, and the secondary boost voltage may be is applied at a time that is a predetermined delayed time after the primary boost voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The electric field is generated to the liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc according to the difference between the voltage of the node A that is boosted by the boost voltage Vboost and the common voltage Vcom such that the transmittance of the light passing through the liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc is changed, thereby displaying the images. The storage capacitor Cst constantly maintains the electric field generated to the liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc. As described above, each pixel PX is input with the data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">By repeating such a process using one horizontal period (may be called &#x201c;1H&#x201d;, and is the same as a period of a horizontal synchronization signal Hsync and a data enable signal DE) in units, the gate-on voltage is sequentially applied to all the scan lines S<b>1</b>-Sn and the data signal is applied to all the pixels PX such that an image of a frame is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When one frame is finished and the next frame is started, the data driver <b>300</b> generates the data voltage according to an inversion signal for the polarity of the data voltage applied to each pixel PX to be opposite to the polarity of the previous frame. This is referred to as frame inversion. At this time, the polarity of the image data signal flowing on one data line may be periodically changed even within one frame according to a characteristic of the inversion signal (for example, row inversion and dot inversion), or the polarity of the image data signal applied to one pixel row may be changed (for example, column inversion and dot inversion).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The liquid crystal display (LCD) of the present invention is operated by a line inversion method in which the common voltage Vcom is constantly maintained during one frame and the polarity of the data voltage is inverted per line (row inversion). The polarity of the common voltage Vcom may be changed per frame.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a timing diagram to explain an operation of the liquid crystal display (LCD) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the scan clock signal CLK_scan has a voltage of the logic high level and a voltage of the logic low level alternately applied with a pulse width of 2 T. For example, the voltage of the logic high level and the voltage of the logic low level may be alternately applied by a method in which the scan clock signal CLK_scan is applied with the voltage of the logic high level in a period T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b> and the voltage of the logic low level in a period T<b>3</b>-T<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Here, 2 T may be equal to one horizontal cycle 1 H.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The boost clock signal CLK_boost has a delay of 1 T, that is, the synchronization difference of &#xbd; a horizontal cycle &#xbd;H with the scan clock signal CLK_scan and may be applied with the pulse of 2 T. For example, the voltage of the logic high level and the voltage of the logic low level may be alternately applied with the method in which the boost clock signal is applied with the voltage of the logic low level in the period T<b>2</b>-T<b>4</b> and the voltage of the logic high level in the period T<b>4</b>-T<b>6</b>. Here, for better understanding and ease of description, it is assumed that the cycle of the boost clock signal CLK_boost has the synchronization difference for the scan clock signal CLK_scan of &#xbd; a horizontal cycle, however the cycle of the boost clock signal CLK_boost may be appropriately adjusted for the difference of the pixel voltage by the coupling of the boost line for the data line to be compensated. This will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the period T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b>, the scan driver <b>200</b> applies the scan signal Scan[1] of the gate-on voltage to the first scan line S<b>1</b> in synchronization with the scan clock signal CLK_scan included in the scan control signal CONT<b>1</b>. The scan signal Scan[1] of the gate-on voltage turns-on the switching transistor M<b>1</b> of the pixel PX connected to the first scan line. Here, an output enable signal included in the scan control signal CONT<b>1</b> may be limited for the gate-on voltage to be maintained from the time T<b>1</b> to the time T<b>3</b>, and thereby the gate-on voltage may be maintained from the time T<b>1</b> to the time T<b>3</b>. A positive data voltage is applied to a plurality of data lines D<b>1</b>-Dm during the period T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The boost driver <b>400</b> applies the boost voltage Vboost[1] to the first boost line corresponding to the first scan line. Here, the boost driver <b>400</b> is not synchronized to the time T<b>3</b> at which the scan signal Scan is converted from the gate-on voltage to the gate-off voltage, but changes the level of the boost voltage[1] at the time T<b>4</b>. That is, the level of the boost voltage[1] is not synchronized to the scan clock signal CLK_scan or the scan signal Scan[1], but is delayed by a predetermined time and changed. Here, it is assumed that the level of the boost voltage[1] is delayed by 1 T (=&#xbd;H) from the time that the scan line is applied with the gate-off voltage at T<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The level of the boost voltage Vboost[1] of the first boost line corresponding to the first scan line applied with the scan signal Scan[1] is primarily increased at the time T<b>4</b> and is secondarily increased at the time T<b>6</b>. The voltage of the pixel connected to the first scan line S<b>1</b>, that is, the voltage of the liquid crystal capacitor Clc, is boosted in proportion to the level of the boost voltage Vboost[1] that is changed at the time T<b>4</b> and the time T<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the period T<b>3</b>-T<b>5</b>, the scan driver <b>200</b> applies the scan signal Scan[2] of the gate-on voltage to the second scan line S<b>2</b>. The scan signal Scan[2] of the gate-on voltage turns on the is switching transistor M<b>1</b> of the pixel PX connected to the second scan line <b>51</b>. A negative data voltage is applied to a plurality of data lines D<b>1</b>-Dm in the period T<b>3</b>-T<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Here, the boost driver <b>400</b> is not synchronized to the time T<b>5</b> that the scan signal Scan[2] is converted from the gate-on voltage to the gate-off voltage, but changes the level of the boost voltage Vboost[2] at the time T<b>6</b>. The level of the boost voltage Vboost[2] of the second boost line corresponding to the second scan line applied with the scan signal Scan[2] is primarily decreased at the time T<b>6</b> and is secondarily decreased at the time T<b>8</b>. The voltage of the pixel connected to the second scan line S<b>2</b> is boosted in proportion to the level of the boost voltage Vboost[2] that is changed at the time T<b>6</b> and the time T<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, the boost driver <b>400</b> applies a primary boost voltage and a secondary boost voltage to the plurality of boost lines in synchronization with the clock signal CLK_boost controlling the output of the boost voltage having the different synchronization from the scan clock signal CLK_scan. The primary boost voltage is applied at the time that is delayed by a predetermined time (e.g., &#xbd;H) from the time that the pixel is applied with the data voltage and the scan line is applied with the gate-off voltage, and the secondary boost voltage is applied at the time that the predetermined time is delayed by the clock signal controlling the output of the boost voltage after the primary boost voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Therefore, in a line inversion method in which the positive data voltage and the negative data voltage are alternately applied to a plurality of data lines D<b>1</b>-Dm, the data voltage may be prevented from decreasing by the coupling between the data line and the boost line, or the boosting of the pixel voltage is decreased by the boost voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, the data voltage and the boost voltage will be compared in a liquid crystal display (LCD) not according to the present invention and a liquid crystal display (LCD) according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example showing a data voltage and a boost voltage in a representative liquid crystal display (LCD) different from the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view showing a data voltage and a boost voltage in a liquid crystal display (LCD) according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a positive predetermined data voltage Vdat with reference to the common voltage Vcom is applied to one of a plurality of data lines D<b>1</b>-Dm in the period T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the representative liquid crystal display (LCD) different from the present invention, the boost voltage Vboost of the logic high level is applied at the time T<b>3</b> at which the application of the positive data voltage Vdat is finished. The voltage of the boost line is changed (increased) by the voltage Va due to the coupling between the data line and the boost line in the period T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b> at which the positive data voltage is applied, and the actual voltage of the pixel is decreased by the voltage Va. Also, the voltage of the boost line is not restored to the common voltage Vcom at the time T<b>3</b> and may be a state in which it is increased to the voltage Vb. At the time T<b>3</b>, the reference voltage is increased to the voltage Vb in the boost line such that the boosting effect by the boost voltage Vboost is decreased by the voltage Vb.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the liquid crystal display (LCD) according to the present invention, the primary boost voltage is applied at the time T<b>4</b> at which the predetermined time is delayed from the is time T<b>3</b> at which the application of the positive data voltage Vdat is finished, and the secondary boost voltage is applied at the time T<b>6</b> at which the predetermined time is delayed from the time T<b>4</b>. The data line is applied with the negative data voltage according to the line inversion method in the period T<b>3</b>-T<b>5</b> such that the voltage of the boost line is changed (decreased) by the voltage Vc that is lower than the initial boost voltage. The initial boost voltage as the reference voltage before the boost voltage is changed may be the voltage of the logic low level or the voltage of the logic high level. The voltage of the logic low level as the initial boost voltage is applied to the boost line connected to the pixel that is applied with the positive data voltage, and the voltage of the logic high level as the initial boost voltage is applied to the boost line connected to the pixel that is applied with the negative data voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The primary boost voltage of the logic high level is applied at the time T<b>4</b> at which the voltage that is lower than the initial boost voltage is formed in the boost line. The primary boost voltage may be a middle value of a target boost voltage. For example, when the initial boost voltage is &#x2212;2V and the target boost voltage is 2V, the primary boost voltage may be 0V as the common voltage Vcom. In the period T<b>5</b>-T<b>7</b>, the data line is applied with the positive data voltage such that the voltage of the boost line is changed (increased) by the voltage Vd. The secondary boost voltage of the logic high level is applied at the time T<b>6</b> at which the voltage of the boost line is increased compared with the target boost voltage by the data voltage. The secondary boost voltage is the target boost voltage. The boosting effect by the primary boost voltage is increased by the voltage Vc, and the boosting effect by the secondary boost voltage is increased by the voltage Vd. Accordingly, the voltage of the pixel may be additionally boosted by the voltages Vc and Vd, and thereby the pixel voltage that is decreased by the voltage Va may be compensated.
