For example, a sense amplifier-type latch circuit includes a latch circuit that captures and stores data during an evaluation phase of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit, and outputs the stored data to differential output nodes. An input differential transistor pair has drains connected to the latch circuit and sources commonly connected to a coupled source node.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The field relates generally to electronic latch circuits for use in digital and mixed-signal systems and, more specifically, to sense amplifier-type latch circuits that employ static bias current to enhance operating frequency.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A basic building block of many digital and mixed-signal systems is a regenerative latch circuit. A regenerative latch is a circuit that can receive a relatively weak input signal and regeneratively amplify the input signal to full-amplitude logic levels. The speed and sensitivity of this type of latch circuit are operating parameters that typically have a large influence on the performance of the overall system. For instance, when a latch is used as a decision-making circuit in a high-speed (e.g., multi-Gbit/s) serial link receiver, the maximum operating frequency of the latch may determine the highest data rate that can be supported by the receiver. If the pulses arriving at the receiver have been attenuated and distorted by high-frequency losses in the transmission media, a latch with high input sensitivity may be needed to recover the data bits with a low bit error rate (BER).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another application in which a high-speed latch with good input sensitivity is needed is high-performance analog-to-digital conversion, in which the latch is used as a voltage comparator (1-bit quantizer). A fast comparator is needed in many analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architectures designed for high sampling rates (e.g., &#x3e;1 G samples/second), and the sensitivity of the comparator should be high so that the ADC resolution is not degraded, usually characterized as the effective number of bits (ENOB).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Exemplary embodiments of the invention generally include electronic latch circuits for use in digital and mixed-signal systems and, more specifically, sense amplifier-type latch circuits and methods to employ static bias currents within a sense amplifier-type latch framework for enhancing operating frequency of the latch.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, a sense amplifier-type latch circuit includes differential input nodes and differential output nodes, a latch circuit, a differential transistor pair, a static bias current circuit, and a switch device. The latch circuit comprises a first inverter and a second inverter, cross-couple connected to each other, wherein the latch circuit captures and stores data during an evaluation phase of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit, and outputs the stored data to the differential output nodes. The differential transistor pair includes gates connected to the differential input nodes of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit, drains connected to the latch circuit, and sources commonly connected to a coupled source node. The static bias current circuit is connected to the coupled source node of the differential transistor pair to provide a static bias current which flows through the differential transistor pair and the first and second inverters of the latch during a precharge phase. The switch device is connected to the coupled source node. The switch device is turned off during the precharge phase and turned on during the evaluation phase of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit by operation of a clock signal to increase current flow through the differential transistor pair.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a sense amplifier-type latch circuit includes a first input node, a second input node, a first output node, a second output node, a first power supply node, and a second power supply node, and a differential amplifier stage comprising first and second output nodes. The sense amplifier-type latch circuit further includes a latch circuit connected between the first power supply node and the first and second output nodes of the differential amplifier stage, wherein the latch comprises first and second inverters, which are cross-coupled to each other, wherein an output of the first inverter is connected to the first output node of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit and to an input of the second inverter, and wherein an output of the second inverter is connected to the second output node of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit and to an input of the first inverter. The differential amplifier stage further includes a differential transistor pair having gates connected to the first and second input nodes of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit, and having a coupled source node. A switch device is connected between the coupled source node and the second power supply node, wherein the switch device is turned off during a precharge phase and turned on during an evaluation phase of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit by operation of a clock signal. A static bias current circuit is connected to the coupled source node of the differential transistor pair to provide a static bias current which flows through the differential amplifier stage and the first and second inverters of the latch during the precharge phase. The sense amplifier-type latch circuit further includes a reset circuit comprising a first reset switch connected between the first power supply node and the first output node of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit, and a second reset switch connected between the first power supply node and the second output node of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit. The first and second reset switches are responsive to the clock signal to switchably connect the first power supply voltage node to the first and second output nodes of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit during the precharge phase, and to switchably disconnect the first power supply voltage node from the first and second output nodes of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit during the evaluation phase.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Exemplary embodiments will now be discussed in further detail with regard to circuits and methods for employing static bias currents within sense amplifier-type latch circuits to enhance the operating frequency and improve performance of the latch circuits. Initially, various circuits to which principles of the invention may be applied will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Traditionally, latches with the highest operating frequencies are those based on current-mode logic (CML) topologies. However, the use of CML latches is not an attractive option in systems where high power efficiency is needed. First, a CML latch itself has high static power dissipation. Second, a CML latch generates an output signal which has limited swing (often less than half of the power supply voltage), and this output signal cannot be directly read by standard CMOS logic, which expects rail-to-rail input levels. While the output of a CML latch can be translated to rail-to-rail levels with circuits known as CML-to-CMOS converters, such circuits have significant propagation delays which often preclude their use in critical timing paths. Consequently, when a CML latch is used to launch data down a critical timing path, usually all of the logic stages in that path must also be realized in CML, with each stage adding significantly to the static power dissipation. In this case, the power overhead of using a CML latch is much higher than just its own static power dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This latter point is illustrated with a specific design example of a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). Recent serial link receiver designs often include a DFE in order to compensate for the signal distortions which occur when fast digital pulses are transferred over electrical channels with limited bandwidth. A fundamental advantage of a DFE over a linear equalizer (such as a peaking amplifier) is that it is able to flatten the channel response (and reduce signal distortion) without amplifying noise or crosstalk. In a DFE, the previously decided bits are fed back with weighted tap coefficients and added to the received input signal. For an M-tap DFE, the feedback taps are denoted H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, . . . , HM. The H<b>1</b> tap represents the intersymbol interference (ISI) contributed by a data bit one unit interval (UI) earlier than the current bit being detected, the H<b>2</b> tap represents the ISI contributed by a data bit two UIs earlier than the current bit, and so on. If the magnitudes and polarities of the tap weights are properly adjusted to match the channel characteristics, the ISI from the previous bits in the data stream will be cancelled, and the bits can be detected by the decision-making latch with a low BER.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The timing constraint associated with the H<b>1</b> tap is the most difficult one to satisfy in a DFE, as there is only one UI available to make a data decision, to feed it back with appropriate weighting, and to add it to the received input signal. Even with the latest deep submicron CMOS technologies, this timing constraint becomes difficult to satisfy for data rates above 10 Gb/s. To relax this timing constraint, speculation is introduced. An example of a DFE with first-tap speculation is the half-rate M-tap architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a half-rate M-tap DFE architecture employing first-tap speculation, to which principles of the invention may be applied. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a half-rate M-tap DFE circuit <b>10</b> having a known architecture which comprises a DFE logic block <b>12</b> that includes the feedback logic for generating weighted taps H<b>3</b>-HM, current integrating summing amplifiers (or summers) S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>, decision making latch blocks L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b> and L<b>4</b>, multiplexers M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>, latches L<b>5</b>, L<b>6</b>, L<b>7</b>, and L<b>8</b>, and buffers B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b> and B<b>4</b>. In the half-rate architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, even bits in the input signal (Rx input) are detected with the decision-making latches L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> on one (e.g., falling) edge of the clock signal CLK, and odd bits in the input signal (Rx input) are detected with decision-making latches L<b>3</b> and L<b>4</b> on the other (e.g., rising) edge of CLK.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The summing amplifiers (or summers) S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> add the DFE feedback taps H<b>1</b>-HM to the received input signal (Rx input). These summing amplifiers may be current-integrating type summing amplifiers, which improves power efficiency. With first-tap speculation, the H<b>1</b> tap is not fed back to the summers S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b> as a dynamic signal. Instead, both +H<b>1</b> and &#x2212;H<b>1</b> are added to the received input signal as static offsets with a parallel pair of summers (e.g., summers S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> for the even bits, and summers S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> for the odd bits). Since the previous bit in the data stream has only two possible values (0 or 1), one of these parallel paths (in the even and odd DFE halves) represents the correct compensation of ISI, so the decision-making latch in that path can detect the data bit with a low BER. Later in time, once the previous bit is known and available, it is used to select a MUX (M<b>1</b> in the case of the even DFE half, M<b>2</b> in the case of the odd DFE half) so that the data bit detected with the correct value of ISI compensation is read out as the valid output of the DFE. In the architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rest of the DFE taps (H<b>2</b> through HM) are fed back to the summers as dynamic signals (not speculated).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the DFE architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the most critical timing paths are those paths which select the MUXes (M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>) used for speculation and those paths which provide H<b>2</b> feedback to the summers S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>. The dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> denote the critical timing paths originating from the even DFE half (by symmetry, there are corresponding timing paths originating from the odd DFE half.) In one embodiment of the DFE, the decision-making latches L<b>1</b>-L<b>4</b> can be implemented as CML-type decision-making latches. Since the delay of a CML-to-CMOS converter is not tolerable, each component in the critical timing paths must also be implemented in CML logic (including MUXes M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>, latches L<b>5</b> and L<b>6</b>, and buffers B<b>1</b>-B<b>4</b>), at a large cost in static power dissipation. The latches L<b>7</b> and L<b>8</b> can be sense amplifier-type latches which convert the CML signals to rail-to-rail levels so that the rest of the DFE logic <b>12</b> (for the later feedback taps) can be implemented with more power-efficient static CMOS circuits. Because the timing constraints for the later DFE taps are not as stringent as that for the H<b>2</b> tap, the clock-to-Q delay of the sense amplifier-type latch can be tolerated here.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In principle, the power efficiency of a DFE with an architecture such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> could be greatly improved if the decision-making latches L<b>1</b>-L<b>4</b> directly generated rail-to-rail output levels, as this would allow even the critical timing paths to be implemented in power-efficient domino and static CMOS circuit styles. A sense amplifier-type latch, also referred to as a differential cascode voltage switch (DCVS) latch, has excellent input sensitivity (at moderate clock rates) and provides a rail-to-rail output signal. Unfortunately, as explained in detail below, conventional sense amplifier-type latches have a relatively long turn-on time when entering their evaluation (regenerative) phase. This long turn-on time increases the clock-to-Q delay, which may be too large for the critical timing paths of a DFE, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The long turn-on time also prevents such latches from achieving good sensitivity at clock rates above 10 GHz, as a long turn-on time leaves insufficient time for regenerative amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of a conventional sense amplifier-type latch circuit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> generally comprises a plurality of MOS transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>, M<b>7</b>, M<b>8</b>, M<b>9</b>, M<b>10</b>, M<b>11</b> and M<b>12</b>. More specifically, the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> comprises a first input node DP, a second input node DN, a first output node QP, a second output node QN, a first power supply node PS<b>1</b> (e.g., VDD), and a second power supply node PS<b>2</b> (e.g., ground). The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> further comprises a differential amplifier stage <b>22</b> comprising first and second output nodes DDP and DDN, and a differential transistor pair M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> having gates connected to the first and second input nodes DP and DN (differential input), having drains connected to the first and second output nodes DDP and DDN of the differential amplifier stage <b>22</b>, and having sources commonly connected to a coupled source node CS. The differential amplifier stage <b>22</b> further comprises an NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> connected between the coupled source node CS and the second power supply node PS<b>2</b>. A clock signal CLK is applied to a gate terminal of the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> further comprises a latch circuit connected between the first power supply node PS<b>1</b> and the first and second output nodes DDP and DDN of the differential amplifier stage <b>22</b>. The latch circuit comprises a first inverter <b>24</b> and a second inverter <b>26</b>, which are connected to each other in a cross-coupled configuration. In particular, the first inverter <b>24</b> comprises complementary PMOS and NMOS transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>7</b>, and the second inverter <b>26</b> comprises complementary PMOS and NMOS transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>8</b>. The output of the first inverter <b>24</b> is connected to the input of the second inverter <b>26</b> and the output node QN. The output of the second inverter <b>26</b> is connected to the input of the first inverter <b>24</b> and the output node QP. The latch circuit provides regenerative amplification and stores memory of a previous data decision, the function of which is well known in the art. The latch data is output as a differential output QP-QN.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> further comprises a reset circuit formed by a plurality of reset switches including PMOS switches M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b> and M<b>11</b>, which are driven by the clock signal CLK. The reset switches M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b> and M<b>11</b>, as well as the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b>, are switchably controlled by the clock signal CLK during a reset (or precharge) phase and an evaluation (decision-making) phase. More specifically, the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> operates as follows</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the clock signal CLK transitions to logic low (e.g., 0 volts), the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> enters a precharge phase to precharge the nodes DDP, DDN, QP, and QN. In particular, during the precharge phase, in response to a logic low CLK signal, the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> is turned off, and the PMOS switches M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>, and M<b>11</b> are turned on. As a result, the nodes DDP, DDN, QP, and QN are charged up to the power supply voltage VDD at node PS<b>1</b>. The precharging of these nodes eliminates memory of the previous data decision. While switches M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b>, and M<b>6</b> pull the nodes DDP, DDN, QP, and QN up to the positive power supply voltage VDD, the switch M<b>11</b> provides a differential short between nodes DDP and DDN, which equalizes their voltages and thereby helps minimize hysteresis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other embodiments of the sense amplifier-type latch of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, some precharging switches are not used. For instance, some sense amplifier-type latches do not use switch M<b>11</b>, but at the expense of exhibiting a bit more hysteresis, depending on the clock frequency. Other sense amplifier-type latch designs omit switches M<b>1</b> and M<b>6</b>. Since the lowest hysteresis and best sensitivity are obtained, however, when all of the internal nodes are precharged and differentially shorted (no high impedance or floating nodes), the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is optimal among the conventional designs.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, when the clock signal CLK transitions to logic high (e.g., VDD volts), the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> enters an evaluation phase. In particular, during the evaluation phase, in response to a logic high CLK signal, the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> is turned on, and the PMOS switches M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>, and M<b>11</b> are turned off. As such, the nodes DDP, DDN, QP, and QN are decoupled from the power supply voltage node PS<b>1</b>, and current begins to flow through the differential input pair M<b>9</b>/M<b>10</b> causing the nodes DDP and DDN to discharge downward from the precharged voltage level (positive power supply voltage VDD). Depending on the polarity of the differential data input DP-DN, either node DDP or node DDN is discharged faster, which determines the binary value that is latched at the output nodes QP and QN once the cross-coupled first inverter <b>24</b> (M<b>3</b>/M<b>7</b>) and second inverter <b>26</b> (M<b>4</b>/M<b>8</b>) start to conduct with significant current and provide regenerative amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the sense amplifier-type latch <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has good input sensitivity (at moderate clock rates) and is used in a wide variety of mixed-signal and digital circuits, the circuit <b>20</b> exhibits a relatively long turn-on time upon entering the evaluation phase due to the nodes DDP and DDN being charged up to VDD. The long turn on time increases its clock-to-Q delay and causes severe performance degradation when the frequency of CLK is raised above 10 GHz (even in the latest CMOS technologies). Indeed, a main problem is that nodes DDP and DDN, which are precharged to the positive power supply, must slew down a few hundred mV before the NMOS transistors (M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>) of the cross-coupled inverters <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> begin to conduct with significant currents. The resulting turn-on time is too much overhead when the cycle time is very short. For instance, if the frequency of CLK is 12.5 GHz (with a 50% duty cycle), the evaluation phase is only 40 ps long. If the turn-on time exceeds 10 ps, for example, more than a quarter of the evaluation phase is wasted, and there is insufficient time left over for regenerative amplification. For this reason, the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> cannot provide high input sensitivity at such high clock frequencies. To improve the power efficiency of DFEs as well as other high-speed circuits (e.g., ADCs) using sense amplifier-type latch circuits, it is desirable to have a latch circuit that can generate rail-to-rail output signals with reduced latency, as compared to the conventional sense amplifier-type latch of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of a sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, in which faster turn-on time and enhanced operating frequency are realized by biasing key transistors with static currents during the precharge phase. As generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> generally comprises a plurality of MOS transistors M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>7</b>, M<b>8</b>, M<b>9</b>, M<b>10</b>, M<b>12</b>, M<b>13</b> and M<b>14</b>. More specifically, the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> comprises a first input node DP, a second input node DN, a first output node QP, a second output node QN, a first power supply node PS<b>1</b> (e.g., VDD), and a second power supply node PS<b>2</b> (e.g., ground). The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> further comprises a differential amplifier stage <b>32</b> comprising first and second output nodes DDP and DDN, and a differential transistor pair M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> having gates connected to the first and second input nodes DP and DN (differential input), having drains connected to the first and second output nodes DDP and DDN, and having sources commonly connected to a coupled source node CS. The differential amplifier stage <b>32</b> further comprises an NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> connected between the coupled source node CS and the second power supply node PS<b>2</b>. A clock signal CLK is applied to a gate terminal of the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> further comprises a latch circuit connected between the first power supply node PS<b>1</b> and the first and second output nodes DDP and DDN of the differential amplifier stage <b>32</b>. Similar to the latch in the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the latch circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises a first inverter <b>24</b> and a second inverter <b>26</b>, which are connected to each other in a cross-coupled configuration, wherein the output of the first inverter <b>24</b> is connected to the input of the second inverter <b>26</b> and the output node QN, and wherein the output of the second inverter <b>26</b> is connected to the input of the first inverter <b>24</b> and the output node QP.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> further comprises a reset circuit formed by a plurality of reset switches including PMOS switches M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b>, which are driven by the clock signal CLK. In contrast to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reset circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> does not include the reset switches M<b>1</b>, M<b>6</b> and M<b>11</b>. The reset switches M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b>, and the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> are switchably controlled by the clock signal CLK during a reset (or precharge) phase and an evaluation (decision-making) phase.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in that the circuit <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> does not include the reset switches M<b>1</b> and M<b>6</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to precharge the nodes DDP and DDN to the power supply voltage VDD. Instead, the differential amplifier stage <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further comprises a static bias current circuit <b>34</b> connected to the coupled source node CS of the differential transistor pair M<b>9</b>/M<b>10</b> to provide a static bias current which flows through the differential amplifier stage and the first and second inverters <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the latch during the precharge phase.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">More specifically, the static bias current circuit <b>34</b> applies a static bias current I<sub>static </sub>to the differential input transistor pair M<b>9</b>/M<b>10</b> and latch circuit during the precharge phase so that nodes DDP and DDN are not floating, but rather settle to a certain voltage level (approximately a gate-to-source voltage below VDD). Because this voltage level is less than VDD (as compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the turn-on time at the beginning of the evaluation phase is decreased, as explained in further detail below. The static bias current circuit <b>34</b> includes NMOS transistors M<b>13</b> and M<b>14</b> connected as a current mirror and a current source I<sub>b</sub>. In particular, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a gate voltage V<sub>b </sub>of transistor M<b>13</b> is generated by driving a bias current I<sub>b </sub>through the diode-connected transistor M<b>14</b>, to generate a simple current mirror relationship between I<sub>b </sub>and I<sub>static</sub>. Other arrangements for biasing a tail device to produce a static current can be employed in the circuit <b>34</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> operates as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the clock signal CLK transitions to logic low (e.g., 0 volts), the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> enters the precharge phase to precharge the nodes QP and QN. In particular, during the precharge phase, in response to a logic low CLK signal, the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> is turned off, and the PMOS switches M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b> are turned on. As a result, the nodes QP and QN are charged up to the power supply voltage VDD. The precharging of these nodes eliminates memory of the previous data decision. During the precharge phase, while the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> is turned off, the tail current device M<b>13</b> remains connected to the common-source node of the input differential pair M<b>9</b>/M<b>10</b> and is biased to act as a current source with value I<sub>static</sub>. The value of I<sub>static </sub>is preferably selected to have a modest value (e.g., 200 microamperes) so that the power penalty of using it is fairly low. For instance, the static power dissipation due to I<sub>static </sub>may be lower than the dynamic power dissipation of the latch when clocked at a high frequency such as 10 GHz. Due to the static current I<sub>static </sub>that is sunk by tail current transistor M<b>13</b>, a modest value of bias current flows through the differential input stage M<b>9</b>/M<b>10</b> during the precharge phase. As a result, the NMOS transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> are biased close to the edge of strong conduction (with gate-to-source voltages at least close to their threshold voltages).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, the NMOS transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> of the cross-coupled inverters <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> connected to the drains of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> at nodes DDP and DDN, respectively, are also biased close to the edge of strong conduction during the precharge phase of the latch <b>30</b>. Although the nodes DDP and DDN are not precharged to VDD using PMOS switches (M<b>1</b> and M<b>6</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the nodes DDP and DDN are not floating (high impedance) during the precharge phase. The static currents flowing through the drains of the transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> pull the voltages at nodes DDP and DDN down to a level which allows the static currents to also flow through transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>. Since the gates and drains of the NMOS transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> are precharged to the positive power supply voltage VDD during the precharge phase, the voltages at nodes DDP and DDN settle to a level which is approximately VDD-Vgs (the gate-to-source voltage of the transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, since the NMOS transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> are effectively diode-connected transistors that are biased with currents set by I<sub>static</sub>, the impedance at nodes DDP and DDN during the precharge phase is approximately 1/gm, where gm is the transconductance of transistor M<b>7</b> (or M<b>8</b>). With a modest (but not very small) value of I<sub>static</sub>, this impedance is low enough that the voltages at nodes DDP and DDN settle quickly in the precharge phase, which helps reduce latch hysteresis. As in the sense amplifier-type latch <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the nodes DDP and DDN are neither floating nor high-impedance nodes during the precharge phase. Since the static currents flowing through the drains of transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> do flow through the precharging switches M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b>, these switches must be sized for low on-resistance so that nodes QN and QP are pulled up to the positive power supply with negligible IR drops. In practice, the use of static currents does not entail a real penalty in the sizing of switch transistors M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b>, as these switches need to be just as large or larger to meet their dynamic requirements (i.e., fast precharging of parasitic capacitances when cycle times are short).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, when the clock signal CLK transitions to logic high (e.g., VDD volts), the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>30</b> enters the evaluation phase. In particular, during the evaluation phase, in response to a logic high CLK signal, the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> is turned on, and the PMOS switches M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b> are turned off. As such, the nodes QP and QN are decoupled from the power supply voltage node. Since the current that flows through the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> (when &#x201c;ON&#x201d;) is much higher than the static current I<sub>static </sub>that flows through the tail current transistor M<b>13</b>, the total current flowing through the differential input amplifier stage <b>32</b> greatly increases. Because the NMOS transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> of the differential input amplifier stage <b>32</b> and the NMOS transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> of the cross-coupled inverters <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are biased close to the edge of strong conduction during the precharge phase, the nodes DDP and DDN do not have to slew far before substantial currents flow through the cross-coupled inverters, and the process of regeneration begins.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, assuming VDD is 1 Volt, and the threshold voltage V<sub>TH </sub>of transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> is in a range of 300 mV to 400 mV, the static bias current I<sub>static </sub>can be selected so that the voltages at nodes DDP and DDN are set to a level in a range of 600 mV to 700 mV during the precharge phase, and the transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> are biased in a state close to strong conduction. Consequently, when the latch circuit <b>30</b> enters the evaluation phase, there is little time wasted for turn-on at the beginning of the evaluation phase. The large reduction of the turn-on time (i.e., acceleration of the regeneration) reduces the clock-to-Q delay of the latch and improves its sensitivity at high clock frequencies (short cycle times). Again, to reiterate, this is in contrast to the latch circuit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> wherein the nodes DDP and DDN are precharged to VDD, which takes a longer time to discharge to a level of VDD-Vgs, thereby delaying the regeneration process and increasing the latency.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of a sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>40</b> according to another exemplary embodiment of the invention. As generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>40</b> comprises a plurality of MOS transistors M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>7</b>, M<b>8</b>, M<b>9</b>, M<b>10</b>, M<b>12</b>, M<b>13</b>, M<b>14</b>, M<b>15</b>, M<b>16</b> and M<b>17</b>. The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>40</b> is similar to the circuit <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in that it includes a differential amplifier stage <b>42</b> which comprises a differential transistor pair M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b>, an NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> connected between the coupled source node of M<b>9</b>/M<b>10</b> and the second power supply node PS<b>2</b> (e.g., ground), and a static current bias circuit <b>34</b>, a latch circuit formed by a first inverter <b>24</b> (M<b>3</b>/M<b>7</b>) and a second inverter <b>26</b> (M<b>4</b>/M<b>8</b>), connected in a cross-coupled configuration to form a latch, and a reset circuit formed by reset switches M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b>. The reset switches M<b>2</b> and M<b>5</b> and the NMOS switch device M<b>12</b> are switchably controlled by the clock signal CLK during a reset (or precharge) phase and an evaluation (or decision-making) phase.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>40</b> further includes a reset transistor M<b>15</b> connected between the output nodes QN and QP which serves as a differential reset device that shorts the output nodes QN and QP during a reset phase. Indeed, in response to a logic low signal of CLK during a precharge phase, the reset switch M<b>15</b> is turned on to short the output nodes QN and QP together to eliminate any residual differential voltage QP-QN that may exist before the evaluation phase. Such elimination of the differential voltage helps reduce latch hysteresis. The reset switch M<b>15</b> is turned off during the evaluation phase. While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, other differential reset devices may be added to the sense amplifier-type latch circuit of the present invention. For instance, a reset transistor connected between nodes DDP and DDN can be implemented to help further reduce latch hysteresis in some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Moreover, the input differential amplifier stage <b>42</b> further includes a neutralization circuit formed by transistors M<b>16</b> and M<b>17</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the transistors M<b>16</b> and M<b>17</b> are configured as capacitors wherein the drain and source nodes of transistor M<b>16</b> are connected to each other, and wherein the drain and source nodes of transistor M<b>17</b> are connected to each other. In this configuration, the transistor M<b>16</b> operates as a capacitor that is connected between the input node DP and the node DDN, and the transistor M<b>17</b> operates as a capacitor that is connected between the input node DN and the node DDP, which serves to neutralize (i.e., cancel) the differential kickback from nodes DDP and DDN to the input nodes DP and DN due to the gate-to-drain capacitances of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">More specifically, in the absence of the neutralization transistors M<b>16</b> and M<b>17</b>, during operation of the circuit, there can be some capacitive coupling (kickback) between nodes DDP and DP due to the gate-to-drain capacitance of transistor M<b>9</b>, and between nodes DDN and DN due to the gate-to-drain capacitance of transistor M<b>10</b>, which causes undesired disturbances on the voltages at input nodes DP and DN, as the voltages at nodes DDP and DDN rise and fall during operation. To neutralize this effect differentially, the transistors M<b>16</b> and M<b>17</b> are configured and sized to act like capacitors with capacitances that match the gate-to-drain capacitances of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b>. It should be noted that other types of capacitors (including other transistor arrangements) may be used in place of transistors M<b>16</b> and M<b>17</b>&#x2014;the only requirement is that the capacitance values match the gate-to-drain capacitances of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the transistors M<b>16</b> and M<b>17</b> do not conduct DC current (as the source of M<b>16</b> is shorted to its own drain, and the source of M<b>17</b> is shorted to its own drain). Instead, they are connected as cross-coupled capacitors that neutralize (cancel differentially) the capacitive coupling effects due to the gate-to-drain capacitances of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, consider a case where the differential voltage DDP-DDN rises, with the voltage on the DDP node increasing and the voltage on the DDN node decreasing. As the voltage on the DDP node increases, it would naturally couple capacitively back to the DP node and raise the voltage of node DP (positive disturbance). As the voltage on the DDN node decreases, it would naturally couple capacitively back to the DN node and lower the voltage of DN (negative disturbance). By connecting the node DDN (with decreasing voltage in this case) to the node DP via a capacitive element (e.g., M<b>16</b>), a negative disturbance is introduced at node DP which cancels the positive disturbance due to the coupling through the gate-to-drain capacitance of M<b>9</b>. Likewise, by connecting the node DDP (with increasing voltage in this case) to the node DN via a capacitive element (e.g., M<b>17</b>), a positive disturbance is introduced at node DN which cancels the negative disturbance due to the coupling through the gate-to-drain capacitance of M<b>10</b>. In this way, differential kickback from nodes DDP and DDN to nodes DP and DN is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Since sense amplifier-type latch circuits employ a precharge phase, there is a time interval during which both of its outputs (nodes QP and QN in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>) are precharged to the same precharge level, wherein the differential output signal QP-QN does not represent a valid logic bit (neither the previously decided nor a current logic bit). In many mixed-signal and digital systems in which a sense amplifier-type latch is used, it is desirable that the previously decided bit be available for reading while the sense amplifier-type latch is in its precharge phase. In order to hold the previously decided bit as a valid output during the precharge phase, a keeper circuit may be connected to the outputs of a sense amplifier-type latch.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of a circuit <b>50</b> comprising a sense amplifier-type latch <b>52</b> and a keeper circuit <b>54</b>. In general, the sense amplifier-type latch <b>52</b> is a generic illustration of any one of the sense amplifier-type latches depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> or <b>4</b>. The latch <b>52</b> includes first and second input nodes DP and DN (differential input) and first and second output nodes QP and QN (differential output). The differential outputs QP and QN of the latch circuit <b>52</b> are connected to first and second inputs INP and INN of the keeper circuit <b>54</b>. The keeper circuit <b>54</b> includes first and second output nodes OUTP and OUTN which output a buffered version (Output_P, Output_N) of the outputs (QP and QN) of the sense amplifier-type latch <b>52</b>. In general, the keeper circuit <b>54</b> buffers a valid output QP-QN (decision) of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>52</b> which is generated during an evaluation phase of the latch circuit <b>52</b>. When the sense amplifier-type latch circuit <b>52</b> enters its precharge phase, and both of its outputs QP and QN are precharged to the same precharge level, the keeper circuit <b>54</b> holds its outputs Output_P and Output_N constant (representing the valid output QP-QN of the latch <b>52</b> from its previous data decision) until the next evaluation phase.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">One standard circuit that can be used as a keeper circuit for a sense amplifier-type latch circuit is a Set-Reset (SR) latch. For instance, an SR latch with active low inputs can be connected to the QP and QN outputs of one of the sense amplifier-type latches depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> or <b>4</b>. When the sense amplifier-type latch makes a data decision (during the evaluation phase), one of its outputs becomes low, which either sets or resets the SR latch so that the output of the SR latch then matches the valid output of the sense amplifier-type latch. When one of the sense amplifier-type latches depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> or <b>4</b> enters its precharge phase, both of its outputs QP and QN become high, so the SR latch maintains its current state until the next evaluation phase of the sense amplifier-type latch.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Very high-speed applications such as DFEs operating at data rates well above 10 Gb/s may require that the keeper circuit have a propagation delay that is shorter than that possible with an SR latch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of a keeper circuit that may be used to implement the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> while achieving a propagation delay shorter than that of an SR latch. When a sense amplifier-type latch such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> or <b>4</b> generates a valid output (during its evaluation phase), one of the two inputs (INP, INN) of the keeper circuit becomes high, and the other becomes low. For instance, if the sense amplifier-type latch generates a logic 1 bit, INP becomes high, and INN becomes low. Because INP is high, PMOS transistor M<b>26</b> is turned off, so no current flows into the current mirror formed by NMOS transistors M<b>28</b> and M<b>27</b>. Since M<b>27</b> is effectively shut off, it does not pull down the output node OUTP. On the other hand, PMOS transistor M<b>25</b> is turned on since INN is low, so OUTP is raised to the positive power supply. The low value of INN also turns on PMOS transistor M<b>22</b>, which drives a large current into the current mirror formed by NMOS transistors M<b>24</b> and M<b>23</b>. Therefore, M<b>23</b> generates a large pull-down current while the high value of INP turns off PMOS transistor M<b>21</b>. As a result, OUTN is pulled down to ground. In a similar manner, if the sense amplifier-type latch generates a logic 0 bit, OUTP is pulled down to ground, and OUTN is raised to the positive power supply. The output of the keeper circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> thus matches the valid output of the sense amplifier-type latch.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When one of the sense amplifier-type latches depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> or <b>4</b> enters its precharge phase, both inputs INP and INN of the keeper circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> become high, so PMOS transistors M<b>21</b>, M<b>22</b>, M<b>25</b>, and M<b>26</b> are turned off. With M<b>22</b> and M<b>26</b> shut off, no currents flow in the two NMOS current mirrors (M<b>23</b>/M<b>24</b> and M<b>27</b>/M<b>28</b>), so all of the NMOS transistors in the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are also shut off. With all of the NMOS and PMOS transistors shut off, and no current flowing in the circuit, the outputs OUTP and OUTN of the keeper circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are held constant (representing the valid output of the sense amplifier-type latch from its previous data decision) by the parasitic capacitances at the output nodes. Due to leakage, this type of dynamic keeper circuit, in which the outputs are held constant not actively but with just capacitance, may not be suitable for lower-frequency applications (e.g., clock frequencies much lower than 1 GHz), but it works well in the very high frequency applications (e.g., clock frequencies well above 5 GHz) for which the sense amplifier-type latch of the present invention is intended.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In order to illustrate the improved response time that is achieved using sense amplifier-type latches according to principles of the invention, computer simulations were performed on the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The computer simulation results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>. In general, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts simulated waveforms that illustrate the performance achieved with the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> implemented using the sense amplifier-type latch circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the keeper circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> at an operating clock frequency of 7.5 GHz. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts simulated waveforms that illustrate the performance achieved with the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> implemented using the sense amplifier-type latch circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the keeper circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, at an operating clock frequency of 7.5 GHz, in accordance with the principles of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts simulated waveforms that illustrate the performance achieved with the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> implemented using the sense amplifier-type latch circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the keeper circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> at an operating clock frequency of 12.5 GHz, in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the simulated performance of the conventional sense amplifier-type latch circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> when implemented in 32 nm CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, waveform (<i>a</i>) depicts the clock signal CLK applied to the gates of transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>, M<b>11</b> and M<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, waveform (<i>b</i>) shows the differential input DP-DN, waveform (<i>c</i>) shows the outputs of the sense amplifier-type latch at nodes QP and QN, and waveform (<i>d</i>) shows the outputs of the keeper circuit OUTN and OUTP.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the simulated performance of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> when implemented in 32 nm CMOS SOI technology. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, waveform (<i>a</i>) depicts the clock signal CLK applied to the gates of transistors M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b> and M<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, waveform (<i>b</i>) shows the differential input DP-DN, waveform (<i>c</i>) shows the outputs of the sense amplifier-type latch at nodes QP and QN, and waveform (<i>d</i>) shows the outputs of the keeper circuit OUTN and OUTP.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To ensure the functionality of the conventional sense amplifier-type latch of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the frequency of the clock signal CLK applied in the first two computer simulations (waveforms (<i>a</i>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) was set at 7.5 GHz. The differential input amplitude DP-DN (waveforms (<i>b</i>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) is 10 mV. The arrows in waveforms (<i>c</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show how much differential output signal QP-QN is generated 40 ps into the evaluation phase (which would be all that is available if the clock frequency were raised to 12.5 GHz). Specifically, for the conventional sense amplifier-type latch, only 365 mV of differential output is generated after 40 ps (as shown in waveform (<i>c</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). For the sense amplifier-type latch with static bias current, 606 mV of differential output is generated after 40 ps (waveform (<i>c</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), which yields an improvement of almost 1.7&#xd7;. This illustrates how reducing the turn-on time of the sense amplifier-type latch and allowing the regeneration to start earlier helps produce stronger signals to drive the keeper circuit, whose output then switches earlier (compare waveforms (<i>d</i>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The acceleration of the regenerative amplification allows the sense amplifier-type latch circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to operate with high sensitivity at higher clock rates. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the simulated performance of the sense amplifier-type latch circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> when implemented in 32 nm CMOS SOI technology and operating at a clock frequency of 12.5 GHz. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, waveform (<i>a</i>) depicts the clock signal CLK applied to the gates of transistors M<b>2</b>, M<b>5</b> and M<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, waveform (<i>b</i>) shows the differential input DP-DN, waveform (<i>c</i>) shows the outputs of the sense amplifier-type latch at nodes QP and QN, and waveform (<i>d</i>) shows the outputs of the keeper circuit OUTN and OUTP. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows proper operation at a clock frequency of 12.5 GHz, wherein high sensitivity of the latch is demonstrated by the differential input amplitude (waveform (<i>b</i>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) being as small as 6 mV. Though the differential output signal QP-QN (waveform (<i>c</i>)) is relatively weak with the circuit operating close to its sensitivity limit, it still has sufficient amplitude to drive the keeper circuit to generate the correct output bit pattern (waveform (<i>d</i>)). Other simulations show that when the conventional sense amplifier-type latch of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is simulated at a clock frequency of 12.5 GHz with similar input amplitudes, the keeper circuit does not generate the correct output bit pattern.</p>
