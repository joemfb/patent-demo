<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to carbon nanotube array of p- and n-channel transistors and p-n diodes and specifically, to complementary circuits of nanotube array field-effect transistors, bipolar transistors, and optoelectronic devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nanotubes (NTs), generally, and Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), specifically, are viewed to be a new key element for future electronics. In the CNT, especially single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), such unique properties as quantization of the electron spectrum, ballistic electron propagation along the tube, current densities as high as 10<sup>9 </sup>A/cm<sup>2</sup>, existence of the semiconductor phase, possibilities for n- and p-doping with a high carrier mobilities, as well as excellent thermal conductance, make nanotubes a great candidate for future novel high-speed, high efficiency electronic and photonic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A key element widely used in the electronic logic circuits is CMOS, wherein both switching states consume minimum energy, see. e. g. J. R. Brews in High-speed Semiconductor Devices, J. Wiley &#x26;Sons, New York, p. 139, 1990. It is therefore important for future nanotube applications to reproduce such an element using CNT technology. Such attempts have been carried out in many research places worldwide.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows as a Prior Art two CNT FETs in series, with n-type and p-type channel field-effect transistors (FET) forming the CMOS circuit, see V. Derycke et al, Nano Letters 1, p. 453, 2001. The CNT CMOS is made from a single nanotube extended between source and drain metal contacts deposited on the Si substrate, while the controlling gate electrodes are made simply by placing the nanotube on top of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>insulating layer on the n+Si substrate. To convert originally p-type CNT into n-type, one of the transistors has been subjected to annealing in vacuum. The resultant effect of voltage switch is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The proof-of-concept design, used in V. Derycke's work, where a single nanotube is placed on the substrate between the contacts, is utilized in essentially all publication on this topic, for both CMOS circuit and individual transistors (see also E. Ungersboeck, et al, IEEE Transactions on nanotechnology, V 4, p. 533, 2005). The drawback of this method is its impracticality for any scale of circuit integration: placement of multiple identical nanotubes to enhance the output current or to form new circuit elements requires a special micro-manipulator and thus precludes any possibility of IC mass manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The patent application Ser. No. 11/705,577 filed by A. Kastalsky on February 2007, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,851,784 describes several nanotube array devices and method for their fabrication. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the nanotube array FET (the direction of the nanotube array is normal to the drawing plane) in which the nanotubes are grown normal to the substrate and the gate electrode <b>21</b> is attached to the sidewall of every nanotube <b>27</b> in the array through a layer of insulator <b>24</b>. The key element is the metal layer <b>21</b> in the middle of the nanotube length, sandwiched between two insulator layers <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>. During deposition of the first insulator layer <b>22</b>, a thin layer of insulation material will also be deposited on the nanotube walls, thereby forming a gate insulator layer <b>24</b> around each nanotube. It is then followed by deposition of the gate metal layer <b>21</b> and the insulator layer <b>23</b>.

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed toward nanotube array electronic and opto-electronic devices and methods of making such devices. The various embodiments share common features related to fabrication techniques and some physical features that make it appropriate for these to be considered together.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention discloses a technology based on the controlled growth of a nanotube array on a metal electrode normal to the electrode plane and then sequential deposition of dielectric and metal layers to produce a solid platform for attachment of a second common contact to all the nanotube tips, thereby forming source and drain electrodes. The transistor gate electrode is made as a third conductive layer sandwiched between the dielectric layers and placed somewhere in the middle of the nanotube length.</p>

Furthermore, p-n-p or n-p-n structures suitable for manufacturing of bipolar transistors are also within the scope of the disclosed devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying Figures, which form a part of this disclosure. It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific products, methods, conditions or parameters described and/or shown herein, and that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting of any claimed invention. Similarly, any description as to a possible mechanism or mode of action or reason for improvement is meant to be illustrative only, and the invention herein is not to be constrained by the correctness or incorrectness of any such suggested mechanism or mode of action or reason for improvement. Throughout this text, it is recognized that the descriptions refer both to the devices and methods of making and/or using these devices, and articles incorporating these devices.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present disclosure the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include the plural reference, and reference to a particular numerical value includes at least that particular value, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to &#x201c;a material&#x201d; is a reference to at least one of such materials and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When values are expressed as approximations by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. In general, use of the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; indicates approximations that can vary depending on the desired properties sought to be obtained by the disclosed subject matter and is to be interpreted in the specific context in which it is used, based on its function, and the person skilled in the art will be able to interpret it as such. In some cases, the number of significant figures used for a particular value may be one non-limiting method of determining the extent of the word &#x201c;about.&#x201d; In other cases, the gradations used in a series of values may be used to determine the intended range available to the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; for each value. Where present, all ranges are inclusive and combinable. That is, reference to values stated in ranges includes each and every value within that range.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is to be appreciated that certain features of the invention which are, for clarity, described herein in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention that, for brevity are described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any subcombination. Finally, while an embodiment may be described as part of a series of steps or part of a more general composition or structure, each said embodiment may also be considered an independent embodiment in itself.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The described objects of the invention essentially cover the majority of modern semiconductor electronic and optoelectronic devices: p-n diodes, transistors, CMOC switches, bipolar transistors, as well as light emitting diodes and lasers. Because of the outstanding electrical and optical properties of semi-conducting nanotubes, especially SWCNTs, all these devices are expected to have parameters superior to their semiconductor counterparts.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the present invention, related fabrication techniques are used to manufacture a series of nanotube array electronic and optoelectronic devices. These devices and the specifics of their manufacture are described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;nanotube&#x201d; refers to nanotubes exhibiting or capable of exhibiting semiconductor-type conductivity, and so may comprise one or more metalloid (e.g., Si, GaAs, or InP), certain metal oxides (e.g., comprising ZnO, SnO, InO, or mixtures thereof) or carbon. More specifically, this includes single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Suitable nanotube electronic devices of the present invention typically use semiconductor type nanotubes, such as semi-conducting Single Walled Carbon NanoTubes (SWCNT). Semiconducting SWCNTs can be incorporated into all of the devices described herein, including transistors or CMIN circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various embodiments of the fabrication technology described herein include the conversion one semiconductor-type of conductivity to the opposite semiconductor-type conductivity, or more specifically from p-type to n-type or from n-type to p-type. By masking sections of p-type or n-type nanotubes, and subjecting the exposed portions of the nanotubes to the appropriate conditions, it is possible to convert only that section of the nanotube to the opposite type conductivity, thereby creating semiconductor junctions within a given nanotube. Typically, the layers of dielectric material are used as the masking layers, they abut and are in physical contact with the walls of the nanotubes to protect the otherwise encased nanotubes from the subsequent conversion environment. In the case of metalloid or inorganic nanotubes, this may be achieved by chemical doping or exposure to oxidative or reductive atmospheres. In the case of carbon, the conversion of p-type carbon nanotubes (including SWCNTs), or sections of nanotubes, into n-type can be accomplished by annealing of originally p-type carbon nanotubes (including SWCNTs), or exposed sections thereof, in a vacuum (or other reducing or non-oxidative atmosphere). Another option for p-type to n-conversion is annealing of the carbon nanotubes (including SWCNTs), or exposed sections thereof, in a potassium atmosphere. Similar conversions of n-type to p-type are also possible, generally by annealing n-type carbon nanotubes (including SWCNTs), or exposed sections thereof, in an oxidizing atmosphere, e.g., oxygen, so as to convert the n-type nanotube to p-type.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Where conversion of one semiconductor-type of conductivity to the opposite semiconductor-type conductivity follows the deposition of a dielectric or metal layer, it is generally good practice to remove incidental dielectric or metal from the sidewalls of the otherwise exposed nanotubes, to ensure proper conversion. In such cases, the use of techniques such as reactive ion- or wet-etching may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should also be appreciated that, while several of the device and methods are described as having or providing a changed conductivity in &#x201c;the middle of&#x201d; or &#x201c;mid-way&#x201d; or &#x201c;halfway&#x201d; along the nanotube length, the invention is not necessarily limited to such a precise definition of &#x201c;middle,&#x201d; &#x201c;mid-way,&#x201d; or &#x201c;halfway.&#x201d; In each case, and unless specifically indicated, these terms may be defined as having the junction or junctions positioned or positioning the junction or junctions (i.e., p-n, n-p, p-n-p, or n-p-n) anywhere along the length of the nanotube(s) between the electrodes, including those positions where the junction or junctions are along 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99% of the length of the nanotube, when measured from either end of the nanotube, described herein as the linear distance from a given end, each linear distance representing individual embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally, in various embodiments of any of the devices herein, the junctions of each nanotube within an array may be positioned at approximately the same linear distance from a given end of the nanotube as the other nanotubes in the same array; in other embodiments, this distance differs for each nanotube within each array.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, where more than one nanotube is present in an array having such a changed conductivity, the conductivity is deemed to be changed if at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% of nanotubes in the array exhibit the described conductivity change, each range representing individual embodiments of the invention. This measure is usefully applied to all of the devices described within this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In series of embodiments, the devices comprise circuits of two nanotube arrays of transistors with different types of conductivity connected in series to form a logic element Complementary Metal Insulator Nanotube (CMIN) device, similar to the Si-based Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry. As in conventional CMOS, one of the transistor arrays has nanotubes with electron conductivity, while the second transistor array has nanotubes with hole conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">These CMIN embodiments contain at least two vertical nanotube arrays of different types of conductivity, each having a transistor structure such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The transistor arrays are connected in series through the top electrode, while the metal layer in the middle of the structure represents a common gate electrode for both arrays. This method of growth of CNT arrays in predetermined position and planar deposition of multi-layer structure, with the nanotubes being buried inside the structure, provides the device processing suitable for the large scale integration of CNT-based integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Similar planar multilayer deposition technique and arrangements apply to a new nanotube array bipolar transistor (NABT) of vertical p-n-p and n-p-n device configurations, the change in the type of conductivity in the middle of the nanotube (transistor base) being produced using the methods of annealing in vacuum or in appropriate gas atmosphere described above. The contact to the base is made using the same method of deposition of the metal layer sandwiched between two dielectrics, similar to the gate in the CMIN. Unlike the insulated gate of the CMIN, however, the metal in the NABT is directly attached to the nanotube sidewall to provide the base contact with a low contact resistance. To minimize the contact resistance, palladium as a contact metal is preferable, see A. Javey et al, Nano Letters, V. 4. p. 1319, 2004. The disclosed nanotube array bipolar transistor is expected to possess unique speed of operation due to both ballistic carrier travel across the base and extremely low intrinsic device capacitances.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The arrangement of vertical nanotube array of p-n junctions also provide for new types of optical elements. The electron-hole injection will result in a radiative recombination, and the device is expected to function as a nanotube array light emitting diode (NALED) and/or a nanotube array injection laser (NAIL).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The terms used within this application are generally given their normal interpretation so as to be understood by one skilled in the art of semiconductor devices or fabrication or in the art areas of the devices themselves. Certain specific terms are defined herein for sake of added clarity. For example, the vertical positioning of the nanotubes, relative to the plane of the base substrate or electrodes, is one of the novel features of the present devices. As used herein, the term &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; is intended to connote an orientation relative to the plane of the base of the device, that relative orientation being substantially orthogonal or normal to that plane.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Unless otherwise specified, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a material capable of providing physical support for the described device. A substrate may be insulative, conductive, or semiconductive, as appropriate for the device being considered. A suitable substrate will comprise materials and have characteristics suitable for any purpose required of the device to which it is attached, including but limited to ability to withstand the downstream processing temperatures needed for the fabrication of the device as well as the surface finish, electrical, thermal, and optical transparency, reflectivity, or opacity suitable or traditionally employed to allow proper operation of the device. Silicon wafers, glasses, or ceramics are exemplary inorganic substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Unless otherwise specified, the terms &#x201c;dielectric&#x201d; or &#x201c;dielectric layer&#x201d; refer to materials providing an electrically insulative function, and comprise those materials traditionally used in semiconductor processing or devices for this purpose. As with substrates, a suitable dielectric will comprise materials and have characteristics suitable for any purpose required of the device to which it is attached, including but limited to ability to withstand the processing temperatures or chemical treatments associated with the downstream fabrication steps of the device as well as the surface finish, electrical, thermal, and optical transparency, reflectivity, or opacity suitable or traditionally employed to allow proper operation of the device. Exemplary materials may include glasses or ceramics comprising oxides, nitrides, or carbides of silicon, titanium, organic polymers, or mixtures thereof. Such dielectrics may be applied using standard semiconductor processing, for example including, as appropriate, chemical or physical vapor deposition or spin coating.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;metal&#x201d; or &#x201c;metal layer&#x201d; refer to those traditionally used in semi-conductor processing, and include aluminum, chromium, cobalt, gold, nickel, silver, palladium, and platinum. However the terms may also include other electrically conductive materials, provided these comprise other electrically conductive materials are capable of surviving the processing conditions suggested by the descriptions, and provide the performance consistent with metal layer materials. For example, the choice of a &#x201c;metal&#x201d; or &#x201c;metal layer&#x201d; deposited after one or more temperature intensive steps may be more flexible than one which must survive such a temperature intensive step (e.g., temperatures used in depositing carbon nanotubes). In such cases, organic polymer or grapheme &#x201c;metals&#x201d; may offer an alternative option to traditionally considered metals. Such metal layers may be applied using standard semiconductor processing, for example including, as appropriate, chemical or physical vapor deposition or spin coating.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Vertical SWCNTs represent especially attractive components of the devices described herein, but are more difficult to grow. Because their diameter is in the range of 1-2 nm, they typically require extremely small pads of catalytic material, in the range of a few nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows one embodiment of a new method of the present invention, for providing catalytic pads of reduced dimensions, including catalytic &#x201c;nanopads.&#x201d; In one embodiment, a method of forming a catalytic pad of reduced dimensions comprises (a) depositing a layer of an organic polymer on an optionally metallized substrate; (b) patterning an opening in the organic layer having an effective diameter of d<sub>1</sub>, so as to expose the substrate; (c) heating the organic layer above its melt temperature such that it flows to reduce the size of the opening to an effective diameter d<sub>2</sub>; and (d) depositing a catalytic metal inside the opening to an effective diameter d<sub>2 </sub>to produce a pad of catalytic metal having an approximate effective diameter d<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this context, the terms &#x201c;effective diameters&#x201d; of d<sub>1 </sub>and d<sub>2 </sub>connote a shape of the opening consistent with that of a circle, these openings are not necessarily constrained to this shape. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;effective diameter&#x201d; is intended to reflect an opening size consistent with that of a corresponding circle. This may be calculated by taking the arithmetic average of the diameters of the opening; for example, in the case of an oblong opening, the average of the major and minor axes. Another way of calculating this effective diameter is to determine the area of the opening, A (e.g., in the case of a square), and apply the formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Effective diameter=2&#xd7;square root (<i>A</i>/&#x3c0;)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In separate embodiments of this method, d<sub>1 </sub>is in the range of between about 5 and about 250 nm, in the range of between about 10 and about 50 nm, in the range of between about 10 and about 30 nm, and in the range of between about 15 and about 20 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In other separate embodiments, d<sub>2 </sub>is in the range of between about 1 and about 25 nm, in the range of between about 1 and about 10 nm, and in the range of between about 1 and about 5 nm. Larger dimensioned openings are also available by the methods described herein, but are less attractive in semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain embodiments, the substrate <b>50</b> comprises an insulating or semi-conductive surface of appropriate surface finish for the intended purpose (for example, polished and/or single crystal Si, GaAs, InP, ceramic, or glass). At least one metal electrode <b>51</b> may be applied using conventional semiconductor techniques, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. The method also provides that the portion of the optionally metallized surface to be patterned is covered with an organic material, for example a thermoplastic or a material which is capable of viscous flow on heating. A particularly useful organic material for the present invention comprises polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the methods provide that the organic polymer is a resist or photoresist and the patterning is achieved by lithographic methods&#x2014;for example, patterning by e-beam lithography&#x2014;and subsequent heat treatment of the patterned photoresist to produce nanopads to the desired dimensions of a few nm necessary for making SWCNT-based CMIN. Where the resist or photoresist is an e-beam resist, such resists are commercially available and the range of available materials. Those embodiments comprising E-beam lithography, which is the highest resolution patterning technology, are especially attractive for producing the smallest diameter openings, though the principle of the invention applies to other photoresist patterning technologies as well. For example, openings can also be created using nanoimprint lithography, interference lithography, self-assembled copolymer pattern transfer, spin coating, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam milling, photolithography, reactive ion-etching, wet-etching, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, electron beam evaporation, sputter deposition, and combinations thereof. However, using e-beam photoresist and pattering, it is possible to achieve opening <b>53</b> of the minimum size of d<sub>1</sub>&#x2dc;15-20 nm, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Once formed, the opening <b>53</b> is further reduced by a controlled melting of the resist or photoresist <b>52</b> by subjecting it to a temperature treatment sufficient to allow the polymer to flow. For example, it is known that PMMA photoresist materials begin to flow as viscous liquids as the temperature is raised above T&#x2dc;90&#xb0; C. This results in a partial covering <b>54</b> of the opening <b>53</b> with the melted photoresist, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>. The length of photoresist extension &#x3b4; depends on many factors, such as type of photoresist, temperature, duration of heating and photoresist thickness. All these parameters must be considered and tightly controlled and adjusted to obtain desirable photoresist extension &#x3b4;.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">While the diameter of the opening may be defined in terms of d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, and &#x3b4;, in certain situations, the flow of the organic layer may also result in extremely thin layers or even monolayers of polymer on the surface of the substrate. Such thin or monolayer polymer coatings may be removed by conventional chemical or physical etching methods to improve the reliability or performance of the resulting device.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A thin film of catalytic material <b>55</b> is then deposited on the substrate <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>, using standard physical or chemical, including vapor, deposition techniques. The term &#x201c;catalytic material&#x201d; in this context refers to those materials known to catalyze the growth of nanotubes, especially carbon nanotubes. Exemplary metals include, but are not limited to those described above; especially Co, Ni or Fe.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">After photoresist lift-off, one obtains the pad of catalytic material <b>56</b> of dimension d<sub>2</sub>=d<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;2&#x3b4;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>e</i>. Where the pads <b>16</b> are of sufficiently small dimensions (e.g., 1-10 nm), they can be used as templates to grow SWNTs, including SWCNTs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>f</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The deposited catalytic pad <b>56</b> may also be subjected to higher temperatures to coalesce the catalytic materials into an effective sphere having an effective radius R calculated to be:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(4/3)&#x3c0;<i>R</i><sup>3</sup>=&#x3c0;/4(<i>d</i><sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup><i>&#xb7;t </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where t is the thickness of the catalytic material <b>55</b>. For the initial diameter of d<sub>1</sub>=15 nm and &#x3b4;=5 nm, one obtains d<sub>2</sub>&#x2dc;5 nm and with t&#x2dc;1 nm the sphere radius R&#x2dc;1.7 nm. This is sufficiently small to grow SWCNTs. Useful effective radii for use in this capacity are in the ranges having lower boundaries of about 0.5 nm, about 1.0 nm, about 1.5 nm, about 2.0 nm, and about 2.5 nm and upper boundaries of about 2 nm, about 3 nm, about 4 nm, about nm, and about 6 nm; for example, in the range from about 0.5 nm to about 3.0 nm, from about 0.5 nm to about 2.5 nm, from about 0.5 to about 2.0 nm, and from about 1.0 nm to about 2.0 nm.
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Catalytic pads produced by any of the preceding methods can be used to produce templates for the growth of vertical nanotubes, including carbon nanotubes, and further including the growth of SWCNTs when the pads are sufficiently small (i.e., &#x201c;nanopads&#x201d;). Such templates can be used to grow single or multiple arrays of at least one nanotubes, including SWCNTs. These methods and devices derived therefrom can be used to prepare a range of devices, some of which are described herein. For example, to produce CMIN circuit, two electrically separated metal electrodes <b>57</b> are utilized to form two SWCNT-based transistors of the CMIN (not shown) using the same method of the photoresist melting.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Various embodiments provide for Complementary Metal Insulator Nanotube devices and methods of making the same. In one such embodiment, a Complementary Metal Insulator Nanotube device comprises (a) a dielectric substrate onto which a first and a second spatially separated metal layers are superposed; (b) a first array of p-type vertical nanotubes positioned substantially perpendicularly to and in electrical communication with said first spatially separated metal layer, said array comprising at least one p-type nanotube; (c) a second array of n-type vertical nanotubes positioned substantially perpendicularly to and in electrical communication with said second spatially separated metal layer, said array comprising at least one n-type nanotube; (d) a first dielectric layer covering said first and second metal layers, having a thickness of about half the length of said vertical nanotubes of the first and second arrays so as to embed the lower half of the first and second arrays, and said first dielectric layer also providing a coating on the sidewalls of at least part of the upper remaining half of the vertical nanotubes of the first and second arrays of sufficient thickness and length as to act as a gate insulator to a third metal layer; (e) the third metal layer covering said first dielectric layer and reaching said first dielectric layer on said sidewalls of the nanotubes in both sets of vertical nanotube arrays, so as to be capable of acting as a gate electrode to the device; (f) a second dielectric layer deposited on top of said third metal layer and making the total thickness of all deposited metal and dielectric layers the same length of the lengths of the first and second nanotube arrays; and (g) a fourth metal layer deposited on the second dielectric layer and in electrical communication with both first and second arrays of vertical nanotubes, so that said fourth metal layer connects both sets of said nanotube arrays and thus makes a circuit of two transistors in series.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another embodiment provides a method of making a Complementary Metal Insulator Nanotube circuit comprising: (a) depositing first and second spatially separated metal layers upon a dielectric substrate; (b) growing a first vertical nanotube array on the first metal layer and a second vertical nanotube array on the second spatially separated metal layer, each nanotube array having the same conductivity type, and each vertical nanotube array having at least one vertical nanotube; (c) converting one of the nanotube arrays into the opposite conductivity type, to give rise to a p-type nanotube array and an n-type nanotube array; (d) providing a first dielectric layer covering said first and second metal layers, a half length of the nanotubes and partially sidewalls of the nanotubes; (e) providing a third metal layer covering said first dielectric layer and reaching said first dielectric layer on said sidewalls of the nanotubes in both said nanotube arrays; (f) providing a second dielectric layer deposited on top of said third metal layer and making the total thickness of all deposited metal and dielectric layers smaller than the nanotube length, to give rise to nanotube ends protruding above said second dielectric layer; (g) removing the protruding nanotube ends; and (h) providing a fourth metal layer covering said first and second vertical nanotube arrays, the fourth metal layer being deposited on the second dielectric layer, the fourth metal layer electrically connecting the first and second vertical nanotube arrays to give rise to a circuit of two transistors in series; wherein said third metal layer is capable of functioning as a gate electrode of the two transistors in the circuit, and said first dielectric layer deposited on said sidewalls of the nanotubes is capable of functioning as a gate insulator of the two transistors in the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment of the CMIN design, shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, two arrays of the nanotubes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are grown on two separate metal electrodes <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> normal to the substrate <b>30</b>, which can be glass plate or Si wafer or any other dielectric substrate capable of sustaining nanotube growth temperatures (&#x2dc;600&#xb0; C.). The nanotube arrays have different types of conductivity, which are produced using above discussed methods of the type conversion. For purposes of discussion herein, nanotubes <b>31</b> are described as being p-type and nanotubes <b>32</b> are described as n-type, although reverse type assignment is equally applicable, since the CMIN structure is symmetrical. The metal layer <b>35</b> sandwiched between two dielectric layers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> represents a common gate for two transistors, wherein the first transistors comprises the substrate metal <b>33</b> as a source, the nanotube array <b>31</b> as a conducting p-channel and the top metal layer <b>38</b> as a drain, while the same top metal layer <b>38</b> is a source of the second transistor, the nanotube array <b>32</b> is an n-channel and substrate metal <b>34</b> is a drain. The dielectric layer <b>39</b> provides the electrical insulation of the gate metal <b>35</b> to both transistor channels.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the p-channel (array <b>31</b>) is originally conducting and n-channel (array <b>32</b>) is depleted, a positive voltage to the gate metal <b>35</b> will make n-channel conducting and p-channel depleted, so that the output voltage taken from the connecting metal electrode <b>38</b> will be switched from minimum to maximum amplitude if positive voltage Vdd is applied to the drain electrode <b>34</b> of the n-channel transistor relative to the source electrode <b>33</b> of the p-channel transistor. On the other hand, change of the polarity of Vdd will result in switching the output voltage from its maximum to minimum amplitude at the same positive gate voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A single nanotube from each array <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> can form two nanotube CMIN circuit. Due to sustainable current density in the SWCNT of 10<sup>9 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, the two nanotube CMIN can provide the current switch of 10 &#x3bc;A. With a realistic nanotube spacing in the array of 1 &#x3bc;m, a 100 &#x3bc;m-long and nanotube diameter wide array will provide 1 mA output current switch, sufficient for IC operations.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the processing steps for a CMIN fabrication. It begins from deposition on the substrate <b>41</b> of two arrays of metal pads <b>42</b> to form first source and drain contacts in predetermined positions, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. For this purpose, palladium is preferable since it provides the lowest contact resistance. It is followed by a placement on the contacts <b>42</b> of small pads <b>43</b> of catalytic material, such as Co, Ni or Fe, needed for the nanotube growth. After growth of the nanotube arrays <b>44</b> and <b>45</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, which are normally have p-type conductance, one of the arrays, <b>44</b>, is protected by deposition of the sacrificial dielectric layer <b>46</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>, while another nanotube array remains exposed and is annealed in vacuum or in potassium atmosphere to convert it into n-type. Then the sacrificial layer <b>46</b> is removed, and two arrays <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> of respective p- and n-types are ready for further processing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d </i>shows the dielectric layer <b>47</b> which is deposited on the substrate and covers the metal electrodes with the nanotubes. At the same time, a thin dielectric layer <b>48</b> also coats the side walls of the nanotubes. The metal layer <b>49</b> deposited atop of the dielectric <b>47</b> represents the common gate electrode for both arrays, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>, while the layer <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d </i>is the gate insulator. Then the second dielectric layer <b>50</b> covers the nanotube arrays, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>f</i>. This layer provides a platform for placement of the top contacts to the transistors. It is preferable to make the layer <b>50</b> thin enough to have the nanotube ends slightly protruded above this layer. After polishing, to remove the nanotube ends, the final metal layer <b>51</b> is deposited on the exposed nanotube ends to connect the arrays into the circuit of two transistor arrays and form the other two source and drain contacts for transistor circuit. Again, the Pd layer is preferable. Thus, according to the present invention, the planar technology of sequential deposition of dielectric and metal layers allows fabrication of the CMIN circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A fundamental advantage of the CMIN devices, beyond simplicity of its fabrication, is absence of any physical limits for performance improvement. In the Si world, quantum mechanical laws preclude the current rate of reduction in transistor feature size (gate length), and in order to continue improvements in device speed and cost per chip at present pace it is necessary to develop new switching circuits wherein these limitations are not at work. In the CMIN design, with gate plane intersecting the nanotube cylinder, these limitations are not applicable. The gate length in this case is controlled essentially by the gate metal thickness and can be made very thin without complication in the device processing. On the other hand the gate insulator coating the nanotube sidewalls can also be made very thin. Finally, the carriers in the short nanotube transistor channel will move ballistically, i.e. with a velocity significantly exceeding the saturated carrier velocity in the Si channel of &#x2dc;10<sup>7 </sup>cm/s. This implies that CMIN looks the best candidate for future replacement of Si-based transistors. On the other hand, Si wafer can be used as a substrate for CMIN fabrication, and therefore Si-based and CNT-based devices can merge into integrated hybrid ICs.</p>

One such embodiment of a Nanotube Array Bipolar Transistor comprises: (a) a first metal layer, optionally superposed on a substrate; (b) at least one array of at least one nanotube superposed on, positioned normal to the plane of, and in electrical communication with the first metal layer, wherein the at least one nanotube comprises sequential first, second, and third sections exhibiting a first, second, and first semiconductor-type conductivity, respectively, so as to have p-n-p or n-p-n semiconductor junctions; (c) a first dielectric layer superposed on the first metal layer having a thickness corresponding to the length of the first section of the at least one nanotube exhibiting the first semiconductor-type conductivity; (d) an optional second dielectric layer superposed on the first dielectric layer; (e) a second metal layer superposed on the optional second dielectric layer (in either case, superposed on the first dielectric layer); (f) an optional third dielectric layer superposed on the second metal layer, such that the combined thickness of the optional second dielectric, second metal, and optional third dielectric layers corresponds to the length of the second section of the at least one nanotube exhibiting the second semiconductor-type conductivity, and such that the second metal layer is in electrical communication with the section of the at least one nanotube exhibiting the second semiconductor-type conductivity; (g) a fourth dielectric layer superposed on the optional third dielectric layer (in either case, superposed on the second metal layer) having a thickness corresponding to the length of the third section of the at least one nanotube exhibiting the first semiconductor-type conductivity; and (h) a third metal layer, superposed on the fourth dielectric layer, in electrical communication with the at least one nanotube.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Embodiments comprising those devices wherein the second and third dielectric layers are present are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In various embodiments, the first and third nanotube sections exhibit p-type conductivity, the second nanotube section exhibits n-type conductivity, and the semiconductor junctions are p-n-p type In other embodiments, the first and third nanotube sections exhibit n-type conductivity, the second nanotube section exhibits p-type conductivity, and the semiconductor junctions are n-p-n type. These junctions are centered along the length of the total length of the nanotube within the at least one array of at least one nanotube.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As with all of the devices described herein, the nanotubes employed in these NABT devices must be capable of exhibiting semiconductor-type behavior. These may include metalloid or inorganic semiconductive nanotubes or carbon nanotubes, especially single-walled carbon nanotube. These vertical SWCNTs, in particular, can be prepared using methods, including those described above.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The metals used in these devices are those traditionally used in semiconductor processing, as described above. In this particular case, however, palladium is especially preferred for its low contact resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Another feature of the use of SWCNTs in such devices is the ability to allow for ballistic movement along either the second portion (base) of the device or the entire length of the nanotube, such that either or both of these lengths are less than the nanotube ballistic mean free path, and various embodiments of this invention provide for this capability. This typically requires the entire nanotube to have a length of less than about 1 micron. Accordingly, in various separate embodiments, the entire length of the nanotubes in this device may be in the range independently having a lower boundary of about 1 nm, about 10 nm, about 50 nm, about 100 nm, or about 250 nm and an upper boundary of about 1000 nm, about 750 nm, about 500 nm, about 250 nm, about 100 nm, or about 50 nm. Exemplary examples of such ranges are those between about 1 nm and about 1000 nm (i.e., to about 1 micron), between about 100 nm and about 900 nm, between about 250 nm and about 750 nm, and between about 500 nm and about 750 nm. Similarly, additional embodiments comprise those devices wherein the length of the second portion of the nanotube (the base) is in the range independently having a lower boundary of about 1 nm, about 10 nm, about 50 nm, about 100 nm, or about 250 nm and an upper boundary of about 1000 nm, about 750 nm, about 500 nm, about 250 nm, about 100 nm, or about 50 nm. Exemplary examples of such ranges are those between about 1 nm and about 1000 nm (i.e., to about 1 micron), between about 100 nm and about 900 nm, between about 250 nm and about 750 nm, and between about 500 nm and about 750 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Especially preferred embodiments include where both of these occur&#x2014;i.e., where both the second portion (the base) and entire length at less than about 1 micron &#x2014;though certain embodiments exist where they do not: i.e., where the length of the second portion (base) satisfies this less than 1 micron criterion but the total length of the entire nanotube exceeds that length.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Other embodiments provide for the fabrication of Nanotube Array Bipolar Transistors, using techniques elsewhere herein described. In one such embodiment, the fabrication steps comprise (a) growing at least one array of at least one nanotube normal to and in electrical communication with a first metal layer, such that the at least one nanotube exhibits a first type of semiconductor conductivity; (b) depositing a first dielectric layer, superposed on the first metal layer, encasing a first portion of the nanotube in the first dielectric layer and leaving a second portion of the at least one nanotube extending above the depth of the first dielectric layer; (c) converting the second portion of the at least one nanotube to the opposite type of semiconductor conductivity of the first portion of the at least one nanotube; (d) sequentially depositing an optional second dielectric layer, a second metal layer, an optional third dielectric layer, and a fourth dielectric layer, such that the combined optional thicknesses of the second dielectric layer, the second metal layer, and the optional third dielectric layer define a second length of the at least one nanotube, so as to leave a third portion of the at least one nanotube extending above the depth of the optional third dielectric layer, and such that the second metal layer is in electrical communication with the section of the at least one nanotube exhibiting the second type of semi-conductor conductivity; (e) converting the third portion of the at least one nanotube to the first type of semiconductor conductivity; (f) depositing a fourth dielectric layer, superposed on the optional third dielectric layer, to a depth covering the walls of the third section of the at least one nanotube; and (g) depositing a third metal layer, superposed on the fourth dielectric layer, so as to be in electrical communication with the at least one nanotube.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some other embodiments, these methods are used to prepare the NABT devices, having one or more of the features described above.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In other embodiments, these methods use methods for growing single-walled carbon nanotubes also as described herein. In particular, such embodiments include those where small pads of catalytic materials are made and used, upon which to grow vertical SWCNTs. Additionally, still other embodiments provide for additional intermediary steps involving the removal any deposited dielectric from the side-walls of the second or third portion of the nanotubes before converting the semiconductor conductivity type of these portions, for example, using techniques including reactive ion- or wet-etching. In certain circumstances, after the deposition of the fourth dielectric layer, some or all of the nanotubes protrude from the surface of this layer. Such an occurrence may be by accident or design. In fact, it may be deemed advantageous to leave such protuberances after the deposition of the fourth dielectric layer to as to provide for improved electrical connectivity between the third metal layer and the nanotube. In such cases, it is useful to polish the surface of the fourth dielectric layer, using techniques standard in the art (e.g., CMP techniques), so as to remove any incidental dielectric, exposing clean nanotube surfaces, and providing for excellent electrical communication between the nanotube and the third metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The overall construction methods described are particularly suitable for mass fabrication of SWCNT-based bipolar transistors</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">These techniques and features are further exemplified in the context of figures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary NABT structure and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary fabrication scenario. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one method of fabrication starts from deposition of the emitter contact <b>71</b> on a substrate <b>72</b>, on which the nanotube array <b>70</b>, most preferably an array of SWCNTs, is grown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>. This is followed by deposition of four dielectric layers, <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> and the metal layer <b>75</b> which is sandwiched between two thin dielectric films <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. Note that elements <b>70</b>-<b>78</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> correspond to the elements <b>60</b>-<b>68</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The substrate may comprise any material capable of sustaining temperature of the nanotube growth (typically up to 600&#xb0; C.). It is important to provide a low resistive contact to the emitter, and Pd is a preferred material for the electrode <b>71</b>. Prior to the nanotube growth, an array of small pads of catalytic metal (not shown) may be deposited on the emitter electrodes to facilitate the nanotube growth.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Returning to the sequential deposition of the dielectric and metal layers, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>, a dielectric layer <b>73</b> is deposited, in this case so as to cover approximately half of the nanotube length, <b>70</b><i>a</i>, forming the transistor base, and the exposed portion of the nanotube <b>70</b><i>b </i>is subjected to the conversion treatment to convert this portion into the opposite conductivity type. For example, if the p-n-p NABT is considered, after completion of the layer <b>73</b>, the nanotubes may be cleaned to remove any thin layer of insulator from the nanotube sidewalls resulting from the deposition of the first dielectric layer and annealed in vacuum to convert uncovered portion of the nanotubes <b>70</b><i>b </i>into n-type material.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A thin dielectric layer <b>74</b> is next deposited, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>, to ensure that the positioning of the following metal layer <b>75</b> is completely within the n-type region. The metal layer serves as a contact to the base. Again, the Pd is preferable metal for this electrode. After deposition of the protective dielectric film <b>76</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>, which serves the same purpose as layer <b>74</b>. The materials of layer <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> may be the same or different as each other or as with respect to layers <b>73</b> and <b>77</b>. Again, the dielectric layers <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are intended to ensure that the metal <b>75</b> contacts only the region of converted semiconductor type; in this case, the region of n-type conductivity. After deposition of layer <b>76</b>, the remaining exposed nanotube portion <b>70</b><i>d </i>is cleaned and annealed again, this time in an oxidizing environment such as the air, to return the uncovered nanotubes back to p-type. (In certain less preferred embodiments, one or both of layers <b>74</b> or <b>76</b> are omitted). Hence, in this example, the length of the n-type region (base &#x201c;thickness&#x201d;) is controlled by the total thickness of the layers <b>74</b>, <b>75</b> and <b>76</b> (i.e., <b>70</b><i>c</i>). After deposition of the final dielectric layer <b>77</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d</i>, the top surface is polished to expose the nanotube ends, and then the deposition of the metal layer <b>78</b> (&#x201c;collector&#x201d;) completes the processing.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Similar processing steps can be done for the n-p-n type device configuration. For example, in such a case, starting from the n-type SWCNTs at the emitter, the base region can be converted into p-type by annealing the SWCNTs in the air, and the collector part of the SWCNTs is converted back to n-type by annealing in vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The NABT is expected to possess superior properties than classical Si bipolar transistor. First, the base length determined by the thickness of the three layers <b>74</b>, <b>75</b> and <b>76</b> can be made very short, e.g., &#x2dc;20-30 nm. This length is sufficiently short to expect a ballistic carrier movement along the nanotube or at least within a part of it, see, e.g., A. Javey et al. Nano Letters, V. 4, p. 1319, 2004, or M. S. Fuhrer, et al. Electronic Properties of Molecular Nanostructures, ed. by H. Kuzmany, et al. p. 401, 2001, where the ballistic length was estimated to be &#x2dc;0.7 &#x3bc;m. This implies much higher carrier speed than that in a classical semiconductor transistor base. For the base-collector voltage of &#x2dc;1V, one can expect the ballistic carrier movement along both the base and the collector with the velocity close to 10<sup>8 </sup>cm/s, order of magnitude higher than the saturated electron velocity in Si. In addition, due to miniature nanotube diameter (&#x2dc;1-2 nm for SWCNT) the intrinsic transistor capacitances are minimized while the current density is exceedingly high, reaching 10<sup>9 </sup>A/cm<sup>2 </sup>in SWCNTs. Further, there is no potential drop across the nanotube diameter, which precludes any effects of &#x201c;current crowding&#x201d;, when the transistor efficiency in the center of the device decreases due to a lateral potential drop across the base, see. e. g. S. Sze, Physics of Semiconductor Devices, J. Wiley &#x26; Sons, NY, 1969.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Finally, a single nanotube in the array can be utilized as a bipolar transistor with a reasonable current value of &#x2dc;10-20 &#x3bc;A. On the other hand, multiple nanotubes in the array connected in parallel can be used to compose a powerful transistor. If the collector pads are electrically separated from each other, then preliminary selection of the nanotubes before bunching them into a single high power device (to eliminate poor quality or metallic nanotubes) is possible, thereby improving the device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">3. Opto-Electronic Devices&#x2014;General Features</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The simple methods of variation of the carrier type of conductivity along the grown nanotube described herein also allows for the fabrication of p-n diode arrays. Devices based on this technology are expected to possess an extremely low intrinsic capacitance due to small nanotube diameter (1-2 nm for SWCNTs) and therefore, very high operational frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Various embodiments of the present invention also include those which comprise semiconducting nanotubes adapted for opto-electronic applications. In such devices, injected electrons optically recombine with the holes and thus produce the light emission, i.e. a bipolar injection and interband recombination are the mechanisms for the light emission. Electron-hole injection in the forward bias direction will produce an interband photon emission. Two-dimensional quantization of electron and hole energy in the nanotube (i.e. &#x201c;quantum wire&#x201d; effect), with the density of states peaking at the quantum levels, ensures a high light emission efficiency, see E. Kapon, Proc. IEEE, 80, p. 398, 1992 and Book on Quantum Well Lasers, Ed. by P. S. Zory, 1993, p. 461. In addition, the nanotubes are calculated to have oscillator strength orders of magnitude larger than that in conventional direct gap semiconductors, see V. Perebeinos et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 086802, 2005. These features suggest a high optical efficiency in the Nanotube Array Light Emitting Diodes (NALED) and Nanotube Array Injection Laser (NAIL).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The disclosed nanotube array LEDs and Lasers are expected to possess unique performance characteristics due to such nanotube properties as direct optical transitions, which provide a high optical radiation probability, strong quantization of the energy spectrum yielding ballistic electron and hole propagation along the nanotube and resulting in suppression of any carrier trapping and non-radiative recombination. In addition, an ultra small nanotube dimension, much smaller than the light wavelength, allow light escape from the nanotubes into the dielectric without any internal reflections, in contrast with a conventional LED where due to internal light reflections typically only &#x2dc;5% of light is released, see e.g. R. H. Saul et al, LED Device Design, Semiconductors and Semimetals, v. 22, p. 193, Part C, 1985. To completely eliminate the internal reflections at the dielectric/vacuum interface a selective etching of the dielectric is proposed and disclosed below.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the NALED, having the light reflecting bottom metal layer (see below) almost 100% of light output will be redirected to be emitted upward. In addition, other factors adversely affecting the light power in the semiconductor LED, such as interfacial non-radiative recombination or self-absorption in the heterostructure, do not exist in the NALED. Finally, the fabrication technology for NALED is much simpler than that for a classical LED, where a multilayer lattice matched semiconductor heterostructure must be epitaxially grown and then carefully processed.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Even a single nanotube can be used as a light emitter. For a sustainable current of &#x2dc;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>A (equivalent to the current density of &#x2dc;10<sup>9 </sup>A/cm<sup>2 </sup>in a single walled nanotube), the applied voltage of &#x2dc;1V and a conservatively chosen light efficiency of 10%, one obtains the output light power of &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;W from a single nanotube. For the matrix of 100&#xd7;100 nanotubes, 1 &#x3bc;m apart, for the photon energy of &#x2dc;1 eV, it translates into a light power of 10 mW and the light power density of 100 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, unachievable for the existing LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">4. Design and Fabrication of Nanotube Array Light Emitting Diodes (NALED)</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Various embodiments provide for Nanotube Array Light Emitting Diodes and methods of making the same. In one such embodiment, the Nanotube Array Light Emitting Diode comprises (a) a first electrically conductive layer capable of reflection at least 70% of incident light; (b) at least one array of a plurality of nanotubes superposed on, positioned normal to the plane of, and in electrical communication with the first electrically conductive layer, wherein each nanotube of the plurality of nanotubes comprises sequential first and second sections exhibiting opposite first and second semiconductor-type conductivity, respectively, so as to comprise a p-n or n-p semiconductor junction; (c) a first optically transparent or semi-transparent dielectric layer superposed on the first electrically conductive layer having a thickness corresponding to the length of the section of each nanotube exhibiting the first semiconductor-type conductivity; (d) a second optically transparent or semi-transparent dielectric layer superposed on the second dielectric layer having a thickness corresponding to the length of the section of each nanotube exhibiting the second semiconductor-type conductivity; and (e) a second electrically conductive layer superposed on the second dielectric layer and in electrical communication with the at least one array of nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The first electrically conductive layer must be capable of reflecting at least 70% of incident light, though higher levels are preferred. For example, materials capable of reflecting at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% of incident light are increasingly preferred embodiments. Metals, especially polished metals are exemplary materials, with those comprising aluminum being most preferred. Small pads of additional metal may be deposited on the first electrically conductive layer to minimize the contact resistance to the nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As with all of the devices described herein, the presence of a semiconductor junction, in this case a p-n or n-p junction is a required element. Accordingly, those materials which can function in this capacity according to the descriptions herein are preferred embodiments with these devices as well. Devices wherein the nanotubes are SWCNTs are especially preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Again, devices wherein the p-n or n-p junction is centered approximately in the middle of the nanotubes are described, the invention is not limited to such a precise definition of &#x201c;middle,&#x201d; and the previous discussions related to the definition of the term &#x201c;middle&#x201d; apply here.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">It should be appreciated that for a light emitting device to provide its benefit, the device must allow the light generated at the junction to escape. In the present design, the light passes through the &#x201c;upper&#x201d; second dielectric layer. Accordingly, this layer must be comprised of materials capable of transmitting light at the frequencies of interest. Similarly, the purpose of the optically reflective first electrically conductive layer is to reflect the light otherwise directed to the base direction out the &#x201c;top&#x201d; of the device. Similarly, then, the first dielectric layer must also be transparent or semi-transparent (translucent) to light. In this regard, the terms &#x201c;transparent or semi-transparent (translucent) to light&#x201d; refer to the ability to transmit at least 50% of the incident light, with preferred embodiments providing that at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 98% of light be transmitted. Materials capable of providing these levels of transmission may be organic or inorganic glasses or ceramics, for example silicon oxide-based glasses, silicon nitride, or transparent polymers, including polyimide. Taking this concept further, the device may also be constructed so that originally present dielectrics are removed and replaced with nascent air or other gas, or the device evacuated, such that the nanotubes are surrounded by gas or full or partial vacuum. In this way, the active area of the nanotube array is not subject to internal optical reflection and thus the photon output efficiency is maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The second electrically conductive layer, together with small pads of metal having low contact resistance to the nanotubes (see below) provides the electrode complementing the first conductive layer. While it is necessary to make electrical connection to the other end of the nanotube, it must be present in such a ways as to maximize the passage of the transmitted light. Two strategies are useful for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The first strategy provides that the second electrical conductive layer comprises traditional electrically conductive material (e.g., metals) formed as narrow strips, wires, ribbons, or meshes across the surface of the third dielectric layer, the widths of which are designed to provide minimal optical blocking, yet appropriate electrical carrying capacity. In various embodiments, small pads of metal (for example, palladium) may be deposited on the tips of the nanotubes contacting the third dielectric layer and providing electrical communication between the nanotubes and the second conductive layer. The typical metals described as traditionally employed in semiconductor processing may be used in this capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A second, more preferred strategy, is to use optically transparent or semitransparent materials as the second conductive layer, configured either as the narrow strips, wires, ribbons, or meshes just discussed or as complete layers. Various materials are known as usefully employed in this way, including certain electrically conductive polymers, transparent ceramic oxides, or sufficiently thin metals. Exemplary electrically conductive polymers include polyfluorenes, polypyrenes, polyazulenes, polynaphthalenes, polypyrroles, polycarbazoles, polyindoles, polyazepines, polyanalines, polythiophenes, polyphenylene sulfides, polyacetylenes, or poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s. Exemplary transparent ceramic oxide include compositions comprising oxides of cadmium, indium, tin, and/or zinc, including those comprising tin oxide, indium tin oxide, indium zinc oxide, or aluminium doped zinc oxide. Indium tin oxide is a preferred material. Transparent metals, exemplified by gold, silver, or aluminum, may also be used, but are less preferred because of their reflectivity, and care must be taken to avoid reflectivity from the internal surfaces. For example, gold having a thickness of about 10 nm or less, or characterized as exhibiting a resistivity of 10, 15, or 20 ohm/cm<sup>2 </sup>can be deposited either by chemical or vapor deposition, or laminated from commercial sources to as to provide sufficient light transmission and conductivity for the present purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some other embodiments, these methods are used to prepare the NALED devices, having one or more of the features described above.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In other embodiments, these methods use methods for growing nanotubes also as described herein. In particular, such embodiments include those where small pads of catalytic materials are made and used, upon which to grow vertical SWCNTs. Additionally, still other embodiments provide for additional intermediary steps involving the removal any deposited dielectric from the side-walls of the first or second portion of the nanotubes before converting the semiconductor conductivity type of these portions. In certain circumstances, after the deposition of the second dielectric layer, some or all of the nanotubes protrude from the surface of this layer. As when constructing NABT devices, such an occurrence may be by accident or design. In fact, it may be deemed advantageous to leave such protuberances after the deposition of the second dielectric layer to as to provide for improved electrical connectivity with the second conductive layer or metal pad. In such cases, it is useful to polish the surface of the fifth dielectric layer, using techniques standard in the art (e.g., CMP techniques), so as to remove any incidental dielectric, exposing clean nanotube surfaces, and providing for excellent electrical communication between the nanotube and the second conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Other embodiments within the scope of the present invention include those electronic or optoelectronic devices where any of the Nanotube Array Light Emitting Diodes described herein is incorporated. Particularly useful embodiments include those where the Nanotube Array Light Emitting Diode is incorporated into an opaque display, a transparent window, or a reflective mirror (e.g., a computer monitor, television screen, or other device useful for communicating information).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows one embodiment of a NALED structure (the description of materials within this exemplary embodiment should not be considered limiting, rather representative of the materials described above). In this embodiment, the fabrication scenario starts from deposition of the metal electrode <b>80</b>, such as aluminum, having the high optical reflectivity described above, followed by deposition of pads of metal <b>81</b>, for example Pd, having low contact resistance to the nanotubes and then small pads of catalytic metal on top of Pd pads (not shown) to facilitate the nanotube growth. The nanotube matrix <b>82</b> is then grown in the predetermined pattern: this pattern can be a linear array or as a two-dimensional matrix array, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>. A first dielectric layer <b>83</b> is deposited around the grown nanotube array, so as to encase the lower portion of the array. The thickness of the first dielectric layer <b>83</b> reaches approximately a half of the nanotube length. At this stage, the remaining exposed nanotube parts (i.e., those portions extending above the upper surface level of dielectric layer <b>83</b>) are cleaned, and the change of the nanotube type of conductivity is made using the above discussed methods of p-to-n and n-to-p conversions, thus forming a p-n junction. The second dielectric layer <b>84</b> is then deposited. It is preferable to have the total dielectric thickness smaller than the nanotube length, so that the nanotube ends are protruded through the dielectrics and then removed with the dielectric polishing, thereby exposing the nanotube tips. This step is followed by deposition of contact metal pads <b>85</b>. Pd is preferred as a contact material again here to minimize the contact resistance. The size of contact pads <b>85</b> should be minimized to prevent light blocking. In the NALED of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, both the emitted light and reflected light from the bottom metal layer <b>80</b> are directed into the top hemisphere, thus making a surface emitting LED configuration. A high optical reflection of the bottom metal layer <b>80</b> almost doubles the light output.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">An exemplary top view of the NALED in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, shows a matrix array of 5&#xd7;5 nanotubes with the top Pd contacts <b>85</b> connected to the metal contact ring <b>86</b> through the metal belts <b>87</b>. These belts should be made of a narrow width so as to minimize the blocking of the passing light.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In other embodiments, these belts can be removed so as to improve the diode light efficiency if the top contact to the nanotubes, or metal pads attached thereto, is made from optically transparent conductor, such as described above. In this example, ITO is used as an exemplary material for this purpose. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this case, both metal ring <b>86</b> and connecting belts <b>87</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are replaced with top transparent and conducting layer of ITO <b>90</b> placed on top of the dielectric <b>84</b> (<b>91</b>) and pads <b>85</b> (<b>92</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The important feature adversely affecting the photon collection in the semiconductor LED is the internal light reflection at the dielectric/ambient interface. In various embodiments, the additional operation of the dielectric etching to remove both layers of the dielectric (<b>83</b> and <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) will completely eliminate the effect of internal reflection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows such an embodiment. Here, a NALED structure of the same nominal design as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is shown, wherein two dielectric layers <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> (corresponding to <b>83</b> and <b>84</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are etched in the active area of the device <b>108</b>, so that the light can freely leave the diode structure. The contact belts <b>107</b> connecting the top metal contacts <b>105</b> to the contact ring <b>106</b> (corresponding to <b>87</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, respectively), are suspended in the air and attached to the contact ring <b>106</b> at the belt ends.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows another exemplary design, consistent with the designs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>) where the ITO layer <b>110</b> covers the active area <b>118</b> and the dielectric layers <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are etched to eliminate internal reflections. Small openings <b>111</b> in the ITO layer <b>110</b> are introduced to facilitate the selective etching of the dielectrics <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">It is important that the light radiating nanotubes are much smaller in size than the expected light wavelength, for reasons discussed above. In the NALED, having the light reflecting bottom metal layer <b>60</b>, almost 100% of light output will be emitted upward. In addition, other factors adversely affecting the light power in the semiconductor LED, such as interfacial non-radiative recombination or self-absorption in the heterostructure, do not exist in the NALED. Finally, the fabrication technology for NALED is immeasurably simpler than that for a classical LED, where a multilayer lattice matched semiconductor heterostructure must be epitaxially grown and then carefully processed. Even a single nanotube can be used as a light emitter. For a sustainable current of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>A (equivalent to the current density of &#x2dc;10<sup>9 </sup>A/cm<sup>2 </sup>in a single walled nanotube), the applied voltage of &#x2dc;1 V and a conservatively chosen light efficiency of 10%, one obtains the output light power of &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;W from a single nanotube. For the matrix of 100&#xd7;100 nanotubes, 1 &#x3bc;m apart, it translates into a light power of 10 mW and the light power density of 100 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, unachievable for the existing LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">5. Design and Fabrication of Nanotube Array Injector Lasers (NAIL)</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Excellent expected optical efficiency of the nanotubes also produces attractive conditions for the CNT quantum wire laser activity: peaking density of states at the quantum levels make the carrier population inversion quite plausible. In comparison with the existing semiconductor heterostructure quantum wire lasers, see aforementioned citations of E. Kapon, the CNT exhibits significantly more pronounced effect of quantization due to much smaller size of the quantum wire (nanotube diameter): &#x2dc;100 nm for semiconductor case vs. &#x2dc;1 nm for SWCNT. High calculated oscillator strength at the energy gap in the CNT, much higher than that in the semiconductors, would provide lower threshold for lasing. Finally, the NAIL technology is simple and far less expensive than that of the semiconductor-based quantum wire lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Various embodiments provide for Nanotube Array Injector Lasers and methods of making the same. In one such embodiment, a Nanotube Array Injector Lasers comprises: (a) a first electrically conductive layer; (b) at least one array of a plurality of nanotubes superposed on, positioned normal to the plane of, and in electrical communication with the first electrically conductive layer, wherein each nanotube of the plurality of nanotubes comprises sequential first and second sections exhibiting opposite first and second semiconductor-type conductivity, respectively, so as to comprise a p-n or n-p semiconductor junction; (c) a first dielectric layer having a first refractive index superposed on the first electrically conductive layer; (d) a second dielectric layer having a second refractive index superposed on the first dielectric layer, such that the combined thickness of the first and second dielectric layers is about the same as the length of the first section of each nanotube, and wherein the second refractive index is greater than the first refractive index; (e) a third dielectric layer superposed on the second dielectric layer, and having the same thickness and being compositionally equivalent to the second dielectric layer; (f) a fourth dielectric layer superposed on the third dielectric layer, and having the same thickness and being compositionally equivalent to the first dielectric layer, such that the combined thickness of the third and fourth dielectric layers is about the same as the length of the second section of each nanotube, wherein the combined first and fourth dielectric layers define the first cladding of a laser waveguide and the combined second and third dielectric layers define the core of the laser waveguide; (g) a second electrically conductive layer superposed on the fourth dielectric layer and in electrical communication with the at least one array of nanotubes; and (h) two side mirrors positioned opposite to one another, normal to the planes of the first and second conductive layers, and parallel to the at least one nanotube array such that the at least one nanotube array is positioned between the two side mirrors, which are configured to create a Fabri-Perot resonator for the laser action.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Many of the embodiments of this type of device are similar to those described above for the NALED devices, including choices of materials, linear distance spacing, and/or configuration of the p-n or n-p junctions. For example, preferred embodiments of the Nanotube Array Injector Laser include those where the electrically conductive layers comprise palladium and where the nanotubes are single-walled carbon nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the case of the Nanotube Array Injection Lasers, the most preferred embodiments are those wherein the p-n or n-p junctions within a given array are positioned at the same linear distance relative to the other nanotubes in the same array, and that the thickness of the core and cladding layers are made or exist to match the frequencies of the light produced by these junctions. Exemplary thicknesses for each layer generally are in the range of between about 0.1 microns and about 10 microns, or between about 1 micron and about 5 microns The person of ordinary skill in the art of lasers would be well capable of defining these dimensions and appropriate materials of construction. Especially useful materials for these core and cladding layers are SiO<sub>2 </sub>and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>; i.e., wherein said first and fourth dielectric layers comprise SiO<sub>2</sub>, while said second and third dielectric layers comprise Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As derivative embodiments to this device type, the two side mirrors may be removed to produce a Light Emitting Diode. Similarly, other embodiments of this device type include those electronic devices which contain any of the embodiments of the Nanotube Array Injection Laser described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Finally, the invention contemplates methods of making such Nanotube Array Injection Lasers, using the techniques as described herein that appropriate and applicable for the device as described.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. shows an exemplary NAIL structure. The nanotube matrix <b>76</b> is grown on the metal layer <b>120</b>. It is preferable to use Pd layer to minimize the contact resistance. Then four dielectric layers <b>121</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> are sequentially deposited to form the core of the waveguide (<b>122</b> and <b>123</b>) and two cladding layers <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> for efficient light propagation parallel to the substrate plane. The thin practically identical layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> of the core have the index of refraction n<sub>core </sub>larger than that of the cladding layers <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>, n<sub>clad</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">After deposition of the half of the waveguide, i.e. layers <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>, the type of conductivity in the exposed nanotube array is altered by the earlier discussed methods to obtain a p-n junction along the nanotubes, with the change of conductivity occurring in the middle of the nanotube length. Then two other layers, <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>, complete the waveguide structure. After polishing the top dielectric <b>124</b>, to expose the nanotube ends, the top contact layer <b>125</b>, preferably Pd, is deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The optimal thickness D of the total core layer composed of the layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b>, depends on the difference of the refractive indices, n<sub>core</sub>&#x2212;n<sub>clad</sub>, and the wavelength &#x3bb; (lambda). The fraction of the light intensity contained within the core, &#x393; (gamma), is given by, see e.g. J. P. Leburton et al, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B1, 415, 1983:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x393;=(2&#x3c0;<sup>2</sup><i>D</i>2)/&#x3bb;<sup>2</sup>(<i>n</i><sub>core</sub><sup>2</sup><i>&#x2212;n</i><sub>clad</sub><sup>2</sup>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Using the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>material for the core layers <b>122</b> and <b>123</b>, with n<sub>core</sub>=2.5, and SiO<sub>2 </sub>material for the cladding layers <b>121</b> and <b>124</b>, with n<sub>clad</sub>=1.46, one obtains for &#x3bb;&#x2dc;1 micron and &#x393;&#x2dc;1, D&#x2dc;200 nm. The cladding layers <b>121</b> and <b>124</b>, 2 &#x3bc;m each, make the total laser structure thickness of &#x2dc;4.2 micron. Under these conditions, the laser wave strongly decays within cladding layers and practically does not interact with the contact layers <b>120</b> and <b>125</b>. Two mirrors <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> at the ends of the laser bar are then deposited to make a Fabri-Perot resonator. It is also important that in the NAIL optical loss through free-carrier absorption is minimized since the interaction of the laser wave with conductive media occurs only at the nanotubes occupying extremely small device volume.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The NAIL structure without the mirrors <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> will operates as the LED with light propagation within the waveguide structure parallel to the substrate plane.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Thus, the disclosed technology unites together two different industries: electronics, normally relying on Si as a material for integrated circuits, and opto-electronics, typically employing III-V heterostructure materials. The proposed CNT-based devices and fabrication methods cover both these worlds: the new disclosed electronic and photonic devices can be combined on the same substrate, which can be a Si wafer or a piece of glass. The performance of these devices is expected to be greater than that of their semiconductor counterparts, largely due to excellent nanotubes properties, while the manufacturing cost is expected to be significantly lower.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Finally, it is important to emphasize that the nanotube arrays can be built on different dielectric materials, including the Si wafer. In the latter case, the Si electronic chips can be combined into hybrid optoelectronic circuits with fiber-optic signal output. Small disclosed nanotube array diodes can easily match optical fibers with extremely small losses at the interface.</p>
