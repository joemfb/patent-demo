<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a thin film transistor substrate, a manufacturing method thereof, and a liquid crystal display panel. In particular, the present invention relates to a thin film transistor substrate including auxiliary capacitors, a manufacturing method thereof, and a liquid crystal display panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An active matrix liquid crystal display panel includes a TFT substrate in which, e.g., a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;TFT&#x201d;) is provided as a switching element at each pixel which is the minimum unit of an image, a counter substrate arranged so as to face the TFT substrate, and a liquid crystal layer sealed between the foregoing substrates. In the TFT substrate, an auxiliary capacitor is provided at each pixel in order to stably retain an electric charge on part of the liquid crystal layer corresponding to each pixel, i.e., a liquid crystal capacitor. The auxiliary capacitor includes, e.g., a capacitor line provided on the substrate, a gate insulating film provided so as to cover the capacitor line, and a capacitor electrode (e.g., a drain electrode of the TFT) provided on the gate insulating film so as to overlap with the capacitor line.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a method for manufacturing a TFT substrate. In such a method, a gate insulating film, a semiconductor layer (film forming the semiconductor layer), a contact layer (film forming a contact layer pattern), and a conductive layer are vapor-deposited in this order so as to cover gate lines, gate electrodes, and storage electrodes which are formed on an insulating substrate. After a photosensitive film is formed on the conductive layer by two times of light exposure, the semiconductor layer (film forming the semiconductor layer), the contact layer (film forming the contact layer pattern), and the conductive layer are etched in two steps by using the photosensitive film. Then, data lines, source electrodes, the semiconductor layer, the contact layer pattern, drain electrodes, and a storage capacitor conductive pattern are formed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the TFT substrate manufactured by the manufacturing method disclosed in Patent Document 1, a storage capacitor corresponding to the auxiliary capacitor has a multilayer structure of the storage electrode, the gate insulating film, a storage capacitor semiconductor layer, a storage capacitor contact layer pattern, and the storage capacitor conductive pattern. In a TFT substrate manufacturing method in which a step of forming a semiconductor layer, source electrodes, and drain electrodes by using an identical photo mask is simplified, the semiconductor layer is, as in the manufacturing method disclosed in Patent Document 1, positioned below the source electrodes and the drain electrodes, and therefore the semiconductor layer is stacked below a capacitor electrode (drain electrode) serving as an auxiliary capacitor. In such a case, not only a gate insulating film but also the semiconductor layer function as dielectric layers in an auxiliary capacitor having a multilayer structure of a capacitor line, the gate insulating film, the semiconductor layer, and the drain electrode. Thus, a change in electrical capacitance due to a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) structure occurs between the gate insulating film and the semiconductor layer, and a change in electrical capacitance due to a schottky structure occurs between the semiconductor layer and the drain electrode. For such reasons, in a liquid crystal display panel configured to control the potential of pixel electrodes through auxiliary capacitors, the potential of the pixel electrodes is not controlled at a predetermined potential, resulting in occurrence of display defects such as flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing, and it is an objective of the present invention to reduce a change in electrical capacitance of an auxiliary capacitor due to a semiconductor layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to accomplish the foregoing objective, the present invention is configured such that a semiconductor layer made of an oxide semiconductor and a pixel electrode made of an oxide conductor contact each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Specifically, a thin film transistor substrate of the present invention includes a plurality of pixel electrodes provided in a matrix; a plurality of thin film transistors each provided for a corresponding one of the pixel electrodes and connected to the corresponding one of the pixel electrodes; and a plurality of auxiliary capacitors each provided for a corresponding one of the pixel electrodes. Each of the thin film transistors includes a gate electrode provided on a substrate, a gate insulating film provided so as to cover the gate electrode, a semiconductor layer provided on the gate insulating film and having a channel region such that the channel region and the gate electrode overlap with each other, and source and drain electrodes provided on the semiconductor layer and arranged apart from each other with the channel region being interposed therebetween, the channel region being exposed through the source and drain electrodes. Each of the auxiliary capacitors includes a capacitor line made of a material identical to that of the gate electrode and provided in a layer identical to that of the gate electrode, the gate insulating film provided so as to cover the capacitor line, the semiconductor layer provided on the gate insulating film so as to overlap with the capacitor line, and the drain electrode provided on the semiconductor layer and connected to a corresponding one of the pixel electrodes. The semiconductor layer is made of an oxide semiconductor. Each of the pixel electrodes is made of an oxide conductor. The semiconductor layer and each of the pixel electrodes contact each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the foregoing configuration, the semiconductor layer of the thin film transistor is made of the oxide semiconductor, and the pixel electrode is made of the oxide conductor. Thus, at each pixel, a band structure in the semiconductor layer and a band structure in the pixel electrode are similar to each other. The semiconductor layer and the pixel electrode contact each other at each pixel. For such a reason, free carriers in each of the pixel electrodes are dispersed into the semiconductor layer and spread to the proximity of an interface between the semiconductor layer and the gate insulating film, and part of the semiconductor layer corresponding to each of the auxiliary capacitors functions as a conductor. Thus, in the auxiliary capacitor having a multilayer structure of the capacitor line, the gate insulating film, the semiconductor layer, and the drain electrode, when voltage is, at each pixel, applied between the capacitor line and the drain electrode, only the gate insulating film is a dielectric layer for retaining an electric charge in the foregoing part, and therefore a change in electrical capacitance can be reduced. Since the change in electrical capacitance can be reduced in each of the auxiliary capacitors each including the semiconductor layer, a change in electrical capacitance of the auxiliary capacitors due to the semiconductor layer can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Each of the pixel electrodes may include first and second pixel electrodes provided adjacent to each other with a corresponding one of the thin film transistors being interposed therebetween. The drain electrode may include first and second drain electrodes connected respectively to the first and second pixel electrodes.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the foregoing configuration, each of the pixel electrodes includes the first and second pixel electrodes. The drain electrode includes the first and second drain electrodes connected respectively to the first and second pixel electrodes. Each of the auxiliary capacitors includes the first auxiliary capacitor having a multilayer structure of the first capacitor line, the gate insulating film, the semiconductor layer, and the first drain electrode, and the second auxiliary capacitor having a multilayer structure of the second capacitor line, the gate insulating film, the semiconductor layer, and the second drain electrode. Thus, e.g., the thin film transistor substrate having, at each pixel, a structure in which sub-pixels corresponding respectively to the first and second pixel electrodes are different from each other in brightness thereof, i.e., a multi-pixel structure of a light sub-pixel and a dark sub-pixel, is specifically configured. Typically in the thin film transistor substrate having the multi-pixel structure, voltage to be applied between the first capacitor line and the first drain electrode and voltage to be applied between the second capacitor line and the second drain electrode are differentiated from each other in order to differentiate between voltage to be applied to part of the liquid crystal layer corresponding to the light sub-pixel and voltage to be applied to part of the liquid crystal layer corresponding to the dark sub-pixel. In such a case, if the semiconductor layer is simply stacked inside the first and second auxiliary capacitors, the foregoing differentiation may result in a change in electrical capacitance of the first and second auxiliary capacitors. Consequently, there is a possibility that, e.g., a balance with voltage of a common electrode of a counter substrate is disrupted. However, according to the foregoing configuration, the following can be reduced: a change in electrical capacitance of the first auxiliary capacitor due to voltage applied between the first capacitor line and the first drain electrode; and a change in electrical capacitance of the second auxiliary capacitor due to voltage applied between the second capacitor line and the second drain electrode. Thus, in a liquid crystal display panel including the thin film transistor substrate, predetermined voltage is applied to part of the liquid crystal layer corresponding to the light sub-pixel and part of the liquid crystal layer corresponding to the dark sub-pixel in the state in which a balance with voltage of the common electrode of the counter substrate is maintained at each pixel.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the foregoing method, four photo masks are used as follows to manufacture the thin film transistor substrate including the auxiliary capacitors. For example, a first photo mask is, in the gate layer formation step, used to form the gate electrode and the capacitor line on the insulating substrate. A second photo mask is, in the resist pattern formation step, used to form the resist pattern, and the resist pattern is, in the first etching step, used to form the source and drain electrodes and the channel region. Then, the resist pattern formed from the reflowed resist pattern is, in the second etching step, used to form the semiconductor layer. In such a manner, the thin film transistor is formed. A third photo mask is, in the interlayer insulating film formation step, used to form the interlayer insulating film having the contact hole. A fourth photo mask is, in the pixel electrode formation step, used to form the pixel electrodes. In the manufactured thin transistor film substrate, the semiconductor layer is, at each pixel, positioned below the drain electrode. However, since part of the semiconductor film is exposed through the drain electrode when the source and drain electrodes and the channel region are formed in the first etching step, the pixel electrodes are formed in the pixel electrode formation step such that the semiconductor layer contacts each of the pixel electrodes at each pixel. In the foregoing configuration, the semiconductor layer is made of the oxide semiconductor, and the pixel electrodes are made of the oxide conductor. Thus, at each pixel, a band structure in the semiconductor layer and a band structure in each of the pixel electrodes are similar to each other. For such a reason, free carriers in each of the pixel electrodes are dispersed into the semiconductor layer and spread to the proximity of an interface between the semiconductor layer and the gate insulating film, and part of the semiconductor layer corresponding to each of the auxiliary capacitors functions as a conductor. Thus, in the auxiliary capacitor having a multilayer structure of the capacitor line, the gate insulating film, the semiconductor layer, and the drain electrode, when voltage is, at each pixel, applied between the capacitor line and the drain electrode, only the gate insulating film is a dielectric layer for retaining an electric charge in the foregoing part, and therefore a change in electrical capacitance can be reduced. Since the change in electrical capacitance can be reduced in each of the auxiliary capacitors each including the semiconductor layer, a change in electrical capacitance of the auxiliary capacitors due to the semiconductor layer can be reduced.</p>

The first photo mask is, in the gate layer formation step, used to form the gate electrode <b>11</b><i>aa</i>, the first capacitor line <b>11</b><i>ba</i>, and the second capacitor line <b>11</b><i>bb </i>on the insulating substrate <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The second photo mask is, in the resist pattern formation step, used to form the resist pattern Raa, and the resist pattern Raa is, in the first etching step, used to form the source electrode <b>14</b><i>aa</i>, the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba</i>, the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb</i>, and the channel regions C. Then, the resist pattern Rab formed from the reflowed resist pattern Raa is, in the second etching step, used to form the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>. In such a manner, the TFT <b>5</b><i>a </i>is formed. The third photo mask is, in the interlayer insulating film formation step, used to form the interlayer insulating film <b>15</b><i>a </i>having the contact holes <b>15</b><i>ca</i>, <b>15</b><i>cb</i>. The fourth photo mask is, in the pixel electrode formation step, used to form the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In such a manner, the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>are formed. In the manufactured TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>is, at each of the sub-pixels Pa, Pb, positioned below the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba </i>or the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb</i>. However, since part of the semiconductor film <b>13</b><i>a </i>is exposed through the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba </i>and the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb </i>when the source electrode <b>14</b><i>aa</i>, the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba</i>, the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb </i>and the channel regions C are formed in the first etching step, the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b </i>are formed in the pixel electrode formation step such that the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>contacts the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>or the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b </i>at each of the sub-pixels Pa, Pb. In the foregoing configuration, the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>is made of an oxide semiconductor, and the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b </i>are made of an oxide conductor. Thus, at each of the sub-pixels Pa, Pb, a band structure in the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>and a band structure in the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>or the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b </i>are similar to each other. For such a reason, free carriers in the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b </i>are, at each of the sub-pixels Pa, Pb, dispersed into the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>and spread to the proximity of an interface between the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the gate insulating film <b>12</b>, and part of the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>functions as a conductor. Thus, in the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>having a multilayer structure of the first capacitor line <b>11</b><i>ba</i>, the gate insulating film <b>12</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>having a multilayer structure of the second capacitor line <b>11</b><i>bb</i>, the gate insulating film <b>12</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb</i>, when voltage is applied to part between the first capacitor line <b>11</b><i>ba </i>and the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba </i>and between the second capacitor line <b>11</b><i>bb </i>and the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb</i>, only the gate insulating film <b>12</b> is a dielectric layer for retaining an electric charge in the foregoing part, and therefore a change in electrical capacitance can be reduced. Since the change in electrical capacitance can be reduced in the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>each including the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>, a change in electrical capacitance of the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>due to the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the present embodiment, each of the pixels P has a multi-pixel structure of the light sub-pixel (Pa) and the dark sub-pixel (Pb). In order to differentiate between voltage to be applied to part of the liquid crystal layer <b>45</b> corresponding to the light sub-pixel (Pa) and voltage to be applied to part of the liquid crystal layer <b>45</b> corresponding to the dark sub-pixel (Pb), voltage to be applied between the first capacitor line <b>11</b><i>ba </i>and the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba </i>and voltage to be applied between the second capacitor line <b>11</b><i>bb </i>and the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb </i>are differentiated from each other. In such a case, e.g., if a semiconductor layer is simply stacked inside first and second auxiliary capacitors, the foregoing differentiation may result in a change in electrical capacitance of the first and second auxiliary capacitors. On the other hand, in the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the present embodiment, since the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>and each of the first and second pixel electrodes <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>contact, as described above, each other at each of the sub-pixels Pa, Pb, the following can be effectively reduced: a change in electrical capacitance of the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>due to voltage applied between the first capacitor line <b>11</b><i>ba </i>and the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba</i>; and a change in electrical capacitance of the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>due to voltage applied between the second capacitor line <b>11</b><i>bb </i>and the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb</i>. In the liquid crystal display panel <b>50</b> including the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the change in electrical capacitance of the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>can be reduced. Thus, predetermined voltage can be applied to part of the liquid crystal layer <b>45</b> corresponding to the light sub-pixel (Pa) and part of the liquid crystal layer <b>45</b> corresponding to the dark sub-pixel (Pb) in the state in which a balance with voltage of the common electrode <b>33</b> of the counter substrate <b>40</b> is maintained at each of the sub-pixels Pa, Pb, thereby reducing occurrence of display defects such as flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the present embodiment, part of the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>b </i>functions as a conductor. Thus, even if the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>is interposed between the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba </i>and between the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b </i>and the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb</i>, the first pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second pixel electrode <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be satisfactorily connected respectively to the first drain electrode <b>14</b><i>ba </i>and the second drain electrode <b>14</b><i>bb</i>. On the other hand, in the case where part of a semiconductor layer corresponding to an auxiliary capacitor is, for the purpose of reducing a change in electrical capacitance of the auxiliary capacitor, removed and a pixel electrode forms a capacitor electrode, the pixel electrode and a drain electrode are connected together only at a side surface of a contact hole, and therefore there are concerns about connection failure between the pixel electrode and the drain electrode. In order to overcome the connection failure, the diameter of the contact hole is increased. However, this leads to concerns about reduction in aperture ratio of a pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the present embodiment, since the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>is made of the oxide semiconductor, the TFT <b>5</b><i>a </i>having favorable properties such as high mobility, high reliability, and low off-current can be realized.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film (having a thickness of about 1000-4000 &#x212b;) etc. are, by, e.g., the CVD, formed on the entirety of the substrate from which the resist pattern Rbb is removed. In such a manner, an inorganic insulating film <b>20</b> is formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>a</i>). The silicon oxide film is preferable as the inorganic insulating film <b>20</b>, but, e.g., a multilayer film of a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride film or a silicon nitride film may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Subsequently, a photosensitive resin film is, by, e.g., spin coating, formed on the entirety of the substrate on which the inorganic insulating film <b>20</b> is formed. In such a manner, an organic insulating film <b>21</b> is formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Then, the organic insulating film <b>21</b> is exposed to light, developed, and baked by using a third photo mask. In such a manner, a second interlayer insulating film <b>21</b><i>a </i>having a contact hole <b>21</b><i>c </i>is formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Part of the inorganic insulating film <b>20</b> exposed through the contact hole <b>21</b><i>c </i>of the second interlayer insulating film <b>21</b><i>a </i>is etched, thereby forming a first interlayer insulating film <b>20</b><i>a </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>a</i>). In such a manner, an interlayer insulating film <b>22</b><i>a </i>including the first interlayer insulating film <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the second interlayer insulating film <b>21</b><i>a </i>is formed.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Pixel Electrode Formation Step</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">First, an ITO film (having a thickness of about 600-2000 &#x212b;) etc. are, by, e.g., the sputtering, formed on the entirety of the substrate on which the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b><i>a </i>is formed in the interlayer insulating film formation step. In such a manner, a transparent conductive film <b>23</b> is formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Subsequently, the transparent conductive film <b>23</b> is patterned by using a fourth photo mask. In such a manner, a first pixel electrode <b>23</b><i>a </i>and a second pixel electrode are formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and a first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>c </i>and a second auxiliary capacitor are formed with the first pixel electrode <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the second pixel electrode contacting the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the foregoing manner, the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>b </i>can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As described above, in the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the manufacturing method thereof according to the present embodiment, since the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>d </i>made of the oxide semiconductor contacts, as in the first embodiment, the first pixel electrode <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the second pixel electrode made of the oxide conductor, a change in electrical capacitance of the first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>c </i>and the second auxiliary capacitor due to the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>d </i>can be reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Third Embodiment of the Invention</heading>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the second embodiment, the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>b </i>in which the second interlayer insulating film forming the interlayer insulating film is formed with no color has been described.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>c </i>can be manufactured in such a manner that light exposure and development of a photosensitive resin film colored red, green, or blue is, for each of the three colors, repeated in the interlayer insulating film formation step of the manufacturing method of the second embodiment. Note that a counter substrate arranged so as to face the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>c </i>has no color filter configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described above, in the TFT substrate <b>30</b><i>c </i>and a manufacturing method thereof according to the present embodiment, since a semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>d </i>made of an oxide semiconductor contacts, as in each of the foregoing embodiments, a first pixel electrode <b>23</b><i>a </i>and a second pixel electrode made of an oxide conductor, a change in electrical capacitance of a first auxiliary capacitor <b>6</b><i>c </i>and a second auxiliary capacitor due to the semiconductor layer <b>13</b><i>d </i>can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In each of the foregoing embodiments, the TFT substrate having the multi-pixel structure has been described as an example. However, the present invention is applicable to a TFT substrate having a single pixel structure.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In each of the foregoing embodiments, the gate insulting film having the multilayer structure has been described as an example. However, the gate insulating film may have a single layer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In each of the foregoing embodiments, the TFT substrate manufacturing method in which only four photo masks are used because of the reflow of the resist pattern has been described as an example. However, the present invention is applicable to a TFT substrate manufacturing method in which only four masks are used because a photosensitive resin film is exposed to light through a halftone or gray-tone mask to form a resist pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In each of the foregoing embodiments, the TFT substrate manufacturing method in which the resist pattern is reflowed by heating has been described as an example.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In each of the foregoing embodiments, the TFT substrate in which the electrode of the TFT connected to the pixel electrode serves as the drain electrode has been described as an example.
