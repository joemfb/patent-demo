<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0052400, filed on May 31, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With advent of point-of-care (POS) measurements, the importance of, and demand for, gene analysis, in vitro diagnosis (IVD), and gene base sequence analysis continue to increase. To meet the growing importance and demand, platforms and systems have been developed to perform a large number of tests with a small amount of samples. For example, microfluidic platforms and systems for microfluidic chips or lab-on-a-chip applications are receiving considerable attention for high throughout analysis. A microfluidic device includes a plurality of microfluidic channels and chambers designed to control and manipulate a very small amount of fluid. Using a microfluidic device may minimize the reaction time of microfluid and allow simultaneously the reaction of microfluid and measurement of the reaction result. Such a microfluidic device may be fabricated using various methods in which diverse materials are used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Meanwhile, for example, during gene analysis, in order to precisely detect the presence of specific DNA or the amount of the DNA in a sample, an actual sample has to be sufficiently amplified for measurement after its purification/extraction. Among various gene amplification techniques, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification is most widely used. A fluorescence detection method is commonly used to detect DNA amplified through PCR. For example, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) uses a plurality of fluorescent dyes/probes and primer sets to amplify and detect/measure a target sample in real time. The principle of qPCR using a TaqMan probe is that a TaqMan probe falls off a template during DNA amplification, thereby having fluorescent characteristics. That is, as a PCR cycle progresses, the number of TaqMan probes cleaved from each template exponentially increases. As a result, the level of a fluorescence signal exponentially increases. By measuring a change in such a fluorescence signal level with an optical system, the presence of a target sample may be determined and a quantitative analysis of the target sample may be allowed. As a PCR cycle progresses, a fluorescence signal level follows an S-curve in which a threshold cycle Ct is set and measured at the point where the fluorescence signal level rapidly changes. Platforms for IVD, gene analysis, biomarker development, gene base sequence analysis using a qPCR technique have already been commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A fluorescence detecting optical system is configured to measure the level of a fluorescence signal or a change in the level thereof due to bio reactions within a microfluidic device such as a microfluidic chip or PCR chip. For example, a fluorescence detecting optical system may irradiate excitation light on a sample labeled with a fluorescent dye and detect fluorescence radiated from the fluorescent dye excited with the excitation light. However, most fluorescent dyes have a wavelength region overlapping between wavelength bands of excitation light and fluorescent light. Thus, an excitation light filter and a fluorescent light filter may be designed in such a way that a wavelength band passed by the excitation light filter does not overlap a wavelength band passed by the fluorescent light filter. If the wavelength bands passed by the excitation light filter and the fluorescent light filter overlap each other, the excitation light is not completely separated from the fluorescent light, thereby causing the excitation light reflected from the microfluidic device to be incident on a photodetector. Because excitation light is usually about 10<sup>5 </sup>to 10<sup>6 </sup>times brighter than fluorescent light emitted by a fluorescent dye, crosstalk between the excitation light and the fluorescent light may degrade the detection performance of a fluorescence detecting optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus including a plurality of fluorescence detecting optical systems for detecting different colors of fluorescence may suffer from crosstalk between excitation light in adjacent wavelength ranges and between fluorescent light in adjacent wavelength ranges according to the design of an excitation light filter, a fluorescent light filter, and a dichroic filter because there is an overlapping region between excitation light in adjacent wavelength ranges and between fluorescent light in adjacent wavelength ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to prevent occurrence of such crosstalk, the excitation light filter and the fluorescent light filter are usually designed to pass a narrow wavelength band (several tends of nm). However, as wavelength ranges transmitted by the excitation light filter and the fluorescent light filter decrease, the intensities of the excitation light and the fluorescent light decreases, thereby resulting in the degradation of detection performance. Furthermore, it is difficult to design a plurality of excitation light filters and a plurality of fluorescent light filters so that transmission wavelength bands thereof do not overlap each other. In order to overcome the drawbacks, compensation of crosstalk using software has been proposed. However, this approach is difficult to apply because the result may vary greatly depending on a selected coefficient value.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, a portion of excitation light emitted by a light source in a fluorescence detecting optical system is reflected back from a microfluidic device to the light source. This may cause an interference between excitation light emitted by the light source and that reflected from the microfluidic device. The interference between the excitation light may result in noise, thereby adversely affecting the detection performance of the fluorescence detecting optical system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Provided are a fluorescence detecting optical system and a multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus including the same, which may effectively reduce crosstalk between excitation light and fluorescent light or between fluorescent light in adjacent wavelength bands and alleviate noise produced due to reflected excitation light.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention, a fluorescence detecting optical system includes: a light source unit that emits excitation light having a first polarization component; an objective lens positioned to focus the excitation light onto a microfluidic device (e.g., comprising a fluorescently labeled sample) or other type of fluorescent sample; a fluorescence detector for detecting fluorescent light generated when a sample within the microfluidic device is excited with the excitation light; and a light delivery unit that delivers the excitation light emitted by the light source unit to the microfluidic device or other sample, and delivers the fluorescent light generated in the microfluidic device or by the sample to the fluorescence detector.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The light delivery unit may be configured to convert excitation light reflected from the microfluidic device or other sample to excitation light having a second polarization component perpendicular to the first polarization component and reflect the excitation light having the second polarization component away from an optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The light delivery unit may include: a first beam splitter disposed between the objective lens and the fluorescence detector so as to transmit at least a portion of incident light and reflect the remaining portion thereof; a second beam splitter disposed between the first beam splitter and the light source unit so as to transmit light with the first polarization component and reflects light with the second polarization component; a first quarter-wave plate disposed between the second and first beam splitters; a third beam splitter disposed between the first beam splitter and the fluorescence detector so as to transmit light with the first polarization component and reflect light with the second polarization component; and a second quarter-wave plate disposed between the third beam splitter and the first beam splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, the first beam splitter may be a half mirror transmitting 50% of incident light and reflecting the remaining 50% thereof, or a dichroic filter reflecting excitation light and transmitting fluorescent light.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, the second and third beam splitters may be polarizing beam splitters.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fluorescence detecting optical system may further include an automatic focusing unit detecting excitation light having the second polarization component reflected by the second or third beam splitter, calculating a focus error of the objective lens, and adjusting a focus position of the objective lens.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The light source unit may include: a light source emitting excitation light; a polarizer transmitting light having the first polarization component and blocking light having the second polarization component perpendicular to the first polarization component; and a collimating lens collimating the excitation light into a parallel beam.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The light source unit may further include an excitation light filter transmitting only excitation light in a predetermined wavelength band.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The fluorescence detector may include a photodetector detecting fluorescent light emitted from a sample (e.g., within the microfluidic device) and a focusing lens focusing the fluorescent light on the photodetector.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The fluorescence detector may further include a fluorescent light filter transmitting only fluorescent light.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The light source unit may include a light source emitting excitation light and a first band pass filter transmitting only excitation light in a predetermined wavelength band. The fluorescence detector may include a photodetector detecting fluorescent light and a second band pass filter transmitting only fluorescent light. Transmission bands of the first and second band pass filters may partially overlap each other.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, each of the first and second excitation light filters may be the same dual band pass filter that transmits both of the first and second excitation light.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, the beam splitter may be a half mirror designed to transmit more than about 95% of light incident on a first surface thereof opposite to the first light source while reflecting more than 95% of light incident on a second surface opposite to the second light source.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. In the drawings, the size of each element may be exaggerated for clarity and convenience of explanation. In this regard, the present embodiments may have different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the descriptions set forth herein. Accordingly, the embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects of the present description.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary construction of a fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment includes a light source <b>101</b> emitting excitation light, a beam splitter <b>107</b> reflecting a portion of incident light and transmitting the remaining portion thereof, an objective lens <b>108</b> focusing the excitation light reflected by the beam splitter <b>107</b> onto a chamber (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at <b>151</b>) of a microfluidic device <b>150</b>, and a photodetector <b>113</b> detecting fluorescent light generated in a sample within the chamber <b>151</b>. The fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> further includes an excitation light filter <b>102</b>, a polarizer <b>103</b>, a collimating lens <b>104</b>, a first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>, and a first quarter-wave plate <b>106</b> located in an optical path between the light source <b>101</b> and the beam splitter <b>107</b>. The excitation light filter <b>102</b> transmits only excitation light having a predetermined wavelength range. The polarizer <b>103</b> transmits light having a first polarization component and blocks light having a second polarization component perpendicular to the first polarization component. The collimating lens <b>104</b> collimates the excitation light into a parallel beam. The first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> transmits light having the first polarization component and reflects light having the second polarization component perpendicular thereto. The first quarter-wave plate <b>106</b> delays the phase of incident light by one quarter of a wavelength of the incident light. The fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> further includes a second quarter-wave plate <b>109</b>, a second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b>, a fluorescent light filter <b>111</b>, and a focusing lens <b>112</b> located in an optical path between the beam splitter <b>107</b> and the photodetector <b>113</b>. The second quarter-wave plate <b>109</b> retards the phase of incident light by a quarter of a wavelength of the incident light, a second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b> transmits light having the first polarization component and reflects light having the second polarization component perpendicular thereto. The fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> transmits only fluorescent light of the light transmitted through the second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b>. The focusing lens <b>112</b> focuses fluorescent light onto the photodetector <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the above construction, the light source <b>101</b>, the excitation light filter <b>102</b>, the polarizer <b>103</b>, and the collimating lens <b>104</b> form a light source unit. For example, the light source <b>101</b> may be a laser diode (LD) or light-emitting diode (LED) emitting light of a predetermined wavelength, or a halogen lamp or white LED emitting white light. The excitation light filter <b>102</b> may be a band pass filter that transmits only excitation light &#x3bb;e in a predetermined wavelength band. For example, the excitation light filter <b>102</b> may be designed to transmit excitation light in a wavelength band having the highest absorption rate with respect to a fluorescent dye used to label a sample within the chamber <b>151</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the excitation light filter <b>102</b> is disposed immediately in front of the light source <b>101</b>, it is not limited thereto. For example, the excitation light filter <b>102</b> may be disposed anywhere between the light source <b>101</b> and the beam splitter <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The polarizer <b>103</b> transmits excitation light with the first polarization component (e.g., p-polarization) and blocks excitation light with the second polarization component (e.g., s-polarization) perpendicular thereto. Thus, the excitation light that has passed through the polarizer <b>103</b> has only the first polarization component. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the polarizer <b>103</b> is disposed between the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the collimating lens <b>104</b>, it is not limited thereto. For example, the polarizer <b>103</b> may be disposed anywhere between the light source <b>101</b> and the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>. Furthermore, when the light source <b>101</b> emits unpolarized light, the polarizer <b>103</b> is used. Thus, when the light source <b>101</b> is a polarized light source that emits light with a predetermined polarization component, the polarizer <b>103</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The fluorescent light filter <b>111</b>, the focusing lens <b>112</b>, and the photodetector <b>113</b> form a fluorescence detecting unit that detects fluorescent light generated in the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>. The fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> blocks other light than fluorescent light so as not to reach the photodetector <b>113</b>. For example, the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> may be a band pass filter that passes only fluorescent light &#x3bb;f in a second wavelength band generated when a sample within the chamber <b>151</b> is excited with excitation light in a first wavelength band. For example, the photodetector <b>113</b> may be a photodiode (PD), a photodiode array, a photo multiplier tube (PMT), a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor, a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor, or an avalanche PD (APD).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Meanwhile, the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>, the first quarter-wave plate <b>106</b>, the beam splitter <b>107</b>, the second quarter-wave plate <b>109</b>, and the second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b> form a light delivery unit that delivers excitation light emitted by the light source <b>101</b> to the microfluidic device <b>150</b> and fluorescent light generated in the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b> to the photodetector <b>113</b>. The first and second polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> and <b>110</b> transmits or reflects incident light according to the polarization direction of the incident light. For example, the first and second polarizing beam splitters <b>105</b> and <b>110</b> may transmit light of the first polarization component (e.g., p-polarization) and reflects light of the second polarization component (e.g., s-polarization) perpendicular thereto. The first and second quarter-wave plates <b>106</b> and <b>109</b> delay the phase of incident light by one quarter of a wavelength of the incident light. According to optical principles, a quarter-wavelength phase shift converts linearly polarized light to circularly polarized light and vice versa. When the linearly polarized light passes through the first or second quarter wave-plate <b>106</b> or <b>109</b> twice, it suffers a half-wavelength phase delay and is changed to linearly polarized light having a polarization direction perpendicular to the original polarization direction. For example, p-polarized light may be converted to s-polarized light as it passes through the first or second quarter-wave plate <b>106</b> or <b>109</b> twice.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The beam splitter <b>107</b> transmits a portion of incident light and reflects the remaining portion thereof. For example, the beam splitter <b>107</b> may be a half mirror disposed at 45 degrees with respect to an optical axis. In this case, the half mirror may be designed to transmit 50% of incident light and reflect the remaining 50% thereof. Instead of the half mirror, a dichroic mirror having wavelength selectivity may be used as the beam splitter <b>107</b>. For example, the dichroic mirror may reflect excitation light &#x3bb;e in the first wavelength band and transmit fluorescent light &#x3bb;f in the second wavelength band. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an optical path between the light source <b>101</b> and the microfluidic device <b>150</b> is bent while an optical path between the photodetector <b>113</b> and the microfluidic device <b>150</b> is straight, it is not limited thereto. Depending on the type of the beam splitter <b>107</b> used, the optical path between the light source <b>101</b> and the microfluidic device <b>150</b> may be straight while the optical path between the photodetector <b>113</b> and the microfluidic device <b>150</b> may be bent. To achieve this, if the beam splitter <b>107</b> is a half mirror, it may rotate by 90 degrees. Alternatively, the beam splitter <b>107</b> may be a dichroic filter that transmits excitation light &#x3bb;e in the first wavelength band and reflects fluorescent light &#x3bb;f in the second wavelength band.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Hereinafter, the operation of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For convenience of explanation, it is assumed that the polarizer <b>103</b> transmits light having p-polarization component while blocking light having s-polarization component. The first and second beam splitters <b>105</b> and <b>110</b> are assumed to transmit light having p-polarization component and reflect light having s-polarization component. The beam splitter <b>107</b> is assumed to be a half mirror inclined at 45 degrees with respect to an optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, the light source <b>101</b> emits excitation light upon being turned on. The excitation light has only a first wavelength band as it passes through the excitation light filter <b>102</b>. Thereafter, the excitation light becomes polarized to have a predetermined polarization component (e.g., p-polarization) as it passes through the polarizer <b>103</b>. The resulting excitation light is collimated into a parallel beam by the collimating lens <b>104</b>. The excitation light &#x3bb;e_p having the p-polarization component passes through the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> and is converted to excitation light &#x3bb;e_c having circular polarization by the first quarter-wave plate <b>106</b>. A portion of the excitation light &#x3bb;e_c is then reflected by the beam splitter <b>107</b> and focused onto the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b> by the objective lens <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The fluorescent dye used to label the sample within the chamber <b>151</b> is excited by the excitation light to emit fluorescent light &#x3bb;f in the second wavelength band. The fluorescent light is unpolarized light having all polarization components. To reflect the excitation light and fluorescent light, the microfluidic device <b>150</b> may be formed of a reflective material such as silicon. Alternatively, a reflective coating is formed on the microfluidic device <b>150</b>. Thus, the remaining portion of the excitation light &#x3bb;e_c not absorbed into the fluorescent dye and the fluorescent light &#x3bb;f emitted by the fluorescent dye are reflected from the microfluidic device <b>150</b> onto the beam splitter <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Then, portions of the excitation light (&#x3bb;e_c) and fluorescent light &#x3bb;f are transmitted by the beam splitter <b>107</b> toward the second quarter-wave plate <b>109</b> while the remaining portions thereof are reflected by the beam splitter <b>107</b> toward the first quarter-wave plate <b>106</b>. As the remaining portions pass through the first quarter-wave plate <b>106</b>, the excitation light &#x3bb;e_c having the circular polarization is converted to excitation light &#x3bb;e_s having s-polarization component. On the other hand, the fluorescent light still remains unpolarized. The excitation light &#x3bb;e_s having the s-polarization component is thereafter reflected by the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>, thereby deviating from an optical path. Thus, because the excitation light reflected from the microfluidic device <b>150</b> is not incident on the light source <b>101</b>, it is possible to suppress noise due to interference of the excitation light. Meanwhile, fluorescent light having a p-polarization component in the fluorescent light that is incident on the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> passes through the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> but is blocked by the excitation light filter <b>102</b>. Furthermore, since the fluorescent light has much lower intensity than the excitation light, it slightly affects the operation of the light source <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As the portions of the excitation light &#x3bb;e_c and fluorescent light &#x3bb;f transmitted by the beam splitter <b>107</b> passes through the second quarter-wave plate <b>109</b>, the excitation light &#x3bb;e_c having the circular polarization is changed to excitation light &#x3bb;e_s having an s-polarization component. The fluorescent light still remains unpolarized. The excitation light &#x3bb;e_s having the s-polarization component is thereafter reflected by the second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b>, thereby deviating from an optical path. That is, because the excitation light reflected from the microfluidic device <b>150</b> does not reach the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b>, it is possible to reduce the possibility that interference may occur between the excitation light and fluorescent light in the photodetector <b>113</b>. Meanwhile, fluorescent light having a p-polarization component in the fluorescent light incident on the second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b> passes through the second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b>, the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> and the focusing lens <b>113</b> and is incident on the photodetector <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> uses polarizing elements such as the polarizer <b>103</b>, the first and second polarizing beam splitters <b>105</b> and <b>110</b>, and the first and second quarter-wave plates <b>106</b> and <b>109</b> to appropriately control the propagation paths of the excitation light and the fluorescent light. In particular, by reflecting the remaining excitation light reflected from the microfluidic device <b>150</b> away from the optical path, the remaining excitation light may be prevented from entering the light source <b>101</b> and the photodetector <b>113</b>. Thus, according to the present embodiment, optical crosstalk may be minimized without using software. It is also possible to suppress noise due to the excitation light reflected from the microfluidic device <b>150</b> reentering the light source <b>101</b>. Even when the light source <b>101</b> emitting white light is used, it is not necessary to design a separate filter for blocking infrared (IR) light and ultraviolet (UV) light. Furthermore, by using an affordable half mirror as well as expensive dichroic filter, the manufacturing costs of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> may be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">By combining a plurality of fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b>, a multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus capable of simultaneously detecting fluorescence for multiple colors is achieved. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary construction of a multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> including the above-described fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> includes first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>detecting fluorescent light in different wavelength bands using excitation light in different wavelength bands. Although the multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> includes the four fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d</i>, it is not limited thereto. Each of the four fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>has the same construction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except for wavelengths of excitation light and fluorescent light.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, the first and second fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>may be constructed to irradiate excitation light in first and third wavelength bands and detect fluorescent light in second and fourth wavelength bands, respectively. The third and fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>c </i>and <b>100</b><i>d </i>may be constructed to irradiate excitation light in fifth and seventh wavelength bands and detect fluorescent light in sixth and eighth wavelength bands, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To achieve this, each of the first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>includes the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> having different transmission bands. According to the polarization principles, as described above, each of the first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>prevents the remaining excitation light from entering the light source <b>101</b> and the photodetector <b>113</b>. Thus, the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> in each of the first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>may be designed without considering crosstalk. That is, multiple excitation light filters <b>102</b> and multiple fluorescent light filters <b>111</b> do not have to be designed so that the transmission bands do not overlap each other.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates transmission bands of multiple excitation light filters <b>102</b> and multiple fluorescent light filters <b>111</b> in the respective first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>used in the multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, when the first fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b><i>a </i>detects fluorescent light using cyan excitation light, transmission bands C and C&#x2032; of the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> may partially overlap each other. In the second fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b><i>b </i>detecting fluorescent light using amber excitation light, transmission bands A and A&#x2032; of the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> may partially overlap each other. In the third fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b><i>c </i>detecting fluorescent light using green excitation light, the transmission bands G and G&#x2032; of the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> may partially overlap each other. In the fourth fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b><i>d </i>detecting fluorescent light using red excitation light, the transmission bands R and R&#x2032; of the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> may partially overlap each other. Furthermore, adjacent channels may partially overlap each other. For example, there may be partial overlaps between transmission bands A&#x2032; and G and between transmission bands G&#x2032; and R. Thus, by designing the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> so as to have wide transmission bands, the detection performance of the multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> may be improved. In particular, by designing the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent filter <b>111</b> to have transmission bands centered at an excitation absorption peak and an emission peak of a fluorescent dye, respectively, light utilization efficiency of the fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> may be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> according to the present embodiment further includes a lead screw <b>501</b> and a guide rail <b>502</b> as a transport element for transporting the first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>along a path defined by the rail. Each of the first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>has one end engaged to the lead screw <b>501</b> and the other end supported by the guide rail <b>502</b>. In the above construction, when a motor (not shown) connected to the lead screw <b>501</b> rotates the lead screw <b>501</b>, the fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>may move along directions indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The one or more optical systems, for instance, can be transported relative to a surface, sample, or array of samples. Thus, the first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b><i>a </i>through <b>100</b><i>d </i>may detect fluorescence while simultaneously moving over multiple chambers <b>151</b> through <b>154</b> in a sequential way.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">This foregoing exemplary constructions of an apparatus are described with reference to a first through fourth fluorescence detecting optical systems for the purposes of illustration, but are not limited to any particular number of fluorescence detecting optical systems.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary construction of a fluorescence detecting optical system <b>200</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention. The fluorescence detecting optical system <b>200</b> has the same construction as the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> except for omission of the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b>. Instead of being used in the multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b>, the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>200</b> may be separated and used individually for detection of single color fluorescence. Because there is no possibility of interference between adjacent channels when the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>200</b> is used individually, the excitation light filter <b>102</b> and the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b> may be omitted. Despite the absence of the fluorescent light filter <b>111</b>, the remaining excitation light is not incident on a photodetector <b>113</b> because it is deviated from an optical path by a second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b>. Furthermore, when excitation wavelengths and fluorescence emission wavelengths of a FAM dye (cyan) and Quasar <b>670</b> fluorescent dye (red) are far apart from each other, there may be little possibility of interference therebetween. Thus, in this case, two-color fluorescence detection may be performed simultaneously using two fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary construction of a fluorescence detecting optical system <b>300</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention. The fluorescence detecting optical system <b>300</b> according to the present embodiment may be constructed to detect fluorescence with excitation light having two different wavelengths. To achieve this, a light source unit of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>300</b> includes two light sources <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b</i>, two excitation light filters <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b</i>, a beam splitter <b>114</b>, a polarizer <b>103</b>, and a collimating lens <b>104</b>. The light source unit uses two different light sources <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b </i>to provide first and second excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;e<b>2</b> of two different wavelengths. For example, the first and second light sources <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b </i>may be LEDs or LDs emitting light of different wavelengths. The first and second excitation light filters <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>may be band pass filters that pass only the first excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>1</b> and the second excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>2</b>, respectively. In order to reduce the number of component types and facilitate assembling, the first and second excitation light filters <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>may be the same filters. For example, the first and second excitation light filters <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>may be dual band pass filters that transmit both of the first and second excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;e<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The beam splitter <b>114</b> causes the first and second excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;e<b>2</b> to propagate along the same optical path. To achieve this, the beam splitter <b>114</b> may be inclined at about 45 degrees so as to face the first and second light sources <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b</i>. For example, the beam splitter <b>114</b> may be a half mirror that transmits a portion of incident light and reflects the remaining portion thereof. In this case, a portion of the first excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>1</b> emitted by the first light source <b>101</b><i>a </i>is transmitted through the beam splitter <b>114</b> to the polarizer <b>103</b>. A portion of the second excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>2</b> emitted by the second light source <b>101</b><i>b </i>is reflected by the beam splitter <b>114</b> onto the polarizer <b>103</b>. For example, the half mirror may be designed to transmit more than about 95% of light incident on one surface thereof opposite to the first light source <b>101</b><i>a </i>while reflecting more than 95% of light incident on the other surface opposite to the second light source <b>101</b><i>b</i>. Instead of the half mirror, the beam splitter <b>114</b> may be a dichroic filter that transmits the first excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>1</b> and reflects the second excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>2</b>. In this case, most of the first excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>1</b> emitted by the first light source <b>101</b><i>a </i>is transmitted through the beam splitter <b>114</b> to the polarizer <b>103</b> while most of the second excitation light &#x3bb;e<b>2</b> is reflected by the beam splitter <b>114</b> to the polarizer <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The rest of the construction and operation of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>300</b> except for the light source unit are almost the same as the structure and operation of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A fluorescent filter <b>111</b> may be a dual band pass filter that transmits both of first fluorescent light emitted from a sample by first excitation light and second fluorescent light emitted from a sample by second excitation light.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the above-described construction, while the first light source <b>101</b><i>a </i>being turned on emits first excitation light, the second light source <b>101</b><i>b </i>is turned off and does not emit excitation light. Thus, fluorescence detecting for a sample may be performed with the first excitation light. The operation of detecting fluorescence with the first excitation light is performed in the same manner as the operation of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>100</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Subsequently, while the second light source <b>101</b><i>b </i>being turned on emits second excitation light, the first light source <b>101</b><i>a </i>is turned off and does not emit excitation light. Thus, fluorescence detecting for a sample may be performed with the second excitation light. When the multi-channel fluorescence detection apparatus <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, two fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>300</b> may be used for four color fluorescence detection.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The foregoing exemplary construction is described above with reference to a first and second light source for the purposes of illustration, but can further comprise additional light sources (e.g., a third, fourth, or fifth light source, etc.). Such additional light sources can be utilized in the same manner, for example, by using additional light sources, excitation light filters, and beam splitters configured in the same manner as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with respect to the first and second light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary construction of a fluorescence detecting optical system <b>400</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention. Unlike the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>400</b> according to the present embodiment further includes a monitoring photodetector <b>115</b> that measures the intensity of excitation light and an automatic focusing unit <b>121</b> through <b>123</b> that calculates a focus error of the excitation light and adjusts a focus position of an objective lens <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, the monitoring photodetector <b>115</b> may monitor the intensity of first excitation light reflected by a beam splitter <b>114</b> and constantly maintain an output of the first light source <b>101</b><i>a</i>. The monitoring photodetector <b>115</b> may also monitor the intensity of second excitation light transmitted by the beam splitter <b>114</b> and constantly maintain an output of the second light source <b>101</b><i>b</i>. To achieve this, the beam splitter may be a half mirror that transmits, for example, more than about 95% of light incident on one surface thereof opposite to the first light source <b>101</b><i>a </i>(and reflecting less than about 5%) while reflecting, for example, more than 95% of light incident on the other surface opposite to the second light source <b>101</b><i>b </i>(and transmitting less than about 5%). While the first light source <b>101</b><i>a </i>is turned on, most (e.g., more than about 95%) of the first excitation light is transmitted through the beam splitter <b>114</b> and used for detecting fluorescence, and the remaining portion (less than about 5%) is reflected by the beam splitter <b>114</b> and used for controlling an optical output of the first light source <b>101</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, while the second light source <b>101</b><i>b </i>is turned on, most (e.g., more than about 95%) of the second excitation light is transmitted through the beam splitter <b>114</b> and used for detecting fluorescence, and the remaining portion (e.g., less than about 5%) is reflected by the beam splitter <b>114</b> and used for controlling an optical output of the second light source <b>101</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Meanwhile, in the embodiments described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>, the excitation light &#x3bb;e_s having an s-polarization component reflected from the microfluidic device <b>150</b> is reflected again by the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> and is discarded. However, in the embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, excitation light &#x3bb;e_s having s-polarization component reflected by the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> is used to perform an automatic focusing function. To achieve this, the automatic focusing unit <b>121</b> through <b>123</b> is disposed opposite a reflecting surface of the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>. The automatic focusing unit <b>121</b> through <b>123</b> includes a focusing lens <b>121</b> focusing excitation light reflected by the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>, a divided-type type photodetector <b>122</b> detecting the excitation light reflected by the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>, and an actuator <b>123</b> for adjusting a focus position of the objective lens <b>108</b>. The divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> having a plurality of photo-detecting segments measures the intensity of light incident on each of the plurality of photo-detecting segments. Then, an output of the segment type photodetector <b>122</b> is used to calculate a focus error of the objective lens <b>108</b>, and the operation of the actuator <b>123</b> is controlled based on the focus error. The automatic focusing unit <b>121</b> through <b>123</b> may calculate a focus error and adjust a focal point using astigmatism or knife-edge.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7C</figref> illustrate the principle of adjusting a focal point using astigmatism in the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the focal point is adjusted using astigmatism, the focusing lens <b>121</b> may be an astigmatic lens and the divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> may be a quad type photodetector having four segments A through D. When the objective lens <b>108</b> comes too close to a chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>, a light spot <b>160</b> formed on the divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> by the focusing lens <b>121</b> is long in a transverse direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The sum of intensities (&#x201c;A+C&#x201d;) measured in the first and third segments A and C is greater than the sum of intensities (&#x201c;B+D&#x201d;) measured in the second and fourth segments B and D. Thus, if A+C&#x3e;B+D, the actuator <b>123</b> operates so that the objective lens <b>108</b> moves away from the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>. For example, the actuator <b>123</b> may be a voice coil motor (VCM).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Conversely, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, when the excitation light is focused precisely on the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>, a perfectly circular light spot <b>160</b> is formed on the divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> by the focusing lens <b>121</b>. Thus, the sum of light intensities (&#x201c;A+C&#x201d;) measured in the first and third segments A and C is equal to the sum of light intensities (&#x201c;B+D&#x201d;) measured in the second and fourth segments B and D. In this case, the position of the objective lens <b>108</b> does not need to be adjusted. When the objective lens <b>108</b> is too far away from the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>, a light spot <b>160</b> formed on the divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> by the focusing lens <b>121</b> is long in a longitudinal direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. Thus, the sum of light intensities (&#x201c;A+C&#x201d;) measured in the first and third segments A and C is less than the sum of light intensities (&#x201c;B+D&#x201d;) measured in the second and fourth segments B and D. Thus, if A+C&#x3c;B+D, the actuator <b>123</b> operates so that the objective lens <b>108</b> moves closer to the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B, <b>10</b>A, and <b>10</b>B illustrate the principle of adjusting a focal point using a knife-edge in the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the focal point is adjusted using a knife-edge, the focusing lens <b>121</b> may be a general convex lens and the divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> may be a dual type photodetector having two segments A and B. The knife-edge <b>124</b> may be disposed between the focusing lens <b>121</b> and the divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> so as to block off unfocused light. When excitation light is focused precisely on the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>, a beam diameter of light being focused by the focusing lens <b>121</b> becomes the smallest at a position of the knife-edge <b>124</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. In this case, because no light is blocked by the knife-edge <b>124</b>, light intensities measured in the first and second segments A and B are equal to each other (A=B) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the objective lens <b>108</b> comes too close to the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>, a beam diameter of light being focused by the focusing lens <b>121</b> becomes the smallest in front of the knife-edge <b>124</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In this case, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, because light directed toward the first segment A is at least partially blocked by the knife-edge <b>124</b>, light intensity measured in the first segment A is less than light intensity measured in the second segment B (A&#x3c;B). When the objective lens <b>108</b> is too far away from the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>, a beam diameter of light being focused by the focusing lens <b>121</b> becomes the smallest past the knife-edge <b>124</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. In this case, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, because light directed toward the second segment B is at least partially blocked by the knife-edge <b>124</b>, light intensity measured in the first segment A is greater than light intensity measured in the second segment B (A&#x3e;B). By using this principle, it is possible to check whether the excitation light is focused precisely on the chamber <b>151</b> of the microfluidic device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, even when the microfluidic device <b>150</b> is not disposed at the precise position, the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> performs an automatic focusing function to automatically focus on the chambers <b>151</b> within the microfluidic device <b>150</b>. Thus, the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>400</b> eliminates the need to use an expensive, high-precision, low-vibration drive mechanism for precisely positioning the microfluidic device <b>150</b>. Although the divided-type photodetector <b>122</b> has been described to detect excitation light reflected by the first polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>, it may be disposed to detect excitation light reflected by the second polarizing beam splitter <b>110</b>. The automatic focusing unit <b>121</b> through <b>123</b> may also be applied to the fluorescence detecting optical systems <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>. Because the rest of the construction and operation of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>400</b> are the same as those of the fluorescence detecting optical system <b>300</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a detailed explanation thereof is omitted.</p>
