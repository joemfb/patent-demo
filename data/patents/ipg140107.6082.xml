<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus and an image processing method, and can suitably find applications in the field of video browsers for identifying a specific scene from an editing apparatus for editing video materials or the contents of video materials, for example.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, it is an ordinary practice on the contents production site of television broadcasting stations and other production companies to cut out part of an audio visual materials (to be referred to as clip hereinafter) obtained by shooting a scene by means of a video camera to prepare a new clip and produces a set of contents by linking a plurality of clips prepared at the same time (see, for example, Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref> of the accompanying drawings schematically illustrates an example of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) image that can be displayed on the display unit of an editing apparatus adapted to such editing operations (to be referred to as editing image hereinafter). As clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>, editing image <b>2001</b> includes a clip synopsis display section <b>2002</b>, a monitor section <b>2003</b>, a story board section <b>2004</b>, a timeline section <b>2005</b> and effect information display sections <b>2006</b>A through <b>2006</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The clip synopsis display section <b>2002</b> is designed to select a desired bin or file from the various bins and files registered in the editing apparatus and display a synopsis of the clips contained in the bin or file.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The operator of the apparatus can select a desired clip from the clips that are synoptically displayed in the clip synopsis display section <b>2002</b> and drag and drop it to the monitor section <b>2003</b> so as to have the leading image of the clip displayed in the monitor section <b>2003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Then, the operator can start replaying the dragged and dropped clip and have the reproduced image displayed in the monitor section <b>2003</b> by clicking the start button in the group of buttons <b>2007</b> displayed in a lower part of the monitor section <b>2003</b> under this condition. Additionally, the operator can fast-forward or rewind the clip by clicking the corresponding one of the buttons. Furthermore, the operator can move left or right the scrub cursor <b>2008</b> displayed above the group of buttons <b>2007</b> to indicate the position of the image that is being currently displayed out of the entire clip by operating the mouse of the apparatus in order to have the monitor section <b>2003</b> display the image that corresponds to the position of the scrub cursor <b>2008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this way, the operator can search for the desired frame by operating the replay button in the group of buttons <b>2007</b> and/or the scrub cursor <b>2008</b>, visually confirming the image reproduced and displayed in the monitor section <b>2003</b>. Then, the operator can specify the starting point (to be referred to as in point hereinafter) and the ending point (to be referred to as out point hereinafter) of the video/audio part to be cut out from the clip by clicking respectively an in point button <b>2009</b><sub>IN </sub>and an out point button <b>2009</b><sub>OUT </sub>arranged in a lower part of the monitor section <b>2003</b>, while having the image of the frame displayed in the monitor section <b>2003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, the operator can paste the video/audio part of the clip sandwiched between the in point and the out point that he or she specified on the story board section <b>2004</b> by means of a drag and drop operation. The operator arranges the clips to be used for the current editing operation in the story board section <b>2004</b> of the editing image <b>2001</b> in the above-described manner so that he or she can imagine the results of the editing operation with ease. Note that a thumbnail and detailed information of a representative image, which may be the leading image, of each of the clips that are pasted are also displayed in the story board section <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Then, the operator sequentially drags and drops the clips pasted on the story board section <b>2004</b> and pastes them on respective video tracks <b>2010</b>V in the timeline section <b>2005</b>. At this time, a band <b>2012</b>V having a length that corresponds to the material length of each of the pasted clips is displayed on the video track <b>2010</b>V of the clip according to the time scale <b>2011</b> that is also shown in the timeline section <b>2005</b>. If any of the clips contain sound, a band <b>2012</b>A having a length equal to that of the corresponding band <b>2012</b>V is displayed at the same position on the corresponding audio track <b>2010</b>A according to the time scale <b>2011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A band <b>2012</b>V that is displayed on a video track <b>2010</b>V of the timeline section <b>2005</b> with or without a band <b>2012</b>A displayed on an audio track <b>2010</b>A tells that the image of the clip that corresponds to the band <b>2012</b>V is displayed with or without, whichever appropriate, the sound of the clip that corresponds to the band <b>2012</b>A at the time shown on the time scale <b>2011</b> in an operation of outputting the edited images and sounds. Thus, with the above-described process, it is possible to prepare an editing list that sequentially specifies the images that are to be displayed as edited images and sounds that are to be output as edited sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When preparing such an editing list and if the operator wants to execute a video special effect process at the time, for example, when the image of the first clip is switched to the image of the second clip, the operator pastes by a drag and drop operation an icon <b>13</b> that corresponds to the video special effect (to be referred to as effect icon hereinafter) out of the effects listed and displayed in an effect list display section <b>6</b>C of the effect information display sections <b>2006</b>A through <b>2006</b>C on the position of a transition track <b>2010</b>T of the timeline section <b>2005</b> same as the position for switching from the first clip to the second clip on the transition track <b>2010</b>T of the timeline section <b>2005</b> according to the time scale <b>2011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Then, as a result, it is possible to input a command to execute the video special effect that corresponds to the effect icon <b>13</b> pasted on the transition track <b>2010</b> at the position linking the image of the first clip and the image of the second clip in the to-be-edited images.

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">In an editing operation using an editing image <b>2001</b> as described above, the operation of searching for a frame in order to specify an in point and an out point is an operation of reproducing the image of the selected clip at high speed by repeating a fast forward winding action and a rewinding action for a number of times or by a scrubbing action of moving left and right the scrub cursor <b>2008</b> by means of a mouse in order to detect the desired frame.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">However, such an operation of searching for a desired frame (to be referred to an image searching operation whenever appropriate hereinafter), which is an operation of reproducing the image of the selected clip at high speed by repeating a fast forward winding action and a rewinding action for a number of times or by a scrubbing action of moving left and right the scrub cursor by means of a mouse as described above, is time consuming unless the operator is trained well and has an excellent skill in such operations. Additionally, there can be cases where the video/audio material to be handled is subjected to compression coding in the long GOP format conforming to the so-called MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group) Standards, which is a format where each GOP (Group Of Pictures) has a plurality of frames for the purpose of raising the compression efficiency, or in an open GOP format where the video/audio material is compressed by using preceding and succeeding GOP data. Then, a plurality of frames and a GOP have to be processed for decoding in order to decode the frame to make it difficult to randomly reproduce an image at high speed. Thus, the displayed image will be poorly responsive to further make the image searching operation a difficult one.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">Furthermore, a so-called cut editing operation of linking clips has hitherto been conducted by pasting clips to the video tracks <b>2010</b>V and the audio tracks <b>2010</b>A of the timeline section <b>2005</b> in the editing image <b>201</b> and the image before the in point and the image after the out point have been confirmed by subsequent replays and scrubs. Therefore, the above-described operation steps have been required for a cut editing operation to make the operation a cumbersome one.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">Additionally, while the operator needs to recognize the images and the sounds to be edited in an editing operation, he or she is required to rely on the sound being output from a speaker, visually confirming the corresponding image or check the levels and the waveform of the sound being displayed on the corresponding audio track <b>2010</b>A in the timeline section <b>2005</b> of the editing image <b>2001</b> (see, for example, the audio track <b>2010</b>A of &#x201c;audio <b>3</b>&#x201d; in the timeline section <b>2005</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>). Thus, it has been difficult to do an editing operation, coordinating images and sounds.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">In view of the above identified circumstances, it is therefore an object of the present invention to propose an image processing apparatus and that facilitates the image searching operation of confirming a scene being edited or a specific scene and also the entire editing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">In an aspect of the present invention, the above object is achieved by providing an image processing apparatus characterized by including: an image generating means for generating display video data of a plurality of images to be displayed respectively in a plurality of image display sections on a display screen from video data; a display type determining means for determining display types indicating display modes of displaying the pictures of the video data on a picture by picture basis or GOP by GOP basis according to variations expressing extents of change of each image data of the video data; a parameter altering means for altering the display parameters or the reproduction parameters corresponding to the display video data according to the type information expressing the display types on a picture by picture basis or GOP by GOP basis as determined by the display type determining means; and an image processing means for displaying the images to be displayed in the form of moving image on the display screen with time lags in the display sequence, using the display parameters or the reproduction parameters altered by the parameter altering means.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">With the above-described arrangement, the sequence of displaying a plurality of images to be displayed is provided with time lags and a plurality of image display sections for displaying a moving image are displayed in an image processing apparatus. Therefore, it is possible to present a reproduced image not only in each of the image display sections but also according to the flow of the time series of the entire image display sections, while each of the reproduced images displayed in all the image display sections is displayed in a differentiated display mode or reproduction mode on a picture by picture basis or GOP by GOP basis as a function of the variation of the image so that it is possible to visually present the difference in the variations of images. Thus, the image processing apparatus allows the operator to intuitively recognize the position in a reproduced image where a change is taking place and to do the operation of searching for the desired image parts from a series of images according to the video data of the images to be displayed and also the operation of editing them with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">In another aspect, there is provided an image processing method characterized by including: an image generating step of generating display video data of a plurality of images to be displayed respectively in a plurality of image display sections on a display screen from video data; a display type determining step of determining display types indicating display modes of displaying the images of the video data on a picture by picture basis or GOP by GOP basis according to variations expressing extents of change of the video data; a parameter altering step of altering the display parameters or the reproduction parameters corresponding to the display video data according to the type information expressing the display types on a picture by picture basis or GOP by GOP basis as determined in the display type determining step; and an image processing step of displaying the images to be displayed in the form of moving image on the display screen with time lags in the display sequence, using the display parameters or the reproduction parameters altered in the parameter altering step.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">With the above-described arrangement, the sequence of displaying a plurality of images to be displayed is provided with time lags and a plurality of image display sections for displaying a moving image are displayed. Therefore, it is possible to present a reproduced image not only in each of the image display sections but also according to the flow of the time series of the entire image display sections, while each of the reproduced images displayed in all the image display sections is displayed in a differentiated display mode or reproduction mode on a picture by picture basis or GOP by GOP basis as a function of the variation of the image so that it is possible to visually present the difference in the variations of images. Thus, the image processing method allows the operator to intuitively recognize the position in a reproduced image where a change is taking place and to do the operation of searching for the desired image parts from a series of images according to the video data of the images to be displayed and also the operation of editing them with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">Thus, according to the present invention, it is possible to realize an image processing apparatus and image processing method that can visually present the difference in the variations of images and allow the operator to intuitively recognize the position in a reproduced image where a change is taking place by way of a combination of such presentations and do the operation of searching for the desired image parts from a series of images according to the video data of the images to be displayed and also the editing operation with ease.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0128" num="0128">Now, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail by referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">(1) Configuration of Editing System Formed by Using this Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0129" num="0129">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>1</b> generally denotes an editing system formed by using this embodiment, which comprises an editing apparatus <b>2</b>, a memory apparatus <b>22</b> and a plurality of video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n </sub>as principal components.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0130">With this editing system <b>1</b>, the operator can take part or all of the images/sounds recorded on a video tape into the large capacity memory apparatus <b>22</b> having RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) as one or more than one clips by way of the editing apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0131">With this editing system <b>1</b>, the operator can prepare an editing list specifying the editing breakdowns for obtaining desired edited images/sounds by linking the clips taken into the memory apparatus <b>22</b> in a desired manner and actually execute an editing process according to the prepared editing list. Additionally, the operator can accumulate the editing images and the edited sounds that are obtained as a result in the memory apparatus <b>22</b> and also record in video tapes by way of any of the video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0132">In the editing apparatus <b>1</b>, GPU<b>4</b>, XDR (Extreme Data Rate)-RAM <b>5</b> and south bridge <b>6</b> are connected to microprocessor <b>3</b>, while hard disk drive <b>7</b>, USB interface <b>8</b> and sound input/output codec <b>9</b> are connected to the south bridge <b>6</b>. Speaker <b>41</b> is connected to the sound input/output codec <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0133">Mouse <b>38</b>, keyboard <b>30</b>, video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n</sub>, the memory apparatus <b>22</b> and operation controller <b>37</b> are connected to the south bridge <b>6</b> by way of PCI bus <b>15</b>. Display <b>40</b> is connected to the GPU <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0134">Meanwhile, the microprocessor <b>3</b> has a multi-core structure where a general purpose main CPU core <b>3</b>M for executing basic programs such as an OS (Operating System), a plurality of (eight in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) type signal processors (to be referred to as sub CPU cores hereinafter) <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH connected to the main CPU core <b>3</b>M by way of internal bus <b>12</b>, a memory controller <b>13</b> for controlling the memory of the XDR-RAM <b>5</b>, which may typically have a capacity of 256 [Mbyte] and I/O (In/Out) controller <b>14</b> for managing the inputs from and the outputs to the south bridge <b>6</b>, are integrally arranged in a single chip and can operate typically with an operating frequency of 4 [GHz].</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0135">The microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>1</b> mainly takes the role of codec such as MPEG decoder, JPEG2000, H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding) and so on and is adapted to executions of data transfers for the reproduced images obtained by decoding to GPU<b>4</b>, shifts of reproduction speed v (which will be described hereinafter) and physical arithmetic operations.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0136">Particularly, each of the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH takes the role of a decoder in the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH can concurrently decode reproduced HD (High Definition) images in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0137">The main CPU core <b>3</b>M is adapted to execute processes and management jobs other than those that the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH do. It receives a command from the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b> by way of the south bridge <b>6</b> and executes one or more than one processes according to the command.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0138">As pointed out above, the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH of the microprocessor <b>3</b> can concurrently decode reproduced HD (High Definition) images in parallel and transfer data between the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the GPU <b>4</b> at a maximum transfer rate of 30 [Gbyte/sec] by way of bus <b>10</b> having a large bandwidth so that it is possible to decode a large number of reproduced high definition images and transfer them in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0139">More specifically, each of the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH can typically decode two reproduced HD images. In other words, the microprocessor <b>3</b> can transfer (in this case) sixteen reproduced high definition images to the GPU <b>4</b> at a time. Note, however, that the number of HD images that each of the sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH can decode simultaneously is not limited to three and may be so adapted as to decode more reproduced images.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0140">On the other hand, the GPU <b>4</b> has functional features of executing coordinate conversion arithmetic processes, processes for enlarging/reducing reproduced images and so on in addition to ultimate rendering processes relating to texture mapping and so on when moving reproduced images to be displayed on the display <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0141">In fact, the microprocessor <b>3</b> reads out the necessary software stored in the hard disk drive <b>7</b> according to the control program stored in the hard disk drive <b>7</b> at each starting time and develops it on the XDR-RAM <b>5</b>. Subsequently, the microprocessor <b>3</b> executes necessary control processes according to the software and the operations performed by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0142">As a command for displaying a clip-take-in-window for taking in an image/sound recorded on a video tape into the memory apparatus <b>22</b> is input as a result of an operation using the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> controls the hard disk drive <b>7</b> to have it read out the corresponding image data in response and, at the same time, also controls the GPU <b>4</b> to have it display the clip-take-in-window on the display <b>40</b> for the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0143">Additionally, as a command for a replay operation is input to any of the video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n </sub>as a result of an operation using the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> controls the video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n </sub>in response and have the related one or more than one of the video tape recorder or recorders to operate for reproducing the specified video/audio signals of the specified clip.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0144">Then, as a result, the video/audio signals reproduced from video tape mounted on the related one or more than one of the video tape recorder <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n </sub>is output and the video signals are applied to the GPU <b>4</b> sequentially by way of the PCI bus <b>15</b>, the south bridge <b>66</b> and the microprocessor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0145">Then, under the control of the microprocessor <b>3</b>, the GPU <b>4</b> executes a predetermined signal process on the video signals to be supplied and sends out the video signals obtained as a result of the signal process to the display <b>40</b> so that the images based on the video signals are displayed at a predetermined position in the clip-take-in-window. Meanwhile, the microprocessor <b>3</b> has the speaker <b>41</b> output sounds based on the audio signals by sending out the audio signals extracted from the video/audio signals to the speaker <b>41</b> by way of the sound input/output codec <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0146">Then, consequently, the operator can specify the desired part of the sounds and images with use of the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b> based on the videos displayed on the display <b>40</b> and the sound output from the speaker <b>41</b> and further can register the management information such as a time code and material length of the in point and the out point by making the sound and video part clip, clip ID, clip name, time and date of shooting of the sound and video, time and date of creating the clip as meta data. Then, the management information of the clip registered as the meta data is registered in the clip management information database in the hard disk drive <b>7</b> under the control of the microprocessor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0147">Thereafter, the microprocessor <b>3</b> executes a replay operation of the videos and sounds of the specified clip by controlling the video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n </sub>as a result of an operation using the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b>, and a command for taking in the clip is input.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0148">Then, as a result, the video/audio signals of the clip reproduced from video tape is output from the video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n </sub>and the video signals are applied to the GPU <b>4</b> sequentially by way of the PCI bus <b>15</b>, the south bridge <b>6</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the bus <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0149" num="0149">Thus, it is possible to reproduce the images and the sounds of a clip that are specified and take them into the memory apparatus <b>22</b> of the editing system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0150">On the other hand, the operator can have the editing system <b>1</b> display images to be edited (which will be described hereinafter) on the display <b>40</b> by way of a predetermined operation using the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b> and prepares an editing list specifying the breakdowns of the editing process telling which clip is to be linked to which clip in what manner by using the images to be edited.

<p id="p-0151" num="0151">When a command for registering the editing list is input by the operator operating at the mouse <b>38</b> after the preparation of the editing list, the microprocessor <b>3</b> files all the editing data specified on the editing list by the operator and registers them in the editing list database in the hard disk drive <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0152">Additionally, when a command for reproducing an image/sound to be edited on the editing list is input by the operator operating the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b> after or while preparing the editing list, the microprocessor <b>3</b> controls the memory apparatus <b>22</b> in response so as to have the memory apparatus <b>22</b> read out the necessary video/audio signals of the related clip.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0153">Of the video/audio signals read out from the memory apparatus <b>22</b> in this way, the video signals are applied to the GPU <b>4</b> sequentially by way of the PCI bus <b>15</b>, the south bridge <b>6</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the bus <b>10</b>. Thereafter, if necessary, the video signals are subjected to a special effect process at the GPU <b>4</b> under the control of the microprocessor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0154">Then, the GPU <b>4</b> executes a predetermined signal process on the signals to be edited obtained by executing a special effect process on the supplied video signals and sends out the video signals obtained as a result of the signal process to the display <b>40</b> under the control of the microprocessor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0155">Meanwhile, the microprocessor <b>3</b> executes a sound mixing process on the audio signals out of the video/audio signals and sends out the audio signals to be edited that are obtained as a result to the speaker <b>41</b> by way of the sound input/output codec <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0156">Then, consequently, the image to be edited is displayed at a predetermined position in the editing image and the corresponding sound to be edited is output from the speaker <b>41</b>. In this way, the operator can proceeds with an editing operation by means of the editing system <b>1</b>, checking the images to be edited and the sound to be edited on the editing list.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0157">Additionally, as the operator inputs a command for executing an editing process by operating the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b> after the preparation of the editing list, the microprocessor <b>3</b> controls the memory apparatus <b>22</b> in response so as to have the memory apparatus <b>22</b> read out the video/audio signals of clips to be used for the editing process and send them out to the GPU <b>4</b> by way of the PCI bus <b>15</b>, the south bridge <b>6</b> and the bus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0158">At this time, if necessary, the GPU <b>4</b> executes a special effect process and a sound mixing process on the video/audio signals of each of the clips supplied to it as in the above-described reproduction mode and sends out the video signals to be edited that are obtained as a result to the memory apparatus <b>22</b> or the corresponding one of the video tape recorders <b>23</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>23</b><sub>n </sub>sequentially by way of the bus <b>10</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b>, the south bridge <b>6</b>, and the PCI bus <b>15</b> under the control of the microprocessor <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0160">In this way, the specified image/sound of clip is edited and/or processed to a specified state and accumulated in the memory apparatus <b>22</b> or recorded in a video tape according to the editing data prepared in advance in the editing system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0161">Therefore, the operator can display images obtained as a result of execution of a special effect process on the reproduced images in the editing image displayed on the display <b>40</b> and also execute various extending operations and editing operations by means of the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the GPU <b>4</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> of the editing system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0162">Meanwhile, the plurality of reproduced images that are decoded concurrently by the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH of the microprocessor <b>3</b> in parallel are transferred to the GPU <b>4</b> as data at a transfer rate that is maximally 30 [Gbyte/sec] so that complex images that are reproduced and subjected to a special effect process can be transferred smoothly at high speed.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">(2-1) Method of Displaying Reproduced Images in Editing Image</heading>
<p id="p-0163" num="0163">As the operator operates the mouse <b>38</b>, the keyboard <b>39</b> or the operation controller <b>37</b> to input a command for displaying the editing image, the microprocessor <b>3</b> controls the hard disk drive <b>7</b> and the GPU <b>4</b> so as to have them display an editing image <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> on the display <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0164">The editing image <b>50</b> includes a clip synopsis display section <b>51</b>, a story board section <b>52</b>, a timeline section <b>53</b> and an effect information display section <b>54</b>, which are same as the clip synopsis display section <b>2002</b>, the story board section <b>2004</b>, the timeline section <b>2005</b> and the effect information display sections <b>2006</b>A through <b>2006</b>C of the editing image <b>2001</b> described earlier by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>, as well as a display section <b>55</b> having a functional feature specific to the editing image <b>50</b>. Since editing operations are performed mainly by using the display section <b>55</b> of the editing image <b>50</b> as will be described hereinafter, the story board section <b>52</b> and the timeline section <b>53</b> are provided only as auxiliary sections.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0165">With respect to the display section <b>55</b> of the editing image <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> can display a group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> formed by sequentially helically arranging a plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>suitable for displaying reproduced images of a clip of moving images typically showing a continuously moving flow from the backside of the image (to be referred to as distal side hereinafter) toward the foreside of the image (to be referred to as proximal side hereinafter).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0166">Note that the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are arranged in such a way that the image display section <b>57</b><sub>n </sub>located at the most proximal side of the image has the largest area and operates as reference image display section and the remaining image display sections have respective areas that gradually become smaller toward the distal end of the spirally arranged display sections and, when an image display section W<b>57</b> located relatively at the proximal side and an image display section W<b>57</b> located immediately behind it partly overlap each other, the overlapping part of the hind side image display section W<b>57</b> is hidden by the corresponding part of the proximal side image display section W<b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0167">However, translucent reproduced images are displayed in the respective image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> and hence, for example, the operator can visually confirm the part (indicated by broken lines) of the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>m </sub>located immediately behind and partly hidden by the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>located at the most proximal side as a translucent image.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0168">The microprocessor <b>3</b> acquires display information including the display sizes and the positions on the display section <b>55</b> of the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>from the hard disk drive <b>7</b> and generates data of the images to be displayed respectively in the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>by processing the reproduced images by means of the GPU <b>4</b> according to the display information. Note that the display positions of the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>arranged in the display image are fixed in principle. In other words, the respective positions of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>to be viewed do not change so that the operator's view is not forced to stray and hence the operator can enjoy a remarkably comfortable visibility.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0169">In the editing image <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for example, the clip that the operator wants may be moved out of the clips that are collectively being displayed in the clip synopsis display section <b>51</b> into the display section <b>55</b> in response to a drag and drop operation of the operator. Thereafter, as the microprocessor <b>3</b> recognizes that the replay button <b>56</b> displayed at the left bottom corner of the display section <b>55</b> is clicked, it reproduces images from the clip and displays them sequentially in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>, starting from the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>located at the most distal side all the way through the adjacent image display sections located at the proximal side thereof W<b>57</b><sub>2</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>3</sub>, . . . , W<b>57</b><sub>m</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>at predetermined time lags, or predetermined time intervals, (to be referred to reproduction time lags hereinafter) &#x394;T as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0170">In other words, the reproduced images of the clip are displayed sequentially from the leading image, which is displayed first in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>located at the most distal side and then, when a reproduction time lag &#x394;T elapses, the next image is displayed in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>2 </sub>located next at the proximal side. When another reproduction time lag &#x394;T elapses, the next image is displayed in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>3 </sub>located next further at the proximal side. In this way, the reproduced images are displayed sequentially in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>in the direction of arrows a (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) as a flow along the time series.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0171">Therefore, the microprocessor <b>3</b> can have the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>sequentially display reproduced images of a clip in a coordinated and interlocked manner with reproduction time lags &#x394;T so as to make them to be viewed as a moving image as a whole in the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0172">Therefore, the operator who is visually checking the plurality of image display sections of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> can view the reproduced images that are displayed with reproduction time lags &#x394;T so as to have an impression as if the images were drawing closer from the center of the spiral at the distal side toward the proximal side of the display screen and, at the same time, as if the operator him- or herself is moving toward the center of the spiral and hence toward the distal side of the display screen because the reproduced images being displayed at the distal side are temporally advanced relative to the reproduced image being displayed at the proximal side.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0173">Thus, with the editing apparatus <b>2</b>, if the operator misses the desired scene displayed in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>of the plurality of W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>, the desired scene is displayed without fail in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>2 </sub>and the succeeding image display sections that appear sequentially from the proximal side of the display screen. Therefore, the operator is not compelled to do a cumbersome operation of rewinding the reproduced images that were once displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>in order to search for the desired scene and may simply wait instead. In short, operations of searching for a scene and editing operations are remarkably facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0174">The images of a clip that are displayed in the respective image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are displayed at a predefined image updating rate, or a predefined image reproduction speed v. If the defined value v of the reproduction speed is large, the reproduced images are displayed on the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>so as to make them appear as if moving at a high uniform speed. If, on the other hand, the defined value of the reproduction speed is small, the reproduced images are displayed on the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>so as to make them appear as if moving at a slow uniform speed.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0175">Particularly, since the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) display reproduced images with reproduction time lags &#x394;T, time code notification frames TC<b>1</b> through TC<b>4</b> are displayed at predetermined intervals of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> in order to notify the operator of the elapsed reproduction time of each of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>and assist the operator for the ongoing image searching operation and current editing operation. Note that, in the editing apparatus <b>2</b>, it is possible to selectively display time code notification frames TC<b>1</b> through TC<b>4</b> for all the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>or totally wipe them away when the operator does not need them.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0176">The initial value of reproduction time lag &#x394;T and that of reproduction speed v can be defined by using reproduction time lag/reproduction speed defining dialog <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that is displayed when the operator selects &#x201c;reproduction time lag/reproduction speed&#x201d; from the context menu (not shown) that is displayed when &#x201c;setting&#x201d; of the tool bar <b>59</b> being displayed in an upper part of the display section <b>55</b> is clicked.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0177">When the operator actually defines the initial value of reproduction time lag &#x394;T and that of reproduction speed v, the operator simply needs to change the numerical value of the reproduction time lag &#x394; and that of the reproduction speed v shown respectively in the text boxes <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> arranged in the reproduction time lag/reproduction speed dialog <b>60</b> to the ones he or she wants by clicking the corresponding ones of the up/down keys <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B, <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B or directly input the numerical values he or she wants by means of the keyboard <b>39</b> and subsequently click an &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button <b>65</b>. Then, the numerical values displayed in the text boxes <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> are set as the initial values of reproduction time lag &#x394;T and reproduction speed v respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0178">With this arrangement, for example, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can have reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>with small reproduction time lags &#x394;T and a low reproduction speed v of the reproduced images and thus can display images of a narrow range of the clip as the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> or have reproduced image displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>with large reproduction time lags &#x394;T and a low reproduction speed v of the reproduced images and thus can display images of a wide range of the clip as the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0179">In actuality, the reproduced images that are displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be displayed with a variable speed as the reproduction speed v is changed and/or may be displayed with arbitrarily selected time lags as the reproduction time lag &#x394;T is changed. Therefore, as a whole, the reproduced images are displayed with a variable speed in an interlocked manner like a vortex extending from a central part of the display screen and from the distal side toward the proximal side as indicated by thick arrow ST<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0180">Of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>, the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>located at the center of the display screen and at the most distal side displays the image that is reproduced earliest, whereas the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>located at the most proximal side displays the image that is reproduced latest. Therefore, the operator can intuitively recognize that the reproduced images are being displayed in the progressing direction from the distal side toward the proximal side of the display screen in time series just like a vortex.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0181">If &#x2212;v is variable defined for the reproduction speed, the reproduced images that are displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>are displayed in the regressing direction at a variable speed with arbitrarily selected time lags that may be changed according to the reproduction time lag &#x394;T that may also be variably defined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Therefore, as a whole, the reproduced images are displayed with a variable speed in an interlocked manner like a spiral extending from the proximal side toward the distal side of the screen as indicated by thick arrow ST<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0182">Additionally, when one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are already shown in the editing image <b>50</b> and another clip that is being displayed in the clip synopsis display section <b>51</b> is dragged and dropped, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can display a group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> that corresponds to the newly dragged and dropped clip in the display section <b>55</b> in addition to the one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> that are already shown in the display section <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0183">Conversely, in the editing image <b>50</b>, when one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are already shown in the display section <b>55</b> and one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are selected and dragged and dropped into the clip synopsis display section <b>51</b>, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can delete the selected one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> from the one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> that are being displayed in the display sections <b>58</b>. Alternatively, when the operator selects one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> in the display section <b>55</b> and depresses the delete key, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> deletes the selected one or more than one groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0184">Then, when a plurality of groups of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are being displayed in the display section <b>55</b> and the operator selects a group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> by operating the mouse and clicks the replay button <b>56</b>, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can display the reproduced images of a corresponding clip in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> at respective timings. Note that the initial value of reproduction time lag &#x394;T and that of reproduction speed v are those that are defined by means of the above-described reproduction time lag/reproduction speed defining dialog <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0185">Now, the parallel decoding process sequence of the editing system <b>1</b> for decoding processes that are executed concurrently in parallel by means of the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH arranged in the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0186">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> moves to the starting step of routine RT<b>1</b> and proceeds to Step SP<b>1</b>, where it takes the control signal input from the mouse <b>38</b> or the keyboard <b>39</b> into itself, or the microprocessor <b>3</b>, by way of the south bridge <b>6</b>.

<p id="p-0187" num="0187">In Step SP<b>2</b>, if the control signal it recognizes in Step SP<b>1</b> is a command for identifying the clip to be displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> defines the drawing loop of the clip to be displayed on the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>by means of the main CPU core <b>3</b>M and then moves to the next step, or Step SP<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0188">In Step SP<b>3</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> performs various physical arithmetic operations including those of defining the display positions and the display sizes of the reproduced images of the clip by means of the main CPU core <b>3</b>M and then moves to the next step, or Step SP<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0189">In Step SP<b>4</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> computes the positions of the frames of the reproduced images of the clip that constitute the drawing loop by means of the main CPU core <b>3</b>M and also allocates the reproduced images of the clip to be displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>to the sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH for decoding before it moves to the next step, or Step SP<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0190">In Step SP<b>5</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> reads out the frames necessary for outputting the reproduced images from the memory apparatus <b>22</b> and assigns them to the sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH to which the reproduced images are allocated in Step SP<b>4</b> before it moves to the next step, or Step SP<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0191">In Step SP<b>6</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> concurrently decodes the frames allocated in Step SP<b>5</b> in parallel by means of the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH that take the role of decoders and then moves to the next step, or Step SP<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0192">In Step SP<b>7</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> transfers the plurality of reproduced images that are decoded in Step SP<b>6</b> along with the display information (display sizes and display positions) of the positions and the sizes of the reproduced images to be displayed in the display section <b>55</b> on the display screen by high speed data transfer by means of the main CPU core <b>3</b>M and then moves to the next step, or Step SP<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0193">In Step SP<b>8</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> has the GPU <b>4</b> paste and display the plurality of reproduced images transferred from the main CPU core <b>3</b>M on the predetermined positions of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>according to the display information (the display sizes and the display positions) and then moves to Step SP<b>9</b> to end the process.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0194">In this way, in the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b>, the eight sub CPU cores <b>3</b>SA through <b>3</b>SH take the role of decoders for the reproduced images to be displayed on the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>and concurrently decode the reproduced images in parallel and the microprocessor <b>3</b> transfers the reproduced and decoded images to the GPU <b>4</b> by way of the bus <b>10</b> of a broad band width for a high speed transfer typically at a maximum transfer rate of 30 [Gbyte/sec].</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0195">Thus, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can decode a large number of reproduced high definition images and transfer them to the GPU <b>4</b> by a data transfer in a short period of time so that it can have the display section <b>55</b> highly responsively display the reproduced images with time lags in an interlocked manner in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> so as to make them appear as a smoothly moving image as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0196">On the other hand, when &#x201c;setting&#x201d; of the tool bar <b>59</b> being displayed in an upper part of the display section <b>55</b> is clicked and &#x201c;sound output mode&#x201d; is selected from the context menu (not shown) that is displayed accordingly in the editing image <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the microprocessor <b>3</b> can select one of the sound output modes, for example either &#x201c;main sound output mode&#x201d; or &#x201c;all sound output mode&#x201d;, for the reproduced image of a clip being displayed in the display section <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0197">If &#x201c;main sound output mode&#x201d; is selected as sound output mode, only the reproduced sound accompanying to the reproduced image displayed in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>located at the most proximal side of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> that is currently being operated is output from the speaker <b>41</b>. If, on the other hand, &#x201c;all sound output mode&#x201d; is selected as sound output mode, all the reproduced sounds accompanying to the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are output from the speaker <b>41</b> in such a way that the volume of the sound of a reproduced image displayed in a distal side image display section, which may be one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>m</sub>, . . . , W<b>57</b><sub>1</sub>, is reduced as a function of the distance from the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>located at the most proximal side.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0198">However, if &#x201c;all sound output mode&#x201d; is selected as sound output mode and a predetermined extent of sound mixing is predictable because the reproduction time lag &#x394;T of the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>is increased or because a change of scene is detected, the output sounds are automatically adjusted in such a way that the sounds of the reproduced images that are displayed in the most proximal image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>and several image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>m</sub>, . . . , located close to the former image display section are output from the speaker <b>41</b>.

<p id="p-0209" num="0209">Now, the various operation methods that can be used for the display section <b>55</b> of the editing image <b>50</b> will be described below.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">(2-3-1) Basic Operations</heading>
<p id="p-0210" num="0210">When, for example, the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>e </sub>that is displaying the desired scene is clicked by the operator out of the reproduced images being displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> (image display section W<b>57</b><sub>e </sub>is clicked first) in the display section <b>55</b> of the editing image <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> displays the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>e </sub>in an emphasized manner by coloring it in a predetermined color (hatched in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) to indicate that the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>e </sub>showing the reproduced image corresponds to the editing position in the editing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0211">Then, the microprocessor <b>3</b> moves the emphasized one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, or the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>e</sub>, of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> sequentially toward the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>h</sub>, W<b>7</b><sub>j</sub>, . . . , W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>that are located at the proximal side of the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>e </sub>with the reproduction time lag &#x394;T according to the flow of the scene (flow of the time series of the reproduced image) in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0212">With this arrangement, the operator can instantaneously visually confirm one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>that is currently displaying the desired scene on the basis of the flow of the emphasized display in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0213">In other words, the emphasized display in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is provided for the scene that the operator noticed first and corresponds to the editing position for the editing operation (e.g., image display section W<b>57</b><sub>e</sub>) and the emphasized display is continued if it is moved as the image display section reproducing the scene is changed sequentially to the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>h</sub>, . . . , W<b>57</b><sub>j</sub>, . . . , W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>. Therefore, the operator can instantaneously and intuitively recognize the scene it noticed first due to the emphasized display while the images are being displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>so as to appear as if they are flowing in the direction indicated by the long and thick arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0214">If the scene that the operator noticed first and corresponds to the editing position for the editing operation is the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>h </sub>as indicated by the short and thick arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the scene that the operator noticed is emphatically displayed so that the operator have an impression that the flow start there.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0215">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(A)</figref>, when, for example, &#x201c;up (&#x2191;)&#x201d; key <b>70</b>U that corresponds to the upward direction in the direction keys <b>70</b> of the keyboard <b>39</b> is depressed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(A-1)</figref>) or the cursor <b>71</b> is moved along, for example, the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>&#x3b1;</sub> through W<b>57</b><sub>&#x3b2;</sub> that are part of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>for a display operation input (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(A-2)</figref>) while the right button of the mouse <b>38</b> is held depressed, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can raise the image display speed of the clip.</p>

<p id="p-0315" num="0315">However, while the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> raises the moving image frame updating rate of the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>m</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, . . . having enlarged scales, it reduces the resolutions of their frames by a predetermined level so that the processing load for displaying reproduced images in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>m</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, . . . and those image display sections can safely observe the timings of reproducing the moving images.</p>

<p id="p-0317" num="0317">In this way, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can move the position of the character CA<b>1</b> relative to the sub 3D space image IM<b>1</b> by means of the cursor <b>71</b> and display the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>m</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, . . . located at the most proximal side of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> and adapted to attract attention in enlarged scales, while it raises the frame frequency of the reproduced images displayed in the enlarged image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>m</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, . . . to allow the operator to visually check the smooth reproduced images.

<p id="p-0321" num="0321">With this arrangement, if the operator feels it difficult to visually confirm the reproduced images of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>because the plurality of image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are mutually overlapping after a shift of the viewpoint, it is possible to two-dimensionally arrange and develop the images SG<b>1</b> through SG<b>9</b> of a total of 9 frames including the frame of the reproduced image that the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>g </sub>is displaying at that time, the four frames immediately preceding that frame and the four frames immediately succeeding the frame two-dimensionally. Therefore, it is possible for the operator to remarkably improve the visibility of the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>and facilitate the image searching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0322">Instead of displaying the images SG<b>1</b> through SG<b>9</b> of a total of 9 frames including the frame of the reproduced image that the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>g </sub>is displaying at that time, the four frames immediately preceding that frame and the four frames immediately succeeding the frame, it is also possible to display the images SG<b>1</b> through SG<b>9</b> of a total of 9 frames including the frame of the reproduced image that the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>g </sub>is displaying at that time, the four frames preceding that frame by every predetermined number and the four frames succeeding the frame by every predetermined number.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0323">When a high reproduction speed v is defined by thinning the frames by every predetermined number of frames (e.g., every five frames) to use the remaining frames and reproduce the images at a predetermined frame rate for displaying the reproduced images in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> develops and displays the images SG<b>1</b> through SG<b>9</b> of a total of 9 frames including the frame of the reproduced image that the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>g </sub>is displaying at that time, the four frames immediately preceding that frame and the four frames immediately succeeding the frame out of the frames left after the initial thinning operation.</p>

Therefore, the still images of the nine frames are displayed when the reproduction of the images is suspended, whereas the two-dimensionally developed images are reproduced at the normal speed when the reproduced images are being displayed in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>at the normal speed.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">(4) Scrub Feature</heading>
<p id="p-0325" num="0325">In addition to the above-described arrangements, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> is provided with a scrub feature for the operator to search for an image, while confirming the contents of the moving image.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0326">The expression of scrub as used herein refers to reproduction of a frame or a field of the picture specified by the operator. The operator specifies a picture typically by moving or otherwise manipulating the knob that functions as GUI (graphical user interface).</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0327">In this embodiment, the knob is provided as scrub knob <b>67</b> that is movable relative to scrub bar <b>66</b> arranged at the bottom row of the display section <b>55</b> in the editing image <b>50</b> and adapted to move in response to the reproducing position of the reproduced image displayed in an image display section, for example the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), specified in advance out of the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>where the reproduced images are displayed with the reproduced time lags &#x394;T.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0328">When the scrub knob <b>67</b> is operated so as to be moved slowly, the image of the frame located at the reproducing position that corresponds to the position of the scrub knob <b>67</b> changes slowly for so-called slow replay. When, on the other hand, the scrub knob <b>67</b> is operated so as to be moved fast, the image of the frame located at the reproducing position that corresponds to the position of the scrub knob <b>67</b> changes fast for so-called high speed replay. Therefore, scrub is a sort of variable speed (special) replay.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0329">On the other hand, in this editing apparatus <b>2</b>, the relative positional relationship between the 3D virtual space and the character CA<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) is used to change the display mode for the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> being displayed in the display section <b>55</b> as pointed out above.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0330">Therefore, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can scrub (reproduce an image with a variable speed (in a special way)) in a condition where the display mode of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is changed to match a desired viewpoint on the part of the operator (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 through 32</figref>). Then, as a result, the operator can search for an image after analyzing in detail the overall flow of the reproduced images displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> and the flow of part of the reproduced images to which attention needs to be paid.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0331">On the other hand, for a scrub operation, it is necessary to read the encoded data of the frame at the position of reproduction that corresponds to the position of the scrub knob <b>67</b>, decode the encoded data into image data and display (the image corresponding to) the image data in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> (image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>) with the reproduced time lags &#x394;T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In the current situation where non-linear editing has become very popular, the importance of the scrub feature is increasing as means for checking the contents of a moving image and determining an editing point. Therefore, a scrub feature with which the operator can check the contents of a moving image smoothly in detail is required.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0332">In view of the above identified situation, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is adapted to appropriately change the display of the reproduced images being displayed in (the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of) the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> on the display section <b>55</b> of the editing image <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) with the reproduction time lags &#x394;T according to the operation of moving the scrub knob <b>67</b>, constantly maintaining the reproduction time lags &#x394;T.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0333">Such a process is executed by the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the GPU <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and may be divided into a process that is executed prior to the editing operation by way of the editing image <b>50</b> (to be referred to as pre-editing process hereinafter) and a process for changing the display of the reproduced images according to the operation of moving the scrub knob <b>67</b> and on the basis of the results of the pre-editing process in a state where the reproduced images are maintained with the reproduction time lags &#x394;T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) (to be referred to as scrub operation hereinafter).

<p id="p-0428" num="0428">The display type determining section <b>1023</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) determines the display type that indicates the display mode for displaying each frame, selecting it from a plurality of display types, according to the variations determined by the variation computing section <b>1022</b> on a frame by frame basis as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0429"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows an example of display types determined by the display type determining section <b>1023</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0430"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows three display types including still image type V<b>1</b> for displaying still images, ordinary type V<b>2</b> where the resolution and the display rate (frame rate) for displaying frames are variable and high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0431">The term of resolution as used herein for displaying a frame refers to the spatial resolution of the image displayed on a display apparatus such as display <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, as for image data including main line data and proxy data, main line data show a high resolution whereas proxy data show a low resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0432">The term of display rate for displaying frames refers to the frequency (period) of updating the display on a display apparatus such as display <b>40</b>. For example, when the display is updated at a display rate same as the frame rate of moving image (e.g., 30 Hz) and, at the same time, the frame that is the object of display is updated from a frame to the next frame (the temporally next frame) at a rate same as the frame rate, the moving image is displayed at the normal speed.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0433">When, on the other hand, the display is updated at a display rate twice as much as the frame rate of moving image and, at the same time, the frame that is the object of display is updated from a frame to the next frame at a rate twice as much as the frame rate, the moving image is displayed at the double speed.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0434">Note that the moving image is displayed at the double speed when the display is updated at a display rate same as the frame rate of the moving image and, at the same time, the frame that is the object of display is updated from a frame to the next frame at a rate twice as much as the frame rate.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0435">Note that, however, the moving image is displayed at the double speed without thinning frames when the display is updated at a display rate twice as much as the frame rate of moving image and, at the same time, the frame that is the object of display is updated from a frame to the next frame at a rate twice as much as the frame rate, whereas frames are thinned when the display is updated at a display rate twice as much as the frame rate of moving image and, at the same time, the frame that is the object of display is updated from a frame to the next frame at a rate twice as much as the frame rate.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0436">Therefore, it is possible to prevent frames from being thinned (reduced) by raising the display rate when the frame that is the object of display is updated at a rate higher than the frame rate.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0437">As for a frame of the still image type V<b>1</b>, if the frame that is the object of display is changed, the (image of the) frame displayed immediately before the change is displayed so long as the frame that is the object of display can be (continuously) regarded same as the (image of the) frame displayed immediately before the change.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0438">As for a frame of the ordinary type V<b>2</b>, the image is displayed at a display rate same as the frame rate of moving image (to be referred to as ordinary rate hereinafter) and with a resolution same as image data of main line data (a resolution higher than an image of proxy data) (to be referred to as ordinary resolution hereinafter).</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0439">As for a frame of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>, the image is displayed at a rate higher than the ordinary rate, e.g. a display rate twice as high as the ordinary rate, and with a resolution same as image data of proxy data (a resolution lower than an image of main line data).</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0440">When there are three display types including the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the variation computing section <b>1022</b> determines the movement information that expresses the extent of temporal change of frames as variation. Then, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> compares, for example, the variation (movement information) of each frame and two predetermined threshold values and selects one of three types of the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> according to the outcome of the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0441"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> illustrates the display type that the display type determining section <b>1023</b> determines on a frame by frame basis according to the variations on a frame by frame basis as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0442">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> compares the variations (movement information) of frames with threshold value L or threshold value H, which show a relationship of L&#x3c;H on a frame by frame basis. Then, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> selects the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>, which is a low resolution type or a high display rate type, for the frames whose movement information is not lower than the threshold value H and hence indicates a large extent of temporal change.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0443">It is desirable to display frames whose movement is large are displayed at a high display rate because the operator can miss temporal changes of images when he or she is scrubbing in an editing operation if, for example, frames that show a large extent of temporal change and hence a large movement are thinned.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0444">However, the load of the apparatus where the scrub feature is being used is increased when the display rate is raised. Additionally, the quantity of data of a frame showing a large movement is large and hence the load of processing the frame is greater than the load of processing a frame showing only a small movement.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0445">Thus, this embodiment is so adapted that a frame showing a large movement is displayed at a high display rate but the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>, which is a low resolution type or a high display rate type, is employed for it. Since the quantity of data of an image showing a low resolution is smaller than that of an image showing a high resolution, it is possible to reduce the load of the apparatus where the scrub feature is being used and at the same time prevent the operator from missing temporal changes of images in an editing operation by displaying frames showing a large movement at a low resolution and a high display rate.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0446">On the other hand, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> selects the still image type V<b>1</b> for displaying still images for the display type of frames whose movement information is less than the threshold value L and hence indicates a small extent of temporal change.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0447">When the scrub feature is being used for an editing operation and frames that show a small extent of temporal change and hence do not (or hardly) show any movement appear consecutively, the image being displayed on the display apparatus does not (or hardly) change when the frame that is the object of display is updated among such frames and the display of the display apparatus, or the display <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is shifted from the (image of the) frame displayed immediately before to the (image of the) frame that is the object of display after the update.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0448">The load of the apparatus where the scrub feature is being used is made heavy for nothing when the frame that is the object of display is updated among such frames and the display of the display apparatus is shifted from the (image of the) frame displayed immediately before to the (image of the) frame that is the object of display after the update although the image being displayed on the display apparatus does not (or hardly) change.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0449">Additionally, when frames that show a small extent of temporal change and hence do not (or hardly) show any movement appear consecutively, the image being displayed on the display apparatus can sometimes be changed slightly when the display of the display apparatus, of the display <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is shifted from the frame displayed immediately before to the frame that is the object of display after the update. Then, the operator who is using the scrub feature on the apparatus is forced to pay attention to the frames that appear consecutively and do not (or hardly) show any movement for nothing because such frames are hardly selected for editing points.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0450">In view of the above-described circumstances, this embodiment employs the still image type V<b>1</b> for displaying the (image of the) frame that is displayed immediately before for frames that do not show any movement if the frame that is the object of display is changed so long as the image of the frame that is the object of display can be regarded same as the image of the frame that is displayed immediately before. With this arrangement, it is possible to prevent a heavy load from being applied to the apparatus where the scrub feature is used and the operator for nothing.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0451">The display type determining section <b>1023</b> selects the ordinary type V<b>2</b> for the display type of frames other than frames whose movement information is not less than the threshold value H and frames whose movement information is less than the threshold value L, or frames showing movement information not less than the threshold value L and less than the threshold value H.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0452">In other words, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> for display images at the ordinary rate (display rate same as the frame rate of moving images) and normally at a low resolution is employed for frames that show a certain extent of movement that is not large.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0453">Among the (string of) frames arranged in time series to form a moving image, a section where frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> appear consecutively is referred to as a still image section and a section where frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> appear consecutively is referred to as an ordinary image section. On the other hand, a section where frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> consecutively appear is referred to as a high display rate/low resolution section.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0454"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> shows an exemplary configuration of the display type determining section <b>1023</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0455">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> includes a memory section <b>1081</b>, a threshold value processing section <b>1082</b>, a continuity determining section <b>1083</b> and a deciding section <b>1084</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0456">The memory section <b>1081</b> is supplied with variations on a frame by frame basis from the variation computing section <b>1022</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>). The memory section <b>1081</b> temporarily stores the variations on a frame by frame basis supplied from the variation computing section <b>1022</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0457">The threshold value processing section <b>1082</b> compares the variations on a frame by frame basis stored in the memory section <b>1081</b> with the threshold value H or L and supplies comparison information that shows the results of the comparison to the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> and the deciding section <b>1084</b> on a frame by frame basis.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0458">The continuity determining section <b>1083</b> judges if a plurality of frames not less than N showing a variation not less than the threshold value H appear consecutively or a plurality of frames not less than N showing a variation less than the threshold value H appear consecutively according to the comparison information supplied from the threshold processing section <b>1082</b> on a frame by frame basis and supplies determination information showing the outcome of the determination to the deciding section <b>1084</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0459">The deciding section <b>1084</b> decides the display type of each frame that forms the moving image according to the comparison information from the threshold processing section <b>1082</b> and the determination information from the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> and outputs the display type.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0460">Now, the process that the display type determining section <b>1023</b> executes will be described below by referring to the flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 53</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0461">As variations are supplied from the variation computing section <b>1022</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) on a frame by frame basis, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> caches (temporarily stores) the variations on a frame by frame basis in the memory section <b>1081</b> in Step S<b>1011</b> and then the process proceeds to Step S<b>1012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0462">Assume here that movement information of each frame is supplied from the variation computing section <b>1022</b> to the display type determining section <b>1023</b> as variation. Assume here also that the display type determining section <b>1023</b> selects a display type from the three types of the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> for each frame.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0463">In Step S<b>1012</b>, the threshold value processing section <b>1082</b> executes a threshold process of comparing the variations on a frame by frame basis (movement information) stored in the memory section <b>1081</b> and (either) the threshold value H or the threshold value L (or both of them) and supplies comparison information showing the outcome of the comparison of the variations on a frame by frame basis and the threshold value H or L to the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> on a frame by frame basis, before the process proceeds to Step S<b>1013</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0464">In Step S<b>1013</b>, the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> typically selects the frame that is located most front in time series that is not selected as attentional frame yet among the frames of the moving image for which the Fy file preparing section <b>1004</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) is preparing an Fy file and then the process proceeds to Step S<b>1014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0465">In Step S<b>1014</b>, the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> judges if the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value H and there exist a plurality of frames, or not less than N frames, whose variations are not less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame or not according to the comparison information from the threshold value processing section <b>1082</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0466">If it is determined in Step S<b>1014</b> that the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value H and there exist a plurality of frames, or not less than N frames, whose variations are not less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame, the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> supplies determination information that shows the outcome of the determination to the deciding section <b>1084</b> and the process proceeds to Step S<b>1015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0467">In Step S<b>1015</b>, the deciding section <b>1084</b> decides the display type of the attentional frame as the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> according to the determination information from the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> and the process proceeds to Step S<b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0468">The display type of the attentional frame is decided as the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> when not only the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value H but also there exist a plurality of frames, or not less than N frames, whose variations are not less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame in Steps S<b>1014</b> and S<b>1015</b> for the reason as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0469">As will be described hereinafter, when the display type is selected from the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>, an image showing a higher resolution (the ordinary resolution), or an image obtained by processing the image data of the main line data whose data quantity is larger (than the proxy data), is displayed for frames whose display type is the still image type V<b>1</b> or the ordinary type V<b>2</b> in a scrub operation. On the other hand, an image showing a low resolution, or an image obtained by processing the image data of the proxy data whose data quantity is smaller (than the main line data), is displayed for frames whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0470">If the memory apparatus <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is a professional disk where both main line data and proxy data are recorded and a scrub operation is conducted by using the main line data or the proxy data recorded in the memory apparatus <b>22</b>, it is necessary to read out the main line data from the memory apparatus <b>22</b> for frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> or the ordinary type V<b>2</b>, whereas it is necessary to readout the proxy data from the memory apparatus <b>22</b> for frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0471">Since main line data and proxy data are recorded at respective positions that are physically separated from each other in the memory apparatus <b>22</b>, seek operations will take place frequently in scrub operations for detecting data recorded in the memory apparatus <b>22</b> to make it difficult to smoothly display the frame specified by operating the scrub bar <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) depending on the performance of the apparatus where scrub operations are performed if frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> or the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> appear alternately in an extreme instance.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0472">In view of this potential problem, this embodiment is so adapted that the display type is selected in such a way that not less than N frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> appears consecutively and also not less than N frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> or the ordinary type V<b>2</b> appear consecutively in order to prevent seek operations from taking place frequently.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0473">Differently stated, in Steps S<b>1014</b> and S<b>1015</b>, when the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value H and there exist a plurality of frames, or not less than N frames, whose variations are not less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame, the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> is selected for the display type of the attentional frame.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0474">The number of frames N can be determined by considering the maximum seek time of the drive <b>5</b> for reproducing data from the memory apparatus <b>22</b> and the total number of frames for forming the moving image for which an Fy file is to be prepared by the Fy file preparing section <b>1004</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>). Alternatively, the number of frames N may be determined in response to the operation performed by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0475">Since the number of frames N refers to the minimum number of frames whose variations are not less than the threshold value H and that need to appear consecutively (or the minimum macro block of frames whose variations are less than the threshold value H and that need to appear consecutively as will be described hereinafter), it may also be referred to as minimum limit number of frames N if appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0476">Seek becomes a problem when frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> or the ordinary type V<b>2</b> for displaying images by using main line data and frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> for displaying images by using proxy data are switched frequently. In other words, seek does not become a problem for frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> and frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> for displaying images by using main line data.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0477">When, on the other hand, it is determined in Step S<b>1014</b> that the variation of the attentional frame is not more than the threshold value H or there does not exist a plurality of frames, or not less than N frames, whose variations are not less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame, the process proceeds to Step S<b>1016</b>, where the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> judges if the variation of the attentional frame is not more than the threshold value H and there exist a plurality of frames, or not less than the minimum limit number of frames N, whose variations are not less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame or not according to the comparison information from the threshold value processing section <b>1082</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0478">If it is determined in Step S<b>1016</b> that the variation of the attentional frame is less than the threshold value H and there exist a plurality of frames, or not less than the minimum limit number of frames N, whose variations are less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame, the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> supplies information showing the outcome of determination to the deciding section <b>1084</b> and the process proceeds to Step S<b>1017</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0479">Upon receiving the determination information from the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> telling that the variation of the attentional frame is not more than the threshold value H and there exist a plurality of frames, or not less than the minimum limit number of frames N, whose variations are not more than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame, the deciding section <b>1084</b> decides if the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value L or not according to the comparison information from the threshold value processing section <b>1082</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0480">If it is decided in Step S<b>1017</b> that the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value L and hence the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value L and less than the threshold value H, the process proceeds to Step S<b>1018</b>, where the deciding section <b>1084</b> decides that the display type of the attentional frame is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the process proceeds to Step S<b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0481">If, on the other hand, it is decided in Step S<b>1017</b> that the variation of the attentional frame is not more than the threshold value L and hence less than the threshold value L, the process proceeds to Step S<b>1019</b>, where the deciding section <b>1084</b> decides that the display type of the attentional frame is the still image type V<b>1</b> and the process proceeds to Step S<b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0482">Thus, with the Steps S<b>1016</b> through S<b>1019</b>, when the variation of the attentional frame is less than the threshold value H and there exist not less than N frames, whose variations are less than the threshold value H and that appear consecutively immediately before, immediately after or across the attentional frame, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> is selected as the display type of the attentional frame when the variation of the attentional frame is not less than the threshold value L and the still image type V<b>1</b> is selected as the display type of the attentional frame when the variation of the attentional frame is less than the threshold value L.

<p id="p-0483" num="0483">In Step S<b>1020</b>, the continuity determining section <b>1083</b> judges if there still is at least a frame that is not selected as attentional frame in the frames that form the moving image for which the Fy file preparing section <b>1004</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) is preparing an Fy file or not.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0484">If it is determined in Step S<b>1020</b> that there still is at least a frame that is not selected as attentional frame, the process returns to Step S<b>1013</b> and a frame that is not selected as attentional frame is newly selected as attentional frame and the process is repeated.

<p id="p-0485" num="0485">If it is determined in Step S<b>1020</b> that there is no frame that is not selected as attentional frame, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> ends the process.</p>

<p id="p-0593" num="0593">Thus, frames of complex images are displayed with a high resolution but the ordinary resolution/low display rate type C<b>3</b> that is a high resolution/low display rate type for displaying images at a low display rate is employed here. Since the processing load is smaller when an image is displayed at a low display rate than when an image is displayed at a high display rate, it is possible to reduce the load of the apparatus where the scrub feature is being used and at the same time prevent the operator from missing spatial changes of images in an editing operation by displaying high resolution images with a low resolution for frames of complex images.</p>
<p id="p-0594" num="0594">On the other hand, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> selects the low resolution/ordinary display rate type C<b>1</b> for displaying images with a resolution lower than the ordinary resolution/low display rate type C<b>3</b> and at the ordinary display rate that is higher than ordinary resolution/low display rate type C<b>3</b> for the display type for frames whose fineness information is less than the threshold value L and hence shows only a small extent of spatial change.</p>
<p id="p-0595" num="0595">Minute parts of frames showing a small extent of spatial change, or those of a plane image, do not appear significantly differently between when the image is displayed with a high resolution and when it is displayed with a low resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0596" num="0596">The load of the apparatus where the scrub feature is being used is raised for nothing when minutes parts of an image that do not appear significantly differently between when the image is displayed with a high resolution and when it is displayed with a low resolution are displayed with a high resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0597" num="0597">For this reason, the low resolution/ordinary display rate type C<b>1</b> for displaying images with a resolution lower than the ordinary resolution/low display rate type C<b>3</b> and at a display rate higher than the ordinary resolution/low display rate type C<b>3</b> is employed to display frames of plane images. With this arrangement, it is possible to prevent the load of the apparatus where the scrub feature is being used is raised for nothing.</p>

<p id="p-0599" num="0599">In other words, the ordinary type C<b>2</b> for displaying images at the ordinary rate (same as the frame rate of moving image) and with the ordinary resolution is selected as the display type of frames of images that are neither very complex nor very plane.</p>

Then, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> selects a display type as tentative display type (tentatively determines the display type) according to the outcome of the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0667" num="0667">More specifically, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> selects one of the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> according to the movement information of the frame as tentative display type (tentatively determines the display type) in a manner as described earlier by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 through 54</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0668" num="0668">As a result, as described earlier by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 through 54</figref>, the display type of a frame whose movement information is less than the threshold value L is tentatively determined as the still image type V<b>1</b> and the display type of a frame whose movement information is not less than the threshold value L and less than the threshold value H is tentatively determined as the ordinary type V<b>2</b>, while a frame whose movement information is not less than the threshold value H is tentatively determined as the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0669" num="0669">Then, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) compares the fineness information of each frame with a predetermined threshold value K on a frame by frame basis and ultimately determines the display type of each frame as one of the still image type VC<b>1</b>, the ordinary type VC<b>2</b>, the high display rate/low resolution type VC<b>3</b> and the ordinary display rate/low resolution type VC<b>4</b> according to the outcome of the comparison and the tentative display type tentatively determined according to the movement information.</p>
<p id="p-0670" num="0670">More specifically, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> ultimately determines the display type of a frame whose tentative display type is the still image type V<b>1</b> as the still image type VC<b>1</b> and that of a frame whose tentative display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> as the high display rate/low resolution type VC<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0671" num="0671">Additionally, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> ultimately determines the display type of a frame whose tentative display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and whose fineness information is not less than the threshold value K, which is a frame of an image that cannot be the as a plane image, as the ordinary type VC<b>2</b>. Finally, the display type determining section <b>1023</b> ultimately determines the display type of a frame whose tentative display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and whose fineness information is less than the threshold value K, which is a frame of a plane image, as the ordinary display rate/low resolution type VC<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0672" num="0672">A frame whose tentative display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> is a frame that shows a certain extent of movement, although not very large. A frame whose fineness information is less than the threshold value K is a plane frame. Therefore, of the frames whose tentative display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b>, those whose fineness information is less than the threshold value K are frames that show a certain extent of movement but are still plane.</p>
<p id="p-0673" num="0673">If an image shows a certain extent of movement, the operator can hardly miss the spatial change of the image if it is a plane image and displayed with a low resolution. Additionally, the load of the apparatus doing a scrub operation can be reduced when the image is displayed with a low resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0674" num="0674">Therefore, while the display type of a frame that shows a certain extent of movement and whose tentative display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> is ultimately determined as the ordinary type VC<b>2</b> for displaying an image with the ordinary resolution in principle, it is ultimately determined as the ordinary display rate/low resolution type VC<b>4</b> for displaying an image with a resolution lower than the ordinary resolution only when the fineness information of the frame is less than the threshold value K.</p>
<p id="p-0675" num="0675">Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, the display type of a frame that is found in section DP of frames whose fineness information is less than the threshold value K and whose tentative display type as tentatively determined according to the movement information thereof is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> is ultimately determined as the ordinary display rate/low resolution type VC<b>4</b>.</p>

However, since a change in the luminance signal is more influential than the color difference signal to the visual sense of human being, it is desirable to use the luminance signal to determine the variation.</p>
<p id="p-0705" num="0705">When, on the other hand, a pixel value is determined from the color components of R, G and B, it is possible to determine the variation of a frame by using the square sum of the color components of R, G and B.</p>

<p id="p-0756" num="0756">As described above, there are frames of a display type that does not involve frame thinning and frames of a display type that involves frame thinning when the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved at a high moving speed for producing a double speed display (replay). In other words, a fast moving speed of the scrub knob <b>67</b> does not give rise to any frame thinning for frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> whose display rate is higher than the ordinary type V<b>2</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the operator from mixing a temporal change of image for frames showing a large movement.</p>
<p id="p-0757" num="0757">As pointed out above, the attentional frame is updated in every 1/30 seconds in an ordinary section whereas the attentional frame is updated in every 1/60 seconds in a high display rate/low resolution section, which is &#xbd; of an ordinary section.</p>
<p id="p-0758" num="0758">Therefore, the decoder <b>1116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>) needs to decode the frames of a high display rate/low resolution section (frames whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>) at a rate twice as high as the frames of the ordinary section (frames whose display type is an ordinary type V<b>2</b>). Additionally, since a frame of a high display rate/low resolution section is a frame showing a large movement that is larger than a frame of an ordinary section, the quantity of data of a frame of a high display rate/low resolution section that the decoder <b>1116</b> needs to decode is larger than the quantity of data of a frame of an ordinary section. From the above, the load of displaying a frame of a high display rate/low resolution section is greater than the load of displaying a frame of an ordinary section.</p>
<p id="p-0759" num="0759">In view of this fact, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> decodes image data as main line data when displaying a frame of an ordinary section, whereas it decodes image data as proxy data when displaying a frame of a high display rate/low resolution section because the quantity of data is smaller in the case of the latter to reduce the load of displaying a frame of a high display rate/low resolution section.</p>
<p id="p-0760" num="0760">While the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved at a rate of moving from left to right by the length of two specifiable sections in 1/30 seconds in the above-described instance, when the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved at rate of moving from left to right by the length of a specifiable section in 1/30 seconds, for example, every frame becomes the attentional frame at time intervals of 1/30 seconds in an ordinary section where frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> are arranged consecutively.

<p id="p-0764" num="0764">In other words, for the frames of a still image section, the image of the frame that becomes the first attentional frame in the still image section is continuously displayed so long as any of the frames of the still image section is selected as attentional frame.</p>
<p id="p-0765" num="0765">Therefore, as shown at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>, when the scrub knob <b>67</b> specifies a frame of a section other than a still image section (a high display rate/low resolution section in the illustrated instance) at the start of a scrub operation and the operator moves the scrub knob <b>67</b> from left to right to firstly specify the leftmost frame of a still image section (the frame that is temporally most preceding frame in the still image section) as attentional frame, the decoder <b>1116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>) decodes the image data of the frame that is firstly specified as attentional frame and the corresponding image is displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0766" num="0766">Thereafter, the image of the frame firstly specified as attentional frame is displayed as the image of the current attentional frame so long as a frame of the still image section is specified as attentional frame. Thus, the decoder <b>1116</b> does not decode the image data of any frame of the still image section other than the image data of the frame that is firstly specified as attentional frame so long as a frame of the still image section is specified as attentional frame.</p>
<p id="p-0767" num="0767">When, on the other hand, the scrub knob <b>67</b> specifies a frame somewhere in the middle of a still image section at the start of a scrub operation as attentional frame as shown in the middle part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>, the decoder <b>1116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>) decodes the image data of the frame that is firstly specified as attentional frame and corresponding image is displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>

Thus, the decoder <b>1116</b> does not decode the image data of any frame of the still image section other than the image data of the frame that is firstly specified as attentional frame so long as a frame of the still image section is specified as attentional frame.</p>
<p id="p-0769" num="0769">Furthermore, when the scrub knob <b>67</b> specifies a frame that is out of the still image section (which is an ordinary section or a high display rate/low resolution section in this instance) at the start of a scrub operation as attentional frame as shown at the bottom of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> and the operator moves the scrub knob <b>67</b> from right to left and firstly specifies the frame located at the right end of the still image section (the frame that is temporally most succeeding), the decoder <b>1116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>) decodes the image data of the frame that is firstly specified as attentional frame and corresponding image is displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0770" num="0770">Thereafter, the image of the frame firstly specified as attentional frame is displayed as the image of the current attentional frame so long as a frame of the still image section is specified as attentional frame.

<p id="p-0771" num="0771">Now, the scrub operation will be described by referring to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0772" num="0772">For example, the operator operates the operation controller <b>37</b>, the mouse <b>38</b> or the keyboard <b>39</b> to specify an AV file that is the object of editing, the operation signal that corresponds to the operation is supplied to the GUI control section <b>1111</b> from the operation controller <b>37</b>, the mouse <b>38</b> or the keyboard <b>39</b>, whichever appropriate.</p>

<p id="p-0787" num="0787">More specifically, if it is determined in Step S<b>1117</b> that the display type of the attentional frame is the still image type V<b>1</b>, the process proceeds to Step S<b>1118</b>, where the display control section <b>1117</b> judges if the display type of the frame that was the attentional frame immediately before (to be also referred to as immediately preceding frame whenever appropriate hereinafter) is the still image type V<b>1</b> and both the immediately preceding frame and the attentional frame are frames of the same still image section or not by referring to the Fy file stored in the file memory section <b>1121</b> of the Fy file management section <b>1114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0788" num="0788">If it is determined in Step S<b>1118</b> that the immediately preceding frame and the attentional frame are not frames of a same still image section, the process proceeds to Step S<b>1119</b>, where the decoder <b>1116</b> waits until the data supply control section <b>1113</b> reads out the main line data of the attentional frame (and the data necessary for decoding the attentional frame) from the memory apparatus <b>22</b> and supplies them to the decoder <b>1116</b> and then acquires (receives) the main line data of the attentional frame before it proceeds to Step S<b>1120</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0820" num="0820">When, on the other hand, the attentional frame is a frame whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> and hence that shows a large (strong) movement, an image is displayed at a high display rate so that the operator can check the contents of the image showing a strong movement accurately with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0821" num="0821">Additionally, when the attentional frame is a frame whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>, the proxy data whose quantity of data is smaller than the main line data are decoded and an image that corresponds to the image data obtained as a result is displayed so that it is possible to reduced the load of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> and prevent a situation where the editing program does not respond (and hence the editing apparatus <b>2</b> is hung up) from taking place due to a heavy load of the editing apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0822" num="0822">When the attentional frame is a frame whose display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and hence shows a certain extent of movement, although not strong, an image of the frame whose display rate is lower than that of a frame of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> but whose resolution is higher than that of a frame of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> is displayed. Since an image of a frame whose display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> shows a movement (the inter-frame change of pixel values) smaller than an image of a frame whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>, the operator can accurately check the contents of the image if the image is displayed at the display rate of a frame of a display type whose display rate is lower than that of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0823" num="0823">Furthermore, an image of a frame whose display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> shows a movement whose extent is smaller than an image of a frame whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>, the data quantity of the main line data of a frame whose display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b> is smaller than that of the main line data of a frame whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b>. Therefore, when the attentional frame is a frame whose display type is the ordinary type V<b>2</b>, if the main line data thereof are decoded and a high resolution image that corresponds to the image data that are obtained as a result of the decoding is displayed, the load of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> is smaller than the load that is applied to the editing apparatus <b>2</b> when the main line data of a frame whose display type is the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> are decoded.</p>
<p id="p-0824" num="0824">As described above, in a scrub operation, all the frames to be displayed are not displayed in the same display mode but reproduced images are displayed by changing predetermined parameters according to the variations (movement information, fineness information) of the images. More specifically, the parameters include a parameter (display parameter) that relates to display and is employed to change the resolution of image and parameters (reproduction parameters) that relate to reproduction and are employed to change the display rate (frame rate) and the reproduction speed v. Additionally, only necessary frames are decoded according to the variations of images. With these arrangements, it is possible to perform a scrub operation appropriately.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">(4-3) Other Forms of Scrub Operation</heading>
<p id="p-0825" num="0825">The display type is determined according to movement information in the above-described scrub operation. Three display types including the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> are provided for the scrub operation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>. However, a scrub operation can alternatively be executed by using five display types including the still image type V<b>11</b>, the ordinary type V<b>12</b>, the high display rate/ordinary resolution type V<b>13</b>, the super high display rate/low resolution type V<b>14</b> and the ultra super high display rate/low resolution type V<b>15</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> or by using three display types including the low resolution/ordinary display rate type C<b>1</b>, the ordinary type C<b>2</b> and the ordinary resolution/low display rate type C<b>3</b> that are determined according to the fineness information as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0826" num="0826">The main line data of an image showing a high resolution and the proxy data of a corresponding image showing a low resolution are recorded in the memory apparatus <b>22</b>, in other words, images of two different types of resolution showing same contents are recoded in the memory apparatus <b>22</b>, and then either an image showing a high resolution or a corresponding image showing a low resolution is displayed depending on the display type of the attentional frame in the above-described scrub operation. However, alternatively it is possible to record images of three different types of resolution including a high resolution, medium resolution and a low resolution in the memory apparatus <b>22</b> and selectively display an image showing a high resolution, an image showing a medium resolution or an image showing a low resolution according to the display type of the attentional frame.</p>
<p id="p-0827" num="0827">Furthermore, the section length of the specifiable section to which frames are assigned is held to a constant value in the above-described scrub operation. However, alternatively it is possible to use a section length obtained by weighting according to movement information, or the variations of the frames assigned to the section.</p>
<p id="p-0828" num="0828">The position of the scrub knob <b>67</b> is detected periodically with a period that corresponds to the display rate and one of the frames assigned to the specifiable section where the scrub knob <b>67</b> is located is selected as attentional frame in the above-described scrub operation so that the attentional frame is displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> (image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>) with the reproduction time lags &#x394;T.</p>
<p id="p-0829" num="0829">As described above by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>, when the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> is divided into a number of specifiable sections having a section length same as the number of frames of a reproduced image that is the object of editing (and hence the object of scrub) displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> and the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved at a constant speed, the scrub knob <b>67</b> moves by a predetermined distance and hence across a predetermined number of specifiable sections in a unit time. Therefore, if the display rate is constant, a predetermined number of frames are displayed as the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved at a constant speed by a constant distance.</p>
<p id="p-0830" num="0830">To simplify the explanation, assume that the display rate is constant and the reproduced image that is displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> includes sections where frames showing a strong movement are arranged consecutively (to be referred to as movement sections whenever appropriate hereinafter) and sections where frames showing no movement are arranged consecutively (to be referred to as non-movement sections wherever appropriate hereinafter). If the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved at a constant speed by a constant distance in each of the range of a specifiable section where frames of movement section are assigned and the range of a specifiable where frames of non-movement section are assigned, the number of frames displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> does not change.</p>
<p id="p-0831" num="0831">However, when the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved within the range of a specifiable section where frames of movement section are assigned, the image being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> changes (moves) to a large extent because frames of movement section show a strong movement.</p>
<p id="p-0832" num="0832">On the other hand, when the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved within the range of a specifiable section where frames of non-movement section are assigned, the image being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> changes (moves) scarcely because frames of non-movement section do not (scarcely) show a movement.</p>
<p id="p-0833" num="0833">Thus, when the movable range of scrub bar <b>66</b> is defined to be a specifiable section and the section lengths of specifiable sections are made equal to each other, there arise ranges where the image being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> changes to a large extent and ranges where the image being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> does not change.</p>
<p id="p-0834" num="0834">When the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved to a certain extent within the range of a specifiable section where frames of non-movement section are assigned, the image being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> does not change so that the operator operating the scrub knob <b>67</b> may have an irritating feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0835" num="0835">When, on the other hand, the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved to a certain extent within a range of a specifiable section where frames of movement section are assigned, the image being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> changes to a large extent so that the operator operating the scrub knob <b>67</b> may be required to manipulate it delicately (finely) in order to detect a desired frame of an image.</p>
<p id="p-0836" num="0836">In view of the above-described circumstances, it is possible to make the section length of specifiable sections to which frames are assigned not constant but weighted as a function of movement information, or the variations of frames assigned to the specifiable sections, in such a way that the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> is divided into specifiable sections and the section length of a specifiable section where frames showing large variations as movement information are assigned is made large. Specific examples will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0837" num="0837"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> illustrates an example of weight to be used for weighting the section length of specifiable section.</p>
<p id="p-0838" num="0838">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates the frame (as indicated by an ordinal number) and the vertical axis indicates the movement information, which is the variation.</p>
<p id="p-0839" num="0839">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is not less than threshold value L<b>1</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 1 and the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is not less than threshold value L<b>2</b> and less than threshold value L<b>1</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 0.7, whereas the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is not less than threshold value L<b>3</b> and less than threshold value L<b>2</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 0.5 and the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is not less than threshold value L<b>4</b> and less than threshold value L<b>3</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 0.3. Additionally, the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is less than threshold value L<b>4</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 0.1, the threshold values L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b> and L<b>4</b> satisfying the requirement of formula L<b>1</b>&#x3e;L<b>2</b>&#x3e;L<b>3</b>&#x3e;L<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0840" num="0840">The section lengths weighted by weight w in the above-described manner can be determined typically in the following way.</p>
<p id="p-0841" num="0841">Sections where specifiable sections whose section lengths are weighted by the same weight w are arranged consecutively will be referred to as same weight sections hereinafter. Assume that the range where frames of the reproduced image that is displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> as the object of editing (and hence the object of scrub) is divided into Q same weight sections.</p>
<p id="p-0842" num="0842">The number of specifiable sections constituting the q-th same weight section from the forefront of the Q same weight sections, or the number of frames assigned to the specifiable section that is the q-th same weight section, is expressed as Fq and the weight fitted to the section length of each of the specifiable sections constituting the q-th same weight section is expressed as wq.</p>
<p id="p-0843" num="0843">The total number F of frames of the reproduced image that is the object of editing (and hence the object of scrub) displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is expressed by formula F=F<b>1</b>+F<b>2</b>+ . . . FQ.</p>
<p id="p-0844" num="0844">If the length of the movable range is 1, the section length of a specifiable section is expressed by 1/F when no weighting system is used.</p>
<p id="p-0845" num="0845">On the other hand, when a weighting system as described above is used, the section length of the specifiable section that constitutes the q-th same weight section from the forefront is expressed by wqFq/(&#x3a3;wiFi). Since the section length of the q-th same weight section from the forefront is expressed by wqFq/(&#x3a3;wiFi), it is possible to determine the section length of the specifiable section constituting the q-th same weight section from the forefront is determined by dividing wq/(&#x3a3;wiFi) by the number of (the frames assigned to) the specifiable section that constitutes the q-th same weight section when the weighting system is used. Note that &#x3a3;wiFi expresses the total sum of wiFi when the suffix i is varied from 1 to Q.</p>
<p id="p-0846" num="0846">It will be appreciated that, when no weighting system is used, the section length of the specifiable section can be determined by making all the weights w<b>1</b>, w<b>2</b>, . . . , wQ of the weighting system equal to each other. In other words, when the weighting system is used, the section length of the specifiable section that constitutes the q-th same weight section from the forefront is wq/(&#x3a3;wiFi) as described above. When the weights w<b>1</b>, w<b>2</b>, . . . , wQ are equal to each other and also to w, wq/(&#x3a3;wiFi)=w/(w&#x3a3;Fi)=1/&#x3a3;Fi=1/F.</p>
<p id="p-0847" num="0847">While four threshold values L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b> and L<b>4</b> that are not related to the threshold values used for determining display types are employed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> to determine the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames are assigned, the threshold values used for determining display types may alternatively be employed for determining the weight w of the section length.</p>
<p id="p-0848" num="0848"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref> illustrates an example where the threshold values H and L that are used for determining display types according to the movement information are also employed for determining the weight of the section length.</p>
<p id="p-0849" num="0849">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates the frame (as indicated by an ordinal number) and the vertical axis indicates the movement information, which is the variation.</p>
<p id="p-0850" num="0850">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>, the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is not less than the threshold value H are assigned is typically made equal to 0.5 and the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is not less than the threshold value L and less than the threshold value H are assigned is typically made equal to 0.3, whereas the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames whose movement information is less than the threshold value L are assigned is typically made equal to 0.1.</p>
<p id="p-0851" num="0851">Alternatively, when frames are assigned to a specifiable section and the display type of each of the frames is determined according to the movement information of the frame, the weight w of the section length of the specifiable section may be determined according to the display type.</p>
<p id="p-0852" num="0852">When the display type of a frame is determined according to the movement information of the frame, the display type indicates the extent of movement of the frame. More specifically, the display type of a frame is selected from the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> according to the movement information of the frame, a frame of the still image type V<b>1</b> is a frame whose movement information is less than the threshold value L in principle and a frame of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> is a frame whose movement information is not less than the threshold value L and less than the threshold value H, whereas a frame of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> is a frame whose movement information is not less than the threshold value H.</p>
<p id="p-0853" num="0853">Therefore, as in the case where the threshold values H and are used as described above by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>, it may be so arranged that the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 0.1 and the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 0.3, whereas the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> are assigned is typically made equal to 0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0854" num="0854">When the weight w of the section length of a specifiable section where frames are assigned is determined according to the display type of the frames, still image sections where frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> are consecutively arranged are same weight sections and ordinary image sections where frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> are consecutively arranged are same weight sections. Similarly, high display rate/low resolution sections where frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> are consecutively arranged are same weight sections.</p>
<p id="p-0855" num="0855"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> is a schematic illustration of specifiable sections when the section length is not weighted and specifiable sections when the section length is weighted.</p>
<p id="p-0856" num="0856">When the section length is not weighted, the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> is divided into specifiable sections having a same section length by the number of the frames constituting the reproduced image that is the object of editing (and hence the object of scrub) displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> as shown in the upper half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> and the frames constituting the reproduced image to be displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> are assigned in time series from the leftmost specifiable section as described above by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0857" num="0857">When the section length is not weighted, the section length of all the sections including still image sections where frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> are arranged consecutively, ordinary sections where frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> are arranged consecutively and high display rate/low resolution sections where frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> are arranged consecutively is made equal to d.</p>
<p id="p-0858" num="0858">When, on the other hand, the section length is weighted, the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> is divided into specifiable sections having different section lengths as shown in the lower half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>. More specifically, as described above by referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>, the frames constituting the reproduced image that is the object of editing (and hence the object of scrub) are assigned in time series from the leftmost specifiable section but the section length of a specifiable where frames having large variations that are movement information are assigned is made long.</p>
<p id="p-0859" num="0859">More specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>, the section length of a still image section where frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> and hence frames showing no movement are assigned is d/2, or &#xbd; of the section length d of a still image section when no weighting system is used. The section length of an ordinary section where frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> and hence frames showing a movement to a certain extent but not strong are assigned is d, or same as the section length d of an ordinary section when no weighting system is used. Finally, the section length of a specifiable section where frames of the high display rate/low resolution section type V<b>3</b> are assigned, frames showing a strong movement is 3d, or 3 times of the section length d of a high display rate/low resolution section when no weighting system is used.</p>
<p id="p-0860" num="0860">Thus, when the section length is weighted, the display of a frame of a still image section ends as the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved by a distance equal to &#xbd; of the section length for which no weighting system is used. Then, as a result, it is possible to prevent the operator operating the scrub knob <b>67</b> from having an irritating feeling when the image being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> does not change although he or she moves the scrub knob <b>67</b> considerably, or to a certain extent.</p>
<p id="p-0861" num="0861">Additionally, when the section length is weighted, the attentional frame being displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is changed from a frame to another of a high display rate/low resolution section as the scrub knob <b>67</b> is moved by a distance equal to 3 times of the section length for which no weighting system is used. Then, as a result, it is possible for the operator to detect the desired frame of an image without delicately (finely) manipulating the scrub knob <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0862" num="0862">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> illustrates type information (GUIs of belt-shaped regions for displaying display types in time series) that is made to agree with the horizontal scale of the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0863" num="0863">In the case of type information that is made to agree with the horizontal scale of the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b>, the (pattern of the) type information at the position of the scrub knob <b>67</b> indicates the display type of the frames assigned to the specifiable section where the scrub knob <b>67</b> is located.</p>

<p id="p-0865" num="0865">The weighted section length of a specifiable section where frames of still image section and hence where frames of the still image type V<b>1</b> are arranged consecutively is &#xbd; of the section length d of the corresponding specifiable section that is not weighted, or d/2. Therefore, the horizontal length of the region D<b>1</b> whose section length is weighted is &#xbd; of the horizontal length of the corresponding region D<b>1</b> whose section length is not weighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0866" num="0866">Then, the weighted section length of a specifiable section where frames of the ordinary section and hence where frames of the ordinary type V<b>2</b> are arranged consecutively is same as the section length d of the corresponding specifiable section that is not weighted, or d.

<p id="p-0867" num="0867">Finally, the weighted section length of a specifiable section where frames of high display rate/low resolution image section and hence where frames of the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> are arranged consecutively is 3 times of the section length d of the corresponding specifiable section that is not weighted, or 3d. Therefore, the horizontal length of the region D<b>3</b> whose section length is weighted is 3 times of the horizontal length of the corresponding region D<b>3</b> whose section length is not weighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0868" num="0868">As described above, when the section length is weighted, the type information corresponds to the weighted section length and hence differs from the type information that corresponds to the section length that is not weighted (conversely, the type information that corresponds to the section length that is not weighted differs from the type information that corresponds to the section length that is weighted).</p>
<p id="p-0869" num="0869">This editing apparatus <b>2</b> is provided with a weighting-on mode where the section length of each specifiable section is weighted and a weighting-off mode where the section length of each specifiable section is not weighted and the operator can select either mode, or switch from the weighting-on mode to the weighting-off mode or vice versa.</p>

<p id="p-0881" num="0881">As the range of a part of the reproduced image is used as the range of assignment for the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b>, the number of frames assigned to the specifiable sections from the forefront specifiable section to the tail end specifiable section in the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> is reduced if compared with the arrangement where all the range of the reproduced image is used as the range of assignment. Then, as a result, the section lengths of the specifiable sections are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0882" num="0882">Then, it is possible to prevent a situation where the frame that is the attentional frame displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> changes remarkably between before a move of the scrub knob <b>67</b> and after the move due to short section lengths of the specifiable sections from taking place.

<p id="p-0883" num="0883">Since the starting point indicator IGst and the ending point indicator IGed indicate the range of assignment that is the range of the frames assigned from the forefront specifiable section to the tail end specifiable section of the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b>, they provide range of assignment information.

<p id="p-0884" num="0884">Now, the range of assignment defining process for defining the range (the range of assignment) of the frames to be assigned to (the specifiable sections of) the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> according to the starting point indicator IGst and the ending point indicator IGed will be described by referring to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0885" num="0885">As an operation of defining a predetermined scrub range is performed by means of the operation controller <b>37</b>, the mouse <b>38</b> or the keyboard <b>39</b>, the GUI control section <b>1111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>) controls the display control section <b>1117</b> so as to have the starting point indicator IGst and the ending point indicator IGed displayed at predetermined respective positions on the predetermined position of the scrub bar <b>66</b> in Step S<b>1141</b> and then the process proceeds to Step S<b>1142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0886" num="0886">In Step S<b>1142</b>, the GUI control section <b>1111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>) assigns the frames of the range of assignment, which is the range of frames between the frame corresponding to the position of the starting point indicator IGst and the frame corresponding to the position of the ending point indicator IGed, to the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> out of the frames that constitute the reproduced image displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> that is the object of editing (and hence the object of scrub).</p>
<p id="p-0887" num="0887">If the above-described weighting for the section lengths of specifiable sections is not considered for the purpose of simplifying the following description, the GUI control section <b>1111</b> divides the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> into specifiable sections whose section length is equal to the quotient of the division of dividing the length of the movable range by the number of the frames found in the range of assignment.

<p id="p-0891" num="0891">In Step S<b>1144</b>, the display control section <b>1117</b> has the starting point indicator IGst or the ending point indicator IGed displayed at the position indicated by the information from the GUI control section <b>1111</b> instead of the position where it is displayed immediately before and the process proceeds to Step S<b>1145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0892" num="0892">In Step S<b>1145</b>, the GUI control section <b>1111</b> determines if the move of the starting point indicator IGst or the ending point indicator IGed is ended or not, in other words, if the operator ends the operation of the operation controller <b>37</b>, the mouse <b>38</b> or the keyboard <b>39</b> for moving the starting point indicator IGst or the ending point indicator IGed, whichever appropriate, or not.</p>
<p id="p-0893" num="0893">If it is determined in Step S<b>1145</b> that the operation of moving the starting point indicator IGst or the ending point indicator IGed is not ended, in other words that the operator is still operating the operation controller <b>37</b>, the mouse <b>38</b> or the keyboard <b>39</b> to move the starting point indicator IGst or the ending point indicator IGed, whichever appropriate, and an operation signal that corresponds to the operation is being supplied to the GUI control section <b>1111</b> from the operation controller <b>37</b>, the mouse <b>38</b> or the keyboard <b>39</b>, whichever appropriate, the GUI control section <b>1111</b> determines the position to which the starting point indicator IGst or the ending point indicator IGed, whichever appropriate, is to be moved and supplies information indicating the position to the display control section <b>1117</b> before the process returns to Step S<b>1144</b>.

Thereafter, the above-described process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0896" num="0896">As described above, the operator can alter the range of the frames that are the objects of scrub (the range of the frames assigned to the movable range of the scrub bar <b>66</b> (the range of assignment)) out of the frames that constitute the reproduced image that is displayed in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> as an object of editing by operating either the starting point indicator IGst or the ending point indicator IGed as GUI.</p>

<p id="p-0900" num="0900">In this example, it is assumed that the display type of a frame is determined according to movement information as one of the still image type V<b>1</b>, the ordinary type V<b>2</b> or the high display rate/low resolution type V<b>3</b> as described earlier by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>.</p>

Still alternatively, it may be so arranged that images are displayed with sizes defined respectively for the display types and the display type of each frame is determined according to the movement information and the fineness information thereof. When images are displayed with sizes defined respectively for the display types and the display type of each frame is determined according to the fineness information thereof, it is possible to display an image of the display type that is determined according to fineness information showing a large extent of fineness with a large size.

<p id="p-0927" num="0927">The variations (movement information, fineness information) that represent the extent of change in the image data of a moving image are determined for each frame and the display type of each frame is determined on a frame by frame basis in the above-described scrub operation. Then, the various processes relating to scrub are executed by using the display types. However, when the moving image is accompanied by audio data, the display type may be determined according to the level (power) of the audio data or the value that shows the extent of change of the audio data. Thus, for example, a frame where the level of audio data changes from low to high (there is an upsurge of sound) may probably show an image that requires attention. Therefore, it may be so arranged that a display type of a high display rate may be selected for displaying such a frame if the movement information thereof shows a certain extent of variation and a display type of a high resolution may be selected for displaying such a frame if the fineness information thereof shows a certain extent of variation.</p>
<p id="p-0928" num="0928">While the scrub operation is executed by using the image data of two different types of resolution including the main line data and the proxy data recorded in the memory apparatus <b>22</b> in the above description, it is possible to execute the scrub operation alternatively by using image data of a single type of resolution or image data of three or more than three different types of resolution.</p>

<p id="p-0935" num="0935"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> illustrates an Fy file that stores the variation of each frame and the display type of each frame.</p>
<p id="p-0936" num="0936">Assume now that a GOP is constituted by 15 frames. Then, it is possible to determine the display type of the GOP constituted by 15 frames as the display type that is the majority display type among the 15 frames, or the display type that the largest number of frames commonly have in the GOP.</p>
<p id="p-0937" num="0937">Then, in the case of the GOP constituted by the 15 frames from the first frame to the 15th frame from the top in the Fy file of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>, the display type V<b>2</b> has a majority among the display types V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b> of the frames so that the display type of the GOP is determined as V<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0938" num="0938">For instance, while the display type of the 9th frame from the top in the Fy file of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> is V<b>1</b>, the display type of the GOP is V<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0939" num="0939">As described above, when the variation and the display type of a GOP constituted by a plurality of frames are determined by determining the variation and the display type of each of the plurality of frames and stored in the Fy file, the capacity (file size) of the Fy file can be lessened if compared with an arrangement where the variations and the display types of all the frames are stored in the Fy file and the load of a process that requires an analysis of the Fy file (file parse) can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0940" num="0940">When preparing an Fy file, encoding image data according to the MPEG system, by determining the variation and the display type of each frame of each GOP, the variation and the display type can be contained in the GOP header in the stream obtained by encoding according to the MPEG system.</p>
<p id="p-0941" num="0941">In the above-described scrub operation, it is necessary for the decoder <b>1116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> to decode image data according to the MPEG system in order to encode image data according to the MPEG system and store them in the memory apparatus <b>22</b>. According to the MPEG system, when a GOP is constituted by 15 frames, each of the frames is encoded as a picture of one of the three picture types including I (Intra) picture, P (predictive) picture and B (bidirectionally predictive) picture. Out of I, P, B pictures, P picture and B picture are encoded on the basis of the I picture or the P picture that is encoded before them and operates as reference image (an image providing the basis for generating a predictive picture) and hence cannot be decoded after decoding the reference image.</p>
<p id="p-0942" num="0942">For example, if a GOP is constituted by 15 frames and each of the frames is expressed by I, P or B and a numeral that indicates the order of display, the 15 frames of the GOP may be expressed as B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, I<b>3</b>, B<b>4</b>, B<b>5</b>, P<b>6</b>, B<b>7</b>, B<b>8</b>, P<b>9</b>, B<b>10</b>, B<b>11</b>, P<b>12</b>, B<b>13</b>, B<b>14</b> and P<b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0943" num="0943">Assume here that, out of the GOP constituted by the 15 frames of B<b>1</b> through P<b>15</b>, the 6th P picture P<b>6</b> from the forefront is encoded by using the 3rd I picture I<b>3</b> as reference image and the 9th P picture P<b>6</b> is encoded by using the 6th P picture P<b>6</b> as reference image, whereas the 15th P picture P<b>15</b> is encoded by using the 12th P picture P<b>12</b> as reference image and the 13th B picture B<b>13</b> is encoded by using the 12th P picture P<b>12</b> and the 15th P picture P<b>15</b> as reference images.</p>
<p id="p-0944" num="0944">In this case, when the 13th B picture B<b>13</b> becomes the attentional frame to be displayed to the viewer <b>15</b>, it is not possible to refer to the 12th P picture P<b>12</b> and the 15th P picture P<b>15</b> to decode the 13th B picture B<b>13</b> before decoding the 3rd I picture I<b>3</b>, decoding the 6th P picture P<b>6</b> by referring to the 3rd I picture I<b>3</b>, decoding the 9th P picture P<b>9</b> by referring to the 6th P picture P<b>6</b>, decoding the 12th P picture P<b>12</b> by referring to the 9th P picture P<b>9</b> and decoding the 15th P picture P<b>15</b> by referring to the 12th P picture P<b>12</b>. Thus, it is time consuming to decode the B picture B<b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0945" num="0945">However, if the P pictures P<b>6</b>, P<b>9</b>, P<b>12</b> and P<b>15</b> are stored in a separate file referred to as P-to-I file as I pictures I<b>6</b>, I<b>9</b>, I<b>12</b> and I<b>15</b> respectively, the decoder <b>1116</b> can decode any picture quickly by referring to the pictures stored in the P-to-I file. In the above-described example, the B picture B<b>13</b> can be decoded in a short period of time by referring to the I pictures I<b>12</b> and I<b>15</b> stored in the P-to-I file.</p>
<p id="p-0946" num="0946">While resolution and image size are applied as parameters relating to display (display parameters) and display rate (frame rate) and reproduction speed v are applied as parameters relating to reproduction (reproduction parameters) in the above-described scrub operation as parameters changed according to the variations, any of various combinations of display parameters and reproduction parameters can be appropriately defined for the purpose of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0947" num="0947">Additionally, the reproduction time lag &#x394;T may be applied as reproduction parameter in addition to display rate (frame rate) and reproduction speed v.

<p id="p-0950" num="0950">When the editing apparatus <b>2</b> displays a reproduced image in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>by thinning the frames, removing every predetermined ordinal number of frames, it can newly prepare image display sections whose number corresponds to the number of the frames removed for thinning (to be referred to new image display sections whenever appropriate hereinafter) between the image display section W<b>57</b> (W<b>57</b><sub>1</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . , or W<b>57</b><sub>n-1</sub>) that is currently displaying a frame whose variation exceeds a predetermined value (threshold value) and the image/sound W<b>57</b> (W<b>57</b><sub>2</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>3</sub>, . . . , or W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>) that displays the frame after the reproduction time lag &#x394;T and display the removed frames in the prepared new image display sections.</p>
<p id="p-0951" num="0951">The process executed by the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the GPU <b>4</b> for this feature will be described below. It is assumed here for the simplicity of explanation that the frames that constitute a moving image are thinned by removing every predetermined ordinal number of frames and, for example, only the 19th frame among the plurality of frames that are left to constitute the reproduced image is a frame whose variation exceeds a predetermined level (threshold value). Then, the frame is selected as object of attention in the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0952" num="0952">While the editing image <b>50</b> is being displayed, the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the GPU <b>4</b> thin the frames that constitute the moving image by removing every ordinal number of frames from the 1st through 18th frames whose variations are less than a predetermined level (threshold value) and, after decoding the frames that are left after the thinning, display them sequentially in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the display section <b>55</b> with the reproduction time lags &#x394;T.</p>
<p id="p-0953" num="0953">Note that the threshold value for variation can be acquired from the Fy file stored in the memory apparatus <b>22</b> in the above-described pre-editing process of the scrub operation.</p>

<p id="p-0955" num="0955">Then, the microprocessor <b>3</b> and the GPU <b>4</b> display the 19th image in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>and, at the same time, prepare new image display sections W<b>57</b>NX<sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b>NX<sub>m</sub>, the number of which is same as that of the m thinning frames.

<p id="p-0957" num="0957">Then, as a result, the transition of drawing in the reproduction time lag &#x394;T between the image display section W<b>57</b><i>c </i>that is currently displaying the image showing a strong movement and the next image display section W<b>57</b><i>d </i>as viewed in the direction of progress of the virtual time axis TP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) is finely presented in the new image display sections W<b>57</b>NX<sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b>NX<sub>m </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 99 and 100</figref> so that the operator can intuitively grasp the contents of the image showing a strong movement.

<p id="p-0959" num="0959">In this way, when the editing apparatus <b>2</b> thins the frames of a moving image by removing every ordinal number of frames and displays the reproduced image in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, it is possible for the editing apparatus <b>2</b> not to remove any frame in the reproduced image whose variation exceeds a predetermined level (threshold value) but to prepare new image display sections W<b>57</b>NX<sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b>NX<sub>m </sub>between the image display section W<b>57</b> that is currently displaying the frame whose variation is large and the next image display section W<b>57</b> (between W<b>57</b><sub>2 </sub>and W<b>57</b><sub>3</sub>, between W<b>57</b><sub>3 </sub>and W<b>57</b><sub>4</sub>, . . . ) and display it in the new image display sections W<b>57</b>NX<sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b>NX<sub>m</sub>.</p>

<p id="p-0961" num="0961">It is also possible to change the number of frames that are to be used as objects of display (thinning frames) between the image display section W<b>57</b> that is currently displaying the frame whose variation is large and the next image display section W<b>57</b> stepwise according to the variation in such a way that, for example, a first number of frames is used when the variation is not less than a first threshold value and less than a second threshold value, a second number of frames that is greater than the first number of frames is used when the variation is not less than the second threshold value and less than a third threshold value, while a third number of frames that is greater than the second number of frames is used when the variation is not less than the third threshold value.</p>

<p id="p-0963" num="0963">With the above-described drawing interval alternation technique, it is possible to display thinning frames between the image display section W<b>57</b> that is currently displaying the frame whose variation is large and the next image display section W<b>57</b> by changing the number of thinning frames as a function of variation and, at the same time, with a size that changes as a function of variation.</p>

Then, as a result, the operator can highly intuitively seek for an image.</p>
<p id="p-0965" num="0965">The above-described drawing interval alternation technique can be combined with the scrub operation described earlier. More specifically, it is possible to display thinning frames between the image display section W<b>57</b> that is currently displaying the frame whose variation is large and the next image display section W<b>57</b> with the number of thinning frames that changes as a function of variation and, at the same time, change the resolution and the display rate of the images (of the frames other than the thinning frames) according to the display type that corresponds to the variation thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0967" num="0967">Note that, when a moving image is displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>, the image itself appears as if flowing in the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> so that an effect similar to the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 99 and 100</figref> can be produced for recognition of a moving image in a 3D space without executing the scrub operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">(6) Operations and Effects</heading>
<p id="p-0968" num="0968">In the editing apparatus <b>2</b> of the editing system <b>1</b> having the above-described configuration, as the operator selects, drags and drops a desired clip from the clip synopsis display section <b>51</b> of the editing image <b>50</b> displayed on the display <b>40</b>, if necessary, subsequently selects the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> associated with the clip and clips the reproduction button <b>56</b>, scenes of the reproduced image of the clip are displayed respectively in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> with predetermined time lags.</p>
<p id="p-0969" num="0969">With this image display method, the scenes of the reproduced image of the clip sequentially appear from the distal side toward the proximal side of the screens of the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>that constitutes the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> with the reproduction time lags &#x394;T defined for them as the reproduction process is started for the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>. Thus, the scenes can give a feeling of depth to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0970" num="0970">Then, with the editing apparatus <b>2</b>, when the operator searches for the frame of a change of scene, he or she is not forced to do a cumbersome operation of moving frames one by one and can intuitively search for the frame with ease if compared with a comparable conventional editing image <b>2001</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>) in which the operator is forced to visually search for a desired frame, while moving the frames one by one of the two-dimensional reproduced image displayed in the monitor section <b>2003</b>, because the same reproduced image is sequentially displayed in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>with the reproduction time lags &#x394;T in the editing image <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0971" num="0971">Particularly, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> displays the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> having a spiral structure by way of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>that are arranged spirally so that all the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>are displayed in a single image of the display section <b>55</b> and none of them are hidden by others to allow the operator to do the operation of searching a desired scene and other editing operations with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0972" num="0972">This provides an important advantage when the editing apparatus <b>2</b> stops all the frames of the reproduced image in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>because still images of the frames neighboring the desired frame are displayed in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> with time lags so that the operator does not have to search for the desired frame, while moving frames one by one to a great advantage on the part of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0973" num="0973">Additionally, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> displays frames of a reproduced image in the form of a moving image in a concerted manner in the image display section W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> with the reproduced time lags &#x394;T so that, when there is a change of scene, the display of the change of scene is updated successively so as to be sequentially shifted from the proximal side to the distal side of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>. Thus, the operator can intuitively do the operation of searching for a desired scene and other editing operations, while effectively feeling the flow of time (the reproduction speed and the direction of reproduction) in the direction of progress of the reproduced image in the entire group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0974" num="0974">When the editing apparatus <b>2</b> reverses the sequence of frames of the reproduced image displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, the operator can intuitively do the operation of searching for a desired scene and other editing operations, while effectively feeling a sensation that the entire group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is moving away to the distal side.</p>
<p id="p-0975" num="0975">Since the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is arranged in a 3D virtual space on the internal memory of the GPU <b>4</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b>, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can move the viewpoint toward the distal side of the vortex of the spiral by way of the sub 3D space image IM<b>1</b> and the character CA<b>1</b> having a coordinate system same as the 3D virtual space and change the display mode of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> to the one that allows them to be seen from an internal viewpoint after the move.</p>
<p id="p-0976" num="0976">Thus, if the reproduced image that is displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>is temporarily stopped and when the editing apparatus <b>2</b> moves the viewpoint toward the distal end of the vortex of the spiral and displays the frames, while changing the display mode of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> gives the operator an impression that he or she is moving into the future passing through the center of the vortex of the spiral. Thus, it is possible to provide a highly entertaining GUI (graphical user interface).</p>
<p id="p-0977" num="0977">Additionally, the viewpoint and the direction of the watching eyes of the operator are shifted relative to the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> according to the relative positional relationship between the sub 3D space image IM<b>1</b> and the character CA<b>1</b> so that the display mode of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> can be changed and displayed in the form of a belt (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 through 32</figref>, etc.), when the viewpoint is moved to the outside of the circle formed by the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b>. Then, it is possible to have the operator imagine the reproduction time of the entire clip from the total length of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> and shift the entire clip to a position or an angle that facilitate the editing operation of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0978" num="0978">Furthermore, various operations including cutting out individual clips, editing a plurality of clips and checking the edited image and so on can be realized within a single display section <b>55</b> in the editing apparatus <b>2</b> so that it is no longer necessary to do cumbersome operations as in the case of conventional editing apparatus that require to use the monitor section <b>2003</b> of the editing image <b>2001</b> for cutting clips, the stream board section <b>2004</b> and the timeline section <b>2005</b> for editing processes and the monitor section <b>2003</b> for checking the edited image. Thus, it is possible to facilitate not only so-called image searching operations but also the entire editing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0979" num="0979">Finally, it is possible to select either &#x201c;main sound output mode&#x201d; or &#x201c;all sound output mode&#x201d; as sound output mode when displaying a reproduced image in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b>. Thus, the operation of searching for a desired video/audio part by means of output sounds can be facilitated by switching the sound output mode appropriately according to the contents of the reproduced sounds of the clip, which are the object of editing.</p>
<p id="p-0980" num="0980">More specifically, when the &#x201c;all sound mode&#x201d; is selected as sound output mode in the editing apparatus <b>2</b>, all the reproduced sounds that accompany the frames of the reproduced image being displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> that is operated are output from the speaker <b>41</b> with volumes that are adjusted in such a way that the sounds of the frames of the reproduced image in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>m </sub>remote from the reference image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>are made small. Thus, it is possible to output the sounds three-dimensionally to make the operation of searching for a desired image/sound part according to the output sounds so much easier. This arrangement can not only make the editing operation easier but also output sounds to give out a feeling of depth that has never been experienced simply because that the reproduced image is displayed in the form of a spiral belt.</p>
<p id="p-0981" num="0981">The editing apparatus <b>2</b> according to the present invention generates image data of the plurality of images to be displayed in the plurality of image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the editing image <b>50</b>. Additionally, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> decides the display type of the picture (frame) to be displayed in the corresponding each of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>on a picture by picture basis according to the variation that expresses the extent of change of the image data of the picture in the video/audio signals of the reproduced image to be displayed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 through 70</figref>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0982" num="0982">Then, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> alters the resolution and the display rate of each of the displayed images that correspond to the image data according to the type information indicating the display type of each picture and has the images of the image data sequentially displayed at the respective positions of the editing image <b>50</b> in the form of a moving image with the resolution and at the display rate that are altered for the images with display time lags (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71 through 98</figref>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0983" num="0983">Thus, since the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can display the images of a moving image sequentially in the proper order of display with time lags on the editing image <b>50</b> so that it can draw the contents (the story) of the images so as to make them appear as if flowing. Then, as a result, it is possible to allow the operator to search for an image, intuitively grasping the contents of the moving image, and hence search for the editing points (the in point and the out point) with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0984" num="0984">Additionally, when the editing apparatus <b>2</b> displays the images of a moving image sequentially with time lags, it does not display all the image in a same display mode but it displays all the images to be displayed with a resolution and a display rate that can vary from image to image according to the display type of the image. Still additionally, the display apparatus <b>2</b> does not decode all the frames that become the attentional frame but decodes only a necessary frame or necessary frames.</p>
<p id="p-0985" num="0985">Therefore, if the reproduction speed v is varied, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can draw the contents (the story) of the moving image as if they are flowing and can change the display mode of each image according to the change of the image. Then, as a result, it is possible to allow the operator to search for an image, intuitively grasping the contents of the moving image, and hence search for the editing points (the in point and the out point) with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0986" num="0986">Furthermore, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> arranges the images of a moving image to be displayed sequentially with time lags in the form of a three-dimensional spiral. Thus, if compared with images arranged simply horizontally or vertically, it is possible to present many images, maintaining the temporal continuity thereof. Then, the operator can accurately check if an image is an object of editing or not, taking long time, so that consequently it is possible to raise the efficiency of searing for an image.</p>
<p id="p-0987" num="0987">Thus, with the above-described arrangement, the images (frames) of the reproduced image of the selected clip are arranged in the form of a three-dimensional spiral with reproduction time lags &#x394;T and displayed in the proper display order to realize a display mode that provides the reproduced image with a temporal depth and easiness of searching for an image. Thus, it is possible to realize an editing system that allows the operator to intuitively search for a desired image part with ease and facilitates the editing operation if compared with the conventional editing image <b>2001</b> where images of a reproduced image are arranged one-dimensionally and the operator searches for a desired image part, constantly viewing the reproduced image.</p>
<p id="p-0988" num="0988">Additionally, when the editing apparatus <b>2</b> displays display the images of a moving image in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>sequentially with time lags, it does not display all the images with in the same display mode but it displays all the images to be displayed with a resolution and a display rate that can vary from image to image according to the display type of the image. Still additionally, the display apparatus <b>2</b> does not decode all the frames that become the attentional frame but decodes only a necessary frame or necessary frames. Then, as a result, it is possible to allow the operator to search for an image, intuitively grasping the contents of the moving image, and hence search for the editing points with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0989" num="0989">As described above, when the operator displays the reproduced image of the selected clip on the display screen and searches for a desired scene, he or she simply repeats an operation of variable replay (scrub replay) for a number of times on the display frame. A prime object of the above-described arrangement of the present invention, on the other hand, is to display the reproduced image in such a way that the operator can intuitively check the predetermined image with ease as the reproduced image of the selected clip shows (changes like) &#x201c;a time series move (flowing move)&#x201d; on the display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0990" num="0990">Another prime object of the above-described arrangement of the present invention is to adaptively change the display parameters, the reproduction parameters and the display type according to the processing capacity of the system (CPU/GPU processing capacity, data transfer rate of the storage storing clips, the seek time, etc.) in order to facilitate the operation of searching for the desired scene in the image searching process so that the operator can intuitively check the reproduced image with ease.</p>

<heading id="h-0028" level="1">(7-1) Configuration of Editing System Formed by Using this Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0991" num="0991">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>90</b> denotes the editing system of the second embodiment. The configuration of this editing system is same as the editing system <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the first embodiment except that the sizes of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) displayed in the display section <b>55</b> of the editing image <b>50</b> are not only varied in such a way they gradually become larger toward the proximal side from the distal side but also as a function of the sound levels of the reproduced sounds that accompany the frames of the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>. Thus, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> of this embodiment can execute various processes like the editing apparatus <b>2</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0992" num="0992">In the case of this editing system <b>90</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> has the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> display the reproduced image of the selected clip according to the video/audio signals of the clip applied to it from the memory apparatus <b>22</b> by way of the PCI bus <b>15</b> and the south bridge <b>6</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and also sequentially notifies the GPU <b>4</b> of the sound levels of the reproduced sounds (the signal levels of the audio signals) that accompany the respective frames of the reproduced images.</p>
<p id="p-0993" num="0993">Then, the GPU <b>4</b> determines if the peak level of each of the reproduced sounds is higher than predefined threshold value Thd or not according to the notification from the microprocessor <b>3</b> and, if it determines that the peak level is higher than the threshold value Thd, it has the corresponding one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>displayed with a size larger than the size with which it is ordinarily displayed when it displays the image of the corresponding frame.</p>
<p id="p-0994" num="0994">For example, if the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>are those illustrated in (A) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref> and the sound levels of the reproduced sounds (the signal levels of the audio signals) that accompany the reproduced images are those illustrated in (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref>, the sound levels of the reproduced sounds that accompany the reproduced images displayed respectively in the second through fourth image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>j </sub>as counted toward the distal side from the reference image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>located at the proximal side of the screen are higher than the threshold value Thd so that the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>j </sub>are displayed with respective sizes larger than the other image display sections at this moment as indicated by arrow crosses in (C) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0995" num="0995">In this case, the microprocessor <b>3</b> controls the GPU <b>4</b> in such a way that the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>j </sub>are displayed with respective magnifications, any of which is made greater than others when the sound level of the reproduced sound that accompanies the corresponding one of the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>j </sub>is higher than the others.</p>
<p id="p-0996" num="0996">Thus, in the instance of (B) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref>, the sound level of the reproduced sound accompanying the reproduced image displayed in the second right side neighboring image display section W<b>57</b><sub>l </sub>from the reference image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>is highest and the sound levels of the reproduced sounds accompanying the reproduced images displayed respectively in the third and fourth right side neighboring image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>j </sub>are slightly lower than that and about same at this moment. Thus, the second right side neighboring image display section W<b>57</b><sub>l </sub>from the reference image display section W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>is enlarged and displayed with the largest magnification and the other image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>j </sub>are enlarged and displayed with a smaller magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0997" num="0997">In this way, the editing system <b>90</b> can display the reproduced images in such a way that the operator can recognize the sound levels of the reproduced sounds accompanying the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> so that the operator can intuitively recognize the contents of the clip and do the operation of searching for an image and other editing operations with ease.</p>
<heading id="h-0029" level="1">(7-2) Sequence of Enlarging and Displaying Image Display Sections</heading>
<p id="p-0998" num="0998">In actuality, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> of the editing system <b>90</b> executes the process of enlarging and displaying the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>l</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>k</sub>, W<b>57</b><sub>j </sub>according to the sound levels of the reproduced sounds that accompany the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections the W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>, following the image display section enlarging/displaying process sequence RT<b>5</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 102</figref>, according to the control program stored in the hard disk drive <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0999" num="0999">More specifically, as the microprocessor <b>3</b> ends the operation of having the reproduced image of the clip, following the reproduction process sequence RT<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it has the GPU <b>4</b> start the image display section enlarging/displaying process sequence RT<b>5</b> in parallel with the above-described display alteration process sequence RT<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-1000" num="1000">Namely, in Step SP<b>51</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> acquires the peak levels of the reproduced sound that accompanies the displayed frame (e.g., a frame) in one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> displayed in the display section <b>55</b> and moves to the next step, or Step SP<b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-1001" num="1001">In Step SP<b>52</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> determines if the peak level of the reproduced sound is higher than the predefined threshold value Thd or not. It returns to Step SP<b>5</b> when the result of the determination is negative, whereas it goes to the next step, or Step SP<b>53</b> when the result of the determination is positive.</p>
<p id="p-1002" num="1002">In Step SP<b>53</b>, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> computes the magnification for each of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>where the peak level of the reproduced sound is determined to be higher than the predefined threshold value Thd and then moves to Step SP<b>54</b>, where it controls the magnification of the corresponding one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>according to the outcome of the computation.</p>
<p id="p-1003" num="1003">In this way, the corresponding one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> displayed in the display section <b>55</b> of the editing image <b>50</b> is enlarged and displayed with the magnification computed in Step SP<b>53</b> from the ordinary size (the size when the peak level is not higher than the threshold value Thd).</p>
<p id="p-1004" num="1004">Subsequently, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> returns to Step SP<b>51</b> and executes the process of Steps SP<b>51</b> through SP<b>54</b> in the same manner. Thereafter, it repeats the process sequentially and cyclically, switching the object of the process selected from the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-1005" num="1005">In this way, when the sound level of the reproduced sound that accompanies the reproduced image displayed in any of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is high, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can display the image display section with a size that corresponds to the sound level out of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>
<heading id="h-0030" level="1">(7-3) Operations and Effects of the Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-1006" num="1006">With the above-described arrangement of the second embodiment, when the sound level of the reproduced sound that accompanies the reproduced image displayed in any of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is high, the microprocessor <b>3</b> of the editing apparatus <b>2</b> can display the image display section with a size that corresponds to the sound level out of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-1007" num="1007">With the above-described image display technique, the operator can recognize the sound levels of the reproduced sounds accompanying the reproduced images displayed in the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>with the sizes of the respective image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> so that the operator can intuitively recognize the contents of the clip and do the operation of searching for an image and other editing operations with ease.</p>
<p id="p-1008" num="1008">Thus, with the above-described arrangement, when the sound level of the reproduced sound that accompanies the reproduced image displayed in any of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>of the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> is high, the image display section is displayed with a size that corresponds to the sound level out of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n</sub>. Thus, this embodiment provides both the visual effect of displaying the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>as a moving image in the form of a three-dimensional spiral in a coordinated manner and the display effect of coordinating the reproduced images and the reproduced sounds of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>to allow the operator to do the operation of searching for an image and other editing operations remarkably easier. Thus, the editing system <b>90</b> of this embodiment can facilitate editing operations much easier if compared with the editing system <b>1</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0031" level="1">(8) Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-1009" num="1009">While the editing apparatus <b>2</b> of the first embodiment and that of the second embodiment are non-linear editing apparatus, the present invention is not limited thereto and also applicable to editing apparatus of various different forms and various image display control apparatus other than editing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-1010" num="1010">Now, possible applications of the present invention will be described below. When, for example, the reproduced image is a TV image (recorded TV image), applications where a scene containing an image of an opaque card is extracted and the scenes before and after the scene that contains the image of the opaque card for a predetermined period of time are identified as attentional part so as to change the display parameters and the reproduction parameters (in such a way that the gaps of display regions are made wide and the sizes of display regions are made large to reproduce high resolution images) may be conceivable other than extracting characteristic quantities contained in an image. Similarly, applications where a CM is identified by way of scene change detection so as to change the display parameters and the reproduction parameters (in such a way that the gaps of display regions are made narrow and the sizes of display regions are made small to reproduce low resolution images) may also be conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-1011" num="1011">Additionally, in the case of music live images, music promotion images and sport images, applications where a scene showing a high sound level is identified as an important scene so as to change the display parameters and the reproduction parameters (in such a way that the gaps of display regions are made wide and the sizes of display regions are made large to reproduce high resolution images) may be conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-1012" num="1012">When the peak level of the sound level of the reproduced sound of an image is higher than a predefined threshold value Thd, the corresponding one of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>for displaying the image of the corresponding frame is displayed with a size larger than the ordinary display size in the above description of the second embodiment. However, the present invention is by no means limited thereto and the size of each of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>may be enlarged or reduced according to the sound level of the reproduced sound of the corresponding image without providing any threshold value Thd.</p>
<p id="p-1013" num="1013">While the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>on the screen of the display section <b>55</b> are displayed in a fixed state in the above description of the first and second embodiments, the present invention is by no means limited thereto and it may alternatively be so arranged particularly when the reproduction speed v of the reproduced images of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>is very slow and the reproduction time lag &#x394;T is not greater than a frame that the image being displayed in each of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>is not updated and the positions of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>are shifted sequentially in such a way that the entire image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>appear as if they were moving in the direction of reproduction. Then, the operator can visually check the group of images being displayed while they are reproduced highly smoothly at low speed.</p>
<p id="p-1014" num="1014">For example, the editing apparatus <b>2</b> may be so adapted that it stops the reproduced images of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>without updating and sequentially shift the positions of the image display sections W<b>57</b><sub>1 </sub>through W<b>57</b><sub>n </sub>on the screen to make the reproduced images appear as if they are being shifted all together from the distal side toward the proximal side on a frame by frame basis at low speed.</p>
<p id="p-1015" num="1015">While the editing apparatus <b>2</b> of the first embodiment and that of the second embodiment have a configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in the above description, the present invention is by no means limited thereto and an editing apparatus according to the present invention can be applied to image processing apparatus of various different configurations. Applications of the present invention include computers, video cameras, digital cameras, game machines, portable information terminals (portable computers, portable telephones, portable game machines) and storage devices (e.g., optical disk storages, homer servers) as well as processing boards and processing cards equipped with the functional features according to the present invention. However, any image processing apparatus according to the present invention comprises a cabinet, a signal processing section and an external interface as common components, which are combined with one or more than one peripheral devices according to the form of the commodity. For example, if an image processing apparatus according to the present invention is a video camera or a digital camera, it comprises a camera unit and a write circuit for storing the picked up image data in a memory medium in addition to the above listed components. If an image processing apparatus according to the present invention is a portable telephone or some other electronic apparatus having a communication feature, it comprises a transmission/reception circuit and an antenna in addition to the above listed components.</p>
<p id="p-1016" num="1016">While the microprocessor <b>3</b> starts the control program stored in the hard disk drive <b>7</b> as image processing program and executes a display change process that corresponds to the viewpoint relative to the group of spiral image display sections <b>58</b> in the above-described first and second embodiments, the present invention is by no means limited thereto and alternatively it may be so arranged that the microprocessor <b>3</b> executes a display change process when a program storage medium storing the control program is installed in the microprocessor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-1017" num="1017">Program storage mediums that can be used for storing the control program for executing a display change process and installed in the hard disk drive <b>7</b> to bring the control program into a state of being ready for execution typically include floppy disks (tradename), CD-ROMs (compact disk-read only memories), DVDs (digital versatile disks) and other package mediums as well as semiconductor memories and magnetic disks where the control program can be stored temporarily or permanently.
