<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method operates a Mobile Station (MS) in a sleep mode state in a wireless communication system. The method includes transmitting a request message to a Base Station (BS) to inquire a location of a next scheduled listening window responsive to failing to receive a traffic indication message and unicast data during a listening window, receiving a response message unicast in response to the request message, performing sleep cycle synchronization by using synchronization information included in the response message, and determining whether an emergency alert service-related message is transmitted by using emergency alert service-related information included in the response message.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S) AND CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to and claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to a Korean patent application filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Oct. 25, 2010 and assigned Serial No. 10-2010-0104115, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference,</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for controlling sleep cycle synchronization to support an emergency alert service in a BWA system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Extensive research is being conducted to provide various Quality of Service (QoS) features with high data rates in the advanced fourth-generation (4G) communication systems. The 4G communication systems are evolving to provide high mobility and QoS features in wireless communication systems such as Local Area Network (LAN) systems and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, because wireless communication systems consider the mobility of a Mobile Station (MS), the power consumption of the MS is evaluated as a key performance index of the entire system. Thus, a wireless communication system standard such as Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 defines an active mode and a sleep mode of an MS to minimize the power consumption of the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate a sleep mode operation defined in the conventional IEEE 802.16 system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an MS receives a mode transition allowance from a Base Station (BS) to transition to a sleep mode in the IEEE 802.16e system. Herein, the BS may buffer or drop packet data to be transmitted, while allowing the transition of the MS to the sleep mode. Also, during a listening window or a listening interval of the MS, the BS informs the MS whether there are data to be transmitted to the MS, and the MS wakes up from the sleep mode and determines whether there are data to be transmitted to the MS. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, TRF-IND (MOBile TRaFfic INDicator (MOB_TRF-IND) messages <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are transmitted to inform whether there are packet data to be transmitted. Herein, the TRF-IND messages <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> containing &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; indicate the absence of packet data, and the TRF-IND message <b>104</b> containing &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; indicates the presence of packet data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If it is determined during the listening interval or the listening window that there are data to be transmitted to the MS, the MS transitions to the active mode and receives data from the BS. Thereafter, in order to transition from the active mode to the sleep mode, the MS transmits/receives SleeP-REQuest/ReSPonse (SLP-REQ/RSP) to/from the BS. This may cause a signaling overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to prevent the signaling overhead, the MS may not transition to the active mode even in the case of presence of traffic, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In other words, there is a limitation in that the transition between the active mode and the sleep mode must be made by MOBile SLeeP-REQuest/ReSPonse (MOB_SLP-REQ/RSP) signaling. Accordingly, during the sleep mode, the MS repeats a sleep state and an awake state in a sleep cycle and receives data.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, during the listening window or the listening interval in a sleep state, the MS receives TRF-IND messages <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> from the BS. Specifically, the MS receives the TRF-IND message <b>100</b> containing &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; during the listening window in the initial sleep cycle and increases the next sleep cycle by two times. After the lapse of the next sleep cycle, the MS receives the TRF-IND message <b>102</b> containing &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; and sets the next sleep cycle to two times the current sleep cycle. After the lapse of the sleep cycle, the MS receives the TRF-IND message <b>104</b> containing &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019;, receives downlink data during the listening window for the TRF-IND message <b>104</b>, and resets the next sleep cycle to the length of the initial sleep cycle. Thereafter, during the listening window after the lapse of the initial sleep cycle, the MS receives the TRF-IND message <b>110</b> containing &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; and increases the sleep cycle by two times. Thereafter, during the listening window after the lapse of the increased sleep cycle, the MS receives the TRF-IND message <b>112</b> containing &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; and again increases the sleep cycle by two times.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">If the MS normally receives the traffic indication information through the TRF-IND message transmitted by the BS, sleep cycle synchronization is maintained between the MS and the BS. On the other hand, if the MS fails to receive the TRF-IND message due to channel state degradation, the MS cannot know whether the BS has transmitted &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; or &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;. Consequently, the MS cannot correctly set the length of the next sleep cycle. This causes sleep cycle desynchronization between the MS and the BS.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates sleep cycle desynchronization in the conventional IEEE 802.16 system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an MS normally receives TRF-IND (MOB_TRF-IND) messages <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> containing &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; during the listening window of a sleep cycle, and fails to receive a TRF-IND message <b>204</b> containing &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; during the listening window after the lapse of the next sleep cycle. Herein, a BS recognizes the listening window of the next sleep cycle as a time point t<b>1</b> (<b>212</b>). However, because the MS has failed to receive the TRF-IND message <b>204</b>, the MS cannot determine whether to reset the next sleep cycle to the initial sleep cycle according to &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; or to increase the next sleep cycle by two times according to &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;. The start time point of a listening window of an actual sleep cycle is the time point t<b>1</b> (<b>212</b>). However, if the MS resets the next sleep cycle to the initial sleep cycle, it causes desynchronization of the listening window of a sleep cycle. Thus, sleep cycle desynchronization may occur if the MS fails to receive the TRF-IND message in the wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to solve the problem of sleep cycle desynchronization, the MS transmits a TRF-IND request message to the BS if the MS fails to receive not only the TRF-IND message but also downlink traffic until the end of the listening window. For example, the TRF-IND request message may be an AAI (Advanced Air Interface)_TRF-IND-REQ message shown in Table 1 below.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For reference, a sleep cycle includes a listening window and a sleep window. The listening window is located at the front of the sleep cycle. Thus, if &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; is received in the current listening window, the current sleep cycle including the current listening window is reset to the initial sleep cycle size. Accordingly, the next scheduled listening window starts at a relatively near point, that is, the current sleep cycle is immediately after the initial sleep cycle. On the other hand, if &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; is received, the current sleep cycle increases by two times the previous sleep cycle. Accordingly, the next scheduled listening window starts at a relatively distant point.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The TRF-IND message may contain emergency alert information, an example of which is shown in Table 3 below.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When an emergency alert indication of Table 3 is set to 1, it means that an emergency alert service-related message will be transmitted. That is, when the emergency alert indication is set to 1, it means that the MS does not enter the sleep state in the sleep window but maintains the awake state to receive an emergency alert service-related message.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, an emergency alert service is considered in the TRF-IND message, whereas an emergency alert service is not considered in the exchange of the TRF-IND-REQ/RSP messages. In other words, if the MS loses the TRF-IND message, the MS can only inquire of the BS what the MS's traffic indicator is, but cannot determine whether there is an emergency alert service-related message.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 7</figref>, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present disclosure in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the disclosure. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged wireless communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present disclosure provides a scheme for controlling sleep cycle synchronization when a Mobile Station (MS) fails to receive a TRF-IND (MOB_TRF-IND) message in a wireless communication system. Although a sleep mode operation control scheme of the present disclosure will be described below in the context of an IEEE 802.16m communication system, it should be understood that the sleep mode operation control scheme of the present disclosure is also applicable to other similar communication systems. Although the following description is made of a scheme for controlling a sleep mode operation by an MS and a Base Station (BS) in the BWA system, it should be understood that the sleep mode operation control scheme of the present disclosure is also applicable to the case where a plurality of MSs are present in the BWA system.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a system according to the present disclosure, a sleep cycle change depending on the value of a TRF-IND message is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A TRF-IND message is used to notify an MS of the presence of downlink data traffic. If &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; is included in the TRF-IND message, the next sleep cycle is reset to the initial sleep cycle. On the other hand, if &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; is included in the TRF-IND message, the next sleep cycle increases by two times the previous sleep cycle. Also, if the MS transmits an uplink data traffic or a bandwidth request, the next sleep cycle is reset to the initial sleep cycle. When the next sleep cycle is reset, the next sleep cycle may be reset to a predetermined length different from that of the initial sleep cycle. For example, the predetermined length may be an integer multiple of the length of the initial sleep cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the present disclosure, a BS and an MS exchange TRF_IND-REQ/RSP messages to exchange not only sleep cycle synchronization information but also emergency alert service-related information. Exemplary embodiments of the exchange of the emergency alert service-related information are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The BS transmits an AAI_TRF-IND-RSP message in response to an AAI_TRF-IND-REQ message received from the MS. Herein, the AAI-TRF-IND-REQ message may be replaced with a header having the same purpose. For example, the AAI_TRF-IND-REQ message may be replaced with a Sleep Control Header (SCH) or a Sleep Control Extended Header (SCEH). The AAI-TRF-IND-RSP message may also be replaced with a header having the same purpose. For example, the AAI_TRF-IND-RSP message may be replaced with a Sleep Control Header (SCH) or a Sleep Control Extended Header (SCEH).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the AAI_TRF_IND-RSP message may be configured as shown in Table 4 below.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In Table 5, if an emergency alert service-related message will be transmitted until a frame indicated by the TRF-IND-RSP message, that is, until the start of a next scheduled listening window, an &#x2018;Emergency Alert Indication&#x2019; field is set to &#x2018;1&#x2019; to notify the MS of the transmission of the emergency alert service-related message.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In Table 5, if an emergency alert service-related message will be transmitted until a frame indicated by the AAI_TRF-IND-RSP message, that is, until the start of a next scheduled listening window, an &#x2018;Frame_Number for Emergency alert Service Message&#x2019; field is used to indicate a transmission time point of the transmission of the emergency alert service-related message.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When receiving the &#x2018;Frame_Number&#x2019; for Emergency alert Service Message&#x2019; field set to a certain frame number, the MS may operate in a sleep state until a frame indicated by the &#x2018;Frame_Number for Emergency alert Service Message&#x2019; field and may temporarily operation in an awake state to receive the emergency alert service-related message. After receiving the emergency alert service-related message, the MS may perform a normal sleep mode operation, that is, may return to a sleep state until the next scheduled listening window.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, only the &#x2018;Frame_Number&#x2019; for Emergency alert Service Message&#x2019; field may be used without the &#x2018;Emergency alert Indication&#x2019; in the AAI_TRF-IND-RSP message of Table 5. Herein, if the &#x2018;Frame_Number for Emergency alert Service Message&#x2019; field is not included, it means that the emergency alert service-related message will not be transmitted until the start of the next scheduled listening window. This assumes that the MS can determine the presence/absence of the &#x2018;Frame_Number for Emergency alert Service Message&#x2019; field. For example, the MS can determine the inclusion/non-inclusion of a relevant parameter according to the ASN.1 encoding rule. That is, according to a document created by ASN.1 PER (Packing Encoding Rule) encoding rule, even when an indication parameter is not defined, an entity performing ASN.1 PER encoding/decoding can determine the presence/absence of other parameters such as a &#x2018;Frame_Number for Emergency alert Service Message&#x2019; parameter. That is, as can be seen from a &#x2018;Type&#x2019; field of TLV (Type Length Value) defined in the ASN.1 BER (Basic Encoding Rule), the entity can determine the presence/absence of a certain parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the process of repeating an awake state and a sleep state in a sleep mode according to a sleep cycle, if the MS fails to receive a TRF-IND message, the present disclosure controls the synchronization between the BS and the MS with respect to the sleep state and the awake state. Hereinafter, with reference to the accompanying drawings, a detailed description will be given of the configurations and operations of the BS and the MS for indicating the presence/absence of an emergency alert service during the synchronization control process.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flow diagram illustrating an operation process of an MS for controlling sleep cycle synchronization in a BWA system according to the present disclosure.</p>

During the sleep mode operation, in step <b>303</b>, the MS determines whether a listening window arrives according to a sleep cycle.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On the other hand, if the listening window arrives, the MS proceeds to step <b>305</b>. In step <b>305</b>, the MS waits to receive a TRF-IND message during the listening window. The TRF-IND message uses the presence/absence of an MS identifier to indicate the presence/absence of downlink traffic of the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">If the TRF-IND message is received, the MS proceeds to step <b>307</b>. In step <b>307</b>, the MS determines whether the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; or &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019;. Whether the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; or &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; is determined according to whether identifier information of the MS is included in the TRF-IND message. That is, if the identifier information is included, the TRF-IND message represents the &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019;; and if the identifier information is not included, the TRF-IND message represents the &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;, the MS proceeds to step <b>309</b>.

For example, if the length of the current sleep cycle is four frames, the length of the next sleep cycle is 8 frames. That is, the BS includes &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; in the TRF-IND message and sets the next sleep cycle of the MS to two times the current sleep cycle. Accordingly, the MS detects &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019; and sets the next sleep cycle to two times the current sleep cycle. Accordingly, the MS and the BS implicitly synchronize the sleep cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">On the other hand, if the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019;, the MS proceeds to step <b>311</b>. In step <b>311</b>, the MS resets the next sleep cycle to the length of the initial sleep cycle. That is, the BS includes &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; in the TRF-IND message and sets the next sleep cycle of the MS to the initial sleep cycle. Accordingly, the MS detects &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; and sets the next sleep cycle to the initial sleep cycle. Accordingly, the MS and the BS implicitly synchronize the sleep cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">If the TRF-IND message is not received in step <b>305</b>, the MS proceeds to step <b>313</b>. In step <b>313</b>, the MS determines whether downlink traffic is received during the remaining listening window. Herein, due to the non-reception of the TRF-IND, the MS cannot determine whether to increase the length of the next sleep cycle by two times or to reset the next sleep cycle to the length of the initial sleep cycle. Thus, in this example, the BS and the MS may operate according to different sleep cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Even failing to receive the TRF-IND message, by determining whether downlink traffic is received during the remaining listening window in step <b>307</b>, the MS can infer whether the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; or &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;. That is, if the downlink traffic is received during the remaining listening window, it means that the TRF-IND message has represented &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019;; and if the downlink traffic is not received during the remaining listening window, it means that the TRF-IND message has represented &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the downlink traffic is received during the remaining listening window, the MS proceeds to step <b>315</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The example where the downlink traffic is not received corresponds to the example where the downlink traffic was not transmitted, that is, the example where the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;, or the example where the downlink traffic fails to be received due to channel state degradation even if the downlink traffic was transmitted. If the downlink traffic was not transmitted, the MS may set the next sleep cycle to two times the current sleep cycle. In this example, the MS need not transmit a TRF-IND-REQ message. On the other hand, if the downlink traffic fails to be received due to channel state degradation, the MS determines that the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;, and sets the next sleep cycle to two times the current sleep cycle, thus causing sleep cycle desynchronization between the MS and the BS. Therefore, in order to prevent the sleep cycle desynchronization, the MS transmits the TRF-IND-REQ message to the BS to remove uncertainty as to whether the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; or &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;. According to another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the MS may inquire a start time point of the next listening window, instead of the information about whether the TRF-IND message represents &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019; or &#x2018;Negative Traffic Indication&#x2019;, and synchronize the start time point of an uncertain sleep cycle.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The modem <b>604</b> performs a baseband signal/bit stream conversion function according to the physical layer standard of the system. For example, for data transmission, the modem <b>604</b> encodes/modulates a transmission bit stream to generate complex symbols, maps the complex symbols to subcarriers, and generates OFDM symbols by Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion. Also, for data reception, the modem <b>604</b> divides baseband signals, received from the RF processor <b>602</b>, on an OFDM symbol basis, restores signals mapped to subcarriers by FFT, and restores the received bit stream by demodulation and decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The controller <b>606</b> controls an overall function of the MS <b>600</b>. For example, the controller <b>606</b> generates and interprets MAC control message exchanged with a BS. The controller <b>606</b> includes a mode controller <b>608</b> for determining an operation mode of the MS <b>600</b> and performs an operation according to the determined operation mode. That is, the mode controller <b>608</b> determines whether to transition to a sleep mode according to the frequency of generation of transmission/reception traffic, and controls conversion of a sleep state and an awake state according to a listening window and a sleep window in a sleep cycle when transitioning to the sleep mode. During the sleep window of the sleep mode, the controller <b>606</b> does not perform a signal receiving operation. During the listening window of the sleep mode, the controller <b>606</b> determines the presence/absence of downlink traffic to the MS <b>600</b> through a traffic indication message received from the BS. The mode controller <b>608</b> controls the length of the sleep window according to the presence/absence of the downlink traffic. If failing to receive the traffic indication message during the listening window, the controller <b>606</b> performs the following functions in order to prevent the sleep cycle desynchronization with the BS.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If failing to receive the traffic indication message during the listening window, the controller <b>606</b> determines whether the downlink traffic is received during the remaining listening window. If the downlink traffic is received during the remaining listening window, the controller <b>606</b> determines that the traffic indication message has represented &#x2018;Positive Traffic Indication&#x2019;, and resets the length of the next sleep cycle to the length of the initial sleep cycle. On the other hand, if the downlink traffic is not received during the remaining listening window, the controller <b>606</b> generates a TRF-IND-REQ message and transmits the TRF-IND-REQ message to the BS through the modem <b>604</b> and the RF processor <b>602</b>. That is, the controller <b>606</b> uses the TRF-IND-REQ message to notify the BS that the controller <b>606</b> has failed to receive the traffic indication message during the listening window and inquires a start time point of the next listening window and the length of a sleep cycle including the next scheduled listening window. For example, the TRF-IND-REQ message may be configured as shown in Table 6. Thereafter, if a TRF-IND-RSP message is received as a response to the TRF-IND-REQ message through the RF processor <b>602</b> and the modem <b>604</b>, the controller <b>606</b> detects the start time point of the next listening window and the length of the sleep cycle including the next scheduled listening window which is contained in the TRF-IND-RSP message. Accordingly, the mode controller <b>608</b> performs sleep cycle synchronization by using the start time point of the next listening window and the length of the sleep cycle including the next scheduled listening window. That is, the mode controller <b>608</b> sets the length of the next sleep cycle to the length of the sleep cycle including the next scheduled listening window, and starts the next sleep cycle from the start time point of the next listening window.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Also, the controller <b>606</b> detects emergency alert service-related information included in the TRF-IND-RSP message. The emergency alert service-related information includes at least one of information indicating the whether an emergency alert service-related message is transmitted and information indicating the transmission time point of the emergency alert service-related message.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to the present disclosure, if the emergency alert service-related information includes only the information indicating the whether the emergency alert service-related message is transmitted, the controller <b>606</b> determines whether the transmission of the emergency alert service-related message is present. If the transmission of the emergency alert service-related message is present, the mode controller <b>608</b> controls the MS <b>600</b> to operate in the awake state until the reception of the emergency alert service-related message.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, if the emergency alert service-related information includes the information indicating the whether the emergency alert service-related message is transmitted and the information indicating the transmission time point of the emergency alert service-related message, the controller <b>606</b> determines whether the transmission of the emergency alert service-related message is present. If the transmission of the emergency alert service-related message is present, the mode controller <b>608</b> controls the MS <b>600</b> to operate in the sleep mode and determines whether the emergency alert service-related message reception frame has arrived. When the emergency alert service-related message reception frame has arrived, the mode controller <b>608</b> transitions to the awake state and the controller <b>606</b> receives the emergency alert service-related message.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, if the emergency alert service-related information includes the information indicating the transmission time point of the emergency alert service-related message, the controller <b>606</b> determines whether the information indicating the transmission time point of the emergency alert service-related message is present. If the information indicating the transmission time point of the emergency alert service-related message is present, the mode controller <b>608</b> controls the MS <b>600</b> to operate in the sleep mode and determines whether the emergency alert service-related message reception frame has arrived. When the emergency alert service-related message reception frame has arrived, the mode controller <b>608</b> transitions to the awake state and the controller <b>606</b> receives the emergency alert service-related message.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the BS <b>700</b> includes an RF processor <b>702</b>, a modem <b>704</b>, and a controller <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The RF processor <b>702</b> performs functions for transmission/reception of signals through a radio channel, such as signal band conversion and signal amplification.

Also, the RF processor <b>702</b> down-converts an RF signal, received through the antenna, into a baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The modem <b>704</b> performs a baseband signal/bit stream conversion function according to the physical layer standard of the system.

Also, for data reception, the modem <b>704</b> divides baseband signals, received from the RF processor <b>702</b>, on an OFDM symbol basis, restores signals mapped to subcarriers by FFT, and restores the received bit stream by demodulation and decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The controller <b>706</b> controls an overall function of the BS <b>700</b>. For example, the controller <b>706</b> generates and interprets MAC control message exchanged with an MS. The controller <b>706</b> determines an operation mode of the MS automatically or at the request of the MS and generates a message indicating the determined operation mode. Herein, the operation mode includes a sleep mode and an active mode. The controller <b>706</b> includes a sleep cycle controller <b>708</b> for controlling a sleep cycle of at least one MS operating in the sleep mode. The sleep cycle increases or decreases according to the progress of the sleep mode, and may differ according to MSs. Also, the controller <b>706</b> generates a traffic indication message transmitted during a listening window of the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The controller <b>706</b> further includes a synchronization information generator <b>710</b> for generating information that is used by the MS, which has failed to receive the traffic indication message during the listening window, to remove the sleep cycle desynchronization with the BS <b>700</b>. The synchronization information generator <b>710</b> generates synchronization information when a TRF-IND-REQ message is received from the MS. Herein, the sleep mode synchronization information includes the start time point of the next listening window and the length of the sleep cycle including the next scheduled listening window. The controller <b>706</b> further includes an emergency alert service information generator <b>712</b> for information that is used by the MS, which has failed to receive the traffic indication message during the listening window, to acquire emergency alert service-related information. The emergency alert service information generator <b>712</b> generates emergency alert service-related information when a TRF-IND-REQ message is received from the MS. The emergency alert service-related information includes at least one of information indicating the whether an emergency alert service-related message is transmitted and information indicating the transmission time point of the emergency alert service-related message. Also, the controller <b>706</b> generates a TRF-IND-RSP message including the emergency alert service-related information and the synchronization information, and transmits the TRF-IND-RSP message through the modem <b>704</b> and the RF processor <b>702</b>. For example, the TRF-IND-RSP message may be configured as shown in Table 4 or Table 5.</p>

However, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the TRF-IND-REQ message may be an independent signaling message designed for a separate function. For example, the independent signaling message may mean &#x2018;Sleep Sync Info Request&#x2019;. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the MS <b>600</b> may transmit CQICH, dedicated CDMA code, or a special code specialized for the synchronization, instead of the TRF-IND-REQ/RSP message.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As described above, the present disclosure controls the state transition between the MS <b>600</b> and the BS <b>700</b> through the sleep control signaling in the BWA system, thereby maintaining the sleep mode synchronization even in the example of non-reception of the TRF-IND message.
