<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same labels and/or reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one or more implementations, described herein, devices may be used to optimize the collection of network performance information.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of an example overview of an implementation described herein. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a user or system operator may configure a network management system to monitor network congestion, network strain, or other types of parameters associated with network performance characteristics corresponding to a network (e.g., a radio access network (RAN)) and/or a network device (e.g., a base station). In response to detecting a problem in the network, the network management system may identify performance information (also referred to herein as &#x201c;key performance indicators&#x201d; or KPIs) relating to the detected problem and communicate priority instructions to the network device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The network device may receive the priority instructions and use the priority instructions to prioritize network performance information that is typically (or that can be) collected by the network device. For example, as depicted in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the network device may create a list of network performance information and assign a priority value to each type of network performance information. The network device may also, or alternatively, evaluate local resources (e.g., processing capacity, memory capacity, bandwidth capacity, etc.) and/or other conditions relating to the network device, in order to determine how resource intensive (or costly) it would be to calculate, collect, or otherwise obtain the different types of network performance information. In response to prioritizing network performance information and/or evaluating the availability of local resources, the network device may collect performance information based on the prioritized performance information and the evaluated resources, which may include a comparison or another type of analysis of the prioritized network performance information and the cost associated with collecting the performance information.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The network device may communicate the collected information to the network management system so that the network management system may continue analyzing network performance and/or investigating problems or other types of issues related to the network or a network device. The network management system may also, or alternatively, provide system diagnostic information to the system operator so that the system operator may better understand current operating conditions in the network and/or initiate investigations or take corrective measures with respect to the network. In some implementations, the network management system may also, or alternatively, be capable of initiating investigations or taking corrective action based on network performance information received from the network device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As such, one or more implementations, discussed herein, may provide a solution to collecting network performance information without unnecessarily creating network congestions or causing one or more other types of network performance problems. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the implementations discussed herein may provide solutions to evaluating the importance of different types of performance information and providing the most important performance information to a network management system so that vital, problematic, or otherwise significant aspects of a network or network device may be analyzed and/or investigated. Further, one or more implementations, discussed herein, may provide solutions to taking into account the capacity of a particular network device to collect performance information so that collecting the performance information does not interrupt other (and possibly more important) network functions or operations performed by the network device. Accordingly, one or more of the implementations described herein may provide intelligent, dynamic solutions to identifying, investigating, and analyzing network performance problems or other types of issues relating to a network or a network device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of an example environment <b>200</b> in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented.

However, the number of devices and/or networks, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is provided for explanatory purposes only. In practice, there may be additional devices and/or networks, fewer devices and/or networks, different devices and/or networks, or differently arranged devices and/or networks than illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also, in some implementations, one or more of the devices of environment <b>200</b> may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices of environment <b>200</b>. Devices of environment <b>200</b> may interconnect via wired connections, wireless connections, or a combination of wired and wireless connections.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Implementations are described as being performed within a RAN that is based on a long term evolution (LTE) network for explanatory purposes. In other implementations, the implementations may be performed within a RAN that is not based on a LTE network.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Environment <b>200</b> may include an evolved packet system (EPS) that includes a LTE network and/or an evolved packet core (EPC) that operate based on a third generation partnership project (3GPP) wireless communication standard. The LTE network may be a RAN that includes one or more base stations <b>220</b> that take the form of evolved Node Bs (eNBs) via which user device <b>210</b> communicates with the EPC. The EPC may include SGW <b>230</b>, MME <b>240</b>, and/or PGW <b>250</b> that enable user device <b>210</b> to communicate with network <b>280</b> and/or an Internet protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS) core. The IMS core may include HSS/AAA server <b>260</b> and/or CSCF server <b>270</b> and may manage authentication, session initiation, account information, profile information, etc. associated with user devices <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">User device <b>210</b> may include any computation or communication device, such as a wireless mobile communication device that is capable of communicating with base station <b>220</b> and/or a network (e.g., network <b>280</b>). For example, user device <b>210</b> may include a radiotelephone, a personal communications system (PCS) terminal (e.g., that may combine a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities), a personal digital assistant (PDA) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet/intranet access, etc.), a smart phone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a camera, a personal gaming system, or another type of mobile computation or communication device. User device <b>210</b> may send traffic to and/or receive traffic from network <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Base station <b>220</b> may include one or more devices that receive, process, and/or transmit traffic, such as audio, video, text, and/or other data, destined for and/or received from user device <b>210</b>. In an example implementation, base station <b>220</b> may be an eNB associated with the LTE network that receives traffic from and/or sends traffic to network <b>280</b> via SGW <b>230</b> and PGW <b>250</b>. Base station <b>220</b> may send traffic to and/or receive traffic from user device <b>210</b> via an air interface. In another example, one or more other base stations <b>220</b> may be associated with a radio access network (RAN) that is not associated with the LTE network.</p>

In one example implementation, SGW <b>230</b> may aggregate traffic received from one or more base stations <b>220</b> associated with the LTE network, and may send the aggregated traffic to network <b>280</b> (e.g., via PGW <b>250</b>) and/or other network devices associated with the IMS core and/or the EPC. SGW <b>230</b> may also receive traffic from the other network devices and/or may send the received traffic to user device <b>210</b> via base station <b>220</b>. SGW <b>230</b> may perform operations associated with handing off user device <b>210</b> from and/or to the LTE network.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">MME <b>240</b> may include one or more computation or communication devices that gather, process, search, store, and/or provide information in a manner described herein. For example, MME <b>240</b> may perform operations associated with handing off user device <b>210</b>, from a first base station <b>220</b> to a second base station <b>220</b>, when user device <b>210</b> is exiting a cell associated with the first base station <b>220</b>.

For example, network management system <b>290</b> may prioritize one or more types of network performance information. In some implementations, network management system <b>290</b> may prioritize the types of network performance information based on the network condition and/or the evaluation of the network condition. For instance, network management system <b>290</b> may prioritize types of network performance information based on a level of relevancy that each type of network performance information has to the network condition.

In other implementations, some or all of process <b>700</b> may be performed by one or more other components/devices, or a group of components/devices, including or excluding network device <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Priority information may be received (block <b>710</b>). For example, network device <b>500</b> may receive priority information from network management system <b>290</b>. As mentioned above, the priority information may include instructions or other types of information relating to prioritizing one or more types of network performance information. In some implementations, the priority information may relate to a network condition detected by network management system <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Network performance information may be prioritized (block <b>720</b>). For example, network device <b>500</b> may prioritize one or more types of network performance information. In some implementations, network device <b>500</b> may prioritize the types of network performance information based on the priority information received from network management system <b>290</b>. As mentioned above, examples of network performance information types may include packet loss information corresponding to a particular network, throughput information corresponding to a particular network, latency information corresponding to a particular network, and/or one or more other types of information relating to the performance of a network or a network device.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Device resources may be evaluated (block <b>730</b>). For instance, network device <b>500</b> may evaluate one or more device resources. Examples of device resources may include a processing capacity, a memory capacity, a bandwidth capacity, or one or more other types of capacities or capabilities corresponding to network device <b>500</b>. As mentioned above, in some implementations, network device <b>500</b> may also, or alternatively, evaluate one or more device resources corresponding to another network device <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Network performance information may be collected (block <b>740</b>). For instance, network device <b>500</b> may collect, calculate, or otherwise obtain network performance information. As mentioned above, network performance information may include various types of information, including information corresponding to a condition, a function, a process, and/or an operation associated with network device <b>500</b>. Network performance information may correspond to information that may be readily collected by network device <b>500</b> (e.g., an identifier corresponding to network device <b>500</b>, an identifier corresponding to a packet source, a time when a particular packet was received, etc.) or information that is calculated, measured, or otherwise derived by network device <b>500</b> (e.g., a processing rate, a change in available bandwidth over a particular period of time, a ratio corresponding to packet loss, a degree or severity corresponding to latency, etc.). Accordingly, network device <b>500</b> may collect a wide variety of network performance information.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some implementations, network device <b>500</b> may collect network performance information based on the priorities assigned to one or more types of network performance information and/or the availability or cost associated with one or more device resources. For instance, network device <b>500</b> may collect the network performance information with the highest priority if sufficient device resources are available. However, if sufficient device resources are not available, network device <b>500</b> may collect the network performance information with the highest priority that the available device resources can collect. In other implementations, if sufficient device resources are not available, network device <b>500</b> may also, or alternatively, collect a smaller quantity of the highest-priority network performance information or collect an alternative form of the highest-priority network performance information (e.g., if the network performance information require calculations, network device <b>500</b> may instead collect the information used by the calculation and the calculation may later be performed by network management system <b>290</b>). As such, network device <b>500</b> may collect network performance information in one or more of a variety of ways and/or forms.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some implementations, network device <b>500</b> may implement one or more types of evaluation systems to help determine which network performance information will be collected and communicated to network management system <b>290</b>. For example, network device <b>500</b> may assign a cost value to different types of device resources based on, for example, an anticipated demand for a device resource, a current usage amount corresponding to the device resource, a historical usage amount corresponding to the device resource, a capacity amount or capacity percentage that has been reserved for one or more other functions, or one or more other types of factors relating to device resources. Additionally, or alternatively, network device <b>500</b> may be assigned or allocated a quantity of information management points that network device <b>500</b> may use to help determine, for example, whether a particular set of device resources required to collect and transmit a particular amount of high-priority network performance information is too costly. As such, one or more implementations, described herein, may provide various solutions to identifying an optimal set of network performance information based on one or more priorities, conditions, constraints, or expectations.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Network performance information may be communicated (block <b>750</b>). For example, network device <b>500</b> may communicate network performance information. In some implementations, network device <b>500</b> may communicate the network performance information to network management system <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a flowchart diagram of an example process <b>700</b> for providing network performance information, in other implementations, a process for providing network performance information may include fewer operations, different operations, differently arranged operations, or additional operations than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram of an example system <b>800</b> for collecting network performance information according to one or more implementations described herein. As depicted, system <b>800</b> may include base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, PGW <b>250</b>, network management system <b>290</b>, and networks <b>810</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>810</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , <b>810</b>-M (where M&#x2267;1) (hereinafter referred to collectively as &#x201c;networks <b>810</b>,&#x201d; and individually as &#x201c;network <b>810</b>&#x201d;). Base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, PGW <b>250</b>, network management system <b>290</b>, and network <b>280</b> are generally described above with reference to, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The number of devices and/or networks, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is provided for explanatory purposes only. In practice, there may be additional devices and/or networks, fewer devices and/or networks, different devices and/or networks, or differently arranged devices and/or networks than illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Also, in some implementations, one or more of the devices of system <b>800</b> may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices of system <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, network management system <b>290</b> may detect a network condition, identify network performance information corresponding to the network condition, and/or communicate priority information, corresponding to the network performance information, to one or more network devices <b>500</b> (e.g., base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, and/or PGW <b>250</b>). Each network device <b>500</b> may receive the priority information, evaluate device resources, collect network performance information based on the priority information and the device resources, and/or communicate the network performance information to network management system <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As depicted in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in some implementations, network management system <b>290</b> may include one or more one or more control scripts or control modules for controlling one or more functions, processes, or operations of one or more network devices <b>500</b>. For example, a control script of network management system <b>290</b> may be used to activate and/or deactivate one or more functions used by base station <b>220</b> to collect one or more types of network performance information. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, examples of such functions include one set of functions for collecting information regarding one network (e.g., network <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>) and another set of functions for collecting information regarding another network (e.g., network <b>280</b>-<b>2</b>). Additionally, or alternatively, each set of functions may include a function for computing a network packet loss, computing a network throughput, and computing a network latency. Accordingly, network management system <b>290</b> may communicate with base station <b>220</b> (or another type of network device <b>500</b>) to activate or deactivate one or more of the information collection functions of base station <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some implementations, network management system <b>290</b> may communicate with base station <b>220</b> (or another type of network device <b>500</b>) via a separate, reserved, or dedicated communication channel. Providing a separate communication channel for communicating with network devices <b>500</b> may better enable network management system <b>290</b> to communicate requests, commands, and/or control information during times of high network congestion. In a similar manner, a separate communication channel may also, or alternatively, better enable network devices <b>500</b> to communicate network performance information to network management system <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As is also depicted in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, multiple network devices <b>500</b> (e.g., base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, and PGW <b>250</b>) may collect one or more types of network performance information (e.g., key performance indicators (KPIs)). In the depicted example, base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, and PGW <b>250</b> are each configured to collect the same type of network performance information, represented by KPI&#x2212;1, KPI&#x2212;2, . . . , KPI&#x2212;P (where P&#x3e;1) (hereinafter referred to collectively as &#x201c;KPIs,&#x201d; and individually as &#x201c;KPI&#x201d;). Configuring multiple network devices <b>500</b> to provide network management system <b>290</b> with the same types of network performance information may better enable network management system <b>290</b> to compare the performance of certain portions of system <b>800</b> with one or more other portions of system <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">By contrast, in other implementations, one or more of base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, and/or PGW <b>250</b> may collect additional types of network performance information, different types of network performance information, and/or alternative types of network performance information. Additionally, or alternatively, while base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, and PGW <b>250</b> may be capable of collecting the same types of network performance information, the actual network performance information that is collected by base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, and PGW <b>250</b> may differ. For instance, the network performance information collected by base station <b>220</b> may correspond to network <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> and/or network <b>280</b>-<b>2</b>, while the network performance information collected by SGW <b>230</b> may correspond to network <b>280</b>-<b>2</b> and/or <b>280</b>-M, and the network performance information collected by PGW <b>250</b> may correspond to <b>280</b>-M and/or another network (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some implementations, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one or more network devices <b>500</b> (e.g., base station <b>220</b>) may include a KPI filter to assist with preventing the collection and/or transmission of KPIs or other types of network performance information that may be insignificant, unnecessary, or otherwise undesirable. In some implementations, the KPI filter may be controlled and/or managed by network management system <b>290</b>. As such, a KPI filter may provide network management system <b>290</b> with a direct solution to preventing the collection and/or transmission of certain types of network performance information. In other implementations, network management system <b>290</b> may also, or alternatively, control the collection of certain types of network performance information via priority information. For example, to prevent a particular network device <b>500</b> from collecting and/or transmitting a particular type of network performance information, network management system <b>290</b> may set, assign, or otherwise associate a very low priority to the unwanted type of network performance information.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some implementations, a network device, such as base station <b>220</b> may evaluate the availability corresponding to one or more device resources by creating a list of one or more device resources and associating a cost value with each of the device resources. The cost value may correspond to a usage amount. The network device may also, or alternatively, determine whether adequate device resources are available to collect network performance information and to communicate the network performance information to the network management system. To do so, the network device may determine which of the device resources are required to collect the network performance information and to communicate the network performance information to the network management system. The network device may calculate a total cost value based on the cost value associated with each of the one or more device resources required to collect and communicate the network performance information and identify a quantity of information management points allocated to the network device for appropriating device resources to collect and communicate network performance information. The network device may determine whether the total cost value is less than the quantity of information management points allocated to the network device for appropriating device resources to collect and communicate network performance information.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As such, since system <b>800</b> provides multiple network devices <b>500</b> that are capable of collecting various types of network performance information corresponding to different portions of system <b>800</b>, one or more implementations, described herein, may enable network management system <b>290</b> to evaluate system <b>800</b> in a more complete and/or detailed manner than might otherwise be possible. Furthermore, centralizing the prioritization of network performance information (e.g., via network management system <b>290</b>), while distributing the responsibility of collecting the network performance information (e.g., via base station <b>220</b>, SGW <b>230</b>, and PGW <b>250</b>) may provide an optimal balance between managing the identification of network performance information and distributing the resource requirements associated with collecting network performance information.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In light of the above, one or more of the implementations, described herein, may provide various solutions to optimizing the collection of network performance information. For instance, one or more implementations, described herein, may include network management system <b>290</b> that may detect network conditions, identify types of network performance information that are significant, and modify one or more network processes for collecting the network performance information. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the implementations, described herein, may provide a balanced solution to centralizing the management, analysis, and prioritization of network performance information yet distributing the responsibility of collecting the network performance information amongst multiple network devices <b>500</b>. Furthermore, in some implementations, network devices <b>500</b> may operate intelligently by collecting high-priority network performance information without overextending device resources.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It will be apparent that example aspects, as described above, may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement these aspects should not be construed as limiting.
