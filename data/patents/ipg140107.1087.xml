<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a utility application which claims the priority of United Kingdom Patent Application No. GB 0907748.8, filed May 6, 2009 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a structural support member for a harness for breathing apparatus, in particular, a structural support member comprising a frame.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) harnesses comprise a structural support member for supporting a cylinder of breathable gas and a pair of shoulder straps and a belt to facilitate the carrying of the structural support member of the back of a user. The structural support member is provided with a valve towards its lower end and a retaining strap at its upper end. In use, a cylinder of breathable gas is attached to the valve and is further secured to the structural support member by means of the retaining strap which is made to pass around an upper portion of the cylinder. A number of flexible hoses extended from the valve to the shoulder straps so that breathing apparatus worn by the user may be conveniently connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to use a back plate as the structural support member. This is usually in the form of a generally flat elongate plate. When a user wears the harness the back plate rests against and along his back. The shoulder and waist straps are tightened on the user such that the back plate is held close to the user. When a user bends over, the back plate does not bend with the user because the back plate is rigid. This causes the user's back, and particularly his spine, to be pressed tightly against the back plate which can be uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore desirable to provide a more comfortable structural support member for a harness for breathing apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a structural support member for a harness for breathing apparatus, the structural support member being generally elongate and arranged in use to support a cylinder of breathable gas, the structural support member comprising: a frame having: a lower portion arranged in use to support a first end of a cylinder; an upper portion arranged in use to support a second opposed end of the cylinder; and first and second side limbs coupling the upper and lower portions and defining a void therebetween, in a substantially central region of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The void may be substantially longitudinally coextensive with the gas-cylinder that is to be mounted on the back frame. The void may be substantially transversely coextensive with the gas-cylinder that is to be mounted on the back frame.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably the void is arranged such that in use it can accommodate a portion of a wearer's back/spine when the wearer bends his back/spine.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably the void is delimited by the upper portion, the lower portion and the first and second limbs. The first and second side limbs may be disposed either side of the gas-cylinder that is to be mounted to the back frame.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At least one of the side limbs may have a guide channel for accommodating a flexible conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The upper portion may comprise a yoke that is detachably attached to the back frame. Preferably the yoke is detachably attached to the first and second side limbs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment the structural support member is further arranged in use to support one or more components that are operatively associated with the breathing apparatus, and the structural support member comprises first and second parts attached along a longitudinal extent of the structural support member and defining therebetween a housing for retaining one or more of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The longitudinal extent along which the first and second parts are attached may be substantially coincident with a longitudinal centreline of the structural support member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first and second parts may define a housing within the lower portion of the structural support member, arranged in use to retain a valve for the cylinder. The first part may comprise the first side limb and the second part may comprise the second side limb.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The longitudinal extent along which the first and second parts are attached may be substantially coincident with a longitudinal centreline of the lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a harness for breathing apparatus comprising a structural support member according to any statement herein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention may comprise any combination of the features and/or limitations referred to herein, except combinations of such features as are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a front view of the back frame <b>10</b> alone. The back frame <b>10</b> comprises a first part <b>20</b> a second part <b>30</b> and a yoke <b>40</b>. The first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are substantially the same but are mirror images of one another. They are connected together towards the lower portion of the back frame along a longitudinal axis <b>12</b> of the back frame <b>10</b> which is coincident with the centre line of the back frame <b>10</b>. The first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are connected together towards the upper portion of the back frame <b>10</b> by the yoke <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first part <b>20</b> comprises a first lower portion <b>22</b> and a first upper portion <b>24</b> that make up the lower portion <b>11</b> of the back frame <b>10</b>. A first side limb <b>26</b> extends longitudinally and connects the first lower portion <b>22</b> to the first upper portion <b>24</b>. The first part <b>20</b> further comprises a first side flange <b>28</b> which comprises two fixing portions <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> to which the left shoulder strap <b>110</b> and the waist strap <b>130</b> can be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second part <b>30</b> comprises a second lower portion <b>32</b> and a second upper portion <b>34</b>. A second side limb <b>36</b> extends longitudinally and connects the second lower portion <b>32</b> to the second upper portion <b>34</b>. The second part <b>30</b> further comprises a second side flange <b>38</b> which comprises two fixing portions <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> to which the right shoulder strap <b>120</b> and the waist strap <b>130</b> can be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first and second side limbs <b>26</b>, <b>36</b> define a void <b>14</b> in a central region of the back frame <b>10</b>. The void <b>14</b> is delimited by the first and second side limbs <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>, the lower portion <b>11</b> of the back frame <b>10</b> and the yoke <b>40</b> (or upper portion of the back frame <b>10</b>). The void <b>14</b> extends longitudinally along, and transversely across, the majority, or at least a substantial portion, of the back frame <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the yoke <b>40</b> of the back frame <b>10</b> comprises first and second attachment portions <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> for attaching the yoke <b>40</b> to the first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> respectively. The first and second attachment portions <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> each comprise a tongue <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> (described in more detail below). The yoke <b>40</b> further includes left and right shoulder strap fixing portions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to which the left and right shoulder straps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> can be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a rear view of the back plate <b>10</b> alone. The first side limb <b>26</b> comprises a first guide channel <b>25</b> and the second side limb <b>36</b> comprises a second guide channel <b>35</b>. These channels <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> are arranged to accommodate and retain the high-pressure hose <b>150</b> and the medium pressure hose <b>152</b> respectively. The guide channels <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> are shaped with projections within and along their length that are arranged to retain flexible conduits within the channels. However, as will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, other means for retaining flexible conduits within the channels are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the back frame <b>10</b> in a disassembled state. As can be seen, the first part <b>20</b>, second part <b>30</b> and yoke <b>40</b> are completely separable. The first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are attached along a longitudinal axis <b>12</b> of the back frame <b>10</b>. The first part <b>20</b> comprises two protrusions <b>21</b> that, upon assembly, are inserted into two holes in the second part <b>31</b> (not shown). A nut and bolt (not shown) are used to hold a first lower portion <b>22</b> to a second lower portion <b>32</b>. The yoke <b>40</b> can be snap-fitted to the first and second upper portions <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> (described in more detail later). A housing for the reducer valve <b>140</b> is defined between the first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> in order to retain the reducer valve <b>140</b> on the back frame <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment the longitudinal extent along which the first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are attached is a longitudinal axis <b>12</b> which is coincident with a longitudinal centre line of the back frame. However, as will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the longitudinal extent of attachment may be orientated at 45&#xb0;, or any other suitable angle, to the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first lower portion <b>22</b> of the first part <b>20</b> comprises a first recess <b>23</b> and the second lower portion <b>32</b> of the second part <b>30</b> comprises a second recess <b>33</b>. During assembly of the harness <b>100</b> first and second lower portions <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> are assembled around the reducer <b>140</b> such that it is housed within both the first recess <b>23</b> and the second recess <b>33</b>. After the first and second lower portions <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> have been fixed together using a nut and bolt (or other fixing device) the reducer is retained within the lower portion <b>11</b> of the back frame <b>11</b>. The housing defined by the first and second recesses <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> of the first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> protect any delicate components of the reducer valve <b>140</b> and also reduce the overall profile of the harness <b>100</b> because a portion of the reducer <b>140</b> is located within the back frame <b>10</b>. The reducer <b>140</b> is also fixed to the back frame <b>10</b> without the need for additional fixing components.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After the first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> have been attached together by the first and second lower portions <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>, the yoke <b>40</b> is attached between the first and second upper portions <b>24</b>, <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, this is done by slotting the tongues <b>41</b>, <b>43</b> of the first and second attachment portions <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the yoke, into first and second grooves <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) provided in the first and second upper portions <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> of the first and second parts <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>. This is a snap-fit-type connection that can be made without the need for tools.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The assembled back frame <b>10</b> having a reducer valve <b>140</b> housed within the lower portion <b>11</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The reducer valve <b>140</b> comprises a cylinder connection portion <b>142</b> that protrudes from the housing such that a gas-cylinder can be attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, after the back frame <b>10</b> has been assembled, a high-pressure hose <b>150</b> and a medium-pressure hose <b>152</b> are attached to the reducer valve <b>140</b>. The high-pressure hose <b>150</b> is located in the first guide channel <b>25</b> of the first side limb <b>20</b> and the medium-pressure hose <b>152</b> is located in the second guide channel <b>35</b> of the second side limb <b>30</b>. The hoses <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> cross to the front side of the back frame <b>10</b> in the region of the yoke <b>40</b>, cross over, and are positioned on the shoulder straps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, assembly of the harness <b>100</b> can be completed by attaching the left and right shoulder straps <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, the waist strap <b>130</b> and the cylinder retaining strap <b>136</b>. The harness <b>100</b> is particularly light due to the large void <b>14</b> that occupies a substantial area of the back frame <b>10</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the void <b>14</b> is substantially longitudinally and transversely coextensive with the gas cylinder <b>1</b>. The first and second side limbs <b>26</b>, <b>36</b> are spaced either side of the gas-cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The harness <b>100</b> is also comfortable for a wearer. When a user wears the harness <b>100</b> on his or her back, the back frame <b>10</b> only contacts the user at a lower region and an upper region. When a user bends over his back/spine bends into the void <b>14</b>. This cannot occur with conventional harnesses <b>100</b>. With conventional harnesses a user's back is forced against a back plate when the user bends over, which can be uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, because a user's spine/back can be accommodated in the void, the overall profile of the user including the harness is smaller. This makes crawling and climbing through small spaces easier.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A further embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. This embodiment is identical to the first embodiment except that the back frame <b>10</b> is integrally formed with a lower portion <b>11</b>, an upper portion <b>40</b> and first and second side limbs <b>26</b>, <b>36</b>. A reducer valve <b>140</b> can be mounted to the front of the lower portion <b>11</b> of the back frame <b>10</b> using a mounting portion <b>13</b>. A large void <b>14</b> in a central region of the back frame <b>10</b> is delimited by the upper portion <b>40</b>, the lower portion <b>11</b> and the first and second side limbs <b>26</b>, <b>36</b>.</p>
