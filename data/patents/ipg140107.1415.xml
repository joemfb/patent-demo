<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to lighting, and more particularly to a light emitting device having a movable collimating unit for adjusting the output direction of light being emitted from the light emitting device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recessed ceiling spots having adjustable direction of the emitted light are commonly used in lighting applications in shops, theatres, galleries, etc. Conventionally incandescent or CDM lamps, i.e. metal halide lamps employing a ceramic discharge tube in place of the usual quartz type, are typically used as light sources in such light emitting devices. These types of light sources requires bulky and heavy mechanical parts to enable an adjustable direction of light emitted from the device. The adjustment of the direction of light is typically achieved by means of tilting and rotating of the complete light emitting device. More recently light emitting diodes, LEDs, have entered into this field of lighting applications. When utilizing LEDs as light sources a similar problem as described above arises. The LEDs require cooling which is often achieved using relatively large and bulky heat sinks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">US 2008/0089085A1 discloses a headlamp for a motor vehicle having an adjustable light path direction. The utilized light source comprises a LED mounted onto a heat sink, which also forms part of a housing of the headlamp. Thus, the light source is arranged within the housing. Furthermore, a movable reflector is distantly arranged from the light source, such that at least a part of the light emitted from the light source is reflected towards a lens, through which light is outputted from the device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to provide a light emitting device that at least alleviates the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a light emitting device comprising a base unit, a light output unit which is engaged with the base unit, and which comprises at least one light source for emitting light, and a movably arranged collimating unit for adjusting the output direction of the emitted light. The light output unit comprises a light output portion for outputting light emitted from the light source. Furthermore, the collimating unit is arranged to encompass the light output portion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a light emitting device is provided having a movably arranged collimating unit which encompasses a light output portion arranged on the light output unit. Substantially all light outputted from the light output portion is thus directly injected into the collimating unit, thereby allowing a high light output yield. The collimating unit collimates the light, and depending on the desired light beam direction, the movably arranged collimating unit is adjusted accordingly. Meanwhile, the position of the light output portion is kept fixed. With the present inventive concept a high flexibility of the angle of the light beam direction is provided. The collimating unit may be arranged such that the light rays outputted at the light output portion hits the collimator a limited amount of times, preferably 0 or 1 times. The invention further provides a simple mechanical construction, which provides a compact, light and cheap solution for the adjustment of the direction of the outputted light from the light emitting device. In addition, no housing is required to seal the light emitting device. Additionally having the cooling means on a set position or orientation can be advantageous because the cooling can be made more effective as the air flows around the device will always be oriented in the same direction. The at least one light source may be one of a light emitting diode, a laser, a CDM and an incandescent.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the light output portion is distanced from the base unit. Thus, the light output portion may advantageously be recessed, or even be fully built in, e.g. in a ceiling or a wall, while having the moving part and the light output portion arranged on the outside the ceiling or the wall. This provides for a good accessibility to the light output portion for maintenance. The light output portion is still connected to the base unit via the light unit. For the ease of a fully built-in base portion, the partitioning wall will have to be provided with a suitable aperture for the light output unit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the collimating unit is arranged to be tiltable with respect to the light output unit and the base unit. Furthermore, the combination of the collimating unit, the base unit, and the light output unit is arranged to be rotatable. This allows for the light output portion to be rotated around a vertical axis with respect to the combination, while still having the same position within the movably arranged collimator. Having the base unit arranged to be rotatable around a vertical axis is advantageous because only the tilt mechanism between the base unit and the light output unit is then required. Depending on the arrangement of the light output portion, the rotation around the vertical axis may, in addition to the collimation of the collimating unit, slightly influence the appearance of the final outputted light distribution, and/or set the light beam direction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the collimating unit is one of a truncated cone, cylinder shaped, square shaped, and triangular. The shape of the collimating unit may advantageously be arranged to influence the appearance of the light beam, or the angular light distribution, for the outputted light.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the base unit comprises a heat sink arranged for dissipating heat from the at least one light source.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the light output unit further comprises a mixing rod having a first end arranged at the at least one light source, and a second end forming the light output portion. With this arrangement, the light sources may be arranged directly onto a heat sink, thus increasing the efficiency of the cooling of the light sources. Also, because the light output portion is kept separated from the light sources, the risk for a user to burn himself on the light emitting device is decreased, as the light output is separated from the heat sources (light sources). The light mixing rod is further advantageous when employing light sources which emits a plurality of colors or when a smoothened light output profile is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the second end is arranged to be one of cone shaped, pyramid shaped, and facetted. Thus, light from the light output surface may leave the light mixing rod from its vertical sides, and not just from a flat end facet. This provides a broadening of the light intensity distribution from the light output surface, which highly increases the amount of light that hits the inner surface of the collimating unit, i.e. less light exits the light emitting device directly without hitting the collimating unit. As a consequence, the length of the collimating unit may be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the device further comprises a light source fixture at which said at least one light source is arranged. Further, the light source fixture is arranged to form the light output portion. The light source fixture allows for a variety of arrangements of the light sources which is advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, a plurality of the light sources are rotational symmetrically arranged on the light source fixture, which is advantageous for providing comparable light distributions in all directions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, a plurality of the light sources are arranged at least partly covering a surface of the light source fixture, wherein the light source fixture is arranged having the shape of one of a sphere, a pyramid, a rectangle, and a cone.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the movably arranged collimating unit comprises an aperture providing a predefined path for the movement of the collimating unit, which predefined path for the movement of the collimating unit is optionally asymmetric.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the light emitting device further comprises a reflector arranged at the base unit. This is advantageous for reflecting stray light through the aperture of the collimating unit and for improving the appearance of the lamp/luminaire.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the light emitting device further comprises a control unit for controlling the movement of the collimating unit, the amount of light, color of the light from the light emitting device, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an alternative embodiment the base unit may be common to a plurality of light output units.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with an embodiment of the light emitting device, the base unit of is arranged to be shifted during movement of the collimating unit for adjusting the direction of the emitted light. The shifting of the position of the base unit is made in order to counterbalance a shifting of an area of the collimating unit from which the light exits the device. This area is referred to the light exit area, and is typically defined by an outer rim of the collimating unit If the collimating unit is moved to adjust the direction of the emitted light, for instance by means of tilting the collimating unit, the shifting of the light exit area of the collimating unit may be counterbalanced by simultaneously shifting the base with reference to the collimating unit, such that the total amplitude of the shifting of the exit area during adjustment of the direction of the light is decreased or totally counterbalanced. The direction of the outputted light may then be altered while still having a fixed position of the origin of the light output. This is also advantageous when optionally arranging the light emitting device in a recess in e.g. a ceiling. As the shifting of the light exit area is decreased, the recess may be decreased and the light emitting device may be better recessed in the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">These and other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The light emitting device <b>100</b> comprises a base unit <b>110</b>, a light output unit <b>120</b> having a first end engaged at the base unit <b>110</b> and comprising a light output surface <b>125</b> at an opposite end, and a movably arranged collimating unit <b>130</b><i>a </i>which is arranged to receive and adjust the direction of the light being outputted from the light output surface <b>125</b>. The light exits the light emitting device via a light exit area of the collimating unit, which is typically defined by the outer rim of the collimating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The light output unit <b>120</b> comprises a light source <b>121</b>. The light source is in this exemplary embodiment a LED, but any suitable light source like a laser, an incandescent lamp or a CDM is applicable within the inventive concept and is considered to fall within the scope of the invention. The light source may be arranged anywhere within the light output unit <b>120</b>. However, as previously mentioned, the light emitted from the light source <b>121</b> is outputted from the light output unit <b>120</b> via the light output surface <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The collimating unit <b>130</b> is typically some type of movably arranged collimating unit, like a curved reflective surface. However, the collimating unit may be realized by means of a movably arranged light guide, lens, or combination of optical components etc., which is arranged to receive light and adjust the direction of the light being outputted from the light output unit <b>120</b>. The collimating unit <b>130</b><i>a </i>is in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a hollow cylinder, which is at least mainly closed in one end. Further, the collimating unit is open in the opposite end, thereby defining a light exit area. An adjustment element, which here comprises a slit <b>129</b>, is arranged at the closed end, in which a portion of the light output unit <b>120</b> is passed through such that the collimating unit <b>130</b><i>a </i>encompasses the light output surface <b>125</b>. The slit <b>129</b> further allows for pivotal adjustment of the collimating unit <b>130</b><i>a</i>. The collimation unit <b>130</b><i>a </i>is further pivotally arranged at the light output unit, and the pivotal movement is guided by the slit <b>129</b>. The slit <b>129</b> may in other embodiments be an aperture of another shape, e.g. circular. The actual pivot, or rotation point, depends on the arrangement. It should also be noted that the adjustment element comprises means for fixating the collimation unit in the adjusted direction (not shown), e.g. by means of mechanical resistance, gearbox, stepper or servo motor (computer driven). In the latter examples of the adjustment element a control unit is utilized to control the movement of the collimating unit to adjust the direction of the light emitted from the light emitting device. Further, the control unit may be arranged in combination with a driver for controlling the amount of light, the color of the light, operation time, or combinations thereof of the device. Several light emitting devices may advantageously be driven and controlled in a lighting system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As previously described the functionality of the collimating unit is to receive and collimate light from the light output unit <b>120</b> and since the collimating unit is adjustable the direction of the light beam being outputted from the device may be controlled into a desired direction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In alternative embodiments of the light emitting device, the adjusting element may in addition to the pivotal movement in one direction as described above, be arranged to allow a 360 degree rotational movement. Further, in the exemplifying embodiment above, the slit <b>129</b> is symmetrically arranged on the closed end of the cylindrically shaped collimating unit to guide the movement of the collimating unit such that a pivotal movement in a predetermined direction is allowed. This slit may also be asymmetrically arranged or have for instance a predetermined curved profile to provide a desired guiding of the movement of the collimating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The base unit <b>110</b> typically comprises the electrical means for powering and control of the device. Further, the base unit will typically comprise means for cooling the light source, i.e. any suitable heat sink with free convection, forced convection, liquid cooling, electrical cooling, or any combination thereof is arranged in connection to the base unit <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an alternative embodiment, the light emitting device comprises control means to control the positioning of the one or more collimating unit(s) <b>130</b>. The control means may comprise a motor for moving the collimation unit, a control device for controlling the motor and optionally communication means for remote control of the collimating unit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an alternative embodiment a common base unit may be arranged with a plurality of light output units <b>120</b>, each provided with a separate movable collimating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, another embodiment of the light emitting device <b>100</b> is illustrated in a cross sectional view. The basic structure of the embodiment is similar to the structure of the exemplary embodiment above. However, here the light source <b>121</b> is placed at the light output surface <b>125</b>. The collimating unit <b>130</b><i>b </i>is shaped as a truncated cone which is substantially closed in one end and open in the opposite end. The shape of the collimating unit may in other embodiments be square shaped, bell shaped, triangular etc. (not shown). Embodiments showing a substantially parabolic collimating unit <b>130</b><i>d </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light output unit <b>120</b> may further be arranged having a light source fixture <b>140</b>. A light source fixture <b>140</b><i>a </i>of an embodiment <b>200</b> of the light emitting device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>. The light source fixture <b>140</b><i>a </i>is arranged such that it forms the light output portion <b>125</b>, i.e. the light source fixture is arranged at the end of the light output unit <b>120</b> which is arranged inside the collimation unit <b>130</b><i>c</i>. The light source fixture <b>140</b><i>a </i>is arranged as a circular plate onto which plate light sources <b>121</b> in the form of sixteen rebel light emitting diodes, LEDs, <b>121</b> are mounted. The light sources <b>121</b> are symmetrically arranged on the circular plate, i.e. the light source fixture <b>140</b><i>c</i>. The light emitting device is typically arranged in a flat ceiling, having the light output unit <b>120</b> aligned with a vertical line. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>the tilting angle (pivotal angle) of the collimation unit <b>130</b><i>c </i>with respect to the vertical line is 0 degrees, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, the tilting angle of the collimation unit <b>130</b><i>c </i>with respect to the vertical line is 45 degrees (it may be larger). The collimating unit is in this exemplifying embodiment 10 cm long and has an inner diameter of 6 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>illustrate ray tracing calculations for this embodiment <b>200</b>. The outputted light beam spot for a flat surface, e.g. a floor, which is at a vertical distance of 140 cm away from the light emitting device <b>200</b> is calculated. As can be deducted from these calculations, the maximum illuminance value for the spot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, i.e. for the tilting angle 45 degrees, is lower due to the tilting angle of 45 degrees. The tilting angle causes the spot to project a conic section. Further, the tilting angle causes a 1.4 times a longer path for the light beam to the floor. The longer path for this tilting angle and the distance to the floor leads to a theoretical factor of 2.8 lower illuminance value in the center of the beam spot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, which is approximately obtained in the ray trace calculation. Furthermore, the light beam spot in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows some asymmetry which is caused by the positioning of the LEDs, which are not all located in an optimal position. The positioning of the LEDs may be optimized by adjusting the shape of the collimation unit <b>130</b><i>c</i>, and/or the point of pivotal movement of the collimating unit. Alternatively, the positions of the LEDs may be adjusted, as is discussed in the next sections.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment of the light emitting device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, the light source fixture <b>140</b><i>b </i>is spherical, such that the light sources <b>121</b>, LEDs, are rotational symmetrically arranged. This virtually eliminates the asymmetry of the beam spot as discussed above (asymmetry caused by the beam striking the surface under an angle may still be present). Since LEDs are arranged in any direction, the tilting direction of the collimator unit <b>130</b><i>c </i>becomes less crucial for the outputted light.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>illustrate yet other embodiments of the light emitting device having different light source fixtures: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a cylindrical light source fixture <b>140</b><i>c </i>with LEDs arranged on two opposite sides. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>illustrates a cone shaped rectangular light source fixture <b>140</b><i>d</i>, having the base of the cone arranged towards the base unit <b>110</b> (not shown), and light sources <b>121</b> at least partly covering the surface of the cone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>illustrates a light source fixture <b>140</b><i>e </i>which is rectangular. Light sources <b>121</b> are arranged on the sides of the rectangle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d </i>illustrates a light source fixture <b>140</b><i>f </i>showing a pyramid shape, and which has the base of the pyramid arranged towards the base (not shown). The sides of the pyramid are arranged with light sources <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment of the light emitting device, the light output unit is allowed to rotate around the vertical axis. This is advantageous for the embodiment <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. The light source fixture <b>140</b><i>c </i>is arranged having light sources <b>121</b> mounted at two vertical sides, such that the light sources <b>121</b> emit light in two main directions which are opposite to each other (left and right along the x-axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>). The collimating unit is allowed to tilt along the y-axis of the drawing. The base unit together with the collimator are allowed to rotate along the vertical (z-axis) at the same rate. Thus, the shape of the light beam being outputted from the light emitting device <b>400</b> is essentially unchanged whatever rotation is made.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment of the light emitting device, the light emitting device further comprises a reflector (not shown) arranged at the base unit. The reflector may be arranged by applying a reflecting material onto an outer surface of the base unit <b>110</b> which faces the collimating unit, or by being incorporated in the assembly as a sub part in the device, e.g. as a reflecting parabolic component arranged to encompass the interface between the light output unit <b>120</b> and the base unit <b>110</b>. This is advantageous for reflecting any stray light through the aperture of the collimating unit and for improving the appearance of the light lamp/luminaire.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment of the light emitting device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, the light emitting device <b>500</b> comprises a base unit <b>110</b>, a light output unit <b>120</b> and a collimating unit <b>130</b><i>c</i>. The light output unit <b>120</b> is arranged having the light sources <b>121</b>, LEDs, arranged at the base unit <b>110</b>. The base unit <b>110</b> comprises a heat sink. The mounting of the light sources at the vicinity of the heat sink is advantageous since the efficiency of the heat transfer from the light sources to the heat sink increases. The light output unit <b>120</b> further comprises a light mixing rod <b>126</b>, having a first end <b>127</b> arranged at the light sources <b>121</b> to receive the emitted light. Light emitted from the light sources <b>121</b> is guided through the mixing rod <b>126</b> and outputted via the second end <b>128</b> of the light mixing rod <b>126</b>. Thus, the second end <b>128</b> of the light emitting rod forms the light output portion <b>125</b> of the light output unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second end <b>128</b> of the light mixing rod <b>126</b> is here flat. Other shapes are possible. In another embodiment the second end <b>128</b> is arranged to be cone shaped, pyramid shaped and facetted, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The light emitting device <b>500</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, is arranged having a facetted second end on the light mixing rod <b>126</b>. This output portion <b>125</b> provides a light output in a radial direction with respect to the extension of the mixing rod, which highly ensures that substantially all of the mixed light hits the inner walls of the collimating unit <b>130</b><i>d</i>. This allows for a shorter length of the collimating unit <b>130</b> with retained light output illuminance, as compared to the embodiment of the light emitting device with a flat second end of the light mixing rod. The length of the collimating unit <b>130</b><i>d </i>is shorter than for the collimating unit <b>130</b><i>c </i>in the embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an alternative embodiment, the light emitting device is arranged to be recessed in a surface, e.g. a ceiling or a wall. Further, the base unit of the device is arranged to be shifted with respect to the collimating unit along a plane parallel to the surface during the adjustment of the collimating unit (not shown). Alternatively the base unit can in addition also shift along a vertical axis. The shifting of the position of the base unit is made in order to counterbalance the shifting of the light exit area of the collimating unit with respect to the surface, such that the total amplitude of the shifting of the light exit area during adjustment of the direction of the light is decreased (or alternatively completely counterbalanced). As the shifting of the light exit area is decreased, the recess area in the surface may be decreased. The shifting of the base unit with respect to the light output portion is also advantageous for an externally arranged light emitting device, as it allows for changing the direction of the outputted light, while having a fixated position of the light exit area with respect to the ceiling.</p>
