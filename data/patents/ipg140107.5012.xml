<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for controlling receive diversity of an antenna system of a computer device, the antenna system including two or more antenna elements. The method includes establishing a session with a remote transmitting system and determining whether a predetermined criteria detected by the computer device is satisfied within the session. If the predetermined criteria is satisfied within the session, the method includes activating at least two of the antenna elements for receiving transmissions, enabling performance of receive diversity on the received transmissions, and performing receive diversity on the received transmissions. If the predetermined criteria is not satisfied within the session, the method includes activating at least one of the antenna elements, disabling performance of receive diversity on the received transmissions, and performing a default signal processing on the received transmissions. A mobile communication device may be used to perform the method.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Example embodiments relate to antenna systems enabled for performing antenna diversity, and more particularly to such systems for use in mobile communication devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Receive diversity (R&#xd7;D) generally includes the use of a number of different antennas positioned at different spatial locations to receive different versions of the same signal. For example, based on a given environment having obstructions, various paths, etc., a signal may be subject to path loss and fading. Receive diversity may be used to process such aspects of a received source signal using the differing antenna positions. In some instances, receive diversity provides enhanced forward link capacity, lower base station transmit power, lower frame error rate, and improved data integrity when compared to processing without receive diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, a tradeoff occurs when implementing receive diversity. To enable receive diversity in some mobile communication devices, at least two antennas need to be powered by a battery. This causes an increased drain on the mobile battery. Such a process may require more battery power as compared to powering a single antenna for receiving signals without performing receive diversity. For example, up to twice the battery power may be required in some instances.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be advantageous to address some of the above-noted difficulties.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some example embodiments generally relate to dynamic control of an antenna system, for example to enable and disable performance of antenna diversity, such as receive diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an example embodiment, there is provided a method for controlling receive diversity of an antenna system of a computer device, the antenna system including two or more antenna elements. The method includes establishing a session with a remote transmitting system and determining whether a predetermined criteria detected by the computer device is satisfied within the session. If the predetermined criteria is satisfied within the session, the method includes activating at least two of the antenna elements for receiving transmissions, enabling performance of receive diversity on the received transmissions, and performing receive diversity on the received transmissions.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules <b>221</b> or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM <b>246</b>. The RAM <b>246</b> is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.</p>

The memory card <b>230</b> is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface <b>232</b> of the mobile communication device <b>201</b> in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The mobile communication device <b>201</b> stores data <b>228</b> in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory <b>244</b>.

For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystems <b>250</b> may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device <b>201</b> may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I/O subsystems <b>250</b> may comprise a navigational tool such as a clickable trackball or thumbwheel, a digital camera, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device <b>201</b> such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The serial data port <b>252</b> may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (e.g., computer <b>117</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>)). The serial data port <b>252</b> enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device <b>201</b> by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile communication device <b>201</b> other than through the wireless network <b>101</b>. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device <b>201</b> through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the mobile communication device <b>201</b> is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth&#xae; (Bluetooth&#xae; is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system <b>117</b> using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device <b>201</b> to the host computer system <b>117</b> via a USB cable or Bluetooth&#xae; connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network <b>101</b> is automatically routed to the mobile communication device <b>201</b> using the USB cable or Bluetooth&#xae; connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network <b>101</b> is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth&#xae; connection to the host computer system <b>117</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The short-range communication subsystem <b>272</b> is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device <b>201</b> and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem <b>272</b> may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth&#xae; communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device <b>201</b> during or after manufacture. Additional applications and/or upgrades to the operating system <b>223</b> or software applications <b>225</b> may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device <b>201</b> through the wireless network <b>101</b>, the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>250</b>, the serial port <b>252</b>, the short-range communication subsystem <b>272</b>, or other suitable subsystems <b>274</b> or wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory <b>244</b>), or written into and executed from the RAM <b>246</b> for execution by the processor <b>240</b> at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device <b>201</b> and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The mobile communication device <b>201</b> may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem <b>211</b> and input to the processor <b>240</b> for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display <b>242</b>. A user of the mobile communication device <b>201</b> may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen <b>204</b>. These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem <b>211</b> over the wireless network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the voice communication mode, the mobile communication device <b>201</b> provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker <b>256</b> and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone <b>258</b>. The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone <b>258</b>, the speaker <b>256</b> and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile communication device <b>201</b>. Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker <b>256</b>, the display screen <b>204</b> may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The mobile communication device <b>201</b> also includes a battery <b>238</b> as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port <b>252</b>. The battery <b>238</b> provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device <b>201</b>, and the battery interface <b>236</b> provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery <b>238</b>. The battery interface <b>236</b> is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile communication device <b>201</b>. A battery level indicator (not shown) may also be included for detecting and indicating the remaining batter power.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some conventional cellular phones, receive diversity is performed on the received signals during a voice call in dependence of signal quality or signal strength. Once the signal strength reaches below a certain level, receive diversity is activated and remains activated until the end of the voice call. However, such a system has limited applicability to voice calls, and if the signal once again returns to an acceptable level the receive diversity remains activated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some example embodiments, the mobile communication device <b>201</b> with the communication subsystem <b>211</b> is enabled to perform various aspects of antenna diversity, such as receive diversity. Generally, a source signal may be subject to path loss and fading based on a given environment having obstructions, various paths, etc. Receive diversity may be used to process such aspects of a received source signal based on the differing positions of antenna elements. In some instances, receive diversity provides enhanced signal processing when compared to processing without receive diversity. It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various implementations of receive diversity may be applied to those embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, the communication subsystem <b>211</b> may generally be used for enabling wireless communications to be received, and in some embodiments transmitted, by the mobile communication device <b>201</b>. The communication subsystem <b>211</b> may for example be used by any of the various subsystems of the mobile communication device <b>201</b> which may require wireless communications. The communication subsystem <b>211</b> includes an antenna system including a receiver <b>214</b>, a transmitter <b>216</b>, and associated components, local oscillators (LOs) <b>222</b>, and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>227</b>. The DSP <b>227</b> acts as a controller or local controller for the communication subsystem <b>211</b>, and may be in communication with the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b>. The receiver <b>214</b> is associated with at least two antenna elements <b>218</b><i>a</i>, <b>218</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>218</b><i>n </i>(each or collectively referred to as <b>218</b>), while the transmitter <b>216</b> is associated with antenna element <b>220</b> (one shown). As would be understood in the art, the antenna elements <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device <b>201</b>, and formed of at least some conductive material for receiving or transmitting (or both) of electromagnetic signals. Although antenna elements <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> are illustrated separately, in some example embodiments at least some of the antenna elements <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> are shared by both receiver and transmitter, and enabled for both transmitting and receiving. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem <b>211</b> depends on the wireless network <b>101</b> in which mobile communication device <b>201</b> is intended to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The mobile communication device <b>201</b> may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations <b>108</b> (or, in some embodiments, fixed transmitter base stations) of the wireless network <b>101</b> within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device <b>201</b> may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network <b>101</b> after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna elements <b>218</b> through the wireless network <b>101</b> are input to the receiver <b>214</b>, which may perform such receiver functions as signal amplification, signal combining, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, as would be understood in the art. A/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP <b>227</b>. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP <b>227</b>. These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter <b>216</b> for digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network <b>101</b> via the antenna <b>220</b>. The DSP <b>227</b> not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver <b>214</b> and the transmitter <b>216</b> may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP <b>227</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The receiver <b>214</b>, through control by the DSP <b>227</b>, may therefore be used to independently activate each antenna element <b>218</b><i>a</i>, <b>218</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>218</b><i>n</i>. Reference to activating for example includes having the battery <b>238</b> provide a power supply to the individual antenna element <b>218</b>, typically by way of activating associated switches or amplifiers, or similar components. For example, in instances where at least two antenna elements <b>218</b> are to be activated, the receiver <b>214</b> may do so by powering those specific antenna elements <b>218</b> from the battery <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The DSP <b>227</b> may also be configured for various modes of signal processing on the received signal. In one aspect, the DSP <b>227</b> is enabled to perform receive diversity on the received signals (by activating two or more of the antenna elements <b>218</b>). The DSP <b>227</b> may also perform a &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity, for example by activating only one antenna element <b>218</b>. Thus, in some instances, the signal processing based on receive diversity may be referred to as a high power mode of operation while the signal processing without receive diversity may be referred to as a low power mode of operation. In another example mode, the DSP <b>227</b> is configured so that multiple antenna elements <b>218</b> may be activated without implementing receive diversity, wherein the signal processing is based merely on processing the received signals based on redundancy or the combined signal. The DSP <b>227</b> may also be configured to enable or disable various modes of operation, or switch between various modes, depending on the particular application as described in detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In example embodiments, the DSP <b>227</b> may also perform some aspects of the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b>, or vice versa. In the embodiment shown, the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b> is in communication with the DSP <b>227</b> and may enable or disable performing of receive diversity by the DSP <b>227</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The specific position of each antenna element <b>218</b> may be located in dependence of on the specific configuration or application of the mobile communication device <b>201</b>. For example, in order to implement various forms of receive diversity each antenna element <b>218</b> may be spaced apart at a distance for example to improve the received signal for performing receive diversity. In an example embodiment, the antenna elements <b>218</b> are spaced apart in dependence of the general wavelength range (or carrier wavelength) of the received transmissions. In another example embodiment, two of the antenna elements <b>218</b> are located on opposing sides or faces of the casing (not shown) of the mobile communication device <b>201</b>. The remaining antenna elements <b>218</b>, if any, may each also be located within the casing (not shown) at generally equal distances between the two of the said opposing antenna elements. Other antenna configurations are also possible in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b> will now be described in greater detail. As shown, the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b> may include various sub-modules <b>300</b>, for example a data transmission quality sub-module <b>302</b>, a timer sub-module <b>308</b>, an application/process/session sub-module <b>310</b>, and an external power sub-module <b>312</b>. The R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b> may provide commands or instructions to enable the various modes of signal processing described above, for example to enable or disable receive diversity or to enable or disable &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity, or for switching between such modes (or other modes). At least some of the sub-modules <b>300</b> include a rule or a predetermined criteria stored within the data <b>228</b>, and enabling of receive diversity if such criteria is satisfied. Other rules or criteria are also provided by some of the sub-modules <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, the predetermined criteria is based on data operations of the computer device <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the communication subsystem <b>211</b> may be in communication with the wireless network <b>101</b> and configured for receiving of transmissions (generally of a source data signal) from the wireless network <b>101</b>. For some applications or implementations, the communication subsystem <b>211</b> is used to facilitate sessions with the wireless network <b>101</b>, for example data sessions. If the mobile communication device is implementing a voice application, the sessions may for example include a voice session. In other embodiments, a combination of both voice sessions and data sessions may be implemented, for example in some videoconferencing or conference call applications. Reference to sessions includes both continuous as well as asynchronous sessions, as appropriate. An asynchronous session could for example include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based messaging. In example embodiments, the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b> dynamically or automatically controls receive diversity by enabling as well as disabling receive diversity within a given session, depending on the detected conditions of the mobile communication device <b>201</b> or the wireless network <b>101</b> (which may change within a given session).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the exemplary sub-modules <b>300</b> will now be described in greater detail. The data transmission quality sub-module <b>302</b> may for example detect data transmission quality of transmissions received and/or sent by the communication subsystem <b>211</b>. In such an embodiment, the communication subsystem <b>211</b> initially operates under the &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity, for example by activating only one antenna element <b>218</b> (while de-activating the remaining antenna elements <b>218</b>). For example, data packet loss may be used as a criteria, wherein receive diversity is enabled when a predetermined percentage of data packet loss is detected. The data transmission quality sub-module <b>302</b> may for example be implemented using a Radio Link Protocol (RLP) module <b>304</b> or a transport layer module <b>306</b>. As is understood in the art, RLP is an automatic repeat request fragmentation protocol used over a wireless (typically cellular) air interface. An RLP detects packet losses and performs retransmissions to bring packet loss down to within a given threshold which may be suitable for some TCP/IP applications. RLP also implements stream fragmentation and reassembly, and sometimes, in-order delivery. The RLP module <b>304</b> is configured to track an amount of packet loss detected by RLP. For example, a user or administrator may set a predetermined threshold such a percentage of packet loss to be detected by the RLP module <b>304</b>, or number of RLP retransmissions within a session or time period. If the percentage of packet loss exceeds the threshold, then instructions or commands are sent to the communication subsystem <b>211</b> to enable receive diversity. Depending on the desired complexity, these thresholds may be computed from the start of the session, or computed based within a specified time period. A user interface (not shown) on the display screen <b>204</b> may also be provided so that the specific threshold or time period may be adjusted or set by a user in real time within a given session (e.g., may be &#x201c;tunable&#x201d; using a sliding scale). In some example embodiments, if the percentage of packet loss returns to within the predetermined threshold with the same session, receive diversity becomes disabled and the communication subsystem <b>211</b> returns to the &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The transport layer module <b>306</b> may for example include the use of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). As is understood in the art, TCP operates in the transport layer and includes mechanisms for accommodating errors or losses in transmitted data packets. For example, TCP detects these errors, requests retransmission of lost packets, rearranges out-of-order packets, and may even assist in minimizing network congestion to reduce the occurrence of other problems. Once the TCP receiver has reassembled the data packet as originally transmitted, it passes that data packet to the appropriate application <b>225</b>. The transport layer module <b>306</b> determines whether the retransmissions or checksum failures of TCP (as would be understood in the art) exceed a predetermined threshold (e.g., by percentage of number of occurrences within a session). If so, receive diversity is activated in the communication subsystem <b>211</b>. In some example embodiments, if the retransmissions or checksum failures returns to within the predetermined threshold with the same session, receive diversity becomes disabled and the communication subsystem <b>211</b> returns to the &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity. Once again, this threshold may be &#x201c;tunable&#x201d; by using a user interface or other mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It can be appreciated that some aspects of the data transmission quality sub-module <b>302</b> are already being implemented by the specific RLP or TCP process. Thus, in some embodiments, the data transmission quality sub-module <b>302</b> reuses and takes advantage of computational processes which are already taking place within the mobile communication device <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The application/process/session sub-module <b>310</b> may be used in dependence of operating wither a specific application <b>225</b> or process implemented by the operating system <b>223</b> or session type. For example, the application/process/session sub-module <b>310</b> may maintain a list of specific applications, processes, or session types for example stored in data <b>228</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Upon activation or execution of a particular application or process, the application/process/session sub-module <b>310</b> determines whether the application, process, or session is included within the list, and if so enables receive diversity. The criteria for inclusion in the list may for example be those applications, processes, or sessions which depend on relatively long or resource-intensive sessions or calls. For example, a teleconference or video streaming application may be included in the list. In another embodiment, the list may be dynamically or automatically generated by the application/process/session sub-module <b>310</b>. For example, when any application, process, or session is being implemented, the application/process/session sub-module <b>310</b> determines or tracks the amount of data being transmitted. If, for a specified application, process or session, the amount of data being transmitted is found to be consistently relatively high, that application, process or session may be included in the list. In another embodiment, the average amount of data being transmitted is tracked and stored for a specified application, process or session. If the average amount of data being transmitted is found to be relatively high, that application, process or session may be included in the list. Similar procedures may be used for removing an application, process or session from the list.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The timer sub-module <b>308</b> is dependent on the duration of, for example, a session, an application, a process, etc. The communication subsystem <b>211</b> initially operates under the &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity, for example by activating only one antenna element <b>218</b>. A timer is initiated based on a predetermined trigger such as the beginning of the session, the execution of an application, process, or session, etc. A predetermined time period is determined. For example, the predetermined time period may be based on a duration wherein it could be presumed that considerable data traffic is being passed for the session. After the predetermined time period has elapsed and the session is still determined to be active, then receive diversity is enabled. Thus, receive diversity may be used to increase the amount of data transmitted when necessary. In some embodiments, the value of the predetermined time period is selected based on typical traffic session durations. For example, for short &#x201c;data burst&#x201d; activity, the predetermined time period is of a suitable time to avoid enabling receive diversity for short data sessions or calls. The predetermined time period may also be selected based on the wireless access technology hosting the data call; for example, a slower technology like 1&#xd7;/CDMA may have a longer timer value than a faster technology such as 1&#xd7;-EVDO. For an always-on application with intermittent short data burst activity, such as email passing, this sub-module <b>308</b> may avoid the frequent use of receive diversity when in relatively stable data link quality coverage.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The external power sub-module <b>312</b> includes enabling of receive diversity when the mobile communication device <b>201</b> is connected to an external power source, such as through serial data port <b>252</b> (e.g., USB). The serial power <b>252</b> may also be used for data communication and recharging of the battery <b>238</b>. When external power is drawn through the serial data port <b>252</b>, receive diversity is enabled as power conservation of the battery <b>238</b> may no longer be desired. In another embodiment, when the battery <b>238</b> or device <b>201</b> is connected to or being recharged using any other power source such as an external power supply (e.g. AC charger, etc.), received diversity is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b> may activate receive diversity depending on any given sub-module <b>300</b>, or in a combination or weighting of specified sub-modules <b>300</b>. Depending on the desired level of restriction, any or all of the sub-modules <b>300</b> (and associated criteria) may be utilized in combination to achieve the level of control, balanced with the level of complexity. For example, the data transmission quality sub-module <b>302</b> may have a relatively higher computational requirement than the timer sub-module <b>308</b>, but may offer a higher degree of accuracy). If the data call is active long enough, then the timer sub-module <b>308</b> will enable receive diversity; however, if any of the data transmission quality sub-module <b>302</b> is satisfied before the timer expires, then receive diversity will be enabled sooner. In another example embodiment, each of the sub-modules <b>300</b> may also operate independently to control (enable and disable) receive diversity. Suitable algorithms may be used to resolve any conflicts, however, in one embodiment any conflicts are resolved in favour of enabling receive diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a method for controlling of receive diversity in the communication subsystem <b>211</b> in accordance with an embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates example operations <b>400</b> for performing the method. In this example embodiment, the operations <b>400</b> are carried out by the R&#xd7;D control module <b>226</b> with the DSP <b>227</b>. The operations <b>400</b> may for example be implemented with respect to a specific session, application or process. In some embodiments, the operations <b>400</b> may be implemented each time a specific session, application or process is initiated, and wherein multiple versions of the operations <b>400</b> run in parallel (e.g., one for each active session, application or process). However, it can further be appreciated that in some embodiments various aspects of the operations <b>400</b> may be performed independently of any specific session, application or process.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At process <b>402</b>, the operations <b>400</b> typically have a default or normal operating state by disabling receive diversity, and for example performing &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity. For example, only one antenna element <b>218</b> may be activated in order to conserve power consumption of the battery <b>238</b>. At process <b>404</b>, a specific application, process or session is initiated. At process <b>406</b>, it is determined whether the specific application, process or session is on a list of specified applications, processes or sessions (the list may be generated, stored and retrieved from data <b>228</b>, as described above with respect to the application/process/session sub-module <b>310</b>). If so, the operations <b>400</b> proceed to process <b>414</b>. At process <b>414</b>, it is determined whether the application, process or session is no longer active and is terminated. If the application, process or session is active and running (if &#x201c;no&#x201d;), receive diversity is enabled at process <b>416</b> (or maintained, if already enabled). If the application, process or session is no longer active and is terminated (if &#x201c;yes&#x201d;), the operations <b>400</b> proceed to process <b>402</b>, once again disabling receive diversity (operating under &#x201c;default&#x201d; signal processing without receive diversity).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring again to process <b>406</b>, if the application, process or session is not on the predetermined list (if &#x201c;no&#x201d;), the operations <b>400</b> proceed to process <b>408</b>, which initializes or resets a timer to zero. At process <b>410</b>, it is determined whether the timer exceeds a predetermined time duration threshold (the choice of which is described in detail above with respect to the timer sub-module <b>308</b>). If the timer has exceeded the predetermined threshold (if &#x201c;yes&#x201d;), the operations <b>400</b> proceed to process <b>414</b>, described above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Still referring to process <b>410</b>, if the timer is still within a predetermined threshold (if &#x201c;no&#x201d;), the operations <b>400</b> proceed to process <b>412</b>, wherein it is determined whether the percentage of packet loss exceeds a predetermined threshold (or whether data quality falls below a predetermined threshold). This may for example be implemented by the data quality sub-module <b>402</b>, described above. If the percentage of packet loss exceeds the threshold (if &#x201c;yes&#x201d;), the operations <b>400</b> proceed to process <b>418</b> to enable receive diversity (or maintain receive diversity if already enabled). Still referring to process <b>412</b>, there may also be dynamic control to also disable receive diversity within a given application, process or session. Thus, if the percentage of packet loss is within the threshold (if &#x201c;no&#x201d;), disable receive diversity (or maintain as disabled if already disabled). The operations may then proceed to process <b>410</b> to once again determine whether the timer exceeds a threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some example embodiments, still referring to process <b>410</b>, to prevent unnecessary toggling, a hysteresis timer (not shown) or merely a timer may be used with respect to a particular criteria. For example, if the data quality is continually considered to be below the threshold (i.e., &#x201c;bad&#x201d; data quality) within another predetermined time period (not shown, but typically less than the timer threshold in process <b>410</b>), the hysteresis timer therefore expires and receive diversity is enabled, and vice versa. Prior to expiration of the hysteresis timer, receive diversity is maintained as disabled (i.e., refrained from being enabled). The hysteresis timer may be weighted or dynamically determined to account for various conditions based on recent activity, such as on the difference of data quality from the threshold, or the amount of time that has passed since the last toggling. If the difference of data quality from the threshold is larger, the hysteresis timer may be shorter (and vice versa). If the amount of time that has passed since the last toggling is larger, the hysteresis timer may be shorter (and vice versa). Combinations or sub-combinations of these factors or other factors may be used to generate the hysteresis timer.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the operations <b>400</b> have been described as occurring in a particular order for exemplary purposes, it will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art that some of the steps may be performed in a different order provided that the result of the changed order of any given step will not prevent or impair the occurrence of subsequent steps. Furthermore, some of the steps described above may be combined in other embodiments, and some of the steps described above may be separated into a number of sub-steps in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments process <b>418</b> transitions directly to decision process <b>414</b>, rather than checking the timer (process <b>410</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Variations of the mobile communication device <b>201</b> are possible. For example, in some example embodiments, the transmitter <b>216</b> may be controlled by the DSP <b>227</b> to perform transmit diversity on the antenna elements <b>220</b> (at least two antenna elements <b>220</b> would be required in this embodiment rather than the only one shown, or may for example share at least some of the same antenna elements <b>218</b> of the receiver <b>214</b>). The mobile communication device <b>201</b> may be configured to enable or disable transmit diversity, depending on the particular application, which may be performed independent or in conjunction with the receive diversity performed by the DSP <b>227</b>. For example, the transmit diversity may be enabled and disabled based on the same criteria as for receive diversity, for example based on certain data operations of the mobile communication device <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to facilitate an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which shows in block diagram form a communication system <b>100</b> in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied.

Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices <b>201</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> employing different example ways of connecting to system <b>100</b>.
