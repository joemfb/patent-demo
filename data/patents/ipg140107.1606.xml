<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to heat dissipation, and particularly, to an airflow guide applied in an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electronic device (for example, a computer server) consists of many parts such as a disk drive, a power supply, a motherboard and components such as memory, IC components, CPU (central processing units), and others, assembled on the motherboard. Heat generated by the electronic components of the electronic device requires prompt dissipation. As performance parameters of the components are increased, the generated heat increases commensurately. Therefore, the electronic device usually includes a fan provided with an airflow guide to dissipate the heat generated by the electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical airflow guide is fixed in a computer case, and a fan is provided with the airflow guide to dissipate excess heat. The airflow guide is disposed on the CPU and the power supply. The airflow guide includes a top cover and two side covers. The side covers extend perpendicularly to opposite ends of the top cover respectively. The side covers and top cover cooperatively define an air inlet adjacent to the CPU and an air outlet adjoining the power supply. Heat dissipation consists of the fan generating airflow into the air inlet and airflow passing through a plurality of electronic components and the convection heat generated by the CPU. However, at this time, the airflow temperature may have been elevated to a point where it no longer is efficient enough in removing the heat generated by the heat dissipating electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of an airflow guide <b>100</b> as disclosed includes a top cover <b>10</b> and two side covers <b>20</b>. The side covers <b>20</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the top cover <b>10</b>. The side covers <b>20</b> and the top cover <b>10</b> cooperatively define a first air inlet <b>31</b> and an air outlet <b>32</b> opposite to the first air inlet <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the top cover <b>10</b> is substantially rectangular, and includes two positioning portions <b>11</b> on opposite sides thereof. In the illustrated embodiment, the two positioning portions <b>11</b> are elongated T-shaped grooves defined on opposite sides of the top cover <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each side cover <b>20</b> includes two base plates <b>21</b>, two sliding plates <b>23</b> and two revolving plates <b>25</b>. Each sliding plate <b>23</b> is slidably connected to the corresponding base plate <b>21</b>. Each revolving plate <b>25</b> is rotatably connected to the corresponding sliding plate <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, each base plate <b>21</b> is substantially rectangular, and includes a receiving portion <b>211</b> and two sliding portions <b>213</b>. The receiving portion <b>211</b> is defined and extended from a side surface of the base plate <b>21</b> to a middle portion of the base plate <b>21</b> for receiving the sliding plate <b>23</b>. The two sliding portions <b>213</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the base plate <b>21</b> adjacent to the receiving portion <b>211</b>. The two sliding portions <b>213</b> slidably engage the positioning portion <b>11</b> of the top cover <b>10</b>. The base plate <b>21</b> further defines two limiting holes <b>215</b> on opposite sides of the base plate <b>21</b> adjacent to sliding portions <b>213</b>, respectively. The limiting holes <b>215</b> communicate with the receiving portion <b>211</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sliding portions <b>213</b> are elongated T-shaped protrusions disposed on the opposite sides of the base plate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each sliding plate <b>23</b> is substantially rectangular, and includes two connecting portions <b>231</b> and two limiting protrusions <b>235</b>. The two connecting portions <b>231</b> are disposed on two adjoining corners of an outer surface of the sliding plate <b>23</b>, respectively. Each connecting portion <b>231</b> defines a shaft hole <b>232</b>. The two limiting protrusions <b>235</b> are disposed on opposite ends of a side surface of the sliding plate <b>23</b> away from the connecting portions <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each revolving plate <b>25</b> is substantially rectangular, and includes two shafts <b>251</b>. The two shafts <b>251</b> are disposed on opposite ends on one side of the revolving plate <b>25</b>, and received in the two shaft hole <b>232</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, during assembly of the airflow-guide <b>100</b>, one of the sliding plates <b>23</b> is received into the receiving portion <b>211</b> of one base plate <b>21</b>. The limiting portions <b>235</b> of the sliding plate <b>23</b> are inserted into the limiting holes <b>215</b> of the base plate <b>21</b>. The shafts <b>251</b> of one revolving plate <b>25</b> are inserted into the shaft holes <b>232</b> of the connecting portions <b>231</b> of the sliding plates <b>23</b>, such that the revolving plate <b>25</b> is rotatably connected to the sliding plate <b>23</b>. By repeating the steps for assembling another base plate <b>21</b>, another sliding plate, and another revolving plate <b>25</b> (a side panel assembly) together, as a result, the sliding plates <b>23</b> of the two sets of side panel assemblies are combined together to form one side cover <b>20</b>. The side cover <b>20</b> thus includes two base plates <b>21</b>, two sliding plate <b>23</b> and two revolving plate <b>25</b>. The two sliding plates <b>23</b> are disposed on a middle portion of the side cover <b>20</b> adjacent to each other. The sliding portions <b>213</b> of the base plate <b>21</b> engages with the limiting portion <b>11</b> of the top cover <b>10</b>, such that the side covers <b>20</b> are fixed to the top cover <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the airflow guide <b>100</b> is provided in an electronic device (not shown), the sliding plate <b>23</b> is partially received in the receiving portion <b>211</b> of the base plate <b>21</b>, such that a second air inlet <b>35</b> is defined in a middle portion of the side cover <b>20</b>. A cooling airflow can enter the second air inlet <b>35</b>, thereby a cooling performance of the airflow guide <b>100</b> is increased. Furthermore, an opening size of the second air inlet <b>35</b> can be changed via the sliding plate <b>23</b> sliding relative to the base plate <b>21</b> according to the desired cooling requirement. The revolving plate <b>25</b> can be rotated relative to the sliding plate <b>23</b> to change an angle between the revolving plate <b>25</b> and the sliding plate <b>23</b>, such that a direction of an airflow entering the second air inlet <b>35</b> can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is to be understand that the sliding portion <b>213</b> can be a sliding groove, correspondingly, the positioning portion <b>11</b> can be a guiding protrusion. The revolving plate <b>25</b> can also be rotatably connected to the sliding plate <b>23</b> by a hinge. At least one of the two side cover <b>20</b> includes the base plate <b>21</b>, the sliding plate <b>23</b> and the revolving plate <b>25</b>. The number of the base plate <b>21</b>, the sliding plate <b>23</b> and the revolving plate <b>25</b> can also be one, or more than three.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Finally, while the present disclosure has been described with reference to particular embodiments, the description is illustrative of the disclosure and is not to be construed as limiting the disclosure. Therefore, various modifications can be made to the embodiments by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.</p>
