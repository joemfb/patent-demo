<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The following relates generally to a buoyant device for teaching and training swimmers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Teaching aides are used to teach a variety of subjects and activities including sports. Swimming is an activity where teaching aides can be of particular utility. Swimming is a common recreational activity as well as a competitive sport. Swimming may be taught formally in a class or may be taught in an informal setting.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Learning to swim may be distressing, difficult and dangerous to a swim trainee due to the perceived or real risk of drowning. Providing a student with an effective teaching aid may reduce the nervousness of the student and help to increase the student's focus. The teaching aid may help the student develop specific techniques of movement in the water and techniques for respiration while swimming. A teaching aid for swimming may also help a swimming student overcome fear and enable a student to assume a position and begin to learn a swimming stroke that may be difficult without a buoyant aid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several types of aides exist to aid students in learning to swim. Examples of these aides include substantially flat flutter boards, which are typically composed of a foam and buoy the student during kicking-type exercises. Flutter boards, for example, may be difficult to grasp while practicing kicking strokes and uncomfortable to rest on. Other flotation devices, for example, pool noodles, do not hold a solid form, are unwieldy when practicing many types of strokes, and are not comfortable when supporting the swimmer's body.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the example embodiments described herein. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the example embodiments described herein may be practised without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the example embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Also, the description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the example embodiments described herein. For example, reference is made to using the teaching aid to perform certain swimming techniques. This application is used as an example and the principles outlined herein are applicable to other swimming techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">To provide helpful instruction, the swimming instructor may provide a clear visual image of proper technique to the swimming trainee. It may be difficult for swim trainees to perform proper techniques using currently available teaching aides, as it may be difficult to find a correct portion of the teaching aid to grasp while performing a swimming technique. Currently available teaching aids may also not be comfortable for a swim trainee. These teaching aids may afford the trainee too much or too little support in the water. Currently available teaching aids may also be difficult to quickly wear or remove and may provide a trainee with too much or insufficient support in the water. Furthermore, teaching aids currently in use may prevent a swim trainee from performing a swim technique in proper form.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a buoyant teaching aid <b>10</b> for training swimmers is shown. The teaching aid <b>10</b> is a substantially U-shaped and comprises two end portions <b>14</b> attached to a front portion <b>12</b>. The front portion <b>12</b> comprises a union <b>20</b> located at the base of the U-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an example embodiment, the union <b>20</b> may be enlarged with respect to the rest of the front portion. The distal end of each of the end portions <b>14</b> tapers to a rounded tip <b>30</b>. Each end portion <b>14</b> also tapers toward an inwardly facing fin <b>32</b>. The end portions <b>14</b> may be thinner than the front portion <b>12</b>. Each of the two end portions <b>14</b> tapers toward the inwardly facing fin <b>32</b> in a smooth transition. Each fin <b>32</b> may be significantly thinner than the outer perimeter of the U-shaped teaching aid <b>10</b>, as is further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Spacing between the inwardly facing fins <b>32</b> is referred to as the fin spacing <b>33</b>. The fin spacing <b>33</b> is sufficiently large to allow the torso of a swim trainee <b>10</b> to pass between the fins. The end portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> define an opening, referred to herein as the central cavity <b>13</b>, which is located between the two end portions <b>14</b>. The central cavity <b>13</b> may be sufficiently large to receive the torso of a swim trainee.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A spacing defined by the distance between a first of the rounded tips <b>30</b> and a second of the rounded tips <b>30</b> is herein after referred to as the tip spacing <b>31</b> and may be sufficiently large to allow a torso of a swim trainee to fit through the tip spacing <b>31</b> and into the central cavity <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the outer perimeter of the teaching aide <b>10</b> corresponds approximately to the shape of a kite K. By way of background, a kite shape refers to a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent equal length sides. A kite shape is used herein as a reference to help describe the shape of the teaching aide <b>10</b>. A union <b>20</b> is located on the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aide <b>10</b>. The union <b>20</b> may be an area of increased thickness in the body of the teaching aide <b>10</b>, and may be adapted to provide a greater level of buoyant force. The union <b>20</b> is located on the first corner k<b>1</b> of kite K. The second corner k<b>2</b> and third corner k<b>3</b> of kite K are located at opposite junctions between the front portion <b>12</b> and each of the end portions <b>14</b>. The fourth corner k<b>4</b> of kite K is located opposite to k<b>1</b> and off of teaching aide <b>10</b>. End portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aide <b>10</b> are tapered to a rounded tip <b>30</b> at the distal end of each end portion <b>14</b>. The fourth corner k<b>4</b> sits approximately at the intersection of lines k<b>2</b>-k<b>4</b> and k<b>3</b>-k<b>4</b> of the kite, which extend down and in the direction of each end portion <b>14</b> past each of the rounded tips <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the tip spacing <b>31</b> and the fin spacing <b>33</b> is narrower than the central cavity <b>13</b>. A swim trainee's torso may be fit through the tip spacing <b>31</b> and the fin spacing <b>33</b> and slide into the central cavity <b>13</b>. The narrower fin spacing <b>33</b> may provide the swim trainee with more stability and may provide support surrounding the swim trainee's torso. Furthermore, by enabling the swim trainee to slide the teaching aid <b>10</b> around the torso, the swim trainee may avoid having to pass the teaching aid <b>10</b> over the swim trainee's head. For the teaching aide to fit the swim trainee's torso, the swim trainee may slide the teaching aid <b>10</b> around the torso by first sliding the torso through the tip spacing <b>31</b> then through the fin spacing <b>33</b> and into the central cavity <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, the fin spacing <b>33</b> is sufficiently narrow to prevent a swim trainee from slipping out of the central cavity while facing toward or away from the union <b>20</b>. The tip spacing <b>31</b>, fin spacing <b>33</b>, size of the central cavity <b>13</b> and other aspects of the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be adapted based on the size of the swim trainee for which the teaching aid <b>10</b> is designed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b>, as was outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is substantially rounded. The union <b>20</b> may be of increased thickness in comparison to the surrounding front portion <b>12</b> to provide a greater level of buoyant force. The teaching aid <b>10</b> may be designed for a swim trainee of a particular age, height, weight, or other measure of body size. The thickness of the union <b>20</b> may be determined as a design consideration based on the weight and size of an age group of swim trainee for which the teaching aid <b>10</b> is designed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The teaching aid <b>10</b> is buoyant due to its characteristic density, which is lower than the density of water. In one example embodiment, the teaching aid <b>10</b> is blow moulded from a polymer. By forming sections of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with higher volume, the buoyancy of various portions of the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be balanced for various aquatic exercises. For example, an area of the teaching aid that supports more body weight may be made to be thicker to provide a higher buoyant force to the swim trainee's body in that area. The thickness of the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be thicker than the two end portions <b>14</b> to allow the front portion <b>12</b> to provide a higher buoyant force to overcome imbalance in the weight applied to each portion of the teaching aid <b>10</b> by the swim trainee.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one example embodiment, the teaching aid <b>10</b> may have tactile features adapted to provide the swim trainee with a stronger grip on certain regions of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. By covering only the regions where a swim trainee is likely to grip with a high friction texture, other areas of the teaching aide <b>10</b> may be provided with a lower friction texture, providing a swim trainee with a more comfortable experience. For example, the surface on the outer perimeter of the teaching aid may comprise a high friction texture whereas the surface on the inner perimeter of the teaching aid and the fins <b>32</b> may comprise a low friction texture. The end portions <b>14</b> may also comprise a high friction texture. The low friction texture may be adapted to come into sliding contact with, for example, the swim trainee's torso, whereas a high friction texture on the outer perimeter of the teaching aid may come into contact primarily with the swim trainee's hands.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">By providing certain parts of the surface of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with a higher friction texture, the swim trainee may feel more comfortable, as the swim trainee may have a better grip of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The higher friction texture may allow swim trainee to explore holding the teaching aid <b>10</b> in various positions and with only one hand without making the swim trainee uncomfortable in the water. A high friction texture may comprise, for example, ridges, bumps, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the inward-facing fins <b>32</b> disposed approximately in the plane of the kite K. The fins <b>32</b> may be designed to provide an ergonomic surface upon which the body of the swim trainee can rest. The fins <b>32</b> may be adapted to also provide a comfortable gripping surface for a variety swim training exercises, as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the teaching aid <b>10</b> is shown in profile view. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the thickness of the thickest portion of the front portion <b>12</b> and the end portions <b>14</b> is approximately uniform along the length of the teaching aid <b>10</b> and tapers towards the rounded tips <b>30</b> at the distal end of the end portions <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, an overhead view of the teaching aid <b>10</b> can be seen. It can be seen that the central cavity <b>13</b> is larger than the tip spacing <b>31</b> and the fin spacing <b>33</b>. With the swim trainee's torso in the central cavity <b>13</b>, the swim trainee may be well supported in the water. The narrower tip spacing <b>31</b> and fin spacing <b>33</b> enable support on almost all sides of the swim trainee's torso. Increased thickness of the union portion <b>20</b>, as described above can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> along A-A is shown. As can be seen, the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be hollow. The teaching aid <b>10</b> may be comprised of a blow-moulded buoyant unitary body. The thickness of the walls may be determined based on the polymer being used and based on the weight or a range of weights of the swim trainee for whom the teaching aid was designed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the location of section B-B, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, is shown. As can be seen from B-B, the cross section of the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> is substantially rounded. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> shows the location of cross section C-C, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>. As can be seen from cross section C-C, particularly when contrasted with section B-B, at the approximate location where the front portion <b>12</b> transitions into the end portions <b>14</b>, the cross section is more elongated. Though the thickness of the thickest point is relatively unchanged with respect to B-B, the section shows a taper toward the inner side of the end portions <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>, the location of the D-D section is shown. The section has been taken approximately in the region where the fins <b>32</b> moved their largest point. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref>, the fins <b>32</b> are significantly thinner than the outer side of the end portions <b>14</b>. The section along lines D-D produces approximately tear-drop shaped cross section. The section shows that the teaching aid <b>10</b> is elongated in the horizontal direction with respect to all of the previous sections of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. It is noteworthy that while the fins <b>32</b> are much thinner than the outer perimeter of the end portions <b>14</b>, they are smoothly tapered. The smooth edges provide a more comfortable surface for the swim trainee.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref>, the location of the E-E section is shown. The sections, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref>, remain approximately tear-drop shaped; however, the fins <b>32</b> are noticeably less elongated than those visible from the D-D section. It is also noteworthy that the thickest portion of the E-E section is thinner than that in the D-D section, as the end portions <b>14</b> are tapering off.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As was mentioned above, the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be designed for various body sizes. For example, a teaching aid <b>10</b> designed for children less than twelve years old may require less buoyancy in comparison with a teaching aid <b>10</b> for adult swimmers. Some swimmers may also require more support while other swimmers may prefer a greater range of motion. Moreover, the size of the central cavity <b>13</b>, the tip spacing <b>31</b> and the fin spacing <b>33</b> typically required for a child less than twelve years old is significantly smaller than the size required for most adults. In general, the size and shape of the teaching aid <b>10</b> can be optimized to suit the swim trainee. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an example teaching aid <b>10</b> is shown. The fins <b>32</b> are large and the fin spacing <b>33</b> is correspondingly small, providing the swim trainee with greater support in all directions. The teaching aid <b>10</b> is also relatively thick, providing a swim trainee with a large buoyant force.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the teaching aid <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is shown in profile. As can be seen from the figure, the teaching aid <b>10</b> is thick over the front portion <b>12</b> as well as a significant fraction of the end portions <b>14</b>. The teaching aid <b>10</b> tapers towards blunt rounded tips <b>30</b>. A teaching aid <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be suitable for a smaller swimmer such as a child, as the central cavity <b>13</b> is small relative to the overall size of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. Moreover, the teaching aid <b>10</b>, provided with relatively large fins <b>32</b>, provides a swim trainee with support on almost all sides, which is beneficial for a novice swim trainee (e.g. a child) who has little experience in the water. Furthermore, the buoyancy of the teaching aid <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> will be substantial due to the relatively thick front portion <b>12</b> and end portions <b>14</b>. A high buoyant force will further assist the swim trainee in staying afloat and remaining calm and comfortable in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a teaching aid <b>10</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is shown. However, the teaching aid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is comparatively thinner, has smaller fins <b>32</b> and a larger central cavity <b>13</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the teaching aid <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in profile, where the thickness of the teaching aid <b>10</b> is visibly less than the thickness of the previously described teaching aid <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The thinner teaching aid <b>10</b> provides less buoyant force, potentially enabling the swim trainee greater freedom of motion at the expense of flotation. The teaching aid <b>10</b> also provides less stability, as the fin spacing <b>33</b> is relatively large. A large fin spacing <b>33</b>, though providing less stability, may allow larger swim trainees to slide the teaching aid <b>10</b> around their torso until they rest in the central cavity <b>13</b>. A larger fin spacing <b>33</b> may also make it easier to slide the teaching aid around the swim trainee's torso. The teaching aid <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may, for example, be better suited to a larger and more confident swimmer that is willing to sacrifice some stability and buoyancy for an increased ease of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In an example embodiment of the teaching aid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the tip spacing <b>31</b> may be approximately 9.5 inches, the fin spacing <b>33</b> may be approximately 7.75 inches, the width <b>42</b> may be approximately 20 inches, and the length may be approximately 20 inches. The union <b>20</b> may measure approximately 4.5 long by 3.45 inches thick. The thickness of the front portion <b>12</b> at reference numeral <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be approximately 2.9 inches. The thickness of the teaching aid at its widest, referred to on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by reference numeral <b>48</b>, is approximately 3.45 inches and the thickness of the teaching aid <b>10</b> at reference numeral <b>46</b> is approximately 2.7 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the same example embodiment, the distance between the points of the kite K of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that corresponds to the perimeter of the teaching aid <b>10</b> are as follows. The distance between points k<b>1</b> and k<b>3</b> and the distance between points k<b>1</b> and k<b>2</b> is approximately 12 inches. The distance between point k<b>4</b> and k<b>3</b> and the distance between points k<b>4</b> and k<b>2</b> are approximately 30 inches. The distance between points k<b>1</b> and k<b>4</b> is approximately 37 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The above measurements are given as example measurements of the approximate measurements of a swim training aid <b>10</b>. The measurements are provided to give a sense of the relative dimensions of the swim training aid <b>10</b>. However, various other dimensions consistent with the principles described herein also fall into the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The teaching aid <b>10</b> may be used in various bodies of water. Typically, swim lessons are taught in swimming pools and hence, the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be suited to the conditions of a swimming pool. Namely, the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be resistant to chlorine, resistant to photodegradation, and resistant to bending and disintegration when being stored and utilized in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The teaching aid <b>10</b> may also have a texture conducive to being easily cleaned to remove foul on the surface of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. This texture may reduce the friction between the skin of the swim trainee and the teaching aid <b>10</b>. As described above, if a higher coefficient of friction is desired between the skin of the swim trainee and the teaching aid <b>10</b>, specific areas of the surface or the entire surface may be provided with a surface treatment to modify the surface texture and increase friction. Similarly, to decrease friction between the swim trainee and the teaching aid <b>10</b>, specific areas or the entire surface of the teaching aid may be treated or coated to reduce friction. A lower coefficient of friction between the hand of the swim trainee and the teaching aid <b>10</b> may make the teaching aid more difficult for the swim trainee to grip in the proper orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The teaching aid <b>10</b> may also be substantially incompressible. A blow-moulded polymer body, for example, meets the aforementioned requirements. In particular, blow-moulded polymer bodies can be made to be resistant to photodegradation and chemical degradation using polymers resistant to UV and chemicals. For example, polymers including high density polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyamides can be made to be structurally sound. Furthermore, due to the lower surface porosity in some blow-moulded polymers in comparison with foams, blow-moulded polymers are more easily cleaned and are less likely to be fouled on the surface, enabling the friction of the swimming aid <b>10</b> to be maintained for longer before cleaning is required. It can be appreciated that the high friction textures (e.g. the bumps, ridges, etc.) can be formed during the blow moulding process. For example, the textures can be part of the mould.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The teaching aid <b>10</b> may, for example, provide swim trainees with more comfort and confidence while practicing swim exercises, allow swim trainees to perform swimming exercises that may be difficult without the aid of a buoyant body, and may assist a trainer in teaching new swim techniques to swim trainees. The teaching aid <b>10</b> may allow for a swim trainee to improve sequentially from simple to more complex swimming techniques. The teaching aid <b>10</b> may be used alone by the swim trainee to practice swim techniques or may be used with a trainer or with teaching material adapted to be used with the teaching aid <b>10</b>. For example, when a swim trainee is learning a new swim technique, a swim trainer may demonstrate the technique to the trainee using the teaching aid <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The teaching aid <b>10</b> may also be provided with swim instructions specifically adapted for the teaching aid <b>10</b>. In particular, the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be provided with swim training instructions, for example, visual materials to aid swim trainees who do not have access to a swim trainer or who would like to practice training without the swim trainer. The visual materials may comprise drawings, flow charts, video, animations or any other representation of instructions to use the teaching aid <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a swim trainee is shown using the teaching aid <b>10</b> to practice the front kick swimming technique in a first example position. The teaching aid <b>10</b> is placed around the torso of the swim trainee and the arms are rested on the end portions of teaching aid <b>10</b> with the swim trainee's elbows at approximately the junctions between the front portion <b>12</b> and the end portions <b>14</b>. The fins <b>32</b> may also serve to support the swim trainee's arms. The surface of the opposite side of the teaching aid <b>10</b> is rested on the back of the swim trainee in the lumbar region. The teaching aid <b>10</b> buoys the upper torso of the swim trainee and allows the swim trainee to focus on leg movements without requiring the swim trainee to engage in any specific arm movements to stay afloat. The legs of the swim trainee are free to be moved upwards and downwards with respect to the water surface to impart the swim trainee with forward thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, shows a second example position for a swim trainee to use a teaching aid <b>10</b> to practice the front kick swimming technique. This position involves, for example, the head of the swim trainee to be submerged for a period of time to practice breathing skills. The teaching aid <b>10</b> lies on the swim trainee in approximately the same position as in the first step, illustrated above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. Specifically, the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> lies over the swim trainee's lumbar and the swim trainee's arms rest on the end portions <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, a swim trainee is shown performing the back kick training exercise using the teaching aid <b>10</b> in a first position. The teaching aid <b>10</b> assists the swim trainee in keeping afloat and respirating without ingesting water while performing the back kick exercise. The swim trainee first positions front portion <b>12</b> of teaching aid <b>10</b> behind the thorax, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, and lies facing upward. The swim trainee's body is supported by the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The swim trainee stretches both arms straight out behind the swim trainee's head while kicking both feet to propel the swim trainee in the direction that the swim trainee's arms are pointing. The end portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> may protrude from the surface of the water. Once both arms are stretched out behind the swim trainee's head, the swim trainee pulls both hands towards the feet in an arcuate path approximately parallel to the water surface and with both palms facing the swim trainee's feet. The swim trainee may then bend both elbows and bringing both arms up to at least the shoulders, and outstretch both arms. The swim trainee may repeat these steps to impart a motive force on the water body with respect to the swim trainee.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A second example back kick position for the teaching aid <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. The swim trainee maintains the kicking throughout the movement of the swim trainee's arms. The front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> remains under the swim trainee. The end portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> may be submerged. Depending on the comfort of the swim trainee, the teaching aid <b>10</b> may also be placed behind the swim trainee's lumbar, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> to support the swim trainee while the swim trainee performs the kicking motion.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Visual representations of instructions to perform the starfish swim exercise is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> are views of the swim trainee performing the starfish exercise while facing upward out of the water. Similarly to the back kick training exercise shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the starfish exercise is performed by placing the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> behind the swim trainee's back, for example, behind the swim trainee's thorax. The end portions of the teaching aid <b>10</b> rise upward and may protrude from the surface of the water. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the swim trainee's arms are then spread away from the swim trainee's body at an angle of, for example, approximately 90 degrees. The swim trainee's legs are also separated and intersect, for example, at an angle of about 45 degrees. The teaching aid <b>10</b> keeps the swim trainee's upper body afloat, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. The swim trainee may balance on the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The swim trainee may move the trainee's arms and/or legs to maintain balance on the teaching aid <b>10</b>. By keeping the upper body afloat, the swim trainee is more able to relax and breathe without ingesting water.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> shows the swim trainee practicing the front starfish from an overhead view. The swim trainee is lying with the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> under the chest or abdomen, depending on the swim trainee's comfort. The end portions may protrude from the surface of the water. The swim trainee stretches the arms out, for example, at approximately a 135 degree angle from the swim trainee's body. The face of the swim trainee is below the surface of the water, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>. The swim trainee may feel more comfortable in this position, as the swim trainee is comfortably supported by the teaching aid <b>10</b> while partially submerged in the water. Similarly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the swim trainee may balance on the teaching aid <b>10</b> using the swim trainee's arms and/or legs.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, which illustrates the swim trainee utilizing the teaching aid <b>10</b> to perform the doggy paddle swim technique. The swim trainee places the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> under the thorax to buoy the swim trainee throughout the exercise. The end portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> may protrude from the surface of the water on each side of the swim trainee's torso. The front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid provides a buoyant force to the swim trainee's torso. The swim trainee then moves both hands in an approximately circular motion, the circle lying in front of the swim trainee and perpendicular to the surface of the water. In this example, the swim trainee's hands are moving approximately 180 degrees apart in the same direction such that when the swim trainee's right hand is at its most distant point from the swim trainee's body, the swim trainee's left hand is at its closest point to the swim trainee's body.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows a swim trainee performing the doggy paddle swim technique using the teaching aid <b>10</b>. However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the swim trainee is paddling in a more hydrodynamic pose, with the head submerged below the surface of the water. In this position, the swim trainee is able to practice submerging the head under the surface of the water, a technique that is required for several other swimming strokes. In either of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> the swim trainee may also be kicking both legs to impart a forward force to the swim trainee with respect to the water.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">A more complex swimming technique practiced using the teaching aid <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the swim trainee is performing the first step of the front crawl technique using the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The swim trainee lays flat at the water's surface with the face submerged in the water and using both feet to kick. In the first step, the swim trainee grasps a first end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the right hand while moving the left hand underneath the swim trainee's body. The swim trainee holds the teaching aid <b>10</b> out in front of the swim trainee's body and in the swim trainee's direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">By exerting a downward force on the teaching aid <b>10</b> using the right arm, the swim trainee may exert an upward force on the swim trainee's torso to keep approximately parallel to the surface of the water. In the second step, the swim trainee continues to move the hand underneath the swim trainee's body in a motion that is approximately parallel with the swim trainee's body and the water's surface, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the second step, the swim trainee's right arm holds the teaching aid <b>10</b> in front of the swimmer's body in approximately the same position as in the first step. As the swim trainee's hand finishes the stroke in the third step, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, the swim trainee's elbow emerges from the water when the swim trainee's hand is in proximity to the swim trainee's hips and reaches for the second end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The swim trainee also releases the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the right hand and begins a stroke with the right hand, mirroring the stroke of the left hand in the first step.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the fourth step, the swim trainee then completes the stroke by swinging the left arm around and grasping the teaching aid <b>10</b> on the second end portion <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>. The swim trainee may begin to exert a forward and downward force on the second end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the left hand while the right hand completes the stroke. The swim trainee releases the teaching aid with the right hand and continues a stroke in steps <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> that mirror the stroke described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>. In the fifth step, the swim trainee, while grasping the second end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the left hand, moves the right arm down the rest of the body, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref> and takes a breath to the right side.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">To complete the stroke, the swim trainee removes the right arm from the water in the sixth step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref> while maintaining a grip on the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The swim trainee then grasps the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the right hand and releases the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the left hand. The swim trainee repeats steps one to seven, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref> to perform the front crawl with assistance from the teaching aid <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14H</figref> shows an overhead view of the swim trainee performing the front crawl swimming technique. As can be seen from the figure, the swim trainee's right arm is grasping at a fin <b>32</b> on a first end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The swim trainee's other hand completes the stroke, as is explained above, before the swim trainee exchanges gripping hands. Note that the swim trainee's arm is approximately completely outstretched and that the fin <b>32</b> provides the swim trainee with an advantageous gripping surface.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The back crawl, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15J</figref> is also carried out by grasping a first end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with a first hand while kicking with both feet and paddling with the second hand. The swim trainee then grips the second end portion <b>14</b> with the second hand and proceeds to use the first hand to perform the stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The back crawl is performed lying face up at the surface of the water. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the swim trainee, in the first step, grasps a first end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the right hand and holds the teaching aid <b>10</b> approximately over the swim trainee's legs. The swim trainee may exert a downward force on the teaching aid <b>10</b> to support and buoy the swim trainee in the water. Concurrently, the swim trainee reaches directly backward, behind the head, with the left hand to place the left hand in a position ready to begin a swim stroke adapted to propel the swim trainee in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows an orthographic projection of the swim trainee performing the first step of the back crawl, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. In the first step, the swim trainee's left arm is extended almost completely backward before the swim trainee begins an arcuate movement with the left hand. The swim trainee maintains a grip on the teaching aid <b>10</b> throughout the back crawl swim exercise, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15J</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the swim trainee is shown in a similar position to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, however, the swim trainee's left arm has commenced an arcuate stroke alongside the swim trainee's body. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the swim trainee maintains his grip on the end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid with the right hand. As is more clear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, which is an orthographic projection similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the swim trainee's left arm has moved away from behind the swim trainee's head to a position along an arcuate path toward the swim trainee's lower body. The swim trainee's hand forces water approximately away from the swim trainee's direction of travel, which consequently provides a force in the swim trainee's direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>, the swim trainee continues the stroke with the left hand while gripping the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the right hand. However, the swim trainee begins to release the first end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the right hand and reaches for the second end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the left hand. When the swim trainee's left hand is approximately aligned with the swim trainee's shoulders, the swim trainee's left arm is outstretched from the swim trainee's body at approximately half the stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Once the swim trainee has completed the stroke with the left arm, the swim trainee grips the second end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the left hand and releases the first end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the right hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15G</figref>. The teaching aid <b>10</b> is maintained approximately over the swim trainee's legs or in proximity to the water over swim trainee's legs. The swim trainee then brings the right arm up and out of the water, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15H</figref> before returning to the mirror position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, wherein the swim trainee's right arm is outstretched behind the swim trainee while the left arm grips the second end portion <b>14</b> of teaching aid <b>10</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15J</figref>, the swim trainee's arm is in the mirror position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>. The swim trainee then repeats the process as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15J</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15K</figref> shows an overhead view of the swim trainee gripping a first end portion <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> with the left hand. The tips <b>30</b> of the end portions <b>14</b> are approximately at the swim trainee's waist. The swim trainee may make use of the fins <b>32</b> if the swim trainee finds them to provide an advantageous gripping surface.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Another stroke performed while the swim trainee is lying face up near the surface of the water is the elementary back stroke. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, in the first step of the elementary back stroke, the swim trainee is supported by the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> is placed under the lumbar of the swim trainee and both of the swim trainee's arms lay approximately parallel to the swim trainee's body and are outside the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The teaching aid <b>10</b> may protrude form the surface of the water. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> it can be seen that the teaching aid <b>10</b> buoys the swim trainee's body close to the surface of the water. As is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the swim trainee's legs begin the stroke extended and approximately parallel, without the knees significantly bent.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As the swim trainee progresses to the second step of the elementary back stroke, the swim trainee moves each hand toward each shoulder, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>. The swim trainee bends both elbows downwards, as can be seen from the side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</figref>. Both of the swim trainee's legs are bent at the knees and separated, forming an approximately 150 degree angle at the knees, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>. The swim trainee's body continues to be supported by the teaching aid <b>10</b>, with the swim trainee's torso in the central cavity <b>13</b> and the swim trainee's face out of the water, enabling the swim trainee to breathe throughout the elementary back stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the third step of the elementary back stroke swim technique, the swim trainee, once having brought both hands to approximately inline with the shoulders, extends both hands outward, as is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref>. As can be seen from the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16F</figref>, the swim trainees elbows are brought closer in line with the swim trainee's shoulders. The swim trainee's knees are bent at approximately 90 degrees. The legs of the swim trainee are further separated in comparison with step two of the elementary back stroke, as is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref>. Similarly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, it can be seen that the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid lies beneath the swim trainee, with the swim trainee's torso lying in the central cavity <b>13</b>. The end portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> may protrude from the surface of the water. The positioning of the teaching aid <b>10</b> relative the swim trainee is consistent for the entire elementary back stroke. The teaching aid <b>10</b> buoys the body of the swim trainee to a point where the swim trainee does not need to worry about sinking under the surface of the water.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In step four of the elementary back stroke, the swim trainee's arms are approximately fully extended and both hands may be inline with the swim trainee's shoulders, as is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16G</figref>. The swim trainee's hands may also be slightly higher than the swim trainee's shoulders, for example, the swim trainee's hands may be inline with the swim trainee's head. The swim trainee's legs are also approximately fully extended and form an angle of about 45 degrees. As is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16H</figref>, the teaching aid <b>10</b> remains under the swim trainee to support the swim trainee. The swim trainee's body is approximately parallel with the water surface.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Once the swim trainee reaches the fourth step of the elementary back stroke, the swim trainee pivots both arms to a position next to his sides while maintaining both hands in a paddle shape. This motion imparts a momentum to the water opposite to the swim trainee's direction of travel. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16I</figref>, which shows the fifth step of the elementary back stroke, the swim trainee has pivoted both arms approximately halfway to being parallel with the swim trainee's torso. Similarly, the swim trainee's legs are brought together and now form an approximately 30 degree angle. As is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16J</figref>, the swim trainee remains approximately parallel to the surface of the water.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16K</figref>, the swim trainee is shown with both arms parallel to the swim trainee's torso. Similarly, the swim trainee's legs are parallel and outstretched. The teaching aid <b>10</b>, remains in the same position as it had throughout the stroke, namely with the union <b>20</b> of the front portion <b>12</b> behind the swim trainee's lumbar. Throughout the exercise, the end portions <b>14</b> may rise above the surface of the water. The swim trainee's arms remain on the outside of the teaching aid <b>10</b> while the swim trainee's torso lies in the U-shaped portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16L</figref> shows the swim trainee after having completed one period of the elementary back stroke. To continue movement in the direction of the swim trainee's head, the swim trainee repeats each step of the elementary back stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the swim trainee is shown in the first step of practicing the breaststroke. The swim trainee begins by lying parallel to the surface of the water with the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> under the centre of the swim trainee's chest. The torso of the swim trainee sits in central cavity <b>13</b>. The end portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aid may protrude from the surface of the water. The positioning of the teaching relative to the swim trainee's body does not change for the duration of the stroke. The swim trainee's arms are outstretched and approximately parallel in front of the swim trainee's face. The palms of the swim trainee's hands are facing outward and the hands are parallel and in proximity, as can be seen from the orthogonal view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. The swim trainee is supported by the teaching aid <b>10</b>; however, the swim trainee's face is submerged in the water to provide a hydrodynamic form. The swim trainee's legs are outstretched and parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> shows the swim trainee in the second step of the breaststroke. The swim trainee has pivoted both arms in approximately 45 degrees of an arc, while maintaining paddle shapes with each hand. The swim trainee's legs remain in generally the same position as in the first step of the breaststroke. As is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>, the swim trainee's arms remain approximately parallel to the surface of the water. The third step of the breaststroke is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>. The swim trainee continues to pivot both arms in an arcuate motion about the shoulders, with the upper arms having travelled approximately 60 degrees of an arc in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>. The swim trainee's legs are approximately in the same relative position as in steps one and two, however, the swim trainee has pivoted both forearms to moved approximately downward in the water while continuing to pivot both arms backward, as is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17G</figref>, where the swim trainee is performing the fourth step of the breaststroke. The swim trainee has pivoted both arms through at least about 90 degrees of the arc about the shoulders and has brought both hands inwards and approximately underneath the swim trainee's body. The swim trainee's hands may come together below the swim trainee's chin. The swim trainee's knees are slightly bent and the swim trainee has begun to draw both feet in towards the torso. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17H</figref>, the swim trainee's hands are in relatively close proximity beneath the swim trainee's torso. It can be seen that for the first time since beginning the breaststroke, the swim trainee's face is above water. It is during this step that the swim trainee is able to inhale. The swim trainee may exhale throughout the remainder of the steps.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In step five, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17I</figref>, the swim trainee's feet have been brought in proximity to the swim trainee's buttocks and both knees are bent at least about 90 degrees. The swim trainee's arms are moving forward with the swim trainee's elbows angled outward in the first step to returning the swim trainee's arms to the position of step one. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17J</figref>, the swim trainee's legs are separated by about 45 degrees and the swim trainee's hands extend to a point. The swim trainee's face is also re-submerged in the water. This position provides the swim trainee with a more hydrodynamic form while being propelled forward through the water.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the final and sixth step of the backstroke, the swim trainee has begun to kick both legs together, which imparts the water between the legs with a generally backward momentum and propels the swim trainee forward. As is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17K</figref>, the swim trainee's legs are bent at the knees at an approximately 90 degree angle and are returning to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. The swim trainee's arms are also extending forward to return to the position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17L</figref>, during the sixth step of the breaststroke, the swim trainee's feet are angled outward and are spaced further apart than the width of the swim trainee's body.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the swim trainee is shown practicing the dolphin kick with help from the buoyancy of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. The swim trainee's legs and feet are held together and the teaching aid <b>10</b> is placed such that the front portion <b>12</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> lies over the spine of the lumbar portion of the swim trainee. The end portions <b>14</b> each extend under the swim trainee's shoulders and arms, while the fins <b>32</b> support the swim trainee's arms. The swim trainee's upper torso lies in the central cavity <b>13</b> of the U-shaped portion of the teaching aid with the swim trainee's head in approximately the plane of the teaching aid <b>10</b>, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The first step of the dolphin kick is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, which comprises the swim trainee bending both knees in unison to apply an upward and rearward momentum to the water above the swim trainee's feet. The swim trainee's arms remain supported by the fins <b>32</b> of the end portions <b>14</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b>. In the second step of the dolphin kick, the swim trainee straightens both knees, applying a downward and rearward momentum to the water. The swim trainee also bends at the waist, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> to form an approximately 150 degree angle between the legs and the torso.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, the swim trainee can be seen using the teaching aid <b>10</b> as a buoyancy device while practicing the eggbeater technique. The swim trainee is supported by placing both arms on the surface of the teaching aid <b>10</b> at approximately the junctions of the front portion <b>12</b> and each of the endpoints <b>14</b>. The swim trainee may also place both arms on any other portion of the teaching aid <b>10</b> that is comfortable. For example, the swim trainee may position both arms on the end portions <b>14</b>. The swim trainee sits in the central cavity <b>13</b> of the teaching aid <b>10</b> and is thus able to hold onto any portion of the teaching aid <b>10</b> if the swim trainee becomes tired or nervous.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The teaching aid <b>10</b> allows the swim trainee's head to remain above the water for easier respiration before the swim trainee's eggbeater technique is sufficient to support the swim trainee completely. To perform the eggbeater technique, the swim trainee is in a sitting position with a straight back. The swim trainee's thighs are approximately parallel to the surface of the water while the swim trainee's lower legs and feet rotate about the knees. The swim trainee's lower legs and feet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, pivot about the knees in an approximately circular pattern. The swim trainee pivots both feet continuously and alternately about the knees in an approximately circular approximately 45 degrees from the surface of the water body, the right foot moving in an opposing and intersecting circular path in relation to the left foot. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the first leg (e.g. the left leg) rotates in a clockwise direction while the second leg (e.g. the right leg) rotates in a counter clockwise direction. The legs do not make contact, as the first leg is close to the axis of the swim trainee's torso while the second leg is extended away from the axis of the swim trainee's torso and vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In one example, a teaching aid for use in swim training is provided. The teaching aid may comprise a unitary blow-moulded buoyant body that is approximately U-shaped having an outer perimeter approximately conforming to the shape of a kite.

The second hand is moved in an arcuate movement approximately parallel to the surface of the water and toward the swimmer's hip. The grip of the first hand on the first end portion is released and the swimmer grips a second end portion of the teaching aid with the second hand in an outstretched position approximately adjacent to the swimmer's hips. The swimmer's first hand is moved behind the head and the arm to which the second hand is connected is almost completely extended. The first hand is moved in an arcuate movement approximately parallel to the surface of the water and toward the swimmer's hip and the grip of the second hand on the second end portion is released. The preceding steps may be repeated to impart a motive force on the water with respect to the swimmer.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The example method may further comprise orienting the union under the swimmer's back, lying the swimmer in the water facing upward and placing both hands of the swimmer near the hips of the swimmer. The legs of the swimmer may be extended to be approximately parallel with the swimmer's knees and bending the knees. The hands of the swimmer may be moved in proximity to their respective armpits of the swimmer in a motion substantially parallel to the sides of the swimmer's torso. The swimmer's elbows may be bent downwards and the swimmer's legs may be bent at the knees and separated. Both hands may be extended outwards from the swimmer's torso and substantially parallel to the surface of the water towards a position wherein both hands are aligned with both of the swimmer's shoulders. Both knees may then be bent to approximately 90 degrees. Both legs may then be extended to be approximately straight and to form an angle of approximately 45 degrees therebetween. The swimmer's hands may be moved in an arcuate motion towards the swimmer's hips with both arms remaining substantially outstretched. The swimmer's legs may be aligned and approximately parallel to the surface of the water. The preceding steps may be repeated to impart a motive force on the water with respect to the swimmer.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The example method may further comprise orienting the union under the swimmer's chest, lying the swimmer in the water facing downward and approximately parallel to the surface of the water and outstretching both arms of the swimmer to be approximately parallel and in close proximity with one another in front of the swimmer's face. The legs of the swimmer may then be outstretched to be approximately parallel and in close proximity with one another. The swimmer's hands may be separated and the arms may be pivoted approximately 45 degrees. The forearms of the swimmer may be pivoted downwards. The hands of the swimmer may then be brought inwards and into close proximity approximately underneath the swimmer's chin. The swimmer's knees may then be bent and the swimmer's legs separated to draw both feet in towards the swimmer's buttocks. The swimmer's hands may be brought together and both of the swimmer's arms may be brought forwards with elbows angled outward. The swimmer's legs may be extended maintaining a separation therebetween. The legs may then be brought together in close proximity. The preceding steps may be repeated to impart a motive force on the water with respect to the swimmer.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In another example method performed using a teaching aid, the teaching aid comprises a unitary buoyant body that is approximately U-shaped having an outer perimeter approximately conforming to the shape of a kite. The body of the teaching aid defines an opening adapted to receive a torso of a swimmer and comprises a pair of end portions joined at a union to form a U-shape, each end portion being tapered to a tip. The end portions further comprise inward-facing fins disposed approximately in the plane of the kite. The method comprises placing the swimmer's torso inside the opening, orienting the union on the swimmer's upper back and placing a first arm of the swimmer on a first fin and a second arm of the swimmer on the second fin, lying the swimmer in the water facing downward. The swimmer's legs and the swimmer's feet are brought in contact and both knees of the swimmer in unison to apply an upward and rearward moment to the water above the swimmer's feet. The swimmer's knees may then be straightened to apply a downward momentum to the water. The swimmer's waist may be bent to form an approximately 150 degree angle between the legs and the torso. The preceding steps may be repeated to impart a motive force on the water with respect to the swimmer.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In another example method performed using a teaching aid, the teaching aid comprises a unitary buoyant body that is approximately U-shaped having an outer perimeter approximately conforming to the shape of a kite. The body of the teaching aid defines an opening adapted to receive a torso of a swimmer and comprises a pair of end portions joined at a union to form a U-shape, each end portion being tapered to a tip. The end portions further comprise inward-facing fins disposed approximately in the plane of the kite. The method comprises placing the swimmer's torso inside the opening, orienting the union on the swimmer's upper back, the swimmer being oriented perpendicular to the water surface. Each of the swimmer's arms are supported by a fin of the teaching aid. The swimmer continuously and alternately pivoting both of the feet about the knees in an approximately circular approximately 45 degrees from the surface of the water, the right foot of the swimmer moving in an opposing and intersecting circular path in relation to the left foot of the swimmer.</p>
