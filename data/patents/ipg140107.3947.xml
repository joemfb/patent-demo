<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A comparison section includes an analog signal to be subjected to AD conversion to a reference signal that increases or decreases with the passage of time, and terminates a comparison process at a timing at which the reference signal has satisfied a predetermined condition for the analog signal. A first count section counts a clock signal of a predetermined frequency as a count clock and outputs a count value. A latch section latches the count value output from the first count section. A latch control section enables the latch section at a first timing related to an end of the comparison process and causes the latch section to execute a latch operation at a second timing delayed by a predetermined time from the first timing.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-132197, filed on Jun. 14, 2011, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an analog-to-digital (AD) conversion circuit and a solid-state imaging apparatus having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As an example of an AD conversion circuit according to the related art, a configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is well known (for example, see Takayuki Toyama et al., &#x201c;A 17.7 Mpixel 120 fps CMOS Image Sensor with 34.8 Gb/s Readout,&#x201d; Sony, Kanagawa, Japan ISSCC2011/SESSION23/IMAGE SENSORS/23.11). First, the configuration and operation of the AD conversion circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a configuration of a single-slope AD conversion circuit according to the related art. The AD conversion circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> includes a first count section <b>1018</b>, a second count section <b>1101</b>, a latch section <b>1108</b>, a comparison section <b>1109</b>, and a buffer circuit BUF.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first count section <b>1018</b> counts a clock signal CLK having a predetermined frequency as a count clock, and outputs binary count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b>. The comparison section <b>1109</b> has a voltage comparator COMP into which an analog signal Signal and a ramp wave Ramp are input. The analog signal Signal serves as an AD conversion target. The ramp wave Ramp decreases with the passage of time. The comparison section <b>1109</b> outputs a comparison output CO based on a result obtained by comparing the analog signal Signal to the ramp wave Ramp. In the comparison section <b>1109</b>, a time interval (the magnitude of a time axis direction) corresponding to the analog signal Signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The latch section <b>1108</b> latches logical states of the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>1018</b>. In this example, the latch section <b>1108</b> includes latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of 5 bits. The count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> are input from the first count section <b>1018</b> to the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b>. The second count section <b>1101</b> counts an output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> to which the count value D<b>4</b> corresponding to a most significant bit (MSB) among the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>1018</b> is input as a count clock. In this example, the second count section <b>1101</b> includes a 7-bit counter circuit (not illustrated). The buffer circuit BUF is an inverting buffer circuit that inverts an input signal and outputs the inverted signal. Herein, a configuration of the inverting buffer circuit is used in order to facilitate the understanding of embodiments of the present invention as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an operation of the AD conversion circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Hereinafter, the operation of the AD conversion circuit according to the related art will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">First, after an input of the analog signal Signal to be subjected to AD conversion has been stabilized, the ramp wave Ramp, which decreases with the passage of time, the ramp wave Ramp is input to one input terminal of the comparator <b>1109</b>. The comparator <b>1109</b> compares the ramp wave Ramp to the analog signal Signal. Meanwhile, the first count section <b>1018</b> counts the clock signal CLK, for example, in a count-up mode, and outputs the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b>. In addition, the second count section <b>1101</b> counts the output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>1108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The comparison section <b>1109</b> compares the ramp wave Ramp to the analog signal Signal, and inverts the comparison output CO at a timing at which voltages of the ramp wave Ramp and the analog signal Signal have been approximately consistent (a first timing). After the comparison output CO has been buffered by the buffer circuit BUF, a latch signal Hold is output from the buffer circuit BUF (a second timing). On the basis of the latch signal Hold, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>1108</b> are in a disable state, so that logical states corresponding to the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> are latched in the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>1108</b>. When the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>1108</b> is stopped, the second count section <b>1101</b> latches count values D<b>5</b> to D<b>11</b> at that time. Thereby, digital data DOUT[<b>11</b>:<b>0</b>] corresponding to the analog signal Signal is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the AD conversion circuit of the related art described above, because the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> constituting the latch section <b>1108</b> continuously operate during a period of a time interval, a value of current consumed by the latch section <b>1108</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the AD conversion circuit of the related art, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> constituting the latch section <b>1108</b> constantly operate in a period from a start time of a comparison by the comparison section <b>1109</b> to the second timing. In general, because an output (particularly, a count value D<b>0</b> of a least significant bit (LSB)) from the first count section <b>1018</b> has a high frequency, current consumed by the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> constituting the latch section <b>1108</b> is high.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Here, an imager used in a digital still camera (DSC) or the like is considered as a specific example using the AD conversion circuit of the related art. Specifically, specs in which the number of pixels is 2000&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>and a frame rate is 120 frames/sec are assumed. Assuming that an AD conversion circuit is arranged for each column of a pixel array, a pixel array of 2000&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>pixels is designated as 4000 rows&#xd7;5000 columns in length and width in order to facilitate description and a blanking period is absent for further simplicity, the number of rows from which pixel signals are read per second is as follows.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>120 frames/sec&#xd7;4000 rows/frame=480K lines/sec<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">That is, a read rate of one row becomes 480 KHz. For example, for 10-bit resolution AD conversion, a count value is output from the first count section <b>1018</b> at a frequency of about 480 MHz, which is 1024 times greater than the read rate of one row. Further, for example, for 12-bit resolution AD conversion, a count value is output from the first count section <b>1018</b> at a frequency of about 2 GHz, which is 4096 times greater than the read rate of one row. In this case, assuming that a consumption current value of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> constituting the latch section <b>1108</b> is 100 &#x3bc;A/column, a consumed current value for 5000 columns becomes as follows.

</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, if the number of pixels, a frame rate, and resolution increase, a count value is output at a frequency of more than 2 GHz, which is a frequency estimated as described above, and the consumption current further increases.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, the first embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a configuration of an AD conversion circuit according to the present embodiment. The AD conversion circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a first count section <b>18</b>, a second count section <b>101</b>, a latch control section <b>105</b>, a latch section <b>108</b>, and a comparison section <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first count section <b>18</b> counts a clock signal CLK having a predetermined frequency as a count clock, and outputs binary count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b>. The comparison section <b>109</b> has a voltage comparator COMP into which an analog signal Signal and a ramp wave Ramp are input. The analog signal Signal serves as an AD conversion target. The ramp wave Ramp decreases with the passage of time. The comparison section <b>109</b> outputs a comparison output CO based on a result obtained by comparing the analog signal Signal to the ramp wave Ramp.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The latch section <b>108</b> latches logical states of the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b>. In the present embodiment, the latch section <b>108</b> includes latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of 5 bits. The count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> are input from the first count section <b>18</b> to the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b>. The second count section <b>101</b> has a counter circuit CNT that counts an output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> to which the count value D<b>4</b> corresponding to an MSB among the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> is input as a count clock. In the present embodiment, the counter circuit CNT includes a 7-bit counter circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows configurations of counter circuits including the first count section <b>18</b> and the second count section <b>101</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first count section <b>18</b> has counter circuits C_<b>0</b> to C_<b>4</b> that output the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> constituting less significant bits of digital data. The count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>3</b> of the counter circuits C_<b>0</b> to C_<b>3</b> are output to the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. The count value D<b>4</b> of the counter circuit C_<b>4</b> is output to the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>, and the output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> is further output to the second count section <b>101</b>. The second count section <b>101</b> has counter circuits C_<b>5</b> to C_<b>11</b> that output count values D<b>5</b> to D<b>11</b> constituting more significant bits of the digital data. Here, the counter circuits C_<b>5</b> to C_<b>11</b> are assumed to be binary counter circuits each having a latch function of holding a logical state.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The latch control section <b>105</b> generates a control signal for controlling an operation of the latch section <b>108</b>. The latch control section <b>105</b> includes an inverting delay circuit DLY, AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> and AND circuit AND_<b>1</b>. The comparison output CO from the comparison section <b>109</b> is input to the inverting delay circuit DLY. The inverting delay circuit DLY inverts and delays the comparison output CO, and outputs a delayed comparison output xCOD. The comparison output CO from the comparison section <b>109</b> and the delayed comparison output xCOD from the inverting delay circuit DLY are input to the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b>. The AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> outputs a control signal Hold_L by carrying out a logical AND operation on the comparison output CO and the delayed comparison output xCOD. A control signal Enable and the delayed comparison output xCOD from the inverting delay circuit DLY are input to the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b>. The AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> outputs a control signal Hold_C by carrying out a logical AND operation on the control signal Enable and the delayed comparison output xCOD.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although details will be described later, the latch control section <b>105</b> enables the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> at a comparison process start time in the comparison section <b>109</b> according to the above-described configuration. Thereafter, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are enabled at a first timing at which the comparison output CO is inverted. Further, the latch control section <b>105</b> causes the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> to execute latch operations at a second timing delayed by a predetermined time from the first timing.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the control signal Hold_L from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in an enable state and directly output the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>3</b> from the first count section <b>18</b>. In addition, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> are in a disable state when the control signal Hold_L from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> transitions from a high level to a low level. At this time, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> latch logical states corresponding to the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>3</b> from the first count section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, when the control signal Hold_C from the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the enable state and directly outputs the count value D<b>4</b> from the first count section <b>18</b>. In addition, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the disable state when the control signal Hold_C from the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> transitions from the high level to the low level. At this time, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> latches a logical state corresponding to the count value D<b>4</b> from the first count section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The above-described configuration is an example, and it is possible to appropriately change the number of bits of a counter circuit constituting the first count section <b>18</b> or the second count section <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, an operation of the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an operation of the AD conversion circuit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, symbols D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> indicate count values of the first count section <b>18</b>, and symbols Q<b>0</b> to Q<b>4</b> indicate outputs of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. First, after the input of the analog signal Signal to be subjected to AD conversion has been stabilized, the ramp wave Ramp, which decreases with the passage of time, the ramp wave Ramp is provided to one input terminal of the comparison section <b>109</b>. The comparison section <b>109</b> compares the ramp wave Ramp to the analog signal Signal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Meanwhile, the first count section <b>18</b> counts a clock signal CLK, for example, in the count-up mode, and outputs the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b>. In addition, the second count section <b>101</b> counts the output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. Although it is preferable that the timing of a count operation start in the first count section <b>18</b> and the second count section <b>101</b> be approximately simultaneous with the timing of an output start of the ramp wave Ramp, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While a voltage of the ramp wave Ramp is greater than the voltage of the analog signal Signal, the comparison output CO of the comparison section <b>109</b> is low. Thus, the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is low. Accordingly, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and their operations are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, because the delayed comparison output xCOD of the inverting delay circuit DLY of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high and the control signal Enable is high, the control signal Hold_C output from the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high. Thus, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the enable state, and directly outputs the count value D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b>. The second count section <b>101</b> performs a count operation based on the output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Subsequently, the comparison output CO is inverted when the voltage of the ramp wave Ramp has been approximately consistent with the voltage of the analog signal Signal (the first timing). Because the delayed comparison output xCOD of the inverting delay circuit DLY of the latch control section <b>105</b> is still high immediately after the comparison output CO has been inverted and the comparison output CO becomes high, the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes high. Thereby, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Because the delayed comparison output xCOD becomes low when a time consistent with a delay time of the inverting delay circuit DLY of the latch control section <b>105</b> has elapsed from the first timing, the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes low. Thereby, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and latch the logical states corresponding to the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>3</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> (the second timing).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, because the delayed comparison output xCOD becomes low, the control signal Hold_C output from the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes low. Thereby, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the disable state and latches the logical state corresponding to the count value D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> at the second timing. When the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is stopped (latched), the second count section <b>101</b> latches the count values D<b>5</b> to D<b>11</b> at that time.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Digital data DOUT[<b>11</b>:<b>0</b>] corresponding to the analog signal Signal is obtained according to count values latched by the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> and count values latched by the counter circuits C_<b>5</b> to C_<b>11</b> of the second count section <b>101</b>. The obtained digital data DOUT[<b>11</b>:<b>0</b>] is output to a subsequent output section (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Because the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> are operable only in a period from the first timing to the second timing in the above-described operation, it is possible to reduce consumption current in the latch section <b>108</b>. Accordingly, low consumption current of the AD conversion circuit is possible. In addition, when the first count section <b>18</b> includes, for example, a synchronous counter, it is possible to reduce a circuit scale as compared to the case in which only the first count section <b>18</b> performs a count operation as in a sixth embodiment to be described later if the second count section <b>101</b> includes for example, an asynchronous counter having a circuit scale smaller than that of the synchronous counter.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although a configuration is made to implement low consumption current by controlling operations of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> constituting the latch section <b>108</b> in the embodiment, a configuration may be made, for example, to control the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>2</b>. In addition, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of a configuration of an AD conversion circuit according to the present embodiment. Hereinafter, parts different from those of the first embodiment will mainly be described. In this embodiment, a configuration of a latch control section <b>105</b> is different from that of the first embodiment. Because configurations other than the latch control section <b>105</b> are the same as in the first embodiment, a description thereof is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The latch control section <b>105</b> includes an inverting delay circuit DLY, AND circuit AND_<b>0</b>, AND circuit AND_<b>1</b>, flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> and flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b>. A comparison output CO from the comparison section <b>109</b> is input to the inverting delay circuit DLY. The inverting delay circuit DLY inverts and delays the input comparison output CO, and outputs a delayed comparison output xCOD.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The delayed comparison output xCOD from the inverting delay circuit DLY is input to the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b>. The flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> outputs the delayed comparison output xCOD as a synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D in synchronization with a clock signal CLK. The comparison output CO from the comparison section <b>109</b> is input to the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b>. The flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> outputs the comparison output CO as a synchronized comparison output CO_D in synchronization with the clock signal CLK.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D from the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> and the synchronized comparison output CO_D from the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> are input to the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b>. The AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> outputs a control signal Hold_L by carrying out a logical AND operation on the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D and the synchronized comparison output CO_D. A control signal Enable and the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D from the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> are input to the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b>. The AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> outputs a control signal Hold_C by carrying out the logical AND operation on the control signal Enable and the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D. Although the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D and the synchronized comparison output CO_D are caused to be synchronized with the clock signal CLK in the present embodiment, the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D and the synchronized comparison output CO_D may be caused to be synchronized with an inverted clock signal xCLK to which the clock signal CLK has been inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, an operation of the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an operation of the AD conversion circuit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, symbols D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> indicate count values of the first count section <b>18</b>, and symbols Q<b>0</b> to Q<b>4</b> indicate outputs of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. First, after an input of an analog signal Signal to be subjected to AD conversion has been stabilized, a ramp wave Ramp, which decreases with the passage of time, is provided to one input terminal of the comparison section <b>109</b>. The comparison section <b>109</b> compares the ramp wave Ramp to the analog signal Signal.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Meanwhile, the first count section <b>18</b> counts the clock signal CLK, for example, in the count-up mode, and outputs the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b>.

Although it is preferable that the timing of a count operation start in the first count section <b>18</b> and the second count section <b>101</b> be approximately simultaneous with the timing of an output start of the ramp wave Ramp, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">While a voltage of the ramp wave Ramp is greater than a voltage of the analog signal Signal, the comparison output CO of the comparison section <b>109</b> is low. Because the comparison output CO is low, the synchronized comparison output CO_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is low. Thus, the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is low. Thereby, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and their operations are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">On the other hand, the delayed comparison output xCOD of the inverting delay circuit DLY of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high, and the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high. In addition, the control signal Enable is high. Thus, the control signal Hold_C output from the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high. Thereby, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the enable state, and directly outputs the count value D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b>. The second count section <b>101</b> performs a count operation based on the output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Subsequently, the comparison output CO is inverted when the voltage of the ramp wave Ramp has been approximately consistent with the voltage of the analog signal Signal. Because the comparison output CO becomes high, the synchronized comparison output CO_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes high (a first timing). In addition, the delayed comparison output xCOD of the inverting delay circuit DLY of the latch control section <b>105</b> is still high immediately after the comparison output CO has been inverted, and the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is still high. Thereby, because the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes high, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When a time consistent with a sum of a delay time of the inverting delay circuit DLY of the latch control section <b>105</b> and a delay time of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> has elapsed from the first timing, the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D becomes low, so that the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes low. Thereby, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and latch logical states corresponding to the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>3</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> (a second timing).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, because the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D becomes low, the control signal Hold_C output from the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes low. Thereby, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the disable state, and latches a logical state corresponding to the count value D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> at the above-described second timing. The second count section <b>101</b> latches the count values D<b>5</b> to D<b>11</b> at that time when the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is stopped (latched).</p>

The obtained digital data DOUT[<b>11</b>:<b>0</b>] is output to a subsequent output section (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Because the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> are operable only in a period from the first timing to the second timing in the above-described operation, it is possible to reduce current consumption in the latch section <b>108</b>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, it is possible to cause the control signals Hold_L and Hold_C to be synchronized with the clock signal CLK and cause latch timings of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> to be synchronized with the clock signal CLK by arranging the flip-flop circuits DFF_<b>0</b> and DFF_<b>1</b>.

The flip-flop circuit XDFF inverts and delays the input comparison output CO, and outputs a delayed comparison output xCOD in synchronization with a clock signal CLK.

Although only part of wirings of the clock signal CLK and the inverted clock signal xCLK within the latch control section <b>105</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, both the clock signal CLK and the inverted clock signal xCLK are input to the flip-flop circuits XDFF, DFF_<b>0</b>, and DFF_<b>1</b> as described above.</p>

In this embodiment, a configuration of a latch control section <b>105</b> is different from that of the third embodiment. Because configurations other than the latch control section <b>105</b> are the same as in the third embodiment, a description thereof is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The latch control section <b>105</b> includes AND circuit AND_<b>0</b>, AND circuit AND_<b>1</b>, flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b>, flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b>, flip-flop circuit XDFF, flip-flop circuit XDFF_<b>0</b>, and flip-flop circuit XDFF_<b>1</b>. A control signal Hold_L is input from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> to the flip-flop circuit XDFF_<b>0</b>.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, the sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example of a configuration of an AD conversion circuit according to this embodiment. The AD conversion circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes a first count section <b>18</b>, a latch control section <b>105</b>, a latch section <b>108</b>, and a comparison section <b>109</b>. The comparison section <b>109</b> is the same as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The first count section <b>18</b> counts a clock signal CLK having a predetermined frequency as a count clock, and outputs binary count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b>. The first count section <b>18</b> includes counter circuits C_<b>0</b> to C_<b>4</b> of 5 bits in the first embodiment, but the first count section <b>18</b> includes counter circuits C_<b>0</b> to C_<b>11</b> of 12 bits to output the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> in this embodiment. The latch section <b>108</b> has latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> that latch logical states of the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The latch control section <b>105</b> includes an AND circuit AND_<b>0</b>, flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b>, flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b>, and flip-flop circuit XDFF. The flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b> is constituted, for example, by connecting four flip-flop circuits. In addition, each of the flip-flop circuits DFF_<b>1</b> and XDFF is constituted by one flip-flop circuit. The AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> is the same as in the first embodiment. The AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> in this embodiment outputs a control signal Hold corresponding to the control signal Hold_L in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although details will be described later, the latch control section <b>105</b> enables the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> at a first timing at which a synchronized comparison output CO_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> is inverted after a comparison output CO of the comparison section <b>109</b> has been inverted according to this configuration. Further, the latch control section <b>105</b> causes the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> to execute latch operations at a second timing delayed by a predetermined time from the first timing.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the control signal Hold from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state and directly output the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> from the first count section <b>18</b>. In addition, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> are in the disable state when the control signal Hold from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> transitions from the high level to the low level. At this time, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> latch logical states corresponding to the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> from the first count section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The above-described configuration is an example, and it is possible to appropriately change the number of bits of a counter circuit constituting the first count section <b>18</b>. In addition, although the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b> includes the four flip-flop circuits and the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> includes the one flip-flop circuit in the present embodiment, the present invention is not limited to the above-described numbers of the flip-flop circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, an operation of the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an operation of the AD conversion circuit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, symbols D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> indicate count values of the first count section <b>18</b>, and symbols Q<b>0</b> to Q<b>4</b> and Q<b>11</b> indicate outputs of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> and D<sub>&#x2014; </sub><b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. First, after an input of an analog signal Signal to be subjected to AD conversion has been stabilized, a ramp wave Ramp, which decreases with the passage of time, is provided to one input terminal of the comparison section <b>109</b>. The comparison section <b>109</b> compares the ramp wave Ramp to the analog signal Signal.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Meanwhile, the first count section <b>18</b> counts a clock signal CLK, for example, in the count-up mode, and outputs the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b>. Although it is preferable that the timing of a count operation start in the first count section <b>18</b> be approximately simultaneous with the timing of an output start of the ramp wave Ramp, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While a voltage of the ramp wave Ramp is greater than a voltage of the analog signal Signal, the comparison output CO of the comparison section <b>109</b> is low. Because the comparison output CO is low, the synchronized comparison output CO_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is low. Thus, the control signal Hold output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is low. Thereby, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and their operations are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Subsequently, the comparison output CO is inverted when the voltage of the ramp wave Ramp has been approximately consistent with the voltage of the analog signal Signal. Because the comparison output CO becomes high, the synchronized comparison output CO_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes high (the first timing). In addition, a delayed comparison output xCOD of the flip-flop circuit XDFF of the latch control section <b>105</b> is still high immediately after the comparison output CO has been inverted, and a synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is still high. Thereby, because the control signal Hold output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes high, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When a time consistent with a sum of a delay time of the flip-flop circuit XDFF of the latch control section <b>105</b> and a delay time of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b> has elapsed from the first timing, the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D becomes low, so that the control signal Hold output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes low. Thereby, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and latch logical states corresponding to the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> (the second timing).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Digital data DOUT[<b>11</b>:<b>0</b>] corresponding to the analog signal Signal is obtained according to count values latched by the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D<sub>&#x2014; </sub><b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. The obtained digital data DOUT[<b>11</b>:<b>0</b>] is output to a subsequent output section (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Because the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> are operable only in a period from the first timing to the second timing in the above-described operation, it is possible to reduce consumption current in the latch section <b>108</b>. Accordingly, low consumption current of the AD conversion circuit is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In addition, it is possible to adjust a period in which the control signal Hold becomes high, that is, a period in which the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state, by adjusting the number of flip-flop circuits constituting the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b>. In this embodiment, the period in which the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is longer than the period in which the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> are delayed and input to the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. When the distance between the first count section <b>18</b> and the latch section <b>108</b> is greater, the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> are further delayed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the present embodiment, as described above, it is possible to delay latch timings of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D<sub>&#x2014; </sub><b>11</b> in consideration of delays of the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>11</b> input to the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> by further lengthening the period in which the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The inverting delay circuit DLY may be used instead of the flip-flop circuit XDFF of the present embodiment. In addition, although the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b> is constituted by four flip-flop circuits in the embodiment, the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>2</b> may be constituted by one flip-flop circuit if there is no need to delay the latch timings of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b>. In addition, if there is no need to cause the latch timings of the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>11</b> to be in synchronization with the clock signal CLK, the flip-flop circuits DFF_<b>1</b> and DFF_<b>2</b> may not be provided.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Next, the eighth embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an example of a configuration of a solid-state imaging apparatus according to the present embodiment. The solid-state imaging apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes an imaging section <b>2</b>, a vertical selection section <b>12</b>, a read current source section <b>5</b>, an analog section <b>6</b>, a first count section <b>18</b>, a ramp section <b>19</b> (reference signal generation section), a column processing section <b>15</b>, a horizontal selection section <b>14</b>, an output section <b>17</b>, and a control section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The imaging section <b>2</b> includes a plurality of unit pixels <b>3</b> arranged in a matrix for generating and outputting a signal corresponding to the amount of an incident electromagnetic wave. The vertical selection section <b>12</b> selects each row of the imaging section <b>2</b>. The read current source section <b>5</b> reads a signal from the imaging section <b>2</b> as a voltage signal. Although details have not been described, the analog section <b>6</b> has an auto gain control (AGC) circuit having a signal amplification function if necessary. The first count section <b>18</b> performs a count operation by designating a clock signal CLK output from the control section <b>20</b> as a count clock, and outputs count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> indicating count results.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The ramp section <b>19</b> generates a ramp wave Ramp (a reference signal) that increases or decreases with the passage of time. The column processing section <b>15</b> is connected to the ramp section <b>19</b> via a reference signal line. The horizontal selection section <b>14</b> reads data subjected to AD conversion to a horizontal signal line. The output section <b>17</b> is connected to the horizontal signal line. The control section <b>20</b> controls each part.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Although the imaging section <b>2</b> including unit pixels of 4 rows&#xd7;6 columns for simplicity has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, several tens to several tens of thousands of unit pixels <b>3</b> are actually arranged in each row or column of the imaging section <b>2</b>. Although not shown, the unit pixels <b>3</b> constituting the imaging section <b>2</b> include a photoelectric conversion element such as a photodiode/photogate/phototransistor and a transistor circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Hereinafter, main parts will be described in further detail. In the imaging section <b>2</b>, the unit pixels <b>3</b> are two-dimensionally arranged only in 4 rows and 6 columns, and a row control line <b>11</b> is wired for each row with respect to a pixel array of 4 rows and 6 columns. One end of the row control line <b>11</b> is connected to an output terminal corresponding to each row of the vertical selection section <b>12</b>. The vertical selection section <b>12</b> includes a shift register or a decoder. The vertical selection section <b>12</b> controls row addressing or row scanning of the imaging section <b>2</b> via the row control line <b>11</b> when each unit pixel <b>3</b> of the imaging section <b>2</b> is driven. In addition, a vertical signal line <b>13</b> is wired for each column with respect to the pixel array of the imaging section <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The read current source section <b>5</b> includes, for example, an NMOS transistor. The vertical signal line <b>13</b> is connected from the imaging section <b>2</b> to a drain terminal of the NMOS transistor constituting the read current source section <b>5</b>. A desired voltage is appropriately applied to a control terminal. A source terminal is connected to GND. Thereby, a signal from a pixel is output as a voltage mode. Although the case in which the NMOS transistor has been used as a current source has been described above, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The column processing section <b>15</b> has a column AD conversion section <b>16</b>, for example, provided for each pixel column of the imaging section <b>2</b>, that is, each vertical signal line <b>13</b>.

Although column AD conversion sections <b>16</b> are arranged to have a one-to-one correspondence relationship with pixel columns of the imaging section <b>2</b> in this embodiment, this is only an example and the present invention is not limited to this layout relationship. For example, one column AD conversion section <b>16</b> for a plurality of pixel columns can be arranged and the one column AD conversion section <b>16</b> can configured to be used and configured in time division among a plurality of pixel columns. The column processing section <b>15</b> is an AD conversion means for converting an analog pixel signal read from a unit pixel <b>3</b> of a selected pixel row of the imaging section <b>2</b> into digital pixel data along with the ramp section <b>19</b> and the first count section <b>18</b> as will be described later.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The ramp section <b>19</b> includes, for example, an integrating circuit. According to control of the control section <b>20</b>, the ramp section <b>19</b> generates a ramp wave Ramp, the level of which changes along a gradient with the passage of time, and supplies the ramp wave Ramp to one of input terminals of a comparison section <b>109</b> via a reference signal line. The ramp section <b>19</b> is not limited to the integrating circuit, and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) circuit may be used. However, in the case of a configuration in which a ramp wave is digitally generated using the DAC circuit, a configuration that makes the step of the ramp wave fine or a configuration equivalent thereto is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The horizontal selection section <b>14</b> includes a shift register or a decoder. The horizontal selection section <b>14</b> controls column addressing or column scanning of the column AD conversion section <b>16</b> of the column processing section <b>15</b>. According to control of the horizontal selection section <b>14</b>, digital data subjected to AD conversion by the column AD conversion section <b>16</b> is sequentially read to the horizontal signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The first count section <b>18</b> includes, for example, an up-counter circuit, to perform a count operation and output the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b>. Although the first count section <b>18</b> may be constituted by a down-counter circuit, the present invention is not limited thereto. Further, although it is preferable that a synchronous counter circuit be used as a counter circuit constituting the first count section <b>18</b>, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The output section <b>17</b> performs a subtraction operation (CDS process). The output section <b>17</b> may further have embedded signal processing functions, for example, such as black level adjustment, column variation correction, color processing, and the like. Further, n-bit parallel digital data may be converted into serial data and the serial data may be output.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The control section <b>20</b> includes a functional block of a timing generator (TG), which supplies predetermined timing pulse signals or clocks necessary for operations of parts such as the ramp section <b>19</b>, the first count section <b>18</b>, the vertical selection section <b>12</b>, the horizontal selection section <b>14</b>, and the output section <b>17</b>, and a functional block for communicating with the TG.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Next, a configuration of the column AD conversion section <b>16</b> will be described. The column AD conversion section <b>16</b> generates a time interval having the magnitude (pulse width) of a time axis direction corresponding to each magnitude of the reset level (reference level) or the signal level by comparing an analog pixel signal Pixel read from each unit pixel <b>3</b> of the imaging section <b>2</b> via the vertical signal line <b>13</b> to a ramp wave Ramp for AD conversion provided from the ramp section <b>19</b>. The AD conversion is performed by generating digital data according to the magnitude of a pixel signal Pixel from data corresponding to the time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Hereinafter, details of a configuration of the column AD conversion section <b>16</b> will be described. The column AD conversion section <b>16</b> is provided for each column and six column AD conversion sections <b>16</b> are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The column AD conversion sections <b>16</b> of the columns have the same configuration. The column AD conversion section <b>16</b> includes a comparison section <b>109</b>, a latch control section <b>105</b>, a latch section <b>108</b>, and a second count section <b>101</b>. The comparison section <b>109</b>, the latch control section <b>105</b>, the latch section <b>108</b>, and the second count section <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> correspond to the comparison section <b>109</b>, the latch control section <b>105</b>, the latch section <b>108</b>, and the second count section <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, respectively. The ramp section <b>19</b>, the first count section <b>18</b>, and the column AD conversion section <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are an example of the AD conversion circuit of the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the analog signal Signal is input to one input terminal of the comparison section <b>109</b>. An analog pixel signal Pixel output from a unit pixel <b>3</b> of the imaging section <b>2</b> via the vertical signal line <b>13</b> is input to the one input terminal of the comparison section <b>109</b> of the embodiment as the analog signal Signal.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The comparison section <b>109</b> converts the magnitude of the pixel signal into a time interval (pulse width), which is information of a time axis direction, by comparing a signal voltage corresponding to the pixel signal Pixel to a ramp voltage of the ramp wave Ramp supplied from the ramp section <b>19</b>. For example, a comparison output CO of the comparison section <b>109</b> has the low level when the ramp voltage is greater than the signal voltage, and has the high level when the ramp voltage is less than or equal to the signal voltage. Because the configurations of the latch control section <b>105</b>, the latch section <b>108</b>, and the second count section <b>101</b> are the same as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a description thereof is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, an operation of the embodiment will be described. Although the description of a specific operation of the unit pixel <b>3</b> is omitted here, a reset level and a signal level are output from the unit pixel <b>3</b> as is well known.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The AD conversion is performed as follows. For example, the ramp voltage of the ramp wave Ramp, which falls with a predetermined slope, is compared to the signal voltage of the pixel signal Pixel. During a period from a point in time related to a start of the comparison process to a second timing subsequent to a first timing related to a point in time when the ramp voltage of the ramp wave Ramp has been consistent with the signal voltage of the pixel signal Pixel, the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b> of the first count section <b>18</b> and count values D<b>5</b> to D<b>11</b> of the second count section <b>101</b> are counted. Thereby, digital data corresponding to the pixel signal Pixel is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the present embodiment, the above-described AD conversion is performed for each of the reset level and the signal level read from the unit pixel <b>3</b>. More specifically, the AD conversion is performed by reading the reset level including noise of a pixel signal in a first read operation from each unit pixel <b>3</b> of a selected row of the imaging section <b>2</b>, and then the AD conversion is performed by reading the signal level in a second read operation. Thereafter, digital data corresponding to a signal component is obtained by digitally carrying out a subtraction operation (CDS process) on the reset level and the signal level. In the first read operation, the AD conversion may be performed by reading the signal level. In the subsequent second read operation, the AD conversion may be performed by reading the reset level.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">&#x3c;AD Conversion Operation&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Hereinafter, a detailed operation of the AD conversion will be described. In the following description, the elements and signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are appropriately used as elements and signals within the latch control section <b>105</b>. After a pixel signal Pixel output from the unit pixel <b>3</b> of an arbitrary pixel row to the vertical signal line <b>13</b> has been stabilized, the control section <b>20</b> supplies control data of ramp wave generation to the ramp section <b>19</b>. The ramp section <b>19</b> receives the control data, and outputs a ramp wave Ramp, the waveform of which temporally changes in a ramp shape as a whole, as a comparison voltage to be provided to one input terminal of the comparison section <b>109</b>. The comparison section <b>109</b> compares the ramp wave Ramp to the pixel signal Pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Meanwhile, the first count section <b>18</b> counts a clock signal CLK, for example, in the count-up mode, and outputs count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>4</b>. In addition, the second count section <b>101</b> counts an output Q<b>4</b> of a latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>. Although it is preferable that the timing of a count operation start in the first count section <b>18</b> and the second count section <b>101</b> be approximately simultaneous with the timing of an output start of the ramp wave Ramp, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">While the voltage of the ramp wave Ramp is greater than the voltage of the pixel signal Pixel, the comparison output CO of the comparison section <b>109</b> is low. Because the comparison output CO is low, a synchronized comparison output CO_D of a flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is low. Thus, a control signal Hold_L output from an AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is low. Thereby, latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and their operations are stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">On the other hand, a delayed comparison output xCOD of a flip-flop circuit XDFF of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high, and a synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D of a flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high. In addition, a control signal Enable is high. Thus, a control signal Hold_C output from an AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is high. Thereby, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the enable state, and directly outputs the count value D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b>. The second count section <b>101</b> performs a count operation based on the output Q<b>4</b> of the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Subsequently, the comparison output CO is inverted when the voltage of the ramp wave Ramp has been approximately consistent with the voltage of the pixel signal Pixel. Because the comparison output CO becomes high, the synchronized comparison output CO_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes high (the first timing). In addition, the delayed comparison output xCOD of the flip-flop circuit XDFF of the latch control section <b>105</b> is still high immediately after the comparison output CO has been inverted, and the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> is still high. Thereby, because the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes high, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the enable state.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When a time consistent with a sum of a delay time of the flip-flop circuit XDFF of the latch control section <b>105</b> and a delay time of the flip-flop circuit DFF_<b>0</b> has elapsed from the first timing, the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D becomes low, so that the control signal Hold_L output from the AND circuit AND_<b>0</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes low. Thereby, the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> are in the disable state, and latch logical states corresponding to the count values D<b>0</b> to D<b>3</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> (the second timing).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In addition, because the synchronized delayed comparison output xCOD_D becomes low, the control signal Hold_C output from the AND circuit AND_<b>1</b> of the latch control section <b>105</b> becomes low. Thereby, the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is in the disable state, and latches a logical state corresponding to the count value D<b>4</b> output from the first count section <b>18</b> at the above-described second timing. The second count section <b>101</b> latches the count values D<b>5</b> to D<b>11</b> at that time when the latch circuit D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> is stopped (latched).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Digital data corresponding to the pixel signal Pixel is obtained according to count values latched by the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>4</b> of the latch section <b>108</b> and count values latched by counter circuits C_<b>5</b> to C_<b>11</b> of the second count section <b>101</b>. When a predetermined time has elapsed, the control section <b>20</b> stops the supply of control data to the ramp section <b>19</b> and the count operation of the first count section <b>18</b>. Thereby, the ramp section <b>19</b> stops ramp wave generation.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Thereafter, digital data is output by the horizontal selection section <b>14</b> to the output section <b>17</b> via the horizontal signal line. The output section <b>17</b> obtains data for a difference between the reset level and the signal level by carrying out a subtraction operation (CDS process). A circuit for carrying out the subtraction operation (CDS process) may be embedded in the column section (column AD conversion section <b>16</b>). In addition, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Because the latch circuits D_<b>0</b> to D_<b>3</b> are operable only in a period from the first timing to the second timing in the above-described operation, it is possible to reduce consumption current in the latch section <b>108</b>. Accordingly, low consumption current of the solid-state imaging apparatus is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Although the configuration of the latch control section <b>105</b> of the embodiment is the same as the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as described above, the configuration of the latch control section <b>105</b> of this embodiment may be the same as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>8</b>.
