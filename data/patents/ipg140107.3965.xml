<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present Application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/753,080, titled Seatback Entertainment Display System, filed on Dec. 22, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventions relate generally to a seatback entertainment system for use in a vehicle (e.g., automobiles such as cars, trucks, and the like; airplanes, boats, trains, busses, etc.). More specifically, the present inventions relate to a seatback entertainment display system having a high-mount arrangement that permits a wide range of adjustment intended to accommodate or adapt to repositioning of the seatback and headrest and to optimize a viewing angle for viewers in the vehicle. The seatback entertainment display system may also include a wide variety of other components such as a DVD player, speakers, lighting sources (e.g. ambient, task, reading, etc.), connectivity ports, headphone jack(s), auxiliary input(s), wireless transmitters/receivers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Seatback entertainment display systems for use with the seats of vehicles such as automobiles are generally known and typically include a display mounted or fixed in a portion of the seatback or a headrest portion of the seat back. However, such known displays for use in a seatbacks have certain disadvantages. For example, movement of the seatback (such as between a reclined position and an upright or fold-forward position tend to change the viewing angle of the display as observed by users (such as users seated in rear seats of the vehicle) to a less-than-optimum position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, such known displays that are mounted into the seatback or headrest typically have an elevation that is determined by the elevation of the seatback or the headrest and the elevation tends to change if the elevation of the seat or the headrest is changed by an occupant of the seat. Further, the viewing angle of the known displays tends to be limited and not readily adaptable to occupants of various sizes that are viewing the display device (e.g. adults, children, etc.). By further way of example, the known seatback displays are generally not adjustable from side-to-side to enhance the viewing angle of rear seat viewers of the display that are sitting in an offset relationship from the display (such as a viewer sitting in the &#x201c;middle&#x201d; of a rear seat arrangement in a vehicle. Although some of the known rear seat display devices that are mounted in a seatback may provide some adjustment, such adjustment capabilities are generally limited and not satisfactory.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a seatback entertainment display system that overcomes the disadvantages of the known seatback displays. It would also be advantageous to provide a seatback entertainment display system having a &#x201c;high mount&#x201d; arrangement that is cantilevered from a top portion of the seatback behind a headrest of the seat. It would also be advantageous to provide a seatback entertainment display system that permits the display to be tilted forward and rearward. It would also be advantageous to provide a seatback entertainment display system that permits a display to be pivoted from side-to-side. It would also be advantageous to provide a seatback entertainment display system that permits the display device to translate vertically in an upwardly and downwardly manner. It would also be advantageous to provide a seatback entertainment display system that permits the display device to be tilted, pivoted or translated to accommodate or adapt to a desired viewing angle for a viewer, and in a manner that is generally independent of the adjustment range of the seatback and/or headrest by an occupant of the seat. It would also be advantageous to provide a seatback entertainment display system having components such as a DVD player, speakers, lighting sources (e.g. ambient, task, reading, etc.), connectivity ports, headphone jack(s), auxiliary input(s), wireless transmitters/receivers, etc. It would also be desirable to provide a seatback entertainment system that movably integrates a headrest and fixedly integrates a display device (with a movably display screen) onto a structure (e.g. a bracket, pair of rods, etc.) extending from the seatback frame.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a seatback entertainment display system for a vehicle having any one or more of these or other advantageous features.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a seatback entertainment display system for use in a vehicle (e.g., automobiles such as cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, minivans, buses, and the like; airplanes, boats, trains, etc.). The seatback entertainment display system is shown and described by way of example to include a display device and other components for use with a seatback of a front seat of a vehicle, for viewing by occupants of the vehicle (&#x201c;viewers&#x201d;) that are seated behind the front seat. Such a display device may be provided in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, components, and configurations, and the system may be used within any seat (such as a train, airplane, bus, etc.) where viewers are seated behind another seat. All such variations are intended to be within the scope of the inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a seatback entertainment display system <b>10</b> for a vehicle is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The system includes a seatback frame <b>20</b>, a support member <b>30</b>, an adjustment device <b>40</b> and a display device <b>50</b>. The system may also include a wide variety of additional components as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-4</figref>. The seatback frame <b>20</b> may be a conventional seat frame for use in any of a wide variety of vehicles. The support member <b>30</b> is shown having a bottom end <b>32</b> that is mounted (connected, coupled, attached, integrally formed, etc.) at or generally near a top portion <b>22</b> of the seatback frame <b>20</b> by any suitable process such as welding, brazing, threaded fasteners, integral formation with the seatback frame, etc. The support member <b>30</b> may be attached to any suitable portion of the seatback frame <b>20</b> (e.g. sides, back, etc.), so that a portion of the frame extends behind a headrest attached to the seatback. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-6</figref>, the support member <b>30</b> is shown to extend upwardly from a location near the top portion <b>22</b> of the seatback frame <b>20</b> and adjacent to, and behind, a headrest <b>24</b> of the seatback to provide a &#x201c;high mount&#x201d; arrangement for the display device <b>50</b>. The support member may be made of any suitable material (such as steel, aluminum, plastic, etc.) and attached to the seatback frame during production of the seatback. A top end <b>34</b> of the support member <b>30</b> is configured to receive an adjustment device <b>40</b> that is shown to interconnect what is shown for example as a top portion of the display device <b>50</b> to the support member <b>30</b> at an attachment point. According to one embodiment, the support member is plastic-coated or encased, however, the support member may be finished in any suitable manner to match or contrast (as desired) with other interior trim features of the vehicle, such as painted, anodized, epoxy coated, plasticized, vinyl coated, fabric-wrapped, leather-wrapped, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one embodiment, the support member <b>30</b> is also shown having a shape that is intended to remain generally &#x201c;concealed&#x201d; or hidden behind the display device <b>50</b> when the display device is in a &#x201c;stowed&#x201d; position against the support member (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2A</figref>), so that the display device retains an appearance similar to that of a &#x201c;hard-mounted&#x201d; type of display device, yet permits the advantageous adjustment features of the embodiments described herein. According to another embodiment the support may be sized and shaped to remain visible when the display device is stowed and may be configured to have an aesthetic appearance that compliments or contrasts with the seat back and/or display device. According to the illustrated embodiment, the support member <b>30</b> is shown as a generally rigid member having a strength suitable for use with all intended loading scenarios that may be potentially experienced by the display device and/or support member. According to an alternative embodiment, the support member may also include a restorable &#x201c;break-free&#x201d; feature (such as a snap-hinge, over-center biasing device, etc.) that is intended to &#x201c;fold&#x201d; or collapse in the event of loading or impact in excess of a certain predetermined amount (e.g. if a person &#x201c;pulls&#x201d; or &#x201c;leans&#x201d; on the display device, or otherwise stresses the display device or support member) to prevent damage to the display device, and/or the adjustment mechanism and/or the support member.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one embodiment, the adjustment mechanism <b>40</b> is intended to permit movement of the display device <b>50</b> (and other components such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-4</figref>) in a forward-rearward (e.g. tipping, tilting, folding, draw-forward, push-back, etc.) manner (i.e. rotation about a horizontal axis&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-7</figref>) through a desired adjustment range, such as range of approximately 0 through 60 degrees. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the display device may be arranged for pivoting upward approximately 180 degrees to accommodate positioning of the vehicle seat when protection of the display is desired (e.g. when moving the seatback to a &#x201c;fold flat&#x201d; position to prevent damage to the display device, etc.). The adjustment mechanism <b>40</b> is also intended to permit a side-to-side (e.g. pivoting, swinging, sliding, etc.) manner (i.e. rotation about a vertical axis) through a desired adjustment range, such as range of approximately 0 through 30 degrees and an up-down (e.g. raise, lower, etc.&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) manner, and a side-to-side manner (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) so that the display panel may be movable by translation generally along a plane defined by the support member or the adjustment device) along a travel distance in an amount up to about the height of the support member <b>30</b>. However, the adjustment mechanism may be selected to provide only one (or certain several) of these adjustment features to suit a particular application or customer. According to one embodiment, the adjustment mechanism is intended to provide a mechanical connection between the support member and the display device. The connection is intended to facilitate use of a quick-release device to permit the display device-(and its associated components) to be removed for use at other locations, and to facilitate interchangeability to permit upgrade/replacement of the display device (and its associated components).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The adjustment mechanism <b>40</b> may be selected as a commercially available product that permits a desired range of motion and may also include a &#x201c;friction-creating&#x201d; or &#x201c;torque-resisting&#x201d; interaction (such as a &#x201c;torque hinge&#x201d; or torque washers or counter-balanced springs or the like for the rotational adjustment features) or may be custom-made to incorporate the desired features or combination of features. The adjustment mechanism may also include &#x201c;retention&#x201d; features (e.g. viscous or frictional interfaces, dampers, spring-assist devices, etc.) that tend to &#x201c;hold&#x201d; or &#x201c;retain&#x201d; the display device in a desired position after adjustment to a desired viewing angle by a viewer and until subsequently repositioned by the viewer. According to one embodiment, the retention features have sufficient retentive strength to maintain the position of the display device during normal usage and movements of the vehicle. However, the strength of the retention features is intended to be low enough to permit convenient manual adjustment of the display device and to permit &#x201c;release&#x201d; of the position of the display device upon impact with an occupant or other object in the vehicle. The horizontal axis pivoting and vertical axis pivoting feature of the adjustment mechanism <b>40</b> may be provided by any suitable rotational device such as a hinge, pin-and-socket, bearing, bushing or the like (shown for example as hinge <b>42</b> for adjustment about a horizontal axis). The up-down and side-to-side translation adjustment feature may be provided using a slide, track, rail or the like, that interfaces between (or is incorporated in), the adjustment mechanism <b>40</b> and either of the display device <b>50</b> or the support member <b>30</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, up-down adjustment is provided by a track <b>36</b> provided in the support member <b>30</b> and is configured to slidably receive a corresponding projection extending from the adjustment mechanism <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Side-to-side adjustment is shown provided by a track <b>52</b> on the display device <b>50</b> that engages a projection or tab (shown as a tang <b>46</b>) extending from hinge <b>42</b> on the adjustment mechanism <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). According to an alternative embodiment the pivotal/rotational features of the adjustment mechanism may comprise a ratchet and pawl device with a release mechanism (such as a spring-biased button, lever, latch, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to other embodiments, the adjustment features may be accomplished by other suitable devices such as a ball-and-socket device, a viscous coupling device, pinned linkages (that permit the display device to telescope, articulate, etc.). According to another alternative embodiment, the position of the display device may be remotely adjustable through suitable motors, servos, actuators or the like (e.g. of a &#x201c;miniature&#x201d; size, etc.) and may be activated through controls on the display device or by a remote control device, such as the remote control that operates a media device associated with the display panel. According to a further alternative embodiment, the adjustment mechanism may include a side-to-side translation feature to permit lateral movement of the display device. According to a further embodiment, the adjustment mechanism (or its attachment point) may be provided with a quick-release device that permits the display device to be removed by a user, such as for security purposes, or for use remote from the vehicle (such as a hotel, or other suitable application or location). The quick release device may include a locking device (such as a key, etc.) to minimize unintended removal of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an alternative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the display device <b>50</b> may be provided as a two-part device that includes a screen portion <b>54</b> that is movably connected to a body portion <b>56</b> of the display device <b>50</b> to permit a further adjustment range for viewing images by a user. The screen portion <b>54</b> is shown pivotally coupled along a top edge to the body portion <b>56</b>, such as by use of a torque hinge or the like. An indentation in body portion (shown as a finger relief <b>58</b>) is provided adjacent a lower edge of the display screen to enhance ease of a use by an occupant of the vehicle in positioning the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to another embodiment, the adjustment device is configured as a low-profile (e.g. thin, slim, narrow, etc.) device that minimizes the package space of the display device behind and adjacent the headrest of the seatback. The adjustment device <b>40</b>, in combination with the support member <b>30</b>, is intended to permit a viewer to selectively customize the viewing angle of the display device <b>50</b> in any one of an almost infinite number of positions, to accommodate a particular viewer (e.g. short, tall, etc.), the location of the viewer (e.g. directly behind the seat, offset from the seat, etc.) and to permit adjustment to maintain the desired viewing angle when the seatback and/or headrest are adjusted or repositioned by the occupant of the seat. For example, if an occupant of the vehicle seat reclines the seatback, the viewer may adjust (e.g. tilt) the display device and/or raise the display device to maintain a desired viewing angle. By further way of example, since the display device is mounted independent of the headrest, an occupant of the seat may adjust the headrest to any desired elevation or inclination without changing the position of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-4</figref>, the display device is shown to include a variety of additional components and/or features intended to enhance the functionality of the display. For example, the display device may include speakers <b>62</b> for broadcasting audio to the user of the display. Ambient lighting may be provided by light sources, such as LEDs <b>64</b>, mounted along a perimeter (or side or back) of the display device to provide multi-colored lighting that is coordinated with the images displayed on the screen of the display device. A media device, shown for example as a DVD player <b>66</b>, may be integrated into the display device, and may have an access door shown as provided along a side or top of the display device.
