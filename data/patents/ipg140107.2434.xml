<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0002">Positive photoresists containing an alkali-soluble resin and a photosensitizer such as 1,2-naphthoquinone diazide are known as resists for use in, for example, the manufacture of semiconductor devices such as ICs and LSIs, the manufacture of displays such as LCDs, and the manufacture of printing plates. One proposed positive photoresist composition contains a mixture of an m-cresol novolac resin and a p-cresol novolac resin as an alkali-soluble resin (see, for example, PTL 1).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0003">Whereas the positive photoresist composition disclosed in PTL 1 is developed to provide high developability, e.g., high sensitivity, there is a need for a higher sensitivity because finer patterns have been used with the increasing packing density of semiconductor devices in recent years. Unfortunately, the positive photoresist composition disclosed in PTL 1 has insufficient sensitivity for use in forming such finer patterns. A need also exists for a higher heat resistance because semiconductor manufacturing processes, for example, involve various heat treatments. Unfortunately, the positive photoresist composition disclosed in PTL 1 has insufficient heat resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0004">Also proposed is a photoresist phenolic resin with high sensitivity and high heat resistance that is prepared by reacting, for example, p-cresol with an aromatic aldehyde and then adding and reacting a phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst (see, for example, PTL 2). This photoresist phenolic resin has a higher heat resistance than those in the related art, although it has insufficient heat resistance to meet the high level of heat resistance required in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0005">Also proposed is a photoresist phenolic resin with high sensitivity and high heat resistance that is prepared by reacting a phenol such as m-cresol, p-cresol, or 2,3-xylenol with an aromatic aldehyde and then adding and reacting formaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst (see, for example, PTL 3). This photoresist phenolic resin has a higher sensitivity than those in the related art, although it has insufficient heat resistance to meet the high level of heat resistance required in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0006">One problem is that a novolac resin, which is an alkali-soluble resin, designed to have a higher alkali solubility so that it has a higher sensitivity exhibits a lower heat resistance, whereas a novolac resin designed to have a higher heat resistance exhibits a lower sensitivity, and this makes it difficult to achieve high sensitivity and high heat resistance at the same time at a higher level. Accordingly, there is a need for a material that has high sensitivity and high heat resistance at the same time at a higher level.</p>

(where R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, and R<sup>3 </sup>are each independently an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms; m, n, and p are each independently an integer of 0 to 4; q is an integer of 1 to (5&#x2212;p); and s is an integer of 1 to (9&#x2212;p)).
</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The aromatic compound (A) can be prepared by, for example, polycondensing an alkyl-substituted phenol (a1) with a phenolic-hydroxyl containing aromatic aldehyde (a2).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The alkyl-substituted phenol (a1) is a compound having the hydrogen atoms on the phenolic aromatic ring thereof partially or completely substituted by alkyl groups. Examples of alkyl groups include alkyl groups having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably methyl. Examples of alkyl-substituted phenols (a1) include monoalkylphenols such as o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-ethylphenol, m-ethylphenol, p-ethylphenol, p-octylphenol, p-t-butylphenol, o-cyclohexylphenol, m-cyclohexylphenol, and p-cyclohexylphenol; dialkylphenols such as 2,5-xylenol, 3,5-xylenol, 3,4-xylenol, 2,4-xylenol, and 2,6-xylenol; and trialkylphenols such as 2,3,5-trimethylphenol and 2,3,6-trimethylphenol. Among these alkyl-substituted phenols, phenols having two alkyl substituents on the aromatic ring thereof are preferred for their good balance of heat resistance and alkali solubility, and such examples include 2,5-xylenol and 2,6-xylenol. These alkyl-substituted phenols (a1) can be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The aromatic aldehyde (a2) is a compound having at least one hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group on the aromatic ring thereof. Examples of aromatic aldehydes (a2) include hydroxybenzaldehydes such as salicylaldehyde, m-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde; dihydroxybenzaldehydes such as 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde; vanillin compounds such as vanillin, ortho-vanillin, isovanillin, and ethylvanillin; and hydroxynaphthaldehydes such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde and 6-hydroxy-2-naphthaldehyde. Among these aromatic aldehydes (a2), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, and 6-hydroxy-2-naphthaldehyde are preferred for their industrial availability and good balance of heat resistance and alkali solubility. These aromatic aldehydes (a2) can be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Examples of aliphatic aldehydes (B) include formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, 1,3,5-trioxane, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, tetraoxymethylene, polyoxymethylene, chloral, hexamethylenetetramine, furfural, glyoxal, n-butyraldehyde, caproaldehyde, allylaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, and acrolein. These aldehyde compounds (B) can be used alone or in combination. Preferably, the aliphatic aldehyde (B) used is formaldehyde, which may be used in combination with other aliphatic aldehydes. If formaldehyde is used in combination with other aliphatic aldehydes, the amount of other aliphatic aldehydes used is preferably 0.05 to 1 mole per mole of formaldehyde.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An example of a method for manufacturing the novolac phenolic resin (C), which is an essential component of the positive photoresist composition of the present invention, includes the following three steps.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">First Step</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The alkyl-substituted phenol (a1) is polycondensed with the aromatic aldehyde (a2) by heating at 60&#xb0; C. to 140&#xb0; C. in the presence of an acid catalyst, optionally using a solvent, to prepare the aromatic compound (A).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Second Step</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aromatic compound (A) prepared in the first step is isolated from the reaction solution.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Third Step</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The aromatic compound (A) isolated in the second step is polycondensed with the aliphatic aldehyde (B) by heating at 60&#xb0; C. to 140&#xb0; C. in the presence of an acid catalyst, optionally using a solvent, to prepare the novolac phenolic resin (C), which is an essential component of the positive photoresist composition of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Examples of acid catalysts used in the first and third steps include acetic acid, oxalic acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phenolsulfonic acid, paratoluenesulfonic acid, zinc acetate, and manganese acetate. These acid catalysts can be used alone or in combination. Among these acid catalysts, sulfuric acid and paratoluenesulfonic acid are preferred for the first step, and sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, and zinc acetate are preferred for the third step, because of their high activities. The acid catalyst may be added before or during the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples of solvents optionally used in the first and third steps include monoalcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol; polyols such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,7-heptanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,9-nonanediol, trimethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and glycerol; glycol ethers such as 2-ethoxyethanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol monopentyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl methyl ether, and ethylene glycol monophenyl ether; cyclic ethers such as 1,3-dioxane and 1,4-dioxane; glycol esters such as ethylene glycol acetate; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene. These solvents can be used alone or in combination. Among these solvents, 2-ethoxyethanol is preferred for its high ability to dissolve the compound to be prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The charge ratio [(a1)/(a2)] of the alkyl-substituted phenol (a1) to the aromatic aldehyde (a2) in the first step is preferably 1/0.2 to 1/0.5, more preferably 1/0.25 to 1/0.45, in molar ratio, which is advantageous in terms of the removability of the unreacted alkyl-substituted phenol (a1), the yield of the product, and the purity of the reaction product.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The charge ratio [(A)/(B)] of the aromatic compound (A) to the aliphatic aldehyde (B) in the third step is preferably 1/0.5 to 1/1.2, more preferably 1/0.6 to 1/0.9, in molar ratio, which avoids excessive polymerization (gelation) and thus provides a photoresist phenolic resin with a suitable molecular weight.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An example of a method for isolating the aromatic compound (A) from the reaction solution in the second step includes pouring the reaction solution into a poor solvent (S1) in which the reaction product is insoluble or poorly soluble, filtering off the resulting precipitate, dissolving the precipitate in a solvent (S2) in which the reaction product is soluble and which is miscible with the poor solvent (S1), pouring the solution into the poor solvent (S1) again, and filtering off the resulting precipitate. Examples of poor solvents (S1) used therefor include water; monoalcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, and cyclohexane; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene. Among these poor solvents (S1), water and methanol are preferred because the acid catalyst can be efficiently removed together. Examples of solvents (S2) include monoalcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol; polyols such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,7-heptanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,9-nonanediol, trimethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and glycerol; glycol ethers such as 2-ethoxyethanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol monopentyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl methyl ether, and ethylene glycol monophenyl ether; cyclic ethers such as 1,3-dioxane and 1,4-dioxane; glycol esters such as ethylene glycol acetate; and ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone. If the poor solvent (S1) used is water, (S2) is preferably acetone. The above poor solvents (S1) and solvents (S2) can be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene is used as a solvent in the first and third steps, the aromatic compound (A) formed by the reaction dissolves in the solvent when heated at 80&#xb0; C. or higher and can therefore be isolated simply by cooling the solution to precipitate the aromatic compound (A) as crystals and then filtering off the precipitate. This eliminates the need to use the poor solvent (S1) and the solvent (S2).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above isolation method in the second step yields the aromatic compound (A) represented by general formula (1) or (2).</p>

To this solution was added 5 parts by mass of a photosensitizer (&#x201c;P-200&#x201d; from Toyo Gosei Co., Ltd., which is a condensate of 1 mol of 4,4&#x2032;-[1-[4-[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1methylethyl]phenyl]ethylidene]bisphenol with 2 mol of 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-5-sulfonylchloride), and it was mixed and dissolved to obtain a positive photoresist composition (1).
