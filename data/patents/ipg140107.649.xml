<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to bodily fluid sampling devices and more specifically, but not exclusively, concerns a dispenser for lancet integrated test element units that is configured to minimize the risk of damage of the units prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The acquisition and testing of bodily fluids is useful for many purposes and continues to grow in importance for use in medical diagnosis and treatment, such as for diabetes, and in other diverse applications. In the medical field, it is desirable for lay operators to perform tests routinely, quickly, and reproducibly outside of a laboratory setting, with rapid results and a readout of the resulting test information. Testing can be performed on various bodily fluids, and for certain applications, is particularly related to the testing of blood and/or interstitial fluid. Performing home-based testing can be difficult for many patients, especially for patients with limited hand dexterity, such as the elderly or diabetics. For example, diabetics can sometimes experience numbness or tingling in their extremities, such as their hands, which can make self-testing difficult because they are unable to accurately position a test strip to collect the blood sample. In addition, wounds for diabetics tend to heal more slowly, and as a result, there is a desire to make incisions less invasive.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, lancet integrated test strips or elements have been developed in which a test strip is integrated with a lancet or other piercing means so as to form a single disposable unit. While these integrated units have somewhat simplified the collection and testing of fluid samples, there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved before a commercial unit can be implemented. One issue concerns maintaining the sterility of the lancet prior to use so as to minimize the risk of infection. Another issue concerns the disposal of used units after use. Once used, the integrated units become a biohazard that need to be disposed of in a safe manner. A number of different types of systems have been proposed for dispensing test strips, lancets, or some combination thereof, but most of these systems have significant drawbacks, especially when used in conjunction with integrated units.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one typical design, individual test strips are stacked within a cartridge. The test strips are usually dispensed on an individual basis either manually or via a sliding mechanism. Since test strips are dispensed individually, automatic handling of the test strips is rather complicated. The sliding mechanism can jam during dispensing, which can damage the test strips. Usually, after use, the test strips have to be disposed of manually via a separate waste container.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Individual test strips or elements have been formed and/or connected together to form tapes of test strips. In one design, the tape is folded within a case, and individual test elements are manually dispensed by pulling on the tape. However, in the age of smaller fluid sample sizes in which the size of test strips becomes smaller, manual feeding and handling of the tape is not practical due to the size of the test strips involved. Such manual feed designs also fail to provide for automatic feeding of the tape and automatic disposal of used sections of the tape, which are typically needed for modern systems. To address these concerns, automatic feed systems like reel-to-reel cassettes have been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Reel-to-reel type cassettes of test strips, which are similar in construction to normal audio cassettes, address a number of test strip handling and storage issues found with previous test strip cartridge designs. However, it has been recognized that there are still a number of significant drawbacks to reel-to-reel type cassettes, especially for electrochemical test strips, lancet integrated test strips, and other disposables that contain components susceptible to damage. For example, if electrochemical test strips are tightly wound around a reel in the cassette, the electrodes within the test strip can be bent or damaged in such a way to create a short, an open condition, or otherwise damage the electrodes, thereby making the test strip unusable. Similarly, if tightly wound around a reel, lancets within integrated units can be bent or otherwise damaged, which in turn can cause injury to the user or otherwise prevent successful lancing of the skin. To combat this problem, tapes of test strips or integrated units are loosely wound around the reels. However, the loosely wound tape makes the cassettes larger than desired and/or reduces the number of tests available before requiring reloading a new cassette. Even when the tape is initially wrapped in a loose manner, the tape can become tightly wrapped as the tape is indexed, thereby damaging the tape. In addition, reel-to-reel type cassette designs are prone to operating in reverse, which can cause the reintroduction of used test strips into the sterilized supply compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, needs remain for further contributions in this area of technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect concerns a lancet integrated test tape that includes a plurality of lancet integrated test units. The lancet integrated test units each include a lancet configured to form an incision in tissue and a test element configured to analyze body fluid from the incision in the tissue. A cartridge includes a supply compartment configured to store an unused section of the tape. The tape is folded within the supply compartment to limit damage to the lancet integrated test units.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect concerns a tape that includes a plurality of test elements configured to analyze body fluid. A cartridge includes a supply compartment configured to store an unused section of the tape. The unused section of the tape is folded within the supply compartment. The cartridge further includes a waste compartment configured to store a used section of the tape. An indexing mechanism is configured to index the tape between the supply compartment and the waste compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further aspect concerns a tape that includes a plurality of test elements configured to analyze body fluid. A cartridge includes a supply compartment configured to store an unused section of the tape. The unused section of the tape is folded within the supply compartment. The cartridge further includes a waste compartment configured to store a used section of the tape. The used section of the tape is folded within the waste compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still yet another aspect concerns a technique in which a plurality of test elements are configured to analyze body fluid are assembled on a sterility sheet. A plurality of piercing members configured to pierce tissue are enclosed in the sterility sheet. Each piercing member is associated with one of the test elements to create a tape of integrated sampling elements.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SELECTED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. A number of embodiments of the invention are shown in detail; although it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that some features that are not relevant to the present invention may not be shown for the sake of clarity. It should be noted that directional terms, such as &#x201c;up&#x201d;, &#x201c;down&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, are used herein solely for the convenience of the reader in order to aid in the reader's understanding of the illustrated embodiments, and it is not the intent that the use of these directional terms in any manner limit the described, illustrated, and/or claimed features to a specific direction or orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As mentioned previously, there have been a number of drawbacks prior cartridge or cassette designs. For example, tapes of lancets, test strip and/or lancet integrated test element (LIT) units can be damaged if tightly wound around a supply reel of a reel-to-reel cassette or other cassette types. To address these issues as well as other concerns, a LIT tape according to one embodiment is stored in a folded manner within a supply compartment. By being stored in a folded manner, the tension applied to the tape during indexing is typically applied to only a few of the LIT units, which in turn reduces the chance of the LIT units being damaged. To further reduce the chance of damaging the LIT units, a feed mechanism can be used to automatically feed the tape between the supply and waste compartments of the cartridge. The feed mechanism allows the LIT units to be positioned properly for lancing and sample collection without the need for any user manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A LIT tape <b>19</b> according to one embodiment, among many, will be described initially with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the tape <b>19</b> includes multiple LIT devices or units <b>20</b>. For further information regarding the individual units <b>20</b>, reference is made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/070,502, filed Mar. 2, 2005, currently pending, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Each unit <b>20</b> includes a lancet assembly or incision forming member <b>22</b> for forming an incision in tissue, a sterility sheet <b>24</b> for maintaining the sterility of the lancet assembly <b>22</b> as well as connecting the units <b>20</b> together, and a test strip <b>26</b> for acquiring a body fluid from the incision. In the illustrated embodiment, the incision forming member <b>22</b> will described with reference to a lancet. It should be recognized that the lancet <b>22</b> can include other devices that puncture, cut, pierce, and/or otherwise ruptures tissue, like needles and blades, to name a few examples. Both the lancet <b>22</b> and the test strip or element <b>26</b> in the illustrated embodiment are generally flat such that the integrated lancing test strip <b>20</b> has an overall flat appearance. Although the common term &#x201c;test strip&#x201d; has been used to aid the reader in understanding the below described embodiments, it should be noted that the test elements or other biosensors described herein should not be limited to those shaped in the form of a strip, but rather, the test elements can be shaped differently. By being flat, multiple units <b>20</b> can be folded in compact manner inside a cartridge, which allows a plurality of units <b>20</b> to be used without the need to individually load and/or dispose of used units <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the overall flat shape allows the LIT tape <b>19</b> to be manufactured with a continuous process in which layers of component materials can be layered to form contiguous strips of units <b>20</b>. It should nonetheless be recognized that the LIT tape <b>19</b> and/or the LIT units <b>20</b> in other embodiments can have a different overall shape.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> has a retainer or guide member <b>28</b> that guides a piercing member or lancet <b>30</b> during lancing. The lancet <b>30</b> is slidably retained within a guide slot or opening <b>31</b> that is defined in a retainer <b>28</b>. In the course of lancing, the guide slot <b>31</b> guides the movement of the lancet <b>30</b> during both extension and retraction. In the illustrated embodiment, the lancet <b>30</b> and the retainer <b>28</b> are separate components that are not directly attached to one another. Nevertheless, in other embodiments, the lancet <b>30</b> and the retainer <b>28</b> can be connected to one another. For example, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can have breakable tabs that connect the lancet <b>30</b> to the retainer <b>28</b> so that the lancet <b>30</b> is held in place during manufacturing as well as prior to lancing, thereby reducing the risk of injury. During lancing, the tabs are broken to allow the lancet <b>30</b> to extend from the integrated lancing test strip <b>20</b>. In another example, a spring for retracting the lancet <b>30</b> connects the retainer <b>28</b> to the lancet <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown, end stops <b>32</b> of the retainer <b>28</b> extend inwardly at a slot opening <b>34</b> of the guide slot <b>31</b> so as to limit the movement of the lancet <b>30</b>, thereby retaining the lancet <b>30</b> in the guide slot <b>31</b>. The lancet <b>30</b> has a body portion <b>35</b> with one or more stop edges <b>36</b>, which are wider than the slot opening <b>34</b>. When the lancet <b>30</b> is fully extended, the stop edges <b>36</b> of the lancet <b>30</b> can contact the end stops <b>32</b>, and thus, limit the travel of the lancet <b>30</b>. However, in other embodiments, the firing mechanism, which is used to fire the lancet <b>30</b>, limits the travel of the lancet <b>30</b>. A neck portion <b>37</b> of the lancet <b>30</b>, which is slightly smaller that the size of the slot opening <b>34</b>, extends from the body portion <b>35</b> of the lancet <b>30</b>. During extension of the lancet <b>30</b>, the neck <b>37</b> is received between the end stops <b>32</b> such that the end stops <b>32</b> can limit undesirable rotation of the lancet <b>30</b> as the tissue is punctured. Extending from the neck <b>37</b>, the lancet <b>30</b> has a blade portion or tip <b>38</b> that is configured to cut tissue. In the illustrated embodiment, the lancet defines an engagement notch <b>39</b> for coupling the lancet <b>30</b> to a firing mechanism. In one form, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> is made at least in part of medical grade stainless steel, but it should be recognized that the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can be made of other materials, such as ceramics and/or plastics. Furthermore, it is contemplated that the guide member <b>28</b> and the lancet <b>30</b> can be made of different materials and/or manufactured separately. In one embodiment, the guide member <b>28</b> and lancet <b>30</b> are formed by a photo-etching technique in which a sheet of metal is photo-etched to form both the guide member <b>28</b> and the lancet <b>30</b>, and in another embodiment, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> is manufactured via stamping. The lancet assembly <b>22</b> in still other embodiments can be manufactured through other techniques as would occur to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after the lancet assembly <b>22</b> is formed, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can be then packaged within the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. As will be appreciated from the discussion below, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can be packaged in the sterility sheet <b>24</b> before, during, or after the lancet assembly <b>22</b> is sterilized. In the illustrated embodiment, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> is a sheet of metallic foil, and in another embodiment, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> is made of plastic. It should be recognized that the sterility sheet <b>24</b> can be made of other types of materials. During manufacturing, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> is folded into two flaps <b>40</b> with a crease or fold <b>42</b> in between, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. After folding, the lancet assemblies <b>22</b> are sandwiched between the two folds <b>40</b> such that the crease <b>42</b> closes the slot opening <b>34</b> of the guide slot <b>31</b> in the lancet assembly <b>22</b>. The flaps <b>40</b> are secured to the opposite (flat) sides of the lancet assembly <b>22</b> so that the lancet <b>30</b> is sealed inside the guide slot <b>31</b> with the slot opening <b>34</b> closed by the crease <b>42</b>. In one form, an adhesive is used to secure the sterility sheet to the guide member <b>28</b>. Adhesive is applied on the guide member <b>28</b> around the guide slot <b>31</b>, but is not applied to the lancet <b>30</b> so that the lancet <b>30</b> is able to still slide within the guide slot <b>31</b>. Although an adhesive is used in the illustrated embodiment, it should be understood that the sterility sheet <b>24</b> can be sealed with the guide member <b>28</b> in other manners, such as through heat sealing. In the illustrated embodiment, the edges of the flaps <b>40</b> are not sealed together, but it is envisioned that in other embodiments the edges of the sterility sheet <b>24</b> can be sealed together so as to form a pocket that encloses the entire lancet assembly <b>22</b>. In still yet another embodiment, instead of folding the sterility sheet <b>24</b>, two sterility sheets <b>24</b> are joined together with the lancet assembly <b>22</b> sandwiched in between.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As depicted, the integrated lancing test strips <b>20</b> in one embodiment are formed in a continuous process. In the continuous process, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> is a continuous band that is rolled off a reel and folded around a continuous band or belt of lancet assemblies <b>22</b> that are likewise rolled from a reel. The lancet assemblies <b>22</b> are sealed between the flaps <b>40</b> of the sterility sheet <b>24</b> and the test elements <b>26</b> are attached to the sheet <b>24</b> in the manner as described above. The sterility sheet <b>24</b> joins adjacent LIT units <b>20</b> together to form the continuous LIT tape <b>19</b>. Between the individual units <b>20</b>, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> has folds or weakened lines <b>43</b> that allow the tape <b>19</b> to be folded in a fan-fold fashion for storage. The fold lines <b>43</b> can also be configured to allow individual units <b>20</b> to be detached from one another. The sterility sheet <b>24</b> can be weakened at the fold lines <b>43</b> in any number of manners as would occur to those skilled in the art. For example, the sheet <b>24</b> can be scored or thinned at the fold line <b>43</b>, and it is contemplated that the fold line <b>43</b> can be continuous or discontinuous. The fold lines <b>43</b> can be formed before the lancet assembly <b>22</b> is covered by the sterility sheet <b>24</b> or afterwards. It is envisioned that the fold line <b>43</b> in other embodiments can be optional such that the tape <b>19</b> naturally folds in a fan-fold or other fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Once joined together, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> and the sterility sheet <b>24</b> form a lancet package or packet <b>44</b>. As mentioned before, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can be sterilized before being enclosed in the sterility sheet <b>24</b> or afterwards. The lancet assembly <b>22</b> can be sterilized through any number of sterilization techniques as would occur to those skilled in the art, such as through chemical, heat, and/or radiation sterilization techniques, to name a few. It should be understood that all or part of the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can be sterilized. For instance, only the lancet <b>30</b> and guide slot <b>31</b> can be sterilized, if so desired. In another embodiment, the lancet assembly <b>22</b> is sterilized after the lancet assembly <b>22</b> is packaged inside the lancet package <b>44</b>. In one form, a radiation sterilization technique is used once the lancet <b>30</b> is enclosed by the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. With the lancet package <b>44</b>, sterilization of the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can occur without exposing the test strip <b>26</b> to the undesirable affects of lancet sterilization. Consequently, the lot specific calibration data can be generated before the lancet package <b>44</b> is attached to the test strip.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the illustrated embodiment, the test strip <b>26</b> is an electro-chemical type test strip. In one particular form, the test strip <b>26</b> includes a modified version of any of the ACCU-CHEK&#xae; brand test strips (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), but it is envisioned that other types of test elements can be used. For example, the test strip <b>26</b> in other embodiments can include an optical type test strip or can analyze fluid samples in other manners. At one end, the test strip <b>26</b> in the illustrated embodiment includes a connection portion <b>46</b> with electrical contacts <b>47</b> that transmit sample readings to a meter. Opposite the connection portion <b>46</b>, the test strip <b>26</b> has a capillary channel <b>48</b> with a capillary opening <b>49</b> that is configured to draw a body fluid sample from an incision formed by the lancet <b>30</b> via capillary action. As should be appreciated, the test strip <b>26</b> inside the capillary channel <b>48</b> includes an analysis region that includes electrodes, such as working, counter and reference electrodes, and reagents for analyzing the fluid sample. In one form, the connection portion <b>46</b> is connected to a meter, and the sample readings from the electrodes in the analysis region are transmitted to the meter via the electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As briefly noted before, the sterilized lancet package <b>44</b> is attached to the test strip <b>26</b> to form the integrated lancing test strip unit <b>20</b>. As depicted, the lancet package <b>44</b> is attached at the end of the test strip <b>26</b> proximal to the capillary opening <b>49</b> of the capillary channel <b>48</b>. In particular, the guide slot opening <b>34</b> of the lancet assembly <b>22</b> and the capillary opening <b>49</b> of the test strip <b>26</b> are positioned near one another in a side-by-side relationship so that when the lancet <b>30</b> forms the incision, the capillary channel opening <b>49</b> is positioned in close proximity to collect the body fluid. The test strip <b>26</b> is attached to the exterior of the sterility sheet <b>24</b> enclosing the lancing member <b>22</b> to complete the integrated test strip <b>20</b>. The test strip <b>26</b> in one form is attached to the lancet package <b>44</b> through an adhesive, but it should be recognized that the test strip <b>26</b> and lancet package <b>44</b> can be attached in other manners. In one form, the lancet package <b>44</b> is attached to the test strip <b>26</b> such that the end edges of both are aligned with another. However, in other embodiments the edges of the lancet package <b>44</b> and the test strip <b>26</b> can be offset from one another. For example, the edge of the lancet package <b>44</b> in the illustrated embodiment, as is demarked by crease <b>42</b>, is recessed slightly from the edge of the test strip <b>26</b> at the capillary opening <b>49</b>. By having the lancet package <b>44</b> recessed, fluid flow to the capillary channel opening <b>49</b> is promoted. In another example, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> is positioned such that the crease <b>42</b> extends past the edge of the test strip <b>26</b>. With this example, all or part of the sterility sheet <b>24</b> can be hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic so as to direct fluid flow towards the capillary channel <b>48</b>. In one particular form, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> extends from the test strip <b>26</b> such that the sterility sheet <b>24</b> acts like a flexible wicking flag that draws fluid into the capillary channel <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To draw the body fluid towards the capillary channel opening <b>49</b> and away from the lancet <b>30</b>, the test strip <b>26</b> in the illustrated embodiment has a fluid direction notch facing the lancet package <b>44</b>. In order to enhance fluid flow towards the capillary channel opening <b>49</b>, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> can be treated and/or made to be hydrophobic. With the sterility sheet <b>24</b> being hydrophobic, the sterility sheet can squeegee or wipe body fluid from the lancet <b>30</b> as the lancet <b>30</b> retracts back inside the guide slot <b>31</b>. It is thought that the wiping action of the sterility sheet <b>24</b> increases the amount of body fluid available for sampling as well as makes the lancet <b>30</b> cleaner for disposal purposes. As noted before, with the lancet <b>30</b> sealed in the lancet package <b>44</b>, the risk of cross-contamination between the lancet <b>30</b> and the test strip <b>26</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the test strip <b>26</b> further defines a relief slot <b>51</b> through which a blade tip of a cam arm extends when engaging the lancet <b>30</b> during loading and firing. In addition, the relief slot <b>51</b> can be used to vent air from the capillary channel <b>48</b> as fluid is collected. The length of the relief slot <b>51</b> generally approximates the length of the lancing stroke of the firing mechanism used to actuate the lancet <b>30</b>. When the lancet package <b>44</b> is attached to the test strip <b>26</b>, the engagement notch <b>39</b> on the lancet <b>30</b> is aligned with the relief slot <b>51</b> in the test strip <b>26</b>. As is described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/070,502, filed Mar. 2, 2005, which is again incorporated by reference in its entirety, the blade tip of a cam arm for the firing mechanism extends through the engagement notch <b>39</b> of the lancet <b>30</b> as well as into the relief slot <b>51</b>. When doing so, the blade tip pierces the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. During lancing, the cam arm via the blade extends and retracts the lancet <b>30</b> relative to the test strip <b>26</b>. As the lancet <b>30</b> extends, the tip <b>38</b> of the lancet <b>30</b> pierces the sterility sheet <b>24</b> at crease <b>42</b>. In one form, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> at the crease <b>42</b> is weakened so as to aid in puncturing by the lancet <b>30</b>, but in other forms, the crease <b>42</b> is not weakened. Once the lancet <b>30</b> is retracted back inside the guide slot <b>31</b>, the two flaps <b>40</b> of the sterility sheet <b>24</b> can hold the lancet <b>30</b> inside through friction. By engaging the lancet <b>30</b> in such a manner, the risk of accidental puncturing by the integrated lancing test strip <b>22</b> is reduced because it is more difficult to manually and/or accidentally actuate the lancet <b>30</b>. It should be recognized that the lancet assembly <b>22</b> can incorporate other structures for engaging the lancet <b>30</b>. For instance, the engagement notch <b>39</b> in the lancet <b>30</b> can be replaced with a protrusion or knob. It is also contemplated that the lancet can be fired through non-mechanical and/or non-contact techniques, which do not require the puncturing of the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. As an example, the lancet <b>30</b> in another embodiment is magnetized and fired magnetically through a voice coil driver or other magnetic drivers. With the lancet <b>30</b> enclosed in the sterility sheet <b>24</b> both before and after lancing, the risk of contamination is reduced, and the risk of accidental injury is likewise reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A cartridge or cassette <b>60</b> in which the test element tape <b>19</b> is housed in illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a top view of the cartridge <b>60</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a partial, cross-sectional view of the cartridge <b>60</b>. As shown, the cartridge <b>60</b> includes a supply compartment <b>62</b> in which unused LIT units <b>20</b> are stored and a waste compartment <b>64</b> in which used units <b>20</b> are stored. Of note, the LIT units <b>20</b> on the tape <b>19</b> are folded in a fanfold fashion along fold lines <b>43</b> within the supply compartment <b>62</b>. As noted previously, LITs and test strips can be damaged when wrapped around a reel in cassettes. For example, the lancet in a LIT can be bent or the electrodes, capillary channel, and/or chemistry within the test strip can be damaged when tightly wrapped around a reel in a reel-to-reel type cassette. To avoid damage, the tape is typically wrapped in a loose manner within a reel-to-reel cassette, which tends to waste space. Even when loosely wrapped, the lancet and/or test strip can be bent or otherwise damaged. As the tape is indexed in a reel-to-reel cassette, the tape around the supply reel can tighten, which in turn can damage the components of the tape.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In contrast, the tape <b>19</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is folded along the fold lines <b>43</b> within the supply compartment, which in turn alleviates a number of issues. When folded, the tape <b>19</b> in one form may have a crease at the fold lines <b>43</b> or may not have a crease in other forms. With the tape <b>19</b> folded along the fold lines <b>43</b>, the individual LIT units <b>20</b> remain generally flat or straight, which minimizes the risk of damage. Moreover, when the tape <b>19</b> is folded, the LIT units <b>20</b> can be tightly packed within the supply compartment <b>62</b> without damaging the LIT units <b>20</b>. Further, the tape <b>19</b> can be indexed without causing significant damage to the LIT units in the folded supply tape <b>19</b>, because the pulling force for indexing is usually applied to merely a few of the LIT units <b>20</b> that are about to be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the tape <b>19</b> is folded in an alternating fanfold manner, but it should be recognized that the tape <b>19</b> can be folded in other manners. For instance, the tape <b>19</b> can be folded in an accordion fashion, and/or in another embodiment, the tape <b>19</b> includes blank sections between the fold lines <b>43</b>, which do not include LIT units <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Between the supply compartment <b>62</b> and the waste compartment <b>64</b>, the cartridge <b>60</b> has a sampling portion <b>66</b> where the LIT units <b>20</b> sample body fluid and a stabilizer arm <b>68</b> that stabilizes the connection between the compartments <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. The sampling portion <b>66</b> and/or stabilizer arm <b>68</b> can be optional or eliminated in other embodiments. As depicted, the sampling portion <b>66</b> and the stabilizer arm <b>68</b> define a meter cavity <b>70</b> in which at least a portion of the meter is received. In one embodiment, the firing cam arm of the meter, which is configured to engage the engagement notch <b>39</b> in the lancet <b>30</b> during lancing, extends within the meter cavity. In the embodiment depicted, the sampling portion <b>66</b> is generally enclosed to assist in maintaining the sterility of the cartridge <b>60</b>, but the sampling portion <b>66</b> still incorporates a number openings that are used to engage the LIT unit <b>20</b> during sampling. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sampling portion <b>66</b> near the top of the cartridge <b>60</b>, which faces the meter once engaged, has a contact opening <b>72</b> where the contacts of the meter engage the contacts <b>47</b> on the LIT units <b>20</b>. At the bottom of the cartridge <b>60</b> that contacts or faces the tissue during fluid acquisition, the sampling portion <b>66</b> of the cartridge <b>60</b> has a sample opening <b>74</b> through which the lancet <b>30</b> extends during lancing and the test strip <b>26</b> collects fluid during sampling. Near the sample opening <b>74</b> the cartridge and/or the meter can incorporate various surfaces (or mechanisms) constructed to express fluid and/or direct the flow of the fluid. Facing the meter opening <b>70</b>, the sampling portion <b>66</b> of the cartridge <b>60</b> has a lancet engagement cavity <b>76</b> through which the firing arm of the meter engages the engagement notch <b>39</b> in the lancet <b>30</b>. It is envisioned that the sampling portion <b>66</b> can be configured in other manners or can be eliminated altogether. For instance, the tape <b>19</b> can be exposed to the outside environment when in the sampling portion <b>66</b>. In another example, the compartments <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are not directly connected together so that the tape <b>19</b> is threaded through the meter in a fashion similar to a film projector.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the waste compartment <b>64</b> includes a take-up reel around which the used section of the tape <b>19</b> is wrapped. As shown, the reel defines an engagement socket <b>80</b> where the meter engages and rotates the reel <b>78</b>. As should be appreciated, the reel in other embodiments can be engaged in other manners. With the reel <b>78</b>, the units <b>20</b> on the tape <b>19</b> are able to be advanced from the storage compartment <b>62</b> to a sampling position, and then once used, the used LIT units <b>20</b> are stored in the waste compartment <b>64</b>. Once the LIT units <b>20</b> are used, the tape <b>19</b> can be wrapped tightly around the reel <b>78</b> without the worry of the resulting damage. Bending of the LIT units <b>20</b> will usually damage the units <b>20</b>, thereby preventing the LIT units <b>20</b> from being accidentally used again. Moreover, the bend in the tape <b>19</b> reduces the chance of used tape being reinserted into the supply compartment <b>62</b>, which could potentially contaminate the supply compartment <b>62</b>. To further reduce the risk of contamination, the cartridge <b>60</b> includes a ratchet mechanism <b>82</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ratchet mechanism <b>82</b> includes a pawl <b>84</b> that engages a gear <b>85</b>. The pawl <b>84</b> can be biased by a spring or other biasing devices. With such a construction, the ratchet mechanism <b>82</b> only allows the reel <b>78</b> to rotate in one direction such that the tape <b>19</b> is only able to travel inside the waste compartment <b>64</b>. It should be recognized that other types of ratchet mechanisms can be used. The waste compartment <b>64</b> further incorporates a guide spindle <b>86</b> that guides the tape <b>19</b> into the waste compartment <b>64</b>. To minimize the risk of contamination, the entrances of the compartments <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> include seals <b>88</b> that seal against opposite sides of the tape <b>19</b>. In selected embodiments, the supply compartment <b>62</b> includes a desiccant to reduce humidity in the supply compartment <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a body fluid sampling system <b>90</b> in which the cartridge <b>60</b> is coupled to a meter <b>92</b>. The cartridge <b>60</b> can be coupled to the meter <b>92</b> in any number of different manners as would occur to those skilled in the art, such as through a snap fit connection and/or through a bayonet style connection. It is envisioned that in other embodiments the cartridge <b>60</b> and meter <b>92</b> can be integrated together to form a single unit. Alternatively, the cartridge <b>60</b> and meter <b>92</b> can be completely separate, but can remotely communicate via a wireless connection or other remote connection. As depicted, the meter <b>92</b> includes a display <b>94</b> for displaying test results and other information. The meter <b>92</b> further includes one or more input buttons <b>96</b> for entering information into the meter <b>92</b> and a firing button <b>98</b> for firing the lancet <b>30</b> in the LIT unit <b>20</b>. The meter <b>92</b> can include any number of firing mechanisms for firing the lancet <b>30</b> as would occur to those skilled in the art, such as a spring loaded firing mechanism, a voice coil driver and/or an electric motor. As should be appreciated, the meter <b>92</b> in other embodiments can, alternatively or additionally, incorporate other types of input and/or output devices, like speakers, lights, keypads, and microphones, to name a few examples. Moreover, the meter <b>92</b> can be configured to connect to other devices, such as computers, via a wired or wireless connection.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To index the tape in the cartridge <b>60</b>, the meter includes an indexing mechanism <b>100</b> that engages the socket <b>80</b> in the reel <b>78</b> of the cartridge <b>60</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the indexing mechanism <b>100</b> includes a rotatable knob <b>102</b> that rotates a drive shaft <b>104</b>, which in turn engages the socket <b>80</b> in the reel <b>78</b>. The user indexes the tape <b>19</b> in the cartridge <b>60</b> by manually rotating the knob <b>102</b>, but in other embodiments, a motor can be used to automatically index the tape <b>19</b>. The indexing mechanism <b>100</b> can further incorporate a ratchet type mechanism to prevent the indexing mechanism <b>100</b> from operating backwards, thereby reducing the chance of reintroducing a contaminated section of the tape <b>19</b> back into the supply compartment <b>62</b> of the cartridge <b>60</b>. In another embodiment, the indexing mechanism <b>100</b> operates in a fashion similar to a camera in which the firing button can only be actuated when the LIT unit <b>20</b> is properly positioned over the sample opening <b>74</b> in the cartridge <b>60</b>. After the lancet <b>30</b> is fired, the indexing mechanism <b>100</b> is used to move the now used LIT unit <b>20</b> into the waste compartment <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the meter <b>92</b> includes a contact engagement member <b>106</b> that aligns with the contact opening <b>72</b> in the cartridge <b>60</b>. The contact engagement member <b>106</b> has contacts <b>108</b> that engage the contacts <b>47</b> on the LIT unit <b>20</b>, when positioned over the sample opening <b>74</b> in the cartridge <b>60</b> in order to collect fluid. In one form, the contacts <b>108</b> of the meter <b>92</b> are leaf spring type contacts, but the contacts <b>108</b> in other embodiments can have a different shape.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To use the meter <b>92</b>, the user rotates the indexing knob <b>102</b> such that the tape <b>19</b> in the cartridge <b>60</b> moves an unused LIT unit <b>20</b> into position over sample opening <b>74</b> in the cartridge <b>60</b>, and once moved into position, the contacts <b>108</b> of the meter <b>92</b> engage the contacts <b>47</b> of the unused LIT unit <b>20</b>. The tape <b>19</b> can be indexed before or after the user places the meter system <b>90</b> against the skin or other tissue to be lanced. To minimize the risk of contamination or infection, the user typically indexes the tape <b>19</b> after the test has been performed so that the used/contaminated LIT unit <b>20</b> is stored in the waste compartment <b>64</b>. Once the system <b>90</b> is placed against the incision site (or in close proximity to the site), the user presses the firing button <b>98</b>, which causes the lancet <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to fire into the tissue and subsequently retract to form an incision in the tissue. Body fluid, such as blood and/or interstitial fluid, bleeds from the newly formed incision, and the body fluid is drawn into the capillary opening <b>49</b> of the capillary channel <b>48</b> via capillary action. The electronics in the meter <b>92</b> analyze the fluid sample in the capillary channel <b>48</b>. As noted before, the electrodes in the channel <b>48</b> of the LIT unit <b>20</b> are coupled to the meter <b>92</b> via contacts <b>47</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the fluid sample is electrochemically analyzed, such as via amperometric, coulumetric, and/or potentiometric techniques, to name a few, but it should be understood that the fluid can be analyzed through other techniques, such as optically. The individual units <b>20</b> and/or the cartridge <b>60</b> can incorporate machine-readable coding, like barcodes, EEPROMS, resistance identification and the like, for calibrating the meter <b>92</b> and/or providing additional information. The results from the analysis are displayed on the display <b>94</b> of the meter <b>92</b> or outputted in some other manner. Once the sample is analyzed, the user can index the tape <b>19</b> via the indexing mechanism <b>100</b> so that the spent unit <b>20</b> is deposited in the waste compartment <b>64</b>. Once all or nearly all of the units <b>20</b> are used, the user can dispose of the cartridge <b>60</b> and replace the cartridge <b>60</b> with a new one.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An integrated test element tape <b>110</b> according to another embodiment will now be described with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The illustrated test element tape <b>110</b> shares a number of features in common with the previously described embodiments, and for the sake of clarity as well as brevity, these common features will not be described in great detail below, but reference is made to the previous discussion. In the illustrated embodiment, the sterility sheet <b>24</b> acts as a base upon which the rest of test elements (strips) <b>111</b> are formed. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, one or more electrodes <b>112</b> with contacts <b>47</b> are formed on the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. The electrodes <b>112</b> can include electrodes of the type known to those skilled in the art, such as working, counter, and/or reference electrodes. It should be understood that the tape <b>110</b> can include more or less electrodes than are shown in the drawings. Moreover, it is contemplated that one of the electrodes <b>112</b> can be formed on the sterility sheet <b>24</b>, while other electrodes <b>112</b> are formed on other layers of the test element <b>111</b>. As can be seen, the analysis ends of the electrodes <b>112</b> (as well as the sterility sheet <b>24</b>) are covered with a reagent <b>114</b> for analyzing the fluid sample. As should be appreciated, the reagent <b>114</b> includes chemicals for analyzing fluids, such as enzymes, mediators and the like, for example. It is envisioned that the reagent <b>114</b> can be applied to the sterility sheet <b>24</b> before or after the electrodes <b>112</b> are formed on the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. Moreover, in other embodiments, the reagent <b>114</b> can be applied to other layers of the tape <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each LIT unit <b>116</b> includes a spacer member <b>118</b> that in part defines the capillary channel <b>48</b>, and a vent member <b>120</b> that forms a vent slot <b>122</b> for venting air from the capillary channel <b>48</b>. A cover layer or sheet <b>124</b> covers the capillary channel <b>48</b> in a manner such that the channel opening <b>49</b> is able to collect a fluid sample. Similar to the previous embodiments, the lancet <b>22</b> is enclosed in the sterility sheet <b>24</b> by folding the flaps <b>40</b> of the sheet <b>24</b> along fold line <b>42</b> and sealing the flaps <b>40</b> together. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one of the LIT units <b>116</b> is shown with the tip <b>38</b> of the lancet <b>22</b> in an extended state in order to show how the tip <b>38</b> extends to puncture the sterility sheet <b>24</b>, but it should be understood that the tip <b>38</b> is normally retracted inside the sheet <b>24</b> prior to use. Like the previous embodiments, the tape <b>110</b> is folded along fold lines <b>43</b> for packaging the tape in the supply compartment of a cartridge. As noted previously, the tape <b>110</b> at the fold lines <b>43</b> in one embodiment can be scored, perforated, or otherwise structured to promote folding, but in other embodiments, the fold lines <b>43</b> can be no different from the rest of the tape <b>110</b> and merely demark where the tape <b>110</b> is folded.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The tape <b>110</b> can by manufactured and sterilized via a number of techniques. As should be recognized, the lancet <b>22</b> can be sterilized utilizing any number of sterilization techniques. Moreover, the lancet <b>22</b> can be sterilized before being enclosed in the sterility sheet <b>24</b>, or afterwards, such as through radiation sterilization. Some sterilization techniques are detrimental to the chemistry of reagents. A number of manufacturing techniques can be used to address this issue. In one embodiment, the lancet <b>22</b> is sterilized and enclosed within the sterility sheet <b>24</b> before the electrodes <b>112</b>, the reagent <b>114</b>, and other components of the LIT units <b>116</b> are applied to the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. This technique reduces the chance of the chemistry in the reagent <b>114</b> being affected by the sterilization of the lancet <b>22</b>. In another embodiment, some or all of components for the LIT units <b>116</b>, which are not affected by the sterilization of the lancet <b>22</b>, are attached prior to sterilization of the lancet <b>22</b>. For instance, in one technique, the electrodes <b>112</b> are formed on the sterility sheet <b>24</b> before the lancet <b>22</b> is sterilized and enclosed in the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. With another technique, the electrodes <b>112</b>, spacer <b>118</b>, and vent member <b>120</b> are attached to the sterility sheet <b>24</b> prior to the sterilization and enclosure of the lancet <b>22</b>. After sterilization, the reagent <b>114</b> is deposited into the capillary channel <b>48</b> on or near the electrodes <b>112</b>, and the cover sheet <b>124</b> is then applied over the capillary channel <b>48</b>. In still yet another embodiment, all of the components of the test element, including the reagent <b>114</b>, are assembled on the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. Afterwards, the lancets <b>22</b> are sterilized and packaged in the sterility sheet <b>24</b> (or vice versa). In order to compensate for the affects of sterilization, the lot calibration readings, which are used to calibrate a meter prior to testing, are taken after the assembled units <b>116</b> have been sterilized.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A test element tape <b>126</b> with individual LIT units <b>128</b> according to another embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The tape <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is structurally similar to and shares a number of components in common with the tape <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, and the tape <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is likewise manufactured in a similar fashion to the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. For instance, the tape includes electrodes <b>112</b> formed on the sterility sheet <b>24</b>, the reagent <b>114</b> for analyzing the fluid sample, and the lancet <b>22</b> wrapped in the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> embodiment, however, the individual units <b>128</b> are not separate and distinct, but rather, are formed from continuous layers of material. As shown, the tape <b>126</b> has a spacer layer <b>130</b> that in part defines the capillary channel <b>48</b> for each LIT unit <b>128</b>, and a vent layer <b>132</b> that forms a vent slot <b>134</b> for venting air from the capillary channel <b>48</b>. A cover layer or sheet <b>136</b> covers the capillary channel <b>48</b> in a manner such that the channel opening <b>49</b> is able to collect a fluid sample via capillary action. As shown, fold lines <b>43</b> are formed on the various layers between the individual units <b>128</b>. The sterility sheet <b>24</b> further includes tractor holes <b>138</b> for a tractor feed mechanism that is used to index the tape <b>126</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the tractor holes <b>138</b> are formed along one edge of the tape <b>126</b>, but it should be appreciated that the tractor holes <b>138</b> can be located elsewhere, formed in other layers of the tape <b>126</b>, and/or include multiple tractor hole rows. Moreover, it is contemplated that the tape <b>126</b> can be indexed in other manners. To orient and align the LIT units <b>128</b>, alignment notches <b>140</b> are punched (or formed in some other manner) along the edges of the tape <b>126</b> to create alignment members <b>142</b>, which act like alignment pins during folding and/or unfolding of the tape <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A cartridge <b>144</b> in which the test element tape <b>126</b> is housed illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown, the cartridge <b>144</b> includes a supply compartment <b>146</b> in which the unused section of the tape <b>126</b> is stored and a waste compartment <b>148</b> in which the used section of the tape <b>126</b> is housed. Between the compartments <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, the cartridge <b>144</b> has a sampling section <b>150</b> where the LIT units <b>128</b> collect and analyze fluid samples. Each compartment <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> has an access opening <b>152</b> that faces the sampling section <b>150</b>, which is sealed by seals <b>88</b>. The sampling section <b>150</b> has a sample opening <b>74</b> through which the lancet <b>22</b> lances the tissue and the unit <b>128</b> draws the fluid into the sample chamber <b>48</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sampling section <b>150</b> includes guides <b>154</b> for guiding the tape <b>126</b> and an indexing or feed mechanism <b>156</b> configured to engage the tractor holes <b>138</b> in order to index the tape <b>126</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the feed mechanism <b>156</b> includes a tractor feed mechanism, but the feed mechanism <b>156</b> can includes other types of feed or indexing mechanisms. The feed mechanism <b>156</b> includes an engagement socket <b>80</b> where the meter engages and moves the feed mechanism <b>156</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the feed mechanism <b>156</b> includes a tractor gear. As should be recognized, the tape <b>126</b> can be guided and indexed in other manners. For instance, instead of the cartridge <b>144</b>, the meter in other embodiments can incorporate the guide rollers <b>154</b> in the feed mechanism <b>156</b>. In a further example, a tractor belt or other type of indexing structure can be used in place of the tractor gear. It is contemplated that the feed mechanism <b>156</b> can incorporate a ratchet or other similar type mechanism for preventing the feed mechanism <b>156</b> from operating in reverse. Moreover, the feed mechanism <b>156</b> can incorporate contacts for the meter that engage the contacts <b>47</b> on the tape <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> cartridge <b>144</b>, the tape <b>126</b> is stored in a folded manner in both the supply <b>146</b> and waste <b>148</b> compartments, and both of the compartments <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> are oriented in a longitudinal manner. With the tape <b>126</b> folded in both compartments <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, the cartridge <b>144</b> has a generally compact configuration. During indexing, the feed mechanism <b>156</b> pulls on the tape <b>126</b> so as to unfold the tape <b>126</b> in the supply compartment <b>146</b>. In the waste compartment <b>148</b>, the tape <b>126</b> is folded along the fold lines <b>43</b> in a manner similar to a retractable wall or a folding closet door. Along both edges of the tape <b>126</b>, the waste compartment <b>148</b> has guide channels <b>158</b> in which the alignment members <b>142</b> of the tape <b>126</b> are received. As the tape <b>126</b> is advanced by the feed mechanism <b>156</b>, the guide channel <b>158</b> orients the tape <b>126</b> as the tape <b>126</b> folds. Within the sampling portion <b>150</b> of the cartridge <b>144</b>, the alignment members <b>142</b> can also be used to sense the position of and/or orient each unit <b>128</b> over the sample opening <b>74</b>. In addition to or as an alternative to the alignment members <b>142</b>, it is envisioned that the tip <b>38</b> of the lancet <b>22</b> can remain slightly extended from the tape <b>126</b> so that the lancet <b>22</b> can be received in the guide channel <b>158</b> of the waste compartment <b>148</b> in order to align and/or guide the movement of the tape <b>126</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the guide channel <b>158</b> is funnel shaped, but the guide channel <b>158</b> can have a different shape in other embodiments. It is contemplated that both compartments <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> can have guide channels <b>158</b> in order to align the tape <b>126</b>. Moreover, the compartments <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> can have the guide channels <b>158</b> on a single wall of the compartment or on two opposing walls (or even more walls). Alternatively or additionally, one or more guide channels <b>158</b> can extend through the sampling section <b>150</b> of the cartridge <b>144</b> in order to guide the movement of the tape <b>126</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a cartridge <b>164</b> configured to store and dispense the tape <b>160</b>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> embodiment, supply <b>166</b> and waste <b>168</b> compartments are oriented in a side-by-side manner to give the cartridge <b>164</b> a compact, u-shaped profile. Nevertheless, the cartridges in other embodiments can be shaped differently. For instance, the cartridges in other embodiments can have a z-shaped profile or a circular shape, to name a few examples. In the circular shaped cartridge, the supply and waste compartment can be separated by a fixed wall or a sliding wall that allows the size of the compartments to change as the tape is used; that is, the supply compartment shrinks and the waste compartment grows as the tape is indexed into the waste compartment. Returning to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the tape <b>160</b> is stored in a folded manner in both the supply <b>166</b> and waste <b>168</b> compartments.

In the depicted embodiment, the sampling portion <b>170</b> includes guides <b>154</b> for guiding the tape <b>160</b>, the feed mechanism <b>156</b>, and the sample opening <b>74</b> where the fluid sample is collected. The sampling portion <b>170</b> can be open to the outside environment, partially open, or fully closed to the outside environment. The tractor feed mechanism <b>156</b> indexes the tape <b>160</b> by engaging the tractor holes <b>138</b> in the manner as previously described. It should be recognized that the tape can be indexed in other manners, and the feed mechanism <b>156</b> can be located elsewhere, such as in one of the compartments <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> or on the meter, to name just a few examples. To guide the tape <b>160</b> as the tape <b>160</b> unfolds and folds, the compartments <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> in the illustrated embodiment include one or more guide surfaces <b>172</b> that are configured to guide the alignment members <b>142</b> on the tape <b>160</b>.

The incision forming members <b>22</b> in one form are sandwiched between folded flaps <b>40</b> of the sterility sheet <b>24</b>. However, in other forms, the incision forming members <b>22</b> can be covered in other manners. To fold the lancet tape <b>176</b>, fold lines <b>43</b> are defined between each lancet element <b>182</b>. For indexing purposes, the lancet tape <b>176</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> has a series of tractor openings <b>138</b>, but the lancet tape <b>176</b> can be indexed in other manners, which can make the tractor openings <b>138</b> optional, such as via a reel mechanism of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For storage purposes, the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> can be folded in a wide variety of fashions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates one manner in which the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> can be folded. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>, the test element tape <b>174</b> and the lancet tape <b>176</b> are joined together at every other fold line <b>43</b>, as indicated by reference numeral <b>184</b>, to create a LIT tape <b>186</b>. In other embodiments, the test element <b>174</b> and lancet <b>176</b> tapes can be joined together at other intervals, like at every third or fourth fold lines <b>43</b>. Moreover, such intervals between join lines <b>184</b> can vary within a single LIT tape <b>186</b>. In one embodiment, the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> are joined together in a face-to-face manner in which the test elements <b>178</b> generally face the lancet tape <b>176</b>, and in another embodiment, the test elements <b>178</b> face away from the lancet tape <b>176</b>. In one form, when the test elements <b>178</b> face the lancet tape <b>176</b>, the width of the lancet tape <b>176</b> is shorter such that the contacts <b>47</b> on the test element tape <b>174</b> remain exposed for contact with the meter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a cartridge <b>188</b> in which the LIT tape <b>186</b> is housed. Like the previous embodiments, the cartridge <b>188</b> includes supply <b>190</b> and waste <b>192</b> compartments in which respectively unused and used sections of the LIT tape <b>186</b> are stored. In addition, the cartridge <b>188</b> includes a sampling portion <b>194</b> where a fluid sample is collected and analyzed. The sampling portion <b>194</b> includes feed mechanism <b>156</b> for feeding the LIT tape <b>186</b>, one or more guides <b>154</b> that guide the LIT tape <b>186</b>, and the sample opening <b>74</b> through which the sample is drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the supply compartment <b>190</b>, the test elements <b>178</b> and the lancet elements <b>182</b> are packed in a stacked configuration. In other words, the test elements <b>178</b> in the test element tape <b>174</b> are folded upon one another, and the lancet elements <b>182</b> in the lancet tape <b>176</b> are folded upon one another. This results in the folded sections of the test element <b>174</b> and the lancet <b>176</b> tapes being positioned in a side-by-side fashion. As the feed mechanism <b>156</b> indexes the LIT tape <b>186</b>, the LIT tape <b>186</b> unfolds in an accordion fashion. Once the LIT tape reaches the sampling portion <b>194</b>, opposing guides <b>154</b> straighten the LIT tape <b>186</b> such that test element <b>174</b> and lancet <b>176</b> tapes are sandwiched together. Consequently, the test <b>178</b> and lancet <b>182</b> elements are brought together to create a LIT unit <b>196</b>, at least on temporary basis. In the illustrated embodiment, opposing guides <b>154</b> squeeze the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> together, but in other embodiments, other mechanisms can be used to press the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> together. Once indexed over the sample opening <b>74</b>, the lancet unit <b>182</b> of the LIT unit <b>196</b> can be used to form an incision from which a fluid sample is drawn and analyzed via the test element <b>178</b> of the LIT unit <b>196</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Afterwards, the now used LIT unit <b>196</b> is indexed into the waste compartment <b>192</b>. In the waste compartment <b>192</b>, the test element <b>174</b> and lancet element <b>176</b> tapes spread apart in an accordion fashion until the LIT tape <b>186</b> is folded in a stacked fashion like in the supply compartment <b>190</b>. With such a construction, the packing density of the LIT tape <b>186</b> is enhanced such that the length of the supply <b>190</b> and waste <b>192</b> compartments can be shortened. Moreover, the risk of cross contamination between the test elements <b>178</b> and the lancet elements <b>182</b> before use is reduced because the test elements <b>178</b> and lancet elements <b>182</b> remain generally apart prior to use and only come into full contact just before use.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A variation of a test element tape <b>198</b> and lancet tape <b>200</b> that can be used in the cartridge <b>188</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, as well as other types of cartridges, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. As can be seen, the test element tape <b>198</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has the test elements <b>178</b> disposed on every other section of the sterility sheet <b>24</b>, such that test elements <b>178</b> have blank or cover sections <b>202</b> in between the fold lines <b>43</b>. Likewise, the lancet tape <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> has cover sections <b>202</b> in between the lancet elements <b>182</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, only a single cover section <b>202</b> is located between the test <b>178</b> and lancet <b>182</b> elements, but in other embodiments, more than one cover section <b>202</b> can be located in between the elements <b>178</b>, <b>182</b>. The intervals of cover sections <b>202</b> can vary within the tape and/or vary from tape to tape. Moreover, the test tape <b>198</b> and the lancet tape <b>200</b> can have different intervals of cover sections <b>202</b>. The cover sections <b>202</b> of the sterility sheet <b>24</b> fold over the test <b>178</b> and lancet <b>182</b> elements so as to protect and maintain the sterility of the elements <b>178</b>, <b>182</b>. As the tapes <b>198</b>, <b>200</b> unfold, the cover sections <b>202</b> peel off the test <b>178</b> and lancet <b>182</b> elements, thereby exposing the test <b>178</b> and lancet <b>182</b> elements for testing purposes. For the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> cartridge <b>188</b>, the test <b>198</b> and lancet <b>200</b> tapes can be connected at join locations <b>184</b> or at other locations. In other embodiments, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the test <b>198</b> and lancet <b>200</b> tapes can be disconnected before, during, and/or after collecting the fluid sample.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a LIT cartridge <b>204</b> according to another embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment, the cartridge <b>204</b> has a supply compartment <b>206</b> and a waste compartment <b>208</b> in which the test element tape <b>174</b> and the lancet tape <b>176</b> are stored separately. With the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> separate, sterilization and calibration can be simplified along with the risk of cross contamination can be reduced. In other embodiments, the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> can be connected together for storage purposes before or after use. It should be recognized that the cartridge <b>204</b> can house a variety of tapes, like the test element tape <b>198</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and/or the lancet tape <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, to name a few examples. Between the supply <b>206</b> and waste <b>208</b> compartments, the cartridge <b>204</b> has a sampling portion <b>210</b> where the fluid sample is acquired and/or analyzed. In one embodiment, the sampling portion <b>210</b> includes one or more tape guides <b>154</b>, one or more feed mechanisms <b>156</b>, and the sampling opening <b>74</b> where the fluid is sampled. In the embodiment shown, the sampling portion <b>210</b> includes two pairs of guides <b>154</b> that position the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> in close proximity to one another or in contact with one another so as to form, at least on a temporary basis, a LIT unit <b>212</b> for sampling and analyzing fluid samples. In one form, the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> are pressed against another so that the test element <b>178</b> is able to collect fluid from the incision formed with the lancet element <b>182</b>. In other forms, the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> can be spaced slightly apart, but still in close proximity so that the test element <b>178</b> is still able to collect fluid. It should be understood that the sampling portion <b>210</b> can be configured differently in other embodiments. For example, the guides <b>154</b> can be optional in other embodiments and/or other types of feed mechanisms <b>156</b> can be used. The waste compartment <b>208</b> in the embodiment shown includes a separator member <b>214</b> that separates the tapes <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> apart, but the separator member <b>214</b> can be optional in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">From the previous discussion, it should be appreciated that the LIT units as well as the meters can be used to sample and analyze body fluid from various body parts like fingers and alternate sites, such as the forearm, for example. Moreover, the LIT units can be used to analyze numerous types of body fluids, such as interstitial fluid and blood, to name a few examples. The body fluid samples can be collected from body fluid bled onto the surface of the tissue or can be directly drawn from below the surface of the tissue. It also should be recognized that the features of the cartridges can be modified for use in other types of meters besides the one illustrated in the drawings. Conversely, the above-described meters can be used in conjunction with other types of cartridges. The cartridges and/or tapes can include machine readable coding that can provide a wide variety of information, such as lot coding and calibration information. For instance, the cartridges can include machine readable coding like barcodes, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, magnetic encoding, electronic memory chips, and/or identification resistors, to name a few examples.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is envisioned that that compartments in the cartridges can be integrated together to form a single unit or can be separate. Further, the waste and supply compartments in other embodiments can incorporate springs or other biasing members to bias the tapes. Moreover, the supply compartments can include desiccants for stabilizing the humidity of the supply compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Regarding the tapes for the above-discussed embodiments, it is contemplated that a leader section can be incorporated into the tapes. It also should be appreciated that the tapes can be folded and/or oriented in other manners, besides in the manners as illustrated in the drawings. Furthermore, the LIT units in further embodiments can be configured in manners different from those shown in the drawings. For example, the lancet can be immovable or fixed relative to the test element. In another example, the lancet retracts via a rotational movement instead of linearly and/or the lancet extends at an angle relative to the opening of the capillary channel. It is contemplated that selected features from the various embodiments can be combined together in any number of other combinations. For instance, the waste compartment reel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be incorporated into the other illustrated embodiments in order to index the tape. Moreover, selected features can be adapted for other tapes that are used to collect and/or analyze body fluid samples, such as lancet tapes or test strip tapes.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected.
