When the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> has moved to the locked position, the lock body <b>17</b> engages with the inner shutter locked portion <b>53</b>, and the inner shutter <b>51</b> is fixed in the front-back direction, i.e., locked.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the first exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the lock body <b>17</b> and the inner shutter locked portion <b>53</b> are configured such that the back surfaces <b>17</b><i>d </i>of the protrusions <b>17</b><i>b </i>are inclined in the left forward direction and the front surfaces <b>53</b><i>d </i>of the protrusions <b>53</b><i>a </i>are inclined in the left forward direction. Therefore, even if the lock body <b>17</b> has not been retracted to the unlocked position before the inner shutter locked portion <b>53</b> reaches the lock body <b>17</b> or even if the lock body <b>17</b> has returned to the locked position before the back end of the inner shutter <b>51</b> reaches the inner shutter stopper surface <b>6</b><i>b </i>due to a manufacturing error or an assembly error of the lock release projection <b>37</b> or the slider projection <b>18</b>, the front surfaces <b>53</b><i>d </i>of the protrusions <b>53</b><i>a </i>applies a force to the back surfaces <b>17</b><i>d </i>of the protrusions <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the lock body <b>17</b> in the left forward direction as the toner cartridge TC is inserted, whereby a leftward component of the force acts on the lock body <b>17</b>. Thus, the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> moves leftward to the unlocked position, and the protrusions <b>53</b><i>a </i>are allowed to move forward by passing over the protrusions <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the inner shutter lock <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">When the toner cartridge TC moves backward from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, the inner shutter <b>51</b> contacts the inner shutter stopper surface <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> is locked, the movement of the inner shutter <b>51</b> is stopped, and the connection hole portion <b>33</b> moves backward while being guided by the holder-side guides <b>7</b> of the supply port portion <b>6</b>. That is, the inner shutter <b>51</b> moves relative to the connection hole <b>33</b><i>a</i>, and the inner shutter <b>51</b> moves from the inner shutter closed position to the inner shutter open position.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">When the toner cartridge TC has moved to the back end of the cartridge holder KH, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, the inner shutter <b>51</b> moves to the inner shutter open position, the connection hole <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the supply port <b>6</b><i>a </i>are connected to each other, and the installation of the toner cartridge TC is finished.

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">With toner cartridge TC according to the first exemplary embodiment, by performing one operation of inserting the toner cartridge TC backward, both the outer shutter <b>61</b> and the inner shutter <b>51</b> are opened and the connection hole <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the supply port <b>6</b><i>a </i>are connected to each other.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">With the toner cartridge TC according to the first exemplary embodiment, the inner shutter <b>51</b> guides the outer shutter <b>61</b> when opening and closing the outer shutter <b>61</b>.

In contrast, with the first exemplary embodiment, the extension guide <b>54</b> of the inner shutter <b>51</b> guides the outer shutter <b>61</b>, so that the movement of the outer shutter <b>61</b> is stabilized, the inner shutter <b>51</b> and the extension guide <b>54</b> are integrated, whereby the structure of the toner cartridge TC is simplified and a guide member that may hinder the operation of opening and closing the inner shutter <b>51</b> is not necessary.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Description of Removal of Cartridge</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When removing the toner cartridge TC after a developer in the toner cartridge TC has been depleted, the toner cartridge TC is pulled out from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>. At this time, the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> is locking the inner shutter <b>51</b>, thereby restraining backward movement of the inner shutter <b>51</b>. Therefore, if, for example, the downstream end of the shutter in the pull-out direction is clamped, a gap extending in the direction in which the shutter is extracted is inevitably generated between the clamped portion and the shutter due to a manufacturing error or the like. In this case, when pulling out the toner cartridge, the shutter may be displaced in the downstream direction, so that a gap may appear between the shutter and the supply port portion and the developer may leak from the gap.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In contrast, with the first exemplary embodiment, movement of the inner shutter <b>51</b> in a lateral direction with respect to the front-back direction in which the toner cartridge TC is removed is restrained, so that a gap in the front-back direction of the inner shutter <b>51</b> does not appear. Therefore, when pulling out the toner cartridge TC, the inner shutter <b>51</b> is not easily separated from the inner shutter stopper surface <b>6</b><i>b</i>, and a gap does not easily appear between the inner shutter <b>51</b> and the inner shutter stopper surface <b>6</b><i>b</i>. Thus, when the connection hole portion <b>33</b> passes a space above the inner shutter <b>51</b> and the inner shutter stopper surface <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a developer is prevented from flowing downward through the connection hole <b>33</b><i>a </i>and accumulated in such a gap. Thus, the inner shutter <b>51</b> is prevented from being smeared with overflowed developer, and smearing of the cartridge holder KH and the toner cartridge TC is suppressed. Moreover, an operator and a floor on which the printer U is placed are prevented from being smeared.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In particular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, in the lock body <b>17</b> and the inner shutter locked portion <b>53</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment, the front surfaces <b>17</b><i>d </i>of the protrusions <b>17</b><i>b </i>are inclined in the right forward direction and the back surfaces <b>53</b><i>c </i>of the protrusions <b>53</b><i>a </i>are inclined in the left backward direction. Therefore, as the toner cartridge TC is pulled out forward, the back surfaces <b>53</b><i>c </i>of the protrusions <b>53</b><i>a </i>apply a force to the front surfaces <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the protrusions <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the lock body <b>17</b> in the right backward direction, whereby a rightward component of the force acts on the lock body <b>17</b>. Thus, the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> receives a force to move the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> further rightward, and a force that may push the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> toward the unlocked position does not act on the inner shutter lock <b>14</b>. Therefore, even if a force that may move the inner shutter <b>51</b> forward is generated by friction when the toner cartridge TC moves forward, a force is applied in a direction such that the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> and the inner shutter locked portion <b>53</b> become engaged with each other, whereby locking of the inner shutter <b>51</b> is not released and backward movement of the inner shutter <b>51</b> is restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the first exemplary embodiment, the lock side wall <b>12</b> is disposed on the front and back sides of the lock body <b>17</b>. Therefore, even if a backward force is applied to the lock body <b>17</b>, the lock side wall <b>12</b> contacts the lock body <b>17</b> and restrains the lock body <b>17</b> from being inclined or collapsed. Therefore, as compared with the case where the lock side wall <b>12</b> is not provided, backward movement of the inner shutter <b>51</b> is further reliably restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, when the toner cartridge TC has been pulled out from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> to the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, the inner shutter <b>51</b> moves relative to the connection hole <b>33</b><i>a</i>, and the inner shutter <b>51</b> closes the connection hole <b>33</b><i>a</i>. In this state, the front guided surface <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the lock release projection <b>37</b> has moved to the back of the back guide surface <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the slider projection <b>18</b>, and the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> is held at the locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">When the toner cartridge TC has been pulled out from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> to the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>, the lock release projection <b>37</b> contacts the slider projection <b>18</b> of the inner shutter lock <b>14</b>, and the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> starts moving toward the unlocked position. Thus, the inner shutter lock <b>14</b> becomes separated from the inner shutter <b>51</b>, and the inner shutter <b>51</b> is unlocked. Accordingly, the inner shutter <b>51</b> becomes ready to move forward, and as the toner cartridge TC is pulled out forward, the inner shutter <b>51</b> is integrally moved forward as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 20B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">When the toner cartridge TC is pulled out from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, the outer opening/closing projection <b>62</b>, which has been guided by the back groove portion <b>3</b><i>c</i>, passes the spiral groove portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, and the outer shutter <b>61</b> moves rightward along the cartridge body <b>31</b>, i.e., toward the outer shutter closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">When the toner cartridge TC is further pulled out from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the outer opening/closing projection <b>62</b> moves along the spiral groove portion <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and the outer shutter <b>61</b> closes the outside of the inner shutter <b>51</b> and moves toward the outer shutter closed position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. At this time, in the first exemplary embodiment, the cartridge holder KH includes the protuberance <b>3</b><i>h </i>protruding rightward at the front end of the spiral groove portion <b>3</b><i>b</i>, so that the outer opening/closing projection <b>62</b> is pressed rightward, i.e., toward the outer shutter closed position. Therefore, as compared with the case where the protuberance <b>3</b><i>h </i>is not provided, the outer shutter <b>61</b> is easily moved toward the outer shutter closed position, and the possibility of the occurrence of half-open state, which is a state in which the outer shutter <b>61</b> is not properly moved to the outer shutter closed position, is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">When the toner cartridge TC has been further pulled from the state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the toner cartridge TC is removed from the printer body U<b>1</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>. Thus, with the first exemplary embodiment, by performing one operation of pulling out the toner cartridge TC forward, both the outer shutter <b>61</b> and the inner shutter <b>51</b> are closed in this order and the connection hole <b>33</b><i>a </i>is closed. Therefore, as compared a structure that requires two operations, pulling out of the toner cartridge is simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Moreover, in the toner cartridge TC according to the first exemplary embodiment, the opening/closing direction of the inner shutter <b>51</b> intersects the opening/closing direction of the outer shutter <b>61</b>. When the opening/closing direction of the two shutters are the same, it is necessary to move the outer shutter in a range that is larger than the range in which the inner shutter is moved, so that the movement distance of the outer shutter becomes large, which may raise a problem in that the size of the toner cartridge TC is increased. In the first exemplary embodiment, the two shutters <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> move in directions that intersect each other, whereby the size of the toner cartridge TC may be reduced.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Description of Movement when Opening Outer Shutter</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> illustrate the outer shutter according to the first exemplary embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> illustrating a state in which the outer shutter has moved from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> toward the outer shutter open position, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> illustrating a state in which the outer shutter is inclined from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref> illustrating the plate spring portion before and after being inclined.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">When the toner cartridge TC according to the first exemplary embodiment is removed from the printer body U<b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the plate spring portion <b>68</b> is elastically deformed by being pushed by the spring contact projection <b>43</b>, and the outer shutter <b>61</b> is urged backward. Therefore, the outer lock tab <b>34</b> engages with the outer lock recess <b>67</b> of the outer shutter <b>61</b>. Therefore, if an external force that may move the outer shutter <b>61</b> leftward toward the outer shutter open position acts on the outer shutter <b>61</b> when, for example, an operator or the like touches the outer shutter <b>61</b>, the outer lock recess <b>67</b> and the right end surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the outer lock tab <b>34</b> contact each other, so that rotation of the outer shutter <b>61</b> is restrained as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">When the toner cartridge TC is inserted into the cartridge holder KH and the outer opening/closing projection <b>62</b> of the outer shutter <b>61</b> contacts the spiral groove portion <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the opening force <b>69</b> oriented in the left forward direction is applied to the outer opening/closing projection <b>62</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. A forward component of the opening force <b>69</b> is cancelled out by a force generated by the plate spring portion <b>68</b>, which urges the outer shutter <b>61</b> backward. Therefore, a leftward component of the opening force <b>69</b> acts on the outer shutter <b>61</b>, and the outer shutter <b>61</b> is moved toward the outer shutter open position until the outer lock recess <b>67</b> and the right end surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the outer lock tab <b>34</b> contact each other as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>. That is, backlash is reduced until the outer shutter <b>61</b> contacts the outer lock tab <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">When the outer shutter <b>61</b> has moved to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, as described above, movement of the outer shutter <b>61</b> is restrained due to contact between the outer lock recess <b>67</b> and the outer lock tab <b>34</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 23A</figref>, in the first exemplary embodiment, a contact point at which the outer lock recess <b>67</b> contacts the outer lock tab <b>34</b> is located downstream of the extension line <b>69</b><i>a </i>of the opening force <b>69</b> with respect to the clockwise direction. When the opening force <b>69</b> is generated in the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, the outer shutter <b>61</b> receives a force that rotates the outer shutter <b>61</b> around the contact point between the outer lock recess <b>67</b> and the outer lock tab <b>34</b>. Therefore, the outer shutter <b>61</b> becomes inclined clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 23B</figref> while the outer lock recess <b>67</b> remains in contact with the outer lock tab <b>34</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the outer shutter <b>61</b> becomes inclined until the left end of the back guide rail <b>64</b> of the outer shutter <b>61</b> contacts the outer shutter back guide <b>42</b>. In the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, as the outer shutter <b>61</b> becomes inclined, the outer lock recess <b>67</b> is moved in the right forward direction, i.e., in a direction away from the outer lock tab <b>34</b>, and engagement between the outer lock recess <b>67</b> and the outer lock tab <b>34</b> becomes loose.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, as the outer shutter <b>61</b> becomes inclined, the base end portion <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the plate spring portion <b>68</b> also becomes inclined and is moved forward. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>, a solid line illustrates the plate spring portion <b>68</b> before the outer shutter <b>61</b> is inclined, and a two-dot chain line illustrates the plate spring portion <b>68</b> after the outer shutter <b>61</b> has been inclined. That is, with respect to the state in which the plate spring portion <b>68</b> is not elastically deformed, which is illustrated with a broken line and a dotted-chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>, the amount of elastic deformation of the plate spring portion <b>68</b> before the outer shutter <b>61</b> is inclined is smaller than the amount of elastic deformation of the plate spring portion <b>68</b> after the outer shutter <b>61</b> has been inclined. Therefore, in the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, a force generated by the plate spring portion <b>68</b> to urge the outer shutter <b>61</b> backward is smaller than the force in the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, when the opening force <b>69</b> acts on the outer shutter <b>61</b>, the outer shutter <b>61</b>, which is restrained from being moved leftward and from being inclined, counteracts the urging force of the plate spring portion <b>68</b> and moves forward due to the forward component of the force. At this time, in the first exemplary embodiment, as described above, an urging force generated by the plate spring portion <b>68</b> to urge the outer shutter <b>61</b> backward is reduced, so that a force needed to move the outer shutter <b>61</b> forward is smaller than that when the urging force is not reduced. Therefore, when inserting the toner cartridge TC, a load and an insertion resistance applied to the operator is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">At this time, in the first exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the degree of engagement between the outer lock recess <b>67</b> and the outer lock tab <b>34</b> is decreased as the outer shutter <b>61</b> becomes inclined, so that the outer lock recess <b>67</b> may be disengaged from the outer lock tab <b>34</b> with a small forward movement of the outer shutter <b>61</b>. That is, the deformation amount of the plate spring portion <b>68</b> when the outer shutter <b>61</b> moves forward is reduced, whereby a load and an insertion resistance applied to an operator is reduced.</p>
