<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to high-frequency dielectric heating using a magnetron like a microwave oven and, in particular, to overheat protection for semiconductor switching elements used in an inverter and prevention of overvoltage applied to the magnetron.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hitherto, in a high-frequency dielectric heating apparatus using a magnetron such as a microwave oven, electric power supplied to the magnetron has been adjusted based on the pulse width of output signal from an inverter controller. To increase the output power, the pulse width of the output signal form the inverter controller has been widened, thereby increasing the electric power supplied to the magnetron. This configuration makes it possible to continuously change heat output of the magnetron.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram including a magnetron used in a high-frequency dielectric heating apparatus in a prior art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, alternating current from a commercial power supply <b>11</b> is rectified to direct current by a rectifier <b>13</b> and the direct current is smoothed through a choke coil <b>14</b> on the output side of the rectifier <b>13</b> and a smoothing capacitor <b>15</b> and is given to the input side of an inverter <b>16</b>. The direct current is converted into any desired high frequency (20 to 40 kHz) by turning on/off a semiconductor switching element, IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) in the inverter <b>16</b>. The inverter <b>16</b> includes IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>for switching the direct current at high speed and a capacitor <b>16</b><i>b </i>and is driven by an inverter controller <b>161</b> for controlling the inverter <b>16</b> to switch on/off electric current flowing through the primary side of a boosting transformer <b>18</b> at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the boosting transformer <b>18</b>, high-frequency voltage output by the inverter <b>16</b> is applied to a primary winding <b>181</b> and a high voltage responsive to the turns ratio is obtained at a secondary winding <b>182</b>. A winding <b>183</b> with a smaller number of turns is provided on the secondary side of the boosting transformer <b>18</b> and is used to heat a filament (heater, cathode) <b>121</b> of a magnetron <b>12</b>. The secondary winding <b>182</b> of the boosting transformer <b>18</b> includes a voltage-doubling rectifier <b>20</b> for rectifying output of the secondary winding. The voltage-doubling rectifier <b>20</b> is made up of high voltage capacitors <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> and two high voltage diodes <b>203</b> and <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A thermistor <b>9</b> for detecting the temperature of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>is attached directly to a leg part of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>or the proximity of the leg part. The leg part is an emitter leg and a chip (chip thermistor) forming the thermistor is soldered on the solder face of the back of a printed board <b>6</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) rather than the radiation fin side. Temperature information provided by the thermistor is input to the inverter controller <b>161</b> and is used to control the inverter <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the printed board <b>6</b> on which a radiation fin <b>7</b>, the IGBT <b>8</b> (<b>16</b><i>a</i>), and the thermistor <b>9</b> are placed. The heating part of the IGBT <b>8</b> for generating high heat is fixed to the radiation fin <b>7</b> and three legs are inserted into through holes of the printed board and are soldered on the opposite side (back, solder side). The chip thermistor is used as the thermistor <b>9</b> and is soldered directly to the legs of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>on the solder face of the back of the printed board <b>6</b> rather than the radiation fin side.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the configuration, a method of preventing thermal destruction of the IGBT for switching the inverter power supply, so-called power down control of stopping or powering down before thermal destruction of the IGBT to prevent a temperature rise is executed. An outline of the power down control is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">(1) When the IGBT temperature reaches a detection temperature, first the power is decreased to a first predetermined value (for example, about a half) without suddenly turning off the power. Then, when the IGBT temperature lowers and falls below the detection temperature, again the power is restored to predetermined power and when the IGBT temperature rises and again reaches the detection temperature, again powering down is performed. This operation sequence is repeated for keeping the detection temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">(2) A given control width signal is always given from a microcomputer, and in the inverter, the thermistor detects the temperature of the IGBT and sends a detection value to the inverter controller for controlling the inverter so as to lower the temperature of the IGBT.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(3) The thermistor is previously inserted into one of partial pressure circuits and gradual decrease control is performed based on the partial pressure ratio when the thermistor detects overheat temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(4) When the gradual decrease control reaches at a certain point in time, the target value is largely decreased and this control is repeated. One cycle of the gradual decrease control is about one to two seconds at shortest. Such control is made possible by lessening a heat time constant as the chip thermistor is provided on the terminal back of the IGBT as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, even when a foreign substance is caught in a fan for some reason and the fan abruptly stops, immediately cooking is stopped. In the configuration, however, attention is focused on the fact that thermal destruction of the IGBT does not easily occur if the fan fails, and cooking is allowed to continue. When the temperature of the IGBT rises and reaches a temperature before the temperature at which thermal destruction of the IGBT occurs, then the power is decreased to about a half and heating is allowed to continue. In such control, if the cooking is ordinarily performed, the user feels that warming is a little slow, and can be allowed to continue cooking without feelings of anxiety of a failure; mental anxiety can be circumvented.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Similar comments are also applied when the fan is locked; the heating operation can be allowed to continue at the minimum output to such an extent that the IGBT is not thermally destroyed without shutting down the power.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are drawings to describe the power down control system described above; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a circuit diagram and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a timing chart showing the operation of a comparator.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the potential at a point P<b>3</b> provided by dividing the collector voltage of IGBT using partial pressure resistors R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b> is input to a (A) terminal of one of two input terminals of a comparator CO<b>1</b> and during starting, a changeover switch S<b>1</b> is at the position of an a terminal and 3 V is applied to the other (C) terminal. When a magnetron heats and enters a stationary state (stationary operation) from the starting, the changeover switch S<b>1</b> switches to the position of a b terminal and the potential at a Pc point provided by dividing Vcc voltage using a partial pressure resistor R<b>1</b> and a thermistor T<b>1</b> (reference numeral <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) is input.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since the thermistor T<b>1</b> has a characteristic that the resistance value decreases with a temperature rise, when the detection temperature of the thermistor is a predetermined value, the collector voltage gradually decreases from the point like (C) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. During the starting, the inverter controller <b>161</b> controls the ON/OFF duty of the IGBT so that the P<b>3</b> potential roughly matches 3 V based on ON/OFF information of the comparator CO<b>1</b> and thus the collector voltage of the IGBT becomes lower than that at the stationary time. When the stationary state is entered, sufficiently high Pc potential as compared with 3 V at the starting time is input to the (C) terminal of the comparator CO<b>1</b>. Therefore, the inverter controller <b>161</b> increases the ON duty of ON/OFF control of the IGBT so that the P<b>3</b> potential (A) roughly matches the Pc potential (C), and the collector voltage of the IGBT also increases. However, although not shown in the figure, a limitation is imposed on the rise in the ON duty mentioned above by a power control function of controlling based on another input signal, included in the inverter controller <b>161</b> and thus the Pc potential (C) always becomes higher than the P<b>3</b> potential (A) and output of the comparator CO<b>1</b> is maintained on at all times, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. However, since the resistance of the thermistor T<b>1</b> decreases with heating of the IGBT because of cooling shortage, etc., when the Pc potential (C) becomes the same as the P<b>3</b> potential (A), again ON/OFF is started. The inverter controller <b>161</b> decreases the ON duty of ON/OFF control of the IGBT so that the P<b>3</b> potential (A) decreases following the decrease in the Pc potential (C) and thus output of the inverter decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, in the power down control, the inverter section starts the magnetron and after the stationary state is entered, output voltage of the inverter section is made to depend on the resistance value of the thermistor and thus if the fan does not rotate for some reason, the inverter section is allowed to continue the operation without shutting down the power. As the temperature of the IGBT rises, the resistance value of the thermistor decreases and output of the inverter decreases, so that the user can continue cooking with such a feeling that the heating temperature is a little low.

<p id="p-0019" num="0019">The power down control described above makes it possible to continue cooking under a given condition without suddenly stopping the cooking, and the usability of the high-voltage dielectric heating apparatus improves for the user. However, when the temperature later falls and the usual operating state is made possible, if the inverter controller again increases output of the magnetron, a so-called moding phenomenon or overshoot occurs and the inverter-control may stop.

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">An embodiment of the present invention will be discussed below in detail with the accompanying drawings:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a high-frequency dielectric heating apparatus according to the present invention. A magnetron <b>12</b> for generating a microwave generates a microwave and heats an object to be heated such as food stored in a cabinet of a high-frequency dielectric heating apparatus such as a microwave oven. A magnetron drive control circuit <b>100</b> includes an inverter main circuit <b>10</b> for receiving supply of AC power from an AC power supply <b>11</b>, a thermistor <b>9</b>, and an inverter controller <b>161</b> for controlling the inverter main circuit <b>10</b>, and the magnetron drive control circuit <b>100</b> performs drive control of the magnetron <b>12</b> for generating, stopping, and changing output of a microwave.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">The inverter main circuit <b>10</b> supplies the AC power from the AC power supply <b>11</b> to the magnetron <b>12</b> and includes a rectifier <b>13</b> of diode bridge type, a smoothing circuit <b>30</b>, an inverter <b>16</b>, a boosting transformer <b>18</b>, a resonance circuit <b>36</b>, and a voltage-doubling rectifier <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">Alternating current from the commercial power supply <b>11</b> is rectified to direct current by the rectifier <b>13</b> and the direct current is smoothed through a choke coil <b>14</b> on the output side of the rectifier <b>13</b> and a smoothing capacitor <b>15</b> (smoothing circuit <b>30</b>) and is given to the input side of the inverter <b>16</b>. The inverter <b>16</b> includes an IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) <b>16</b><i>a </i>for switching direct current at high speed and a capacitor <b>16</b><i>b </i>and the direct current is converted into any desired high frequency (20 to 40 kHz) by turning on/off the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The inverter <b>16</b> is driven by an inverter controller <b>161</b> described later for switching on/off electric current flowing through the primary side of the boosting transformer <b>18</b> at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">In the boosting transformer <b>18</b>, high-frequency voltage output by the inverter <b>16</b> is applied to a primary winding <b>181</b> and a high voltage responsive to the turns ratio is obtained at a secondary winding <b>182</b>. A winding <b>183</b> with a smaller number of turns is provided on the secondary side of the boosting transformer <b>18</b> and is used to heat a filament (heater, cathode) <b>121</b> of the magnetron <b>12</b>. The secondary winding <b>182</b> of the boosting transformer <b>18</b> is connected to a voltage-doubling rectifier <b>20</b> for rectifying output of the secondary winding and a high voltage is applied between the cathode <b>121</b> and an anode <b>122</b> for generating a microwave. The voltage-doubling rectifier <b>20</b> is made up of high voltage capacitors <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> and two high voltage diodes <b>203</b> and <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">The resonance circuit <b>36</b> is implemented as a parallel circuit of the capacitor <b>16</b><i>b </i>and the primary winding <b>181</b> of the boosting transformer <b>18</b> and the primary winding <b>181</b> is assumed to be a part of the inverter <b>16</b>, whereby the resonance circuit can be grasped as a component circuit of the inverter <b>16</b>. A rectifying diode <b>16</b><i>d </i>is connected to the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>in parallel; in the embodiment, the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the rectifying diode <b>16</b><i>d </i>make up a switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">A thermistor <b>9</b> functions as a temperature detection section for detecting the temperature of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>and is attached to a leg part of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>or the proximity of the leg part according to a similar method to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As the thermistor <b>9</b>, any of various types such as an NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistor with resistance decreasing with a temperature rise, a PTC (positive temperature coefficient) thermistor with resistance increasing with a temperature rise, or a CTR (critical temperature coefficient) thermistor with resistance abruptly decreasing when a predetermined temperature is exceeded can be used. In the embodiment, the NTC thermistor wherein the relationship between temperature and resistance value changes proportionally is used. The temperature detection section for detecting the temperature of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>is not limited to the thermistor and any of various devices can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">The inverter controller <b>161</b> switches on and off the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the inverter <b>16</b> at high speed under the duty ratio set in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control and turns on and off electric current flowing through the primary side of the boosting transformer <b>18</b> at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">In the configuration, a method of preventing thermal destruction of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a</i>, so-called power down control of stopping or powering down before thermal destruction of the IGBT to prevent a temperature rise is executed by the inverter controller <b>161</b>. An outline of the power down control is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">(1) When the IGBT temperature reaches a detection temperature, first the power is decreased to a first predetermined value (for example, about a half) without suddenly turning off the power. Then, when the IGBT temperature lowers and falls below the detection temperature, again the power is restored to predetermined power and when the IGBT temperature rises and again reaches the detection temperature, again powering down is performed. This operation sequence is repeated for keeping the detection temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">(2) A given control width signal is always given from a microcomputer and in the inverter, the thermistor detects the temperature of the IGBT and sends a detection value to the inverter controller for controlling the inverter so as to lower the temperature of the IGBT.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">(3) The thermistor is previously inserted into one of partial pressure circuits and gradual decrease control is performed based on the partial pressure ratio when the thermistor detects overheat temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">(4) When the gradual decrease control reaches at a certain point in time, the target value is largely decreased and this control is repeated. One cycle of the gradual decrease control is about one to two seconds at shortest. Such control is made possible by lessening a heat time constant as the chip thermistor is provided on the terminal back of the IGBT as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">Therefore, even when a foreign substance is caught in a fan for some reason and the fan abruptly stops, immediately cooking is stopped. In the configuration, however, attention is focused on the fact that thermal destruction of the IGBT does not easily occur if the fan fails, and cooking is allowed to continue. When the temperature of the IGBT rises and reaches a temperature before the temperature at which thermal destruction of the IGBT occurs, then the power is decreased to about a half and heating is allowed to continue. In such control, if the cooking is ordinarily performed, the user feels that warming is a little slow, and can be allowed to continue cooking without feelings of anxiety of a failure; mental anxiety can be circumvented.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">Similar comments are also applied when the fan is locked; the heating operation can be allowed to continue at the minimum output to such an extent that the IGBT is not thermally destroyed without shutting down the power.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">The power down control described above makes it possible to continue cooking under a given condition without suddenly stopping the cooking, and the usability of the high-voltage dielectric heating apparatus improves for the user. However, when the temperature later falls and the usual operating state is made possible, if the inverter controller again increases output of the magnetron, the moding phenomenon occurs and the inverter-control may stop. This is because if the output of the magnetron is increased from low output under the power down control to usual output, the filament becomes open or a state close to open and an overvoltage may be applied to the filament and its peripheral circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a drawing to show the configuration of one embodiment of the inverter controller according to the present invention. The inverter controller <b>161</b> includes a sub-control circuit <b>1</b>, a sub-control circuit <b>2</b>, a sub-control circuit <b>3</b>, a sub-control circuit <b>5</b>, and a sub-control circuit <b>5</b>. The sub-control circuits <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> are directly connected to each other, the sub-control circuit <b>2</b> is connected to the sub-control circuit <b>4</b>, and the sub-control circuits <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">The sub-control circuit <b>1</b> includes comparators C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b> and partial pressure resistors R<b>8</b>, R<b>9</b>, and R<b>10</b>. Potentials Vc<b>2</b> and Vc<b>3</b> of P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> points provided by dividing Vcc voltage using the partial pressure resistors R<b>8</b>, R<b>9</b>, and R<b>10</b> (Vc<b>2</b>&#x3e;Vc<b>3</b>) are input to positive terminals (+ terminals) of the comparators C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>, and potential Vpc of a PC point provided by dividing Vcc voltage using the partial pressure resistor R<b>1</b> and the thermistor T<b>1</b> (reference numeral <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is input to negative terminals (&#x2212; terminals).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">That is, the sub-control circuit <b>1</b> forms a temperature state output section for outputting a first state signal indicating the relative relationship between Vpc and Vc<b>2</b> from the comparator C<b>2</b> and a second state signal indicating the relative relationship between Vpc and Vc<b>3</b> from the comparator C<b>3</b> in response to Vpc of an output value of the thermistor T<b>1</b>. Since Vc<b>2</b> and Vc<b>3</b> differ from each other, the first state signal and the second state signal become signals indicating different temperature states of the thermistor T<b>1</b> from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">The sub-control circuit <b>2</b> includes a (changeover) switch S<b>1</b>, switches S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b>, partial pressure resistors R<b>3</b>, R<b>4</b>, R<b>5</b>, and R<b>6</b>, a ground resistor R<b>7</b>, and a comparator C<b>1</b>. Potential Vp<b>3</b> of a P<b>3</b> point between the partial pressure resistors R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b> is input to a positive terminal A of the comparator C<b>1</b>, and a voltage signal from the switch S<b>1</b> is input to a negative terminal B. The changeover switch S<b>1</b> includes a moving contact K<b>1</b> and is switched to either of a first fixed terminal a and a second fixed terminal b in response to a signal from a NAND gate circuit of the sub-control circuit <b>3</b> described later. In this case, the potential Vp<b>3</b> is potential reflecting the collector voltage of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the sub-control circuit <b>2</b> fluctuates the collector-emitter voltage of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>together with the sub-control circuits <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> described later; the collector-emitter voltage is equal to a resonance voltage occurring in the resonance circuit <b>36</b>. Therefore, the sub-control circuit <b>2</b> functions as a voltage fluctuating section (output fluctuating unit) for fluctuating the resonance voltage occurring in the resonance circuit <b>36</b> by the action of the moving contact K<b>1</b>, etc., and in cooperation with the sub-control circuits <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">Potential Vp<b>5</b> of a P<b>5</b> point provided by dividing Vcc voltage using the partial pressure resistors R<b>5</b> and R<b>6</b>, here 3 V, is input to the first fixed terminal a. Further, when the switch S<b>2</b> is turned on (closed), the ground resistor R<b>7</b> is connected to P<b>5</b> in parallel and a divided voltage signal is input to P<b>5</b>. Turning on/off (opening/closing) the switch S<b>2</b> is controlled by an electric signal when the switch S<b>3</b> connected to the comparator C<b>3</b> of the sub-control circuit <b>1</b> is on. The switch S<b>3</b> is turned on (closed) in the stationary state of the magnetron.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">The sub-control circuit <b>3</b> includes the NAND gate circuit, a comparator C<b>4</b>, an electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b>, a resistor R<b>11</b>, switches S<b>4</b>, S<b>5</b>, and S<b>6</b>, an OR gate circuit, a NOT gate circuit, and a current source P. As described above, output of the NAND gate circuit is input to the moving contact K<b>1</b> of the changeover switch S<b>1</b> of the sub-control circuit <b>2</b>. On the other hand, output of the comparator C<b>4</b> is input to a first input terminal a of the NAND gate circuit and output of the NOT gate circuit for inverting output of the comparator C<b>2</b> is input to a second input terminal b. Reference potential of 3 V is input to a negative terminal of the comparator C<b>4</b>. On the other hand, a voltage signal of an SS point between the current source P and the switch S<b>6</b> connected to the Vcc voltage and the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b> is input to a positive terminal of the comparator C<b>4</b>. A signal from the switch S<b>5</b> opened or closed according to output from the OR gate circuit is input to the SS point through the resistor R<b>11</b> and further the SS point is connected to the current source P through the switch S<b>6</b>. The OR gate circuit has three input terminals a, b, and c and a signal from the switch S<b>4</b> to which a signal of the comparator C<b>2</b> of the sub-control circuit <b>1</b> is input is input to the first input terminal a. &#x201c;Start&#x201d; and &#x201c;Stop&#x201d; signals are input to the second input terminal b and the third input terminal c, respectively.

The operation of the inverter controller <b>161</b> will be discussed below with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>:</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">(1) Step S<b>1</b> (At the Magnetron Starting Time)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">To begin with, at the starting time when the magnetron <b>12</b> starts to operate, the temperature of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>is low and therefore the temperature of the thermistor T<b>1</b> is also low and thus the resistance of the thermistor T<b>1</b> is comparatively high (the thermistor T<b>1</b> is implemented as an NTC thermistor with resistance decreasing with a temperature rise) and therefore the potential Vpc is high. Thus, the comparator C<b>3</b> for making a comparison between the potential Vpc and the potential Vc<b>3</b> outputs &#x201c;0 (Low)&#x201d; and inversion output of C<b>2</b> provided through the NOT gate circuit from output of the comparator C<b>2</b> becomes &#x201c;1 (Hi)&#x201d; (S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>)). At this time, the switches S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> are off.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">Since the switches S<b>6</b> and S<b>5</b> are also off, the potential at the SS point remains low (S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>)) and by comparing with the reference potential 3 V on the negative terminal side, the comparator C<b>4</b> outputs &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>h</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">In the NAND gate circuit, &#x201c;0&#x201d; is input to the first input terminal a and &#x201c;1&#x201d; is input to the second input terminal b and thus the NAND gate circuit outputs &#x201c;1&#x201d; (S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>i</i>)). If the NAND gate circuit outputs &#x201c;1 (Hi),&#x201d; the moving contact K<b>1</b> of the changeover switch S<b>1</b> of the sub-control circuit <b>2</b> is switched to the side of the first fixed terminal a and if the NAND gate circuit outputs &#x201c;0 (Low),&#x201d; the moving contact K<b>1</b> is switched to the side of the second fixed terminal b. Therefore, the moving contact K<b>1</b> of the changeover switch S<b>1</b> is set to the side of the first fixed terminal a.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">The switch S<b>3</b> is off and the potential Vp<b>5</b> of the P<b>5</b> point (3 V) provided by dividing voltage using the partial pressure resistors R<b>5</b> and R<b>6</b> is input to the negative terminal of the comparator C<b>1</b>. On the other hand, the potential Vp<b>3</b> of the point P<b>3</b> provided by dividing the collector voltage of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>using the partial pressure resistors R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b> is input to the positive terminal of the comparator C<b>1</b>. Vp<b>3</b> is a divided voltage of the collector voltage and repeatedly exceeds and falls below 3 V of Vp<b>5</b> by the action of the resonance voltage of the resonance circuit <b>36</b> of the inverter <b>16</b>. Therefore, the comparator C<b>1</b> outputs on and off repeatedly in such a manner that it outputs off when the potential at the point P<b>3</b> is smaller than 3 V and outputs on when the potential becomes higher than 3 V (S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>e</i>)) and this information is input to the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>through the sub-control circuit <b>4</b>. Since the on/off duty of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>is controlled so that the P<b>3</b> potential roughly matches 3 V, the collector voltage of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>at the starting time becomes lower than that at the stationary time.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">(2) Steps S<b>2</b> to S<b>4</b> (Transition From Start of Magnetron to Stationary State)</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">When the operation state of the magnetron becomes stationary, the switches S<b>3</b>, S<b>4</b>, and S<b>6</b> are turned on. Then, charge storage from the current source P through the switch S<b>6</b> to the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b> starts and the potential at the SS point starts to rise (S<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>)). When the potential at the SS point exceeds 3 V, by comparing with the reference potential 3 V on the negative terminal side, the comparator C<b>4</b> outputs &#x201c;1&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; is input to the first input terminal a of the NAND gate circuit (S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>h</i>)). On the other hand, input to the second input terminal b remains &#x201c;1.&#x201d; Therefore, the NAND gate circuit outputs &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>i</i>)) and the moving contact K<b>1</b> of the changeover switch S<b>1</b> is set to the side of the second fixed terminal b. At this time, PD<b>1</b> of the resistor R<b>6</b> is turned off (S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>c</i>)). That is, if the magnetron enters the stationary state, PD<b>1</b> works for suppressing occurrence of the moding phenomenon until the potential at the SS point reaches 3 V.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">The potential at the SS point continues to rise by the action of the current source P (S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>)) and as the input voltage to the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b>, a high potential as compared with 3 V at the starting time is input. Therefore, the on duty of the on/off control of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>is enhanced so that the P<b>3</b> potential roughly matches the SS potential, the collector voltage of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>also becomes high, and the input voltage to P<b>3</b>, the positive terminal A, divided voltage of the collector voltage, also rises (S<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>)). This means that the on duty of the on/off control is enhanced depending on the rise inclination of the SS potential. That is, the sub-control circuit <b>3</b> raises the SS potential and shoulders stationary transition control at the time of making a transition from the start of the magnetron to the stationary state.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">When the input voltage to the positive terminal A, the negative terminal B becomes equal to or greater than a predetermined value, namely, the on duty of the on/off control of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>becomes equal to or greater than a predetermined value, a power control function of the sub-control circuit <b>5</b> is activated and a limitation is imposed on the rise in the on duty. That is, the limitation is imposed, whereby the SS potential always becomes higher than the P<b>3</b> potential and thus the comparator C<b>1</b> outputs off and the on duty is controlled by the sub-control circuit <b>5</b>. The power control function is as follows: The comparator C<b>5</b> makes a comparison between linDC of a voltage into which the input current is converted and the REF potential of the reference potential of linDC and when linDC exceeds the REF potential, the comparator C<b>5</b> generates a signal for turning on the switch S<b>8</b> and the on duty is controlled, whereby the power control function is accomplished (S<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>j</i>)). Thus, if the SS potential becomes higher than the P<b>3</b> potential, only the sub-control circuit <b>5</b> controls the on duty, so that it is made possible to impose a limitation on the rise in the on duty, and safety can be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">(3) Step S<b>5</b> (Power Down Control of Magnetron)</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">The IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>is heated with the passage of time under the safe operation described above and the temperature of the thermistor T<b>1</b> also rises with the temperature rise of the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the resistance value decreases. When the cooling performance is poor or a foreign substance is caught in a fan for some reason and the fan abruptly stops, etc., the resistance value further decreases and the potential Vpc of the point PC starts to fall. If the potential Vpc becomes lower than Vc<b>2</b> (for example, 3.8 V) of another input potential of the comparator C<b>2</b> (Vpc&#x3c;Vc<b>2</b>), the comparator C<b>2</b> outputs &#x201c;1.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">When the comparator C<b>2</b> outputs &#x201c;1,&#x201d; inversion output of C<b>2</b> provided through the NOT gate circuit from output of the comparator C<b>2</b> becomes &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>f</i>)). Therefore, &#x201c;1&#x201d; and &#x201c;0&#x201d; are input to the two input terminals a and b of the NAND gate circuit and the NAND gate circuit outputs &#x201c;1&#x201d; (S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>i</i>)) and the moving contact of the changeover switch S<b>1</b> moves from the second fixed terminal b to the side of the first fixed terminal a.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">At this time, the input voltage to the positive terminal A, the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b> is rapidly lowered to 3 V independently of the potential at the SS point and is maintained at 3 V (S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>)). Thus, the power down control (PD<b>1</b>) works. This means that the comparator C<b>1</b> outputs on and off repeatedly (S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>e</i>)) at the same time as the potential Vpc becomes lower than Vc<b>2</b> of another input potential of the comparator C<b>2</b> (Vpc&#x3c;Vc<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">When the comparator C<b>2</b> outputs &#x201c;1,&#x201d; the switch S<b>5</b> is turned on through the switch S<b>4</b> and output &#x201c;1&#x201d; of the OR gate circuit and the charge of the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b> is allowed to flow into the ground through the resistor R<b>11</b> and the potential at the point SS starts to fall (S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>)). If the potential at the point SS falls below 3 V (middle of S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>)), the comparator C<b>4</b> outputs &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>h</i>)). At this point in time, however, even if the output of the comparator C<b>4</b> changes from &#x201c;1&#x201d; to &#x201c;0,&#x201d; the output of the NAND gate circuit is not affected. Lowering the SS potential is resetting the stationary transition control that the sub-control circuit <b>3</b> shoulders, used at the time of making a transition from the start to the stationary state.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">(4) Step S<b>6</b> (Continuation of Power Down Control)</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">If the temperature of the thermistor T<b>1</b> further rises, the resistance value of the thermistor T<b>1</b> decreases and the potential Vpc of the point PC also lowers and when the potential becomes lower than Vc<b>3</b> (for example, 2.9 V) of another input potential of the comparator C<b>3</b> (Vpc&#x3c;Vc<b>3</b>), the comparator C<b>3</b> outputs &#x201c;1&#x201d; (S<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>g</i>)). In the stationary state, S<b>2</b> is turned on through the switch S<b>3</b> already turned on and further PD<b>2</b> of the resistor R<b>7</b> is turned on (S<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>d</i>)) and the input voltage to the positive terminal A, the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b> further lowers from 3 V and further the power down control (PD<b>2</b>) works (S<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">(5) Step S<b>7</b> (Power Down Control Release)</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">When the temperature of the thermistor T<b>1</b> again falls by the power down control PD<b>2</b>, the resistance value of the thermistor T<b>1</b> increases and the potential Vpc at the point PC also rises and when the potential becomes higher than Vc<b>3</b> of another input potential of the comparator C<b>3</b> (Vpc&#x3e;Vc<b>3</b>), the comparator C<b>3</b> outputs &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>g</i>)). In association with this, the switch S<b>2</b> is turned off and the PD<b>2</b> of the resistor R<b>7</b> is turned off (S<b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>d</i>)) and thus the input voltage to the positive terminal A, the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b> is again restored to 3 V (S<b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">(6) Step S<b>8</b> (Usual Operation Start)</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">When the temperature of the thermistor T<b>1</b> further falls, the resistance value of the thermistor T<b>1</b> increases and the potential Vpc at the point PC also starts to rise. When the potential Vpc becomes higher than Vc<b>2</b> (for example, 3.8 V) of another input potential of the comparator C<b>2</b> (Vpc&#x3e;Vc<b>2</b>), the comparator C<b>2</b> outputs &#x201c;0&#x201d; (inversion output of C<b>2</b> becomes &#x201c;1&#x201d; as in S<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>f</i>)). Then, the switch S<b>5</b> turned on in the power down control is turned off through the switch S<b>4</b> and the OR gate circuit and the partial pressure action of the resistor R<b>11</b> does not work. The potential at the point SS starts to rise (S<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>)) with charge storage in the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b>. Since the potential at the point SS does not reach 3 V, the moving contact K<b>1</b> of the changeover switch S<b>1</b> is on the side of the fixed terminal a and the switch S<b>2</b> is also off and thus the PD<b>1</b> control still works (S<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>c</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">(7) Step S<b>9</b> (Output Rise After Usual Operation Start)</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">When the potential at the point SS continues to rise and exceeds 3 V (S<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>)), the comparator C<b>4</b> outputs &#x201c;1&#x201d; (rise signal described later), the NAND gate circuit outputs &#x201c;0,&#x201d; and the moving contact K<b>1</b> is switched to the side of the second fixed terminal b (S<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>i</i>)). The input voltage to the positive terminal A, the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b> start to rise while depending on the rise inclination of the SS potential (S<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">As described above, in the present invention, the sub-control circuit <b>3</b> containing the NAND gate circuit, the comparator C<b>4</b>, and the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b> is provided at the preceding stage of the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b>. When the potential at the SS point on the negative terminal side of the comparator C<b>4</b> exceeds 3 V, then (the NAND gate circuit outputs &#x201c;0 and) the moving contact K<b>1</b> of the changeover switch S<b>1</b> moves to the side of the second fixed terminal b and the input voltage to the positive terminal A, the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b> start to rise. The time delay from rise start of the potential at the SS point to reaching 3 V (S<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is realized by the storage action of the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b>. That is, at the stationary state time, the potential at the SS point starts to rise with a signal (first state signal) from the comparator C<b>2</b> as a trigger and the sub-control circuit <b>3</b> functions as an output increase delay section (output increase suppressing unit) for outputting a rise signal for raising the input voltage to the IGBT <b>16</b><i>a </i>to the comparator C<b>1</b> after a predetermined time (S<b>8</b>) until the potential exceeds 3 V. The output increase delay section is also used for the stationary transition control at the time of making a transition from the start to the stationary state and the control system is reset and is again used, so that output increase suppressing control can be easily performed. That is, the SS potential is once lowered at the power down time using the thermistor, whereby the sub-control circuit <b>3</b> as the output increase delay section shoulders not only the stationary transition control at the time of making a transition from the start to the stationary state, but also the output increase suppressing control. In the configuration described above, the stationary transition control is reset and is again used, but the stationary transition control and the output increase suppressing control may be performed using different control circuits, of course.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">According to the configuration described above, it is made possible to delay rise in the input voltage to the positive terminal A, the negative terminal B of the comparator C<b>1</b> for a predetermined time after the power down control is released at step S<b>7</b> as shown in steps S<b>8</b> and S<b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). That is, in the present invention, to restore the output of the magnetron to a predetermined value, the output is restored to the predetermined value while output control is performed for a predetermined time, so that it is made possible to prevent problem occurrence of the moding phenomenon, overshoot, etc., and improve the reliability and the usability of the high-frequency dielectric heating apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">The duration of the time delay (S<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) described above is realized by the storage action of the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b> and thus can be adjusted by changing the time constant of the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b>. For example, the SS change inclination is small on a dotted line L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which means that the time constant of the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b> is larger, and original delay time T<b>1</b> grows to T<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">Since the time constant changes in response to the electrostatic capacitance of the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b>, for example, the electrolytic capacitor CO<b>1</b> having an appropriate time delay can be adopted in response to the use of the inverter controller and the high-frequency dielectric heating apparatus. A variable capacitor capable of varying electrostatic capacitance is adopted in the portion of the electrolytic capacitor, whereby it is made possible to change the time delay in response to a scene.</p>
