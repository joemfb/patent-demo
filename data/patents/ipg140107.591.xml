<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a swivel adapter mount that can be used between a device and implement, such as with excavating equipment, such as a backhoe or excavator. A bucket of other implement can then be moved to positions that would not be possible with a conventional backhoe or similar device. This invention is also related to bearing assemblies that will operate in such an environment with a relatively long service life.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional backhoes and crawler type excavators are not suited for digging ditches with sloping sides. These types of conventional excavating equipment do not have the ability to tilt or swivel a bucket or claw so that a slope can be graded. Therefore a separate piece of equipment, such as a device with a telescoping boom and tilted claw, such as the type manufactured by Gradall are typically employed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The instant invention provides a swivel adapter mount that allows a bucket to be tilted so that a slope can be graded by using a backhoe, a crawler type excavator or similar piece of equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There have been earlier devices that are intended to tilt or swivel an excavating bucket for use in grading a slope. However, these devices have not proven to be effective. In some cases they require a large number of component parts and are therefore costly both to manufacture and to repair. The more parts that are necessary than the chance then the greater the chance of a break down if other things are equal. Others have not proven to be sturdy enough for use in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Most of these prior art devices employ hydraulic means to rotate a bucket through and angle of approximately forty-five degrees. If these devices could rotate through three hundred sixty degrees or be capable of continuous rotation, they could be employed with implements other than buckets and could greatly expand the versatility of backhoes, crawler excavators or similar commonly available equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Mechanisms to tilt or swivel a bucket on the end of an excavating boom have been discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,626; U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,926; U.S. Pat. No. 6,146,082; U.S. Pat. No. 6,539,650; and in International Published Patent Application WO 2007/097698. However, none of these approaches is believed to be as versatile and reliable as the swivel adapter mount of the instant invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An apparatus according to this invention is used to rotate an implement, for example a bucket, relative to a device, for example an excavating device. The apparatus includes a housing and a disc. The disc and the housing are rotatable relative to each other about a central axis extending through the housing and the disc and through the implement and the device when the housing and disc are mounted between the implement and the device. The implement can be swiveled relative to the device. A bearing assembly is positioned between the housing and rotating disc and around the central axis about which the rotating disc and the housing are relatively rotatable. The bearing assembly includes opposed geared bearing races and geared bearings. A first bearing race is fixed to the disc and a second bearing race is fixed to the housing. Each of the opposed bearing races have radially spaced, opposed inclined bearing surfaces extending around the central axis. A circular race gear is radially positioned between the opposed truncated inclined bearing surfaces. The inclined bearing surfaces extend beyond the cylindrical gear. The circular race gear has radially diverging race gear teeth aligned with projections transversely radiating from the central axis. A plurality of rotatable geared bearings are positioned around the opposed bearing races. Each rotatable gear or geared bearing has two, oppositely facing conical bearing surfaces at each end of the rotatable geared bearing. The rotatable gear or geared bearings are positioned between opposed bearing races so that the oppositely facing conical bearing surfaces on the geared bearings engage the inclined bearing surfaces on the opposed bearing races. Each gear or geared bearing also includes divergent geared bearing teeth disposed around each geared bearing between oppositely facing conical bearing surfaces. The divergent gear or geared bearing teeth are progressively radially thicker so that the divergent geared bearing teeth will mesh with the diverging race gear teeth on the circular race gear. The bearing assembly will bear loads transverse to the central axis as the implement is rotated relative to the device about the central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of this invention the apparatus is actuated by fluid pressure to rotate an implement, such as an excavating bucket, relative to a device about a central axis. the apparatus comprising. The apparatus includes a housing attachable to the device and a cylindrical shaft extending through the housing and attachable to the implement. A disc is affixed to cylindrical shaft with the cylindrical shaft extending axially beyond the disc. The disc is rotated with the cylindrical shaft relative to the housing by the application of fluid pressure supplied from the device so that the implement is rotatable relative to the device. The shaft and the disc are rotatable relative to the housing around the central axis. A bearing assembly for supporting loads transverse to the central axis is positioned between the housing and the disc. The bearing assembly extends around the cylindrical shaft, with the bearing assembly including bearing races on the disc and on the housing, and bearings disposed in the bearing races around the cylindrical shaft. Fluid passages extend parallel to the central axis through the shaft so that the shaft comprises a rotary union so that fluid pressure can be transmitted through rotary union from the device for further manipulation of the implement about axes transverse to the central axis in addition to rotating the disc and the implement about the central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This apparatus can be mounted on an excavating device in which an implement can be rotated relative to an excavating boom on the excavating device about multiple perpendicular axes in response to fluid pressure supplied by the excavating device. The apparatus includes a housing attachable to the excavating boom and a combination rotary union and bearing disc mounted to the housing and rotatable relative to the housing about a first axis upon the application of hydraulic fluid pressure supplied by the excavating device. The combination rotary union and bearing disc is also attachable to the implement. Fluid passages extend through the combination rotary union and bearing disc so that hydraulic fluid pressure can be supplied to an another fluid powered actuation component for rotating the implement about a second axis. A bearing assembly is located between the bearing disc and the housing for bearing loads transverse to the first axis. The bearing assembly extends around a portion of the combination rotary union and bearing disc, and further comprises bearing races on the bearing disc and on the housing with a plurality of bearings disposed in the bearing races.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When used with an excavator or a wheeled backhoe, a swivel apparatus according to this invention can not only improve more efficient use of excavating devices on a worksite, but it can also improve safety by preforming operations, the would otherwise require workers to preform excavating tasks in a ditch, where accidents are more likely to happen. The additional range of motion be allowing an implement, such as a bucket, to be swivel and tilt about perpendicular axes, in addition to normal rotation, will allow a single excavating device to perform multiple tasks. For example, an excavating device with the capabilities of the instant invention would all an operator to maneuver around pipe culverts dig and remove earth from beneath a pipe and to work around trees, pipe lines, fire hydrants and other obstacles. An operator can also use an excavator employing these capabilities to handle slopes from 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 without moving the excavating device. A person will not then need to do such a potentially dangerous task in a ditch. Furthermore, a single excavating device with the capabilities of this invention, can dig from different directions, so that multiple excavating device would not be needed to dig a single ditch, nor would it be necessary to reposition the main excavating device. By swiveling and tilting an implement, the operator could also level bedding stone that might be required, and other tasks could also be performed. Although not limited in principle, an excavating device according to this invention would be suitable for a 75,000 pound excavator or wheeled backhoe.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An excavating device or the representative embodiment depicted herein provides the ability to rotate an implement, such as a bucket for 360 degrees in either direction as well as tilting the implement 90 degrees in either direction for a total of 180 degrees. Such an excavating device will minimize the need for specialty equipment and enhance profitability. An excavating device incorporating this invention is well suited for jobs, such as working on slopes, leveling ground, precise backfilling and quick profiling utilities, clearing land and landscaping.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The bearing assembly of this invention is not limited to use with excavating equipment and is especially suited for heavy duty and high load operations. This bearing assembly reduces micro chatter and eliminates rotational wobble to create smooth and precise control. The bearing housing oil is filled, which provides superior lubrication, minimizes wear and leads to longer life. This bearing assembly provides precise control with rifle-true anti-backlash resulting in smoother operation and excellent control. The bearing assembly also provides am improved thrust bearing with gear teeth providing superior thrust bearing performance. The bearing assembly also excellent speed reduction, and through phase tuning it allows differentiation in the number of teeth that must be engaged between input and output, which enables successful reduction rations. Less noise and vibration is the result of evenly distributed bearing loads reducing rough spots. The bearing assembly is also structurally rigid and provides excellent overall load capacity. The number are reduced as well as weight and size in addition to increases load capacity and excellent performance.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view of a prior art excavator <b>1</b> with which the swivel adapter mount or swivel mounting adapter according to this invention can be used to mount implements such as an excavating bucket or claw <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a crawler type excavator but it should be understood that this excavator is merely representative of other types of excavating equipment. In particular, the swivel adapter or swivel adapter mount of this invention can be used on a backhoe. With the use of suitable brackets, swivel mounting adapters of this invention can be used on various types of excavating equipment, without modifying the swivel adapter itself.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The prior art crawler type excavator <b>1</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> employs a boom <b>3</b> and an articulated main arm <b>4</b>. A hydraulic arm cylinder <b>7</b> and a hydraulic bucket cylinder <b>8</b> can be employed to rotate the main arm <b>4</b> relative to the boom <b>3</b> about an elbow joint <b>9</b>. Hydraulic cylinders <b>13</b> can raise and lower the boom <b>3</b>. The main arm <b>4</b> is attached to the bucket <b>2</b> by a wrist joint <b>10</b> through a forward bucket pivot <b>11</b>, so that the bucket <b>2</b> can be rotated relative to the arm <b>4</b>. In order to impart this rotation, an auxiliary arm <b>5</b> is also connected to the bucket <b>2</b> through a rear bucket pivot <b>12</b>, and the auxiliary arm <b>5</b> is connected to the main arm <b>4</b> by a link <b>6</b>. Reciprocation of a piston in hydraulic cylinder <b>8</b> will cause the bucket <b>2</b> to rotate about an axis A<b>1</b>-A<b>1</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, substantially perpendicular to the main arm <b>4</b>, though an angle of approximately one hundred eighty degrees, so that the bucket <b>2</b> can be used for excavating in a conventional manner. Articulation of the bucket <b>2</b> and the main arm <b>4</b> is essentially confined to motions parallel to the plane through the centerline of the boom <b>3</b>, and in a standard excavating apparatus such as the crawler excavator <b>2</b>, the bucket <b>2</b> cannot be swiveled or twisted relative to the main arm <b>4</b> or the boom <b>3</b>. For a crawler excavator <b>2</b>, the entire apparatus can be turned relative to the crawler tracks, but this movement is normally intended to deposit dirt of other debris to another location after excavation. A backhoe does not normally permit the boom assembly to be turned in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The instant invention provides a mounting adapter assembly that will allow a bucket or other implement to be swiveled or twisted relative to the main arm <b>4</b> of standard excavating equipment or mechanism, such as backhoes and crawler excavators, without requiring modification to the main arm assembly <b>4</b> or to the boom <b>3</b>, other than perhaps mounting additional hydraulic transmission lines or electric wires or transmission lines to power the swiveling adapter. This invention allows a bucket <b>2</b> or other implement to be swiveled about an axis that is perpendicular to the normal bucket manipulation axis A<b>1</b>-A<b>1</b>. A bucket <b>2</b> or similar implement can also be swiveled about and axis generally along the length of the excavator main arm <b>4</b>, by employing a swivel adapter mounted between the main arm <b>4</b> and the bucket or implement <b>2</b>. Only minor modifications, if any, need be made to standard implements or other mechanisms, such as buckets. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/530,324 filed Jun. 22, 2012, of which this application is a continuation in part, discloses embodiments of a swivel adapter of this type and this application is incorporated herein by reference. The swivel adapter <b>20</b> disclosed herein incorporates the same essential components and operates much the same as embodiments thereby incorporated herein by reference. The preferred embodiment of the swivel adapter <b>20</b> described herein, also incorporates components that will allow greater forces and greater loads to be applied to the swivel adapter <b>20</b> as the excavator device <b>1</b> is employed in heavy duty operations. Although this preferred embodiment is described with reference to its use an earth moving excavator device <b>1</b>, it should be understood that the swivel adapter <b>20</b> can be employed with other devices and implements to permit rotation of the implement relative to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Swivel adaptor apparatus <b>20</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is mounted between the main arm <b>4</b>, comprising a part of the excavator device <b>1</b> and the bucket or implement <b>2</b>. This swivel adapter apparatus <b>20</b> will allow an implement mounted on the bottom of the swivel adapter apparatus <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to be rotated about a Central Axis CA-CA relative to a device on which the swivel adapter apparatus <b>20</b> is mounted at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Swivel adapter apparatus <b>20</b> has a housing <b>21</b>, which further comprises a top housing <b>22</b> and a bottom housing <b>23</b>, which are attached together by studs or bolts. Detailed views of the top housing are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. Detailed views of the bottom housing <b>23</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. A combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is mounted between top housing <b>22</b> and bottom housing <b>23</b>. Detailed views of the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5E</figref>. A mounting plate <b>50</b> is positioned below the bottom housing. This mounting plate <b>50</b> is attached to a shaft section <b>40</b> comprising part of the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b>. This mounting plate <b>50</b> will rotate relative to the housing <b>21</b>. Details of this mounting plate <b>50</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. At least one swivel hydraulic motor <b>30</b> is mounted on the top of the housing <b>21</b>. In the preferred embodiment two swivel hydraulic motors <b>30</b> are employed, although one of these motors <b>30</b> is obscured by one of the debris shields <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. These swivel hydraulic motors <b>30</b> are conventional hydraulic motors of the type that can be employed in construction equipment. In the preferred embodiment a Parker Hydraulic Motor Gerotor, fixed displacement hydraulic motor serial number TG0335AS030AAAB can be employed, although it should be understood that other hydraulic motors or actuators could be employed. The swivel adaptor apparatus <b>20</b> is attached to a boom main arm <b>4</b> by top mounting brackets <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a bucket pivoting actuator or auxiliary actuator <b>90</b> mounted on an actuator saddle <b>92</b>, which is attached to mounting plate <b>50</b>, and is positioned between the swivel adaptor apparatus <b>20</b> and a bucket or other implement <b>2</b>. A Helac hydraulic actuator is used in the preferred embodiment of this invention, although other hydraulic actuators could be employed. Bucket mounting brackets <b>94</b> attach the bucket pivoting actuator <b>90</b> to the bucket <b>2</b>. This bucket actuator <b>90</b> is a hydraulic actuator that will be employed to rotate a bucket or implement <b>2</b> about axis A<b>1</b>-A<b>1</b>, which will be perpendicular to central axis CA-CA. Thus the bucket or implement <b>2</b> can be rotated about two perpendicular axes at the same time, and in combination with the movement of the excavator <b>1</b> and the boom <b>3</b> and boom main arm <b>4</b> will allow the bucket <b>2</b> or any other implement to be manipulated into any orientation relative to the horizontal and the vertical within the reach of the excavator apparatus <b>1</b>. The swivel adaptor <b>2</b> allows rotation about central axis CA-CA, which is not possible with conventional prior art excavation apparatus such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> includes a shaft <b>31</b> and a bearing disc <b>32</b> that extends around the shaft <b>40</b> and which as a thickness that is substantially less than the height of the shaft section <b>40</b>. In the preferred embodiment the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> comprises a one piece member that can be machined from or a metal that will suitably withstand the loads applied to the apparatus. It should be understood that this combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> can be fabricated as a separate shaft and bearing disc, which may be affixed to each other during assembly, and that the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> is not to be limited to a one-piece member unless referred to as such. The lower part of the shaft forms a shaft implement hub <b>46</b> to which the mounting plate <b>50</b> can be attached. When the shaft <b>40</b> is rotated about the central axis CA-CA, which coincides with the shaft axis, the mounting plate <b>50</b> and the implements mounted thereon will rotate about the central axis CA-CA relative to the housing <b>21</b>. Since the housing <b>21</b> will be attached to the boom main arm <b>4</b>, the implement, such as bucket <b>2</b>, will rotate relative to the boom also about the axis CA-CA.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the top housing <b>22</b> is assembled to the bottom housing <b>23</b>, and internal recess, sufficient to receive the flywheel or combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> will be formed by a top housing cavity <b>26</b> and a bottom housing cavity <b>28</b> on the interior surfaces of the two components that, when joined, will form the housing <b>20</b>. A central hole <b>24</b> extends through top housing <b>22</b> and communicates with the recess formed within housing <b>20</b> formed by the opposed cavities <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. This central hole <b>24</b> will receive a hydraulic input projection <b>44</b> at the upper end of the shaft <b>40</b> on the flywheel <b>30</b>. A shaft hole <b>25</b> on the bottom housing will allow the shaft implement hub section <b>46</b> to extend therethrough so that the mounting plate <b>50</b> can be attached to the shaft <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A circular channel <b>27</b> extends upwardly from the cavity <b>26</b> on the top housing. Similarly a circular channel <b>29</b> extends downwardly from the cavity <b>28</b> on the bottom housing. These circular channels <b>27</b> and <b>29</b> extend around the central axis CA-CA and each of these channels has the same mean diameter. These channels <b>27</b> and <b>29</b> will receive bearing races <b>60</b> in a manner that will be subsequently discussed in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The bearing disc portion <b>32</b> of the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> has circular disc channels <b>33</b> on the upper and lower surfaces of the bearing disc <b>32</b>, which have the same diameter relative to the central axis CA-CA of the shaft <b>40</b> as the circular channels <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>. The channels <b>33</b> will also receive bearing races <b>60</b> so that opposed bearing races <b>60</b> will face each other both above and below the bearing disc <b>30</b> when the components are in an assembled configuration. When the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b> is positioned between the assembled top housing <b>22</b> and bottom housing <b>23</b>, the disc channels <b>33</b> are aligned with and opposed to the housing channels <b>27</b> and <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The channels <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>33</b> will each receive a bearing race <b>60</b>, and a circular race gear <b>66</b> will be positioned in each circular bearing race <b>60</b>. The circular race gear <b>66</b>, the bearing race <b>60</b> and a plurality of rotatable geared or gear bearings <b>70</b> will form bearing assemblies. A circular race <b>60</b> with a circular gear <b>66</b> positioned in one of the housing channels <b>27</b> or <b>29</b> will form a housing bearing assembly. A circular race <b>60</b> with a circular gear <b>66</b> positioned within a bearing disc channel <b>33</b> will form a bearing race assembly. Components of these bearing race assemblies are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7F</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each circular race <b>60</b> has opposed inclined bearing surfaces <b>64</b> on opposite sides of a circular grove <b>65</b> in which a circular gear <b>66</b> will be positioned. The angle of each inclined bearing surface <b>64</b>, relative to the vertical will be forty-five (45) degrees in the preferred embodiment, but it should be understood that other inclinations can be employed. Each circular gear <b>66</b> has evenly spaced radially diverging race gear teeth <b>68</b> extending therearound. The race gear teeth <b>68</b> are formed along radial projections extending from the center of the circular gear <b>66</b>. When mounted in the races <b>60</b> and on the bearing disc <b>32</b> or the housing parts <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, the center of the circular gear <b>66</b> will be defined by the intersection with the central axis CA-CA. Since the race gear teeth <b>68</b> are formed by radial projections, each of the race gear teeth <b>68</b> will be wider along the outer periphery of the circular race gear <b>66</b> than along the inner periphery of the circular race gear <b>66</b>. Thus the race gear teeth <b>68</b> can be described as radially diverging. This radially diverging shape is important in insuring that there if limited if any slippage between the race gear teeth <b>68</b> and the divergent geared bearing teeth <b>76</b> on the rotatable gear or geared bearings <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The individual geared or gear bearings <b>70</b> that are disposed around the opposed races in the bearing disc <b>32</b> and the two housing components <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8G</figref>. The axis of rotation of each gear bearing <b>70</b> will extend perpendicular to the central axis CA-CA, and the gear bearing axes of rotation will extend along radial projections intersection this central axis. These gear bearing axes of rotation will thus extend generally parallel to the interior faces of the housing parts <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, and to the plane of the bearing disc <b>32</b>. None of the axes of rotation of the gear bearings <b>70</b> will be parallel to the any of the other gear bearings <b>70</b>. Each of these bearings <b>70</b> has an inner conical bearing surface <b>72</b> and an outer conical bearing surface <b>74</b> located at the two opposite ends of the gear bearing <b>70</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the maximum diameter of the outer conical gear bearing surface <b>74</b> is greater than the maximum diameter of the inner conical gear bearing surface <b>72</b>. The maximum diameter of the divergent gear bearing teeth <b>76</b> will also be greater by distance d, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, at the intersection with the outer conical bearing surface <b>74</b> than at the intersection of the gear bearing teeth <b>76</b> with the inner conical bearing surface <b>72</b>. The width of the individual gear bearing teeth <b>76</b> will also be greater at their outer end than at the inner end of the diverging gear bearing teeth <b>76</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8E and 8F</figref> show that the width <b>76</b><i>a </i>of the gear teeth at their inner end is less than the width <b>76</b><i>b </i>at the outer end of the gear bearing. The divergent gear bearing teeth <b>76</b> will thus mesh with the radially diverging race gear teeth <b>68</b> on the circular race gear <b>66</b>. This will allow rotational movement of the gear bearings <b>70</b> and the bearing disc <b>32</b> relative to the housing <b>21</b>. The engagement of the divergent gear bearing teeth <b>76</b> with the diverging race gear teeth <b>68</b> will also cause the gear bearings <b>70</b> to rotate as the bearing disc <b>32</b> rotates relative to the housing <b>21</b>. This positive rotation imparted to the gear bearings <b>70</b> will cause the gear bearing conical bearing surfaces <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> to rotate relative to the inclined bearing surfaces <b>64</b> on the races <b>60</b>, so the bearing surfaces will not slide causing wear and damage to the bearing components. Relatively large loads that would be encountered in applications such as earth moving will not therefore cause damage to the bearings or the races. These bearings can also be employed in the presence of debris or dirt as would be encountered in applications, such as earth moving and excavation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When rotation of the bearing disc <b>32</b> is imparted relative to the housing <b>21</b>, the swivel adapter <b>20</b> causes the implement, such as a bucket <b>2</b>, to swivel or rotate about the central axis CA-CA relative to the excavator boom arm <b>4</b> to which the housing <b>21</b> is attached. Rotation of the bearing disc <b>32</b> is imparted by the hydraulic swivel motor or motors <b>80</b> mounted on the housing <b>20</b>. These motors are connected to hydraulic lines and to a source of hydraulic pressure, not shown, on the excavator device <b>1</b> or on some other device with which the swivel adapter <b>20</b> is to be used. The preferred embodiment uses hydraulic pressure to swivel the implement relative to the otherwise stationary device on which it is employed. It should be understood, however, that some other fluid actuation source, such as a pneumatic source, could also employ a swivel adapter <b>20</b> according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fluid pressure motor or motors <b>80</b> impart rotation to the bearing disc through a swivel drive gear <b>82</b> rotated by the motor <b>80</b>, which in turn engages a driven gear <b>34</b> extending around the periphery of the bearing disc <b>32</b>. Drive gears <b>82</b> are located in the openings <b>88</b> located on opposite sides of the top housing <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Shields or guards <b>84</b> located on the exterior of the motors <b>80</b> prevent damage to the motors <b>80</b> due to impact when the device is moved as wells as debris unearthed during excavating and other operations.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The swivel adapter <b>20</b> does permit the implement to swivel relative to the device on which it is mounted. In the representative embodiment depicted herein, an auxiliary or bucket fluid pressure or hydraulic pressure actuator <b>90</b> is mounted between the swivel adapter <b>20</b> and the implement, such as bucket <b>2</b>. The actuator <b>90</b> is mounted to the swivel adapter <b>20</b> by the mounting plate <b>50</b>, and rotation of the shaft <b>40</b> causes both the mounting plate <b>50</b> and the actuator <b>90</b> to swivel. Standoffs in the form of buttons fabricated from a material having a low coefficient of friction can be mounted on top of the mounting plate to limit friction between the mounting plate and the bottom housing <b>23</b>. Hard bronze button <b>56</b> can be mounted in mounting plate button holes <b>54</b> and will not only reduce friction, but also will stabilize devices mounted on mounting plate <b>50</b>. When differential hydraulic pressure is applied to actuator <b>90</b> it will rotate the implement, which is attached to the auxiliary actuator <b>90</b> by a yoke or saddle <b>90</b>, which is in turn attached to the implement or bucket <b>2</b> by bucket mounting ears or brackets <b>94</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hydraulic actuator <b>90</b> will impart rotation to the implement, such as a bucket, about an axis that is perpendicular to the axis CA-CA about which the swivel adapter will cause the implement to rotate. The bucket actuator <b>90</b> will also cause rotation that is perpendicular to axis A<b>1</b>-A<b>1</b> as shown in the prior art excavator <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The bucket actuator <b>90</b> will cause the bucket <b>2</b> to tilt relative to the ground when activated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order for the bucket or tilt actuator <b>90</b> to manipulate the bucket <b>2</b>, fluid pressure or hydraulic fluid must be supplied to the actuator <b>90</b>. A pressure control manifold or controller (not shown) can be mounted on the excavator boom to provide control of the hydraulic fluid pressure supplied to the rotary motors <b>80</b>, as well as to the tilt actuator <b>90</b>. Since the excavator device <b>1</b> is the source of pressurized hydraulic fluid, this fluid must pass through the swivel adapter <b>20</b>, which is located between the auxiliary actuator <b>90</b> and the boom of the excavator device <b>1</b>. The shaft <b>40</b>, which with the bearing disc <b>32</b> forms the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>30</b>, includes fluid passages <b>42</b>, which extend from the top to the bottom of the shaft section <b>40</b>. These fluid passages <b>42</b> are seen in the section view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. A rotary cap <b>58</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> is attached to the top housing <b>22</b>, and this rotary cap <b>58</b> extends over the hydraulic input projection <b>44</b>. Standard fluid lines on the excavator <b>1</b> are attachable to the rotary cap <b>58</b> on the top face of cap <b>50</b>. Fluid passages in the rotary cap <b>58</b> communicate with the space between the rotary cap <b>58</b> and the input hydraulic projection <b>44</b> on the shaft portion <b>40</b> of the combination rotary union and bearing disc <b>32</b>. O-ring grooves extend around the input hydraulic projection <b>44</b>. Fluid lines can be connected at the bottom of shaft <b>40</b>, and these fluid lines can then be attached to the auxiliary or bucket actuator <b>90</b>. Since conventional fluid lines are flexible, these lines will not prevent the shaft <b>40</b> from rotating when a force due to a hydraulic pressure differential is applied to the bearing disc <b>32</b> by the hydraulic swivel motor or motors <b>80</b> to in turn impart rotation to the shaft <b>40</b>.</p>
