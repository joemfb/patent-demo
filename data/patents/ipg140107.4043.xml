<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a thickness measuring system <b>100</b> for measuring the thickness of a planar plate-shaped member <b>200</b> is provided. The thickness measuring system <b>100</b> includes a processor <b>10</b>, a first distance measurer <b>20</b>, a second distance measurer <b>30</b>, and a plate-shaped member detecting sensor <b>60</b>. The plate-shaped member <b>200</b> includes a first side <b>210</b> and a second side <b>220</b> that are parallel to each other. During a measuring process, the plate-shaped member <b>200</b> is placed on a conveyer belt <b>300</b> and moves past between the distance measurers <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>. In the embodiment, the distance measurers <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> are arranged at opposite sides of the conveyer belt <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the embodiment, the distance measurers <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> are laser distance measuring sensors. When needed, the distance measurers <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> may be infrared distance measuring sensors. The plate-shaped member detecting sensor <b>60</b> includes a light emitter <b>40</b> and a light receiver <b>50</b> that are arranged adjacent to the distance measurers <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>. The light emitted by the light emitter <b>40</b> is received by the light receiver <b>50</b>. When the plate-shaped member <b>200</b> passes between the distance measurers <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>, the light from the light emitter <b>40</b> is blocked, and the light receiver <b>50</b> signals the processor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Upon receiving the signal from the receiver <b>50</b>, the processor <b>10</b> controls the first distance measurer <b>20</b> and the second distance measurer <b>30</b> to emit light. Specifically, the first distance measurer <b>20</b> is controlled to emit a first light beam that is across and parallel to the surface of the conveyer belt <b>300</b>. After reflection by the plate-shaped member <b>200</b>, the first light beam is received by the first distance measurer <b>20</b>. The first distance measurer <b>20</b> records the time that the first light beam takes during the journey, and calculates a first distance A by multiplying the time according to the velocity of the first light beam. The second distance measurer <b>30</b> is controlled to emit a second light beam and a third light beam. The second light beam is parallel to the conveyer belt <b>300</b> and a first angle &#x3b1; is formed between the second light beam and the third light beam. After reflection by the plate-shaped member <b>200</b>, the second light beam and the third light beam are received by the first distance measurer <b>20</b>. The first distance measurer <b>20</b> records the respective times that the second light beam and the third light beam take during the journey, and calculates a second distance B and a third distance C by multiplying the time by the velocity of the second light beam and the third light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The processor calculates an angle &#x3b2; between the plate-shaped member <b>200</b> and the conveyer belt <b>300</b> based on the distances A, B, and C and the angle &#x3b1;. When the plate-shaped member <b>200</b> is properly positioned, the plate-shaped member <b>200</b> is perpendicular to the conveyer belt <b>300</b> and the angle &#x3b2; is then 90 degrees. However, for a number of reasons, the plate-shaped member <b>200</b> may not be precisely perpendicular to the conveyer belt <b>300</b>, and thus there is a need to calculate an exact value of the angle &#x3b2;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the thickness L of the plate-shaped member <b>200</b> equals to (K-A-B)*sin&#x3b2;, wherein K represents the distance between the distance measurers <b>20</b> and <b>30</b>. According to Law of Sines, sin&#x3b2;=sin&#x3b1;*C/D. According to Law of Cosines, cos&#x3b1;=(B<sup>2</sup>+C<sup>2</sup>-2B*C). Thus, the thickness L=(K-A-B)* C/D* &#x221a;{square root over (1&#x2212;cos&#x3b1;<sup>2</sup>)}.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">While various embodiments have been described and illustrated, the disclosure is not to be construed as being limited thereto. Various modifications can be made to the embodiments by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
