<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a hollow fiber membrane module and a puller used therefor, and more particularly, to a hollow fiber membrane module and a puller used therefor, wherein each individual hollow fiber membrane module can be easily pulled out from a filtering apparatus provided with a plurality of hollow fiber membrane modules if it is required to be replaced or repaired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A separation method using a membrane has lots of advantages over the method based on heating or phase-changing. Among the advantages is high reliability of water treatment since the water purity required can be easily and stably satisfied by adjusting the size of the pores of a membrane. Furthermore, since the separation method using a membrane does not require a heating process, a membrane can be used with microorganism which is useful for separation process but may be adversely affected by heat.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among the membrane employing separation methods is a method using a hollow fiber membrane module which comprises a bundle of hollow fiber membranes. Conventionally, the hollow fiber membrane module has been widely used in a micro-filtration field for producing axenic water, drinking water, super pure water, and so on. Recently, however, the application of the hollow fiber membrane module is being expanded to include sewage and waste water treatment, solid-liquid separation in a septic tank, removal of suspended solid (SS) from industrial wastewater, filtration of river, filtration of industrial water, and filtration of swimming pool water.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One kind of the hollow fiber membrane modules is a submerged-type hollow fiber membrane module which is submerged into a water tank filled with fluid to be treated. Negative pressure is applied to the inside of the hollow fiber membranes, whereby only fluid passes through the wall of each membrane and solid elements such as impurities and sludge are rejected and accumulate in the tank. When used for separation, the plural submerged-type hollow fiber membrane modules are installed in a frame structure. A submerged-type hollow fiber membrane module is advantageous in that the manufacturing cost is relatively low and that the installation and maintenance cost may be reduced since a facility for circulating fluid is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one example of a related art submerged-type hollow fiber membrane module.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In case of the related art submerged-type hollow fiber membrane module <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of hollow fiber membranes <b>120</b> are arranged in a bundle between two headers <b>110</b>. Both ends of the hollow fiber membrane <b>120</b> are respectively potted to confronting sides of the two headers <b>110</b> by an adhesive of polyurethane. In this case, a permeate collecting unit (not shown) is formed in each of the headers <b>110</b>, wherein the permeate colleting unit is connected with open ends of the hollow fiber membrane <b>120</b> so as to collect permeate passing through the hollow fiber membrane <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Between the confronting sides of the two headers <b>110</b>, there are two upper supporting members <b>131</b> and two lower supporting members <b>132</b> so as to stably maintain an interval between the two headers <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the meantime, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a filtering apparatus using the submerged-type hollow fiber membrane module has a structure including a plurality of hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d </i>packed into a frame structure (not shown), wherein the filtering apparatus performs a filtering process while being submerged into a liquid substrate containing impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, when the submerged-type hollow fiber membrane module is used to treat wastewater, the solids in the wastewater fouls the membranes causing their permeability to be declined as the water treatment is processed. Thus, while the water treatment is carried out by the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d</i>, an aeration process has to be performed for stably maintaining the high permeability of the membranes. In the aeration process, air is jetted from an aeration pipe (not shown) positioned under the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d </i>during the water treatment, thereby generating rising air bubbles. Thus, foreign materials are removed from the membrane surface owing to the rising air bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the respective hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d </i>may be intensely shaken or vibrated due to the rising air bubbles from the aeration pipe for the aeration process of the filtering membrane. Furthermore, there is a high possibility that the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d </i>are damaged by their collision. In order to minimize the damage in the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d</i>, they have to be maintained for being in close contact with one another, fixedly.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If any one of the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d </i>has to be replaced or repaired due to the damage thereof, it is necessary to pull out the hollow fiber membrane module to be replaced or repaired from the filtering apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in the filtering apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d </i>are maintained for being in close contact with one another. In addition, each of headers <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and <b>110</b><i>d </i>in the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d </i>is provided with only flat surfaces. Thus, when trying to individually pull out the hollow fiber membrane module <b>100</b><i>b </i>or <b>100</b><i>c</i>, which is positioned in the center of the frame structure, among the hollow fiber membrane modules <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, and <b>100</b><i>d</i>, a pulling force is hardly transmitted to the corresponding hollow fiber membrane module <b>100</b><i>b </i>or <b>100</b><i>c </i>without securing an enough space at both sides of the header <b>110</b><i>b </i>or <b>110</b><i>c</i>. Furthermore, a large-sized hollow fiber membrane module according to a recent trend requiring a large water-treatment capacity may cause more difficulty in individually pulling out each individual hollow fiber membrane module from the filtering apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a hollow fiber membrane module and a puller used therefor, which is capable of preventing one or more problems of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide a hollow fiber membrane module and a puller used therefor, wherein each individual hollow fiber membrane module can be easily pulled out from a filtering apparatus provided with a plurality of hollow fiber membrane modules if it is required to be replaced or repaired.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a hollow fiber membrane module comprises a hollow fiber membrane; and at least one header to which the hollow fiber membrane is potted, wherein the header includes a first lateral side to which the hollow fiber membrane is potted and a second lateral side opposite to the first lateral side, and wherein an engaging plate is formed at the second lateral side.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pulling groove comprises a first groove which is open in a direction perpendicular to the second lateral side; and a second groove which extends from the first groove to the inner part of the header in a direction parallel to the second lateral side, wherein the engaging plate is a part of the second lateral side corresponding to the second groove. In this case, when the hollow fiber membrane module is pulled with a puller including a hooking member, the hooking member is firstly inserted into the first groove, and is then moved toward a direction parallel to the second lateral side so that the hooking member is inserted into the second groove.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">At this time, at least a part of the first groove may be positioned at the same height as the second groove in a longitudinal direction of the header, or the entire first groove is positioned at a different height from the second groove in a longitudinal direction of the header.</p>
