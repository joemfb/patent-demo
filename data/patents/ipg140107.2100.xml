<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to the field of optical and medical devices, and more specifically to an apparatus and method for microarray implementation for the detection of multiple analytes such as chemical agents and biological molecules using photonic crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Label-free optical sensors based on photonic crystals have been demonstrated as a highly sensitive potential method for performing a large range of biochemical and cell-based assays. For background information on photonic crystals, the reader is directed to Joannopoulos, J. D., R. D. Meade, and J. N. Winn, <i>Photonic Crystals, </i>1995 Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. Tight confinement of the optical field in photonic crystal microcavities leads to a strong interaction with the surrounding ambient in the vicinity of the microcavity, thereby leading to large sensitivity to changes in refractive index of the ambient. Much of the research in photonic crystal devices has relied on enhancing refractive index sensitivity to a single analyte (Lee M. R., Fauchet M., &#x201c;Nanoscale microcavity sensor for single particle detection,&#x201d; Optics Letters 32, 3284 (2007)). Research on photonic crystals for multiple analyte sensing has focused on one-dimensional photonic crystal grating-like structures (see patents US20080225293 and US20030027328) that measure the resonant peak reflected wavelengths; such sensors have wide linewidths of the resonant peaks due to one-dimensional confinement and do not utilize the full potential of narrow resonant linewidths of two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities. Furthermore, measurements are made from each sensor element in the array in a serial process, requiring multiple sources and detectors for parallel sensing beyond a single element. Research has been performed with one-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities coupled to ridge waveguides (See Mandal S. and Erickson D., &#x201c;Nanoscale optofluidic sensor arrays&#x201d;, Optics Express 16, 1623 (2008)). One dimensional photonic crystal microcavities, in addition to poor optical confinement, do not utilize the slow light effect due to reduced group velocity in two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides that would otherwise enhance coupling efficiency and thereby improve signal-to-noise ratio of sensing. Demonstrated two dimensional photonic crystal waveguide biosensors rely on shifts of the stop-gap (see Skivesen N. et al., &#x201c;Photonic crystal waveguide biosensor&#x201d;, Optics Express 15, 3169 (2007)) or shifts of the resonant peak of an isolated microcavity (see Chakravarty S. et al., &#x201c;Ion detection with photonic crystal microcavities&#x201d;, Optics Letters 30, 2578 (2005)). In either case, the design is not suitable for the fabrication of microarrays for multiple analyte sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Two dimensional photonic crystal microcavities integrated with two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides offer the possibility of integrating the high quality-factor resonances of two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities with the slow light effect of two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides for high sensitivity, high signal-to-noise ratio sensing. Furthermore, multiple photonic crystal microcavities can be simultaneously arrayed along a single photonic crystal waveguide, so that a single measurement can be performed in parallel to elicit the response from multiple sensor elements, thereby increasing measurement throughput and reducing cost. An array of two sensors demonstrated using two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities uses multiple ridge waveguides between individual photonic crystal microcavities. Coupling between photonic crystal waveguides and ridge waveguides introduces additional significant transmission loss at each interface, thereby significantly reducing signal-to-noise ratio as each microcavity is added for multiple sensing. The design demonstrated by Guillermain et al. (see Guillermain E., Fauchet P. M., &#x201c;Multi-channel sensing with resonant microcavities coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide,&#x201d; JWA 45, CLEO Conference (2009)) in effect employs multiple photonic crystal waveguides and also employs microcavities with significantly poor quality factors that make the designs unsuitable for high sensitivity sensing. Better designs are needed in the art to realize photonic crystal microarray devices that efficiently couple light from ridge waveguides to a single photonic crystal waveguide, wherein multiple photonic crystal microcavities with high quality factors and covering a large bandwidth for sensing are coupled to a single photonic crystal waveguide for high sensitivity multiple sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A standard on-chip multiple protein patterning technique using lithography typically requires a pre-bake resist temperature of 100&#xb0; C. or higher. At the very least, temperatures this high compromise or alter biological functionality, and at the very worst they may destroy its function. Most proteins are stable in vivo at a temperature of 37&#xb0; C., but this stability is dependent on chaperone proteins that maintain the proper conformation of other proteins in cells. Since proteins in vitro lack these chaperone proteins, they must be maintained at even lower temperatures to prevent denaturation and loss of function. Designs are needed to enable patterning of different kinds of biomolecules in aqueous phase to preserve functionality of biomolecules.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Designs are needed in the art to integrate two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities with two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides for multiple analyte sensing and designs are further needed to pattern multiple biomolecules, of different constitutions, on the photonic crystal substrate while preserving their functionality.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">III. SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One embodiment of the invention provides a sensor comprising a semiconductor material core with high dielectric constant, supported on the bottom by a low dielectric constant cladding. A triangular lattice of photonic crystal holes is etched into the substrate. The photonic crystal waveguide is defined by filling a single row of holes, from input ridge waveguide transition to output ridge waveguide transition with the semiconductor core material. A photonic crystal microcavity is similarly defined by filing a few holes with semiconductor core material. Multiple photonic crystal microcavities are patterned at a distance of three lattice constants from the photonic crystal waveguide. The distance between individual photonic crystal microcavities is 10 lattice periods. The high dielectric constant core with structured photonic crystal waveguide and photonic crystal microcavities, together with the low dielectric constant cladding, form the photonic crystal microarray structure. Light is coupled into the photonic crystal waveguide from a ridge waveguide. Light is out-coupled from the photonic crystal waveguide to an output ridge waveguide. When a broadband light source is input to the photonic crystal waveguide, wavelengths corresponding to the resonant wavelengths of the individual microcavities are coupled to the corresponding microcavities. As a result, minima are observed in the transmission spectrum corresponding to the dropped wavelength of each photonic crystal microcavity. Depending upon the wavelength range of interrogation, the period of the sub-wavelength lattice can vary from 50 nm to 1500 nm and the depth of the lattice structure can vary from 0.4 to 0.7 times the lattice periodicity above. The semiconductor material can be silicon (or any Group IV material), gallium arsenide (or any III-V semiconductor) or any semiconductor material with high refractive index. The substrate can be any Group IV material corresponding to the Group IV core material, or any substrate suitable to grow the III-V core material. Above the microcavity, a thin film of target binding molecules that are immobilized on the microcavity surfaces, each microcavity surface being coated with an exclusive target molecule or biomolecule, forms the dielectric coating. The one or more binding molecules are free of detection labels. The one or more specific binding substances are thus arranged in an array on the microcavities, along the photonic crystal waveguide. A single transmission spectrum therefore probes the binding events on multiple microcavities. A binding event on a specific microcavity shifts the corresponding transmission minimum and leads to a sensing event for the specific microcavity. Analyzed biomolecules can be proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules or genes. Arrays of microcavities therefore lead to a multiple analyte sensing device that increases the measurement throughput of the device, in addition to the obvious sensitivity enhancements achieved by using a two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide coupled to two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To summarize:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The primary objective of the invention is to provide an integrated photonic crystal microarray with compact size that can be monolithically integrated with different kinds of biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, DNA, RNA or small molecules to implement a personalized diagnostic chip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second objective of the invention is to eliminate the need for labeling of biomolecule and biomolecule conjugates for on-chip detection and thereby reduce microarray costs associated with biomolecule labeling.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The third objective of the invention is to significantly increase measurement throughput from devices by signal collection and analysis from multiple elements of a microarray in a single measurement as opposed to individual element measurement in contemporary systems.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fourth objective of the invention is to implement a novel lithography scheme on a CMOS chip that avoids high temperature processes associated with photolithography and chemical etching for the patterning of multiple biomolecules and thereby preserves biomolecule functionality in aqueous phase at room temperatures or even colder if necessary.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Detailed Description of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a device for a microarray for personalized diagnostic applications comprises: a functional photonic crystal waveguide having a waveguide core along which light is guided, arrays of photonic crystal microcavities along the length of the photonic crystal waveguide each coated with a separate biomolecule specific to disease identification, an input and output photonic crystal waveguide with gradually changed group index before and after the functional photonic crystal waveguide, which can bridge the refractive indices difference between conventional optical waveguides and the functional photonic crystal waveguide. The sensor can be used to detect organic or inorganic substances such as proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules, nucleic acids, virus, bacteria, cells, and genes, without requiring labels such as fluorescence or radiometry. Light (from a broadband source or LED) coupled into a photonic crystal waveguide couples with the resonance of a photonic crystal microcavity and thereby drops the resonant wavelength in the microcavity, leading to a minimum in the transmission spectrum of the photonic crystal waveguide at the resonant wavelength. Transmission minima are observed for each resonant wavelength of the individual microcavities along the photonic crystal waveguide. The resonance wavelength shifts to longer wavelengths in response to the attachment of a material on the microcavity surface leading to the corresponding shift of the transmission minimum of that microcavity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment of the present invention, a device for a microarray for multiple analyte sensing applications comprises: a functional photonic crystal waveguide having a waveguide core along which light is guided, arrays of photonic crystal microcavities along the length of the photonic crystal waveguide each coated with a separate polymer or hydrogel specific to a unique environmental parameter, an input and output photonic crystal waveguide with gradually changed group index before and after the functional photonic crystal waveguide, which can bridge the refractive indices difference between conventional optical waveguides and the functional photonic crystal waveguide. The sensor can be used to detect changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, molarity of solution, acidity or alkalinity (pH) of aqueous medium, ion concentration of solutions, trace gases in the atmosphere, pollutants in ground water that can be organic or inorganic, volatile and non-volatile, pesticides and thereof in a single optical transmission measurement. A unique polymer or hydrogel is chosen with maximum response to changes in each of the above parameters and a unique microcavity along the waveguide is coated with a unique polymer or hydrogel. Light (from a broadband source or LED) coupled into a photonic crystal waveguide couples with the resonance of a photonic crystal microcavity and thereby drops the resonant wavelength in the microcavity, leading to a minimum in the transmission spectrum of the photonic crystal waveguide at the resonant wavelength. Transmission minima are observed for each resonant wavelength of the individual microcavities along the photonic crystal waveguide, in the pristine condition. The resonance wavelength shifts to longer wavelengths in response to changes in ambient parameters listed above leading to the corresponding shift of the transmission minimum of that microcavity, the amount of transmission minimum shift determines the absolute change in ambient conditions in the vicinity of the microarray device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For the measurement of environmental parameters in situ, the device is incorporated with a filter to remove macroscopic dirt and dust particles. The filter can be a macroscopic filter incorporated off-chip or a microfluidic filter incorporated on-chip.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Methods for fabricating photonic crystal structures are widely described in the literature. Sensor structures of the invention have higher sensitivity than previous structures due to the use of two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities with resonances that have high quality factor together with the slow light effect of two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides. Methods for patterning of multiple biomolecules exclusively on photonic crystal microcavities that preserves biomolecule functionality in aqueous phase are disclosed. The amount of refractive index change and hence the shift in resonance frequency is determined by the amount of adsorbed molecules or biomolecules on the microcavity surface that interacts with the electromagnetic field of the photonic crystal. The system is capable of detecting a single cell attached to its surface.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Microarrays provide an unprecedented opportunity for comprehensive concurrent analysis of thousands of biomolecules such as proteins, genes, DNA molecules, small molecules or nucleic acids. The global analysis of the response to a toxic agent, as opposed to the historical method of examining a few select biomolecules, provides a more complete picture of toxicologically significant events. Array-based expression profiling is useful for differentiating compounds that interact directly with the species from those compounds that are toxic via a secondary mechanism. Microarrays are consequently finding numerous applications in pathogen detection and biodefense. The sensors have utility in the fields of pharmaceutical research (e.g., high throughput screening, secondary screening, quality control, cytoxicity, clinical trial evaluation), life science research (e.g., proteomics, protein interaction analysis, DNA-protein interaction analysis, enzyme-substrate interaction analysis, cell-protein interaction analysis), diagnostic tests (e.g., protein presence, cell identification), environmental detection (bacterial and spore detection and identification), and bio-warfare defense.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The principles of the invention can also be applied to e.g., evanescent wave based biosensors and any biosensors incorporating an optical waveguide. The principle can also be applied to arrays of ring or disk resonators coupled to a bus waveguide. However such waveguides provide limited free-spectral range for microcavity resonances and also do not incorporate slow light effect of photonic crystal waveguides and are thus less sensitive with low signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiments are provided herein. It is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Defect engineered photonic crystals, with sub-micron dimensions have already demonstrated high sensitivity to trace volumes of analytes. While biosensing has been demonstrated in photonic crystal devices with single biomolecules, no previous effort has been made to extend the device capability to microarrays. Particularly, patterning of multiple biomolecules on a few micron scales has faced challenges of binding exclusivity and binding specificity. Our proposed device consists of an array of photonic crystal microcavity resonators coupled to a single photonic crystal waveguide that give rise to minima in the photonic crystal waveguide transmission spectrum at the resonance frequency of the microcavity. Using a new microfluidic technique, individual target biomolecules are coated exclusively on individual photonic crystal microcavities. Our method eliminates labeling for analyte identification. The impact of our novel and robust multi-analyte sensing technique can reach much further than the field of biomolecular science and diagnostics alone. This section will provide detailed description of the preferred embodiments in the aspect of device architecture, as well as the design concept and working principle.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> presents a schematic drawing of a photonic crystal microarray. It consists of a functional photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>, input ridge waveguide <b>112</b>, output ridge waveguide <b>113</b> and an array of N photonic crystal microcavities <b>20</b><i>n </i>where n represents digits and ranges from 1 to N (N&#x2192;&#x221e;). The functional photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> includes a number of column members <b>102</b> (labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) etched through or partially into the semiconductor slab <b>101</b> (labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The waveguide core <b>141</b> is defined as the space between the centers of two column members adjacent to the region where the columns are absent. In one preferred embodiment, the column members <b>102</b> (labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) are arranged to form a periodic lattice with a lattice constant &#x3b1;. In some embodiments, the width of waveguide core <b>141</b> can range from 0.5 times sqrt(3) times the lattice constant &#x3b1; to 50 times sqrt(3) times the lattice constant &#x3b1;. The arrows indicate the direction in which electromagnetic waves are coupled into and out of the photonic crystal waveguide respectively. In the figure, due to space limitations, the microcavities are designated as <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, . . . , <b>20</b>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1) and <b>20</b><i>n </i>respectively. The photonic crystal microcavities are parallel to the photonic crystal waveguide and are placed 3 lattice periods away from the waveguide. Although the photonic crystal microcavities have been shown at 3 lattice periods away from the photonic crystal waveguide, the offset can be 1, 2, . . . 10 lattice periods. Beyond 10 lattice periods, the coupling efficiency of light from the guided light in the photonic crystal waveguide will be very small. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is an enlarged section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> showing the photonic crystal microcavity elements <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, columnar members <b>102</b>, and photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> in greater detail. The photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> is defined by filling a complete row of columnar members with the semiconductor slab material <b>101</b>. Similarly, a photonic crystal microcavity, for instance <b>201</b>, is defined by filing a row of 4 columnar members <b>102</b> with semiconductor material <b>101</b>. The distance between individual photonic crystal microcavities is 12 periods. The photonic crystal microcavity <b>201</b> can have different geometries as described in the literature. The resonant wavelength of a photonic crystal microcavity is dependent on the geometry of the microcavity. Light propagating in a photonic crystal waveguide couples to a photonic crystal microcavity at the resonant wavelength of the microcavity. The transmission spectrum of the photonic crystal waveguides consequently shows minima corresponding to the resonant wavelength of each photonic crystal microcavity. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of the functional photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> taken along line A-A&#x2032;, the column members <b>102</b> extend throughout the thickness of the slab <b>101</b> to reach a bottom cladding <b>105</b>. In one embodiment, the top cladding <b>106</b> is air. However, the top cladding can be any organic or inorganic dielectric material, columnar members <b>102</b> can extend through both <b>106</b> and <b>101</b> as well as through the bottom cladding <b>105</b> to reach the substrate <b>107</b>. Although the structure within the slab <b>101</b> is substantially uniform in the vertical direction in this embodiment, vertically non-uniform structure, such as the columnar members <b>102</b> whose radii are varying along the vertical direction, may be used as well. The column members <b>102</b> can be either simply void or filled with other dielectric materials. Between the ridge waveguide <b>112</b> and the core photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>, there is an impedance taper <b>115</b> for coupling of light from ridge waveguide to photonic crystal waveguide with high efficiency. Similarly, at the output, between the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> and the output ridge waveguide <b>113</b>, there is another impedance taper <b>114</b> for better coupling efficiency. The impedance taper <b>115</b> is formed by shifting the columnar members from photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> to ridge waveguide <b>112</b> by x times &#x3b1; in the direction perpendicular to <b>100</b>, in the plane of the waveguide, in steps of (x times &#x3b1;)/p where p is a number greater than 5, &#x3b1; is the lattice constant, and x varies from 0 to z, where z is a fractional number between zero and one (0&#x3c;z&#x3c;1). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, p equals 8 since it is the first eight columnar members that have been shifted in both of the impedance tapers <b>115</b> and <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the impedance tapers <b>115</b> and <b>114</b> may be oppositely tapered. In that embodiment, impedance taper <b>115</b> would be narrower at the ridge waveguide <b>112</b> than at the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> and impedance taper <b>114</b> would be narrower at the ridge waveguide <b>113</b> than at the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, x varies from 0 to z, where z is a fractional number between zero and minus one (&#x2212;1&#x3c;z&#x3c;0). For a photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, which comprise photonic crystals of two-dimensional periodicity, the wave guiding in the vertical direction must be provided by conventional index-guiding scheme. This means a bottom cladding <b>105</b> and a superstrate <b>106</b> with a lower effective index relative to that of the slab material must be disposed below and above the slab <b>101</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the superstrate is absent and simply represented by air or vacuum. On one side, the bottom cladding <b>105</b> and superstrate <b>106</b> prevent guided lightwave escaping far away from the top and bottom surfaces of the slab <b>101</b>. In most applications, it is desirable that the waveguide have a single guided mode, which can be achieved through adjusting the width of the waveguide core <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, substances are coated on the photonic crystal microcavity are labeled as <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, . . . <b>30</b>(<i>n</i>&#x2212;1), <b>30</b><i>n</i>, where n represents digits and ranges from 1 to N (N&#x2192;&#x221e;). Each photonic crystal microcavity <b>20</b><i>n </i>is coated with a specific substance <b>30</b><i>n</i>. In one embodiment, the substance can be a biomolecule such as proteins, nucleic acids, DNA, RNA, antigens, antibodies, small molecules, peptides, genes etc. Each biomolecule can be specific to a particular disease causing conjugate where the disease of interest can be cancer, malaria, Leptospirosis or any infectious disease to achieve specific detection. In another embodiment, the substance <b>30</b><i>n </i>can be a hydrogel that swells in the presence of a specific analytical solution or ambient gas wherein the ambient gas includes, but is not limited to, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide or other gases such as oxygen, nitrogen thereof. In yet another embodiment, the substance can be a polymer that changes its effective refractive index upon contact with a chemical substance or proportionately to changes in temperature, humidity and pressure thereof. The device is therefore a very generalized construction where multiple polymer or biological molecules, each specific to detection of a specific species, are arrayed for simultaneous detection.</p>

The circles indicate columnar members of the photonic crystal waveguide. It is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that peak of the field intensity is well confined inside the waveguide core region <b>141</b>. Outside of <b>141</b>, there are two side peaks due to evanescent field. Due to even symmetry of the mode with respect to the center of the waveguide, the mode couples very well with resonant modes of photonic crystal microcavities which possess even symmetry.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a top view of the field intensity pattern of a defect mode of a photonic crystal microcavity <b>20</b><i>n </i>where n represents digits and ranges from 1 to N (N&#x2192;&#x221e;), in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The circles indicate columnar members of the photonic crystal microcavity. It is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that peak of the field intensity is well confined inside the photonic crystal microcavity region <b>151</b>. Outside of <b>151</b>, there is very weak field intensity that overlaps with the columnar members. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> suggests that photonic crystal microcavity resonant mode is well confined in the dielectric, in the plane of the waveguide inside region <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The bold curve <b>190</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a dispersion diagram of the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>. Three regions are distinctly visible in the bold curve. A region <b>161</b> where d&#x3c9;/dk is almost zero, a region <b>163</b> where d&#x3c9;/dk is very high and a region <b>162</b> where d&#x3c9;/dk has intermediate values. d&#x3c9;/dk denotes the group velocity of light propagating in the photonic crystal waveguide at the corresponding frequency. The region <b>164</b> denotes the stopgap of the photonic crystal waveguide where the transmission is zero. The coupling efficiency between a photonic crystal waveguide and a photonic crystal microcavity is inversely proportional to the group velocity, consequently slower the group velocities higher the coupling due to higher interaction time. However, region <b>161</b> is not suitable due to high dispersion and consequently high transmission loss. We identify a range of frequencies in region <b>162</b> between dotted lines <b>191</b> and <b>192</b> over which we vary the resonance of the photonic crystal microcavity to achieve high coupling efficiency with photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> address photonic crystal microcavity design issues so that the entire range of frequencies between the dotted lines <b>191</b> and <b>192</b> can be efficiently used for resonant coupling, thereby increasing the number of microcavities that can be arrayed in parallel for the multiple analyte sensing diagnostic chip. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> depicts one embodiment of a photonic crystal microcavity where a row of 4 columnar members <b>102</b> has been filled with the semiconductor dielectric material <b>101</b>. We consider a photonic crystal waveguide transmission spectrum when 2 photonic crystal microcavities say <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are coupled to the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>. For the microcavity <b>201</b>, the columnar members <b>501</b> and <b>502</b>, have each been shifted toward each other by 0.2&#x3b1; and for microcavity <b>202</b> the columnar members <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> have each been shifted away from each other by 0.2&#x3b1;, where a denotes the lattice periodicity of the triangular lattice photonic crystal structure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, 2 sharp minima <b>511</b> and <b>512</b> are observed that correspond to the resonance of corresponding photonic crystal microcavities <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. This demonstrates that progressive geometry tuning of photonic crystal microcavities can result in multiple microcavities arrayed along a photonic crystal waveguide, each with a unique resonance frequency resulting in a unique transmission minimum in the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b> transmission spectrum. Although the magnitude of the shift is indicated as 0.2&#x3b1;, the magnitude of the shift can vary continuously from 0 to 0.45&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> depicts another embodiment of a photonic crystal microcavity where a row of 4 columnar members <b>102</b> has been filled with the semiconductor dielectric material <b>101</b>. We consider a photonic crystal waveguide transmission spectrum when 2 photonic crystal microcavities say <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> are coupled to the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>. The individual construction of each of the photonic crystal microcavities <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> can be described by the microcavity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, for the microcavity <b>201</b>, the columnar members <b>501</b> and <b>502</b>, have each been shifted toward each other by 0.2&#x3b1; and for microcavity <b>202</b> the columnar members <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> have each been shifted away from each other by 0.2&#x3b1;, where a denotes the lattice periodicity of the triangular lattice photonic crystal structure. For the microcavity <b>202</b>, as illustrated in general for a microcavity <b>20</b><i>n</i>, the diameters of the members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> are further reduced in size to 0.9 times the diameter of columnar members <b>102</b> elsewhere. Two sharp minima <b>513</b> and <b>514</b> are observed that correspond respectively to the resonance of corresponding photonic crystal microcavities <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. The transmission minimum <b>514</b> is red-shifted corresponding to the transmission minimum <b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The transmission minimum <b>513</b> is not shifted corresponding to the transmission minimum <b>511</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> since the geometry of microcavity <b>201</b> has not been changed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The fact is significant since this ensures that our design selection of 12 lattice periods between adjacent microcavities is optimum and does not alter either a resonance quality factor or the resonance wavelength of a designed microcavity. By reducing the diameter of the columnar members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b>, the dielectric fraction inside the resonant mode of <b>202</b> is increased which brings the frequency of the mode down, closer to the dotted line <b>192</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The diameter of the columnar members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> can thus be changed in step to achieve a new microcavity design with a different resonant frequency. Although the magnitude of the shift for elements <b>501</b> and <b>502</b> is indicated as 0.2&#x3b1;, the magnitude of the shift can vary continuously from 0 to 0.45&#x3b1;. Although the magnitude of the diameter change of the members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> is indicated as 0.9 times the diameter of columnar members <b>102</b> elsewhere, the magnitude of the shift can vary continuously from 0 to 1 times the diameter of columnar members <b>102</b> elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, columnar members <b>501</b> and <b>502</b> are not the only columnar members that may be shifted. Surrounding columnar members such as <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> may also be shifted towards the interior or exterior of the microcavity <b>20</b><i>n</i>.

In another embodiment, columnar member <b>501</b> may be shifted by 0.2&#x3b1; opposite to the &#x393;&#x2212;K direction arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, columnar member <b>502</b> may be shifted by 0.2&#x3b1; in the direction of the &#x393;&#x2212;K direction arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, all columnar members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> may be shifted by 0.2&#x3b1;, in the direction opposite to the arrows for each element <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Although the magnitude of the shift is indicated as 0.2&#x3b1;, the magnitude of the shift can vary continuously from 0 to 0.45&#x3b1;. Additionally, the columnar members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> may also be shifted at any angle from 0 to 360 degrees relative to the &#x393;&#x2212;K direction arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Similarly, columnar members <b>501</b> and <b>502</b> may be shifted by 0.2&#x3b1;, at any angle from 0 to 360 degrees relative to the &#x393;&#x2212;K direction arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts another embodiment of a photonic crystal microcavity where a row of 4 columnar members <b>102</b> has been filled with the semiconductor dielectric material <b>101</b>. We consider a photonic crystal waveguide transmission spectrum when 2 photonic crystal microcavities say <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> are coupled to the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>. For the microcavity <b>201</b>, the columnar members <b>501</b> and <b>502</b>, have been shifted by &#x2212;0.2&#x3b1; and for microcavity <b>202</b> the columnar members <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> are shifted by +0.2&#x3b1;, where a denotes the lattice periodicity of the triangular lattice photonic crystal structure. For the microcavity <b>202</b>, the diameters of the members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> are reduced in size to 0.9 times the diameter of columnar members <b>102</b> elsewhere. For the microcavity <b>201</b>, the diameters of the members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> are increased in size to 1.05 times the diameter of columnar members <b>102</b> elsewhere. Two sharp minima <b>515</b> and <b>516</b> are observed that correspond respectively to the resonance of corresponding photonic crystal microcavities <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. The transmission minimum <b>515</b> is blue-shifted corresponding to the transmission minimum <b>511</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The transmission minimum <b>516</b> is red-shifted corresponding to the transmission minimum <b>514</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> and red-shifted further corresponding to the transmission minimum <b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. By further reducing the diameter of the columnar members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the dielectric fraction inside the resonant mode of <b>202</b> is further increased which brings the frequency of the mode down further, and even closer to the dotted line <b>192</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. By increasing the diameter of the columnar members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b>, the dielectric fraction inside the resonant mode of <b>201</b> is decreased, which raises the frequency of the resonant mode, closer to the dotted line <b>191</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The diameter of the columnar members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> can thus be changed in steps to achieve a new microcavity design with a different resonant frequency. Although the magnitude of the diameter change of the members <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> is indicated as 1.05 times the diameter of columnar members <b>102</b> elsewhere, the magnitude of the shift can vary continuously from 1 to 2 times the diameter of columnar members <b>102</b> elsewhere. In yet another embodiment, the columnar members <b>501</b>, <b>502</b> and <b>601</b>-<b>610</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> can be selectively filled with a material with the same or different dielectric constant as the dielectric constant of the slab material to achieve a different resonance frequency of the photonic crystal microcavity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the columnar members <b>501</b>, <b>501</b><i>a</i>, and <b>501</b><i>b </i>and <b>502</b>, <b>502</b><i>a</i>, and <b>502</b><i>b </i>of microcavity <b>20</b><i>n </i>may be changed in diameter and/or shifted in position to achieve a desired resonance frequency of the photonic crystal microcavity. By making these and other similar geometry changes to the columnar members surrounding the microcavity as shown for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> above, for each of the microcavities <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, . . . <b>20</b><i>n </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is possible to shift the transmission minima of the individual microcavities so that they do not overlap. The idea is to have as many first order transmission minima from the varied microcavities without interference from the second order transmission minima. One such second order transmission minima from the same microcavity as transmission minimum <b>512</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> just to the left of transmission minimum <b>511</b> at around 1580 nm.</p>

The composite microcavity, comprising microcavities <b>201</b> and <b>201</b><i>a </i>thus has a larger optical mode volume resulting in higher sensitivity to refractive index changes. In other embodiments, microcavities oriented along the crystal lattice of +60 degrees and &#x2212;60 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, respectively, may also be mirrored or duplicated directly across the photonic crystal waveguide.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second design concept of this invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> that concerns the patterning of biomolecules onto the patterned silicon substrate <b>411</b> using a novel microfluidic technique that preserves biomolecule functionality in aqueous phase at all times. In one embodiment, biomolecules are patterned on a photonic crystal patterned silicon substrate with a thin layer of silicon dioxide. The thickness of silicon dioxide is not more than 10 nanometers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the steps in the fabrication process on a patterned substrate that preserves the biomolecule functionality in aqueous phase. A film, <b>412</b> is deposited on the substrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. In one embodiment, the film <b>412</b> is parylene. A thin film of metal <b>413</b> is sputtered onto the film <b>412</b> and patterned by photolithography. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>). In one embodiment, the film is aluminum but it could be any metal that can be sputtered onto the film <b>412</b>. Using <b>413</b> mask, <b>412</b> is etched to substrate in oxygen plasma. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>). The film <b>412</b> is patterned so that only the region above the microcavity is opened. In one embodiment, when the device is to be used as a biosensor, the devices are functionalized by treating with 10% by volume 3-aminopropyl-triethoxy-silane (3-APTES) in toluene. It is then washed 3 times in toluene to remove unbound 3-APTES, 3 times in methanol to remove toluene and finally 3 times in de-ionized water to remove methanol. The devices are then incubated in 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes and washed 3 times in PBS. Simultaneously, PDMS microfluidic channels are prepared by molding technique. A master silicon wafer <b>421</b>, cleaned in Piranha solution and rinsed is dried and subsequently, a photoresist <b>422</b> is spin-coated on the silicon wafer. In one embodiment, the photoresist is SU-8 but it can be any lithographically patterned polymer that can give high aspect ratio features. After patterning <b>422</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>) and baking, a mixture of another polymer precursor <b>423</b> and curing agent in the ratio of 10:1 volume together with a hydrophilic additive is poured over the <b>422</b> mold, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref>. In this embodiment the polymer <b>423</b> is polydimethylsiloxane, popularly known as PDMS. After complete curing, the <b>423</b> layer will be removed from the mold to achieve the structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10F</figref>. The PDMS microfluidic channel is carefully aligned and mounted on the structure patterned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10G</figref>. Solutions <b>433</b> containing different biomolecule samples <b>431</b>, <b>432</b> will be introduced into microchannels as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10H</figref>. Biomolecules will be selectively deposited on exposed sites in each channel on the photonic crystal microcavity. After initial biomolecule deposition and overnight incubation, microchannels will be thoroughly washed with PBS to purge them of any excess, unbound biomolecule and the microchannels peeled off using tweezers. After overnight incubation and washing, the device is coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to prevent any non-specific binding and washed 3 times with PBS. Finally, the device as a whole is maintained in solution <b>433</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10I</figref>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, the individual biomolecules are dispensed on top of the individual photonic crystal microcavities by an ink jet printer. In this embodiment, devices are functionalized by treating with 10% by volume 3-APTES (APTES=amino-propyl-triethoxy silane) in toluene. It is then washed 3 times in toluene to remove unbound 3-APTES, 3 times in methanol to remove toluene and finally 3 times in de-ionized water to remove methanol.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is the top view of the device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10G</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10H</figref>. As illustrated, openings in the parylene (<b>412</b>) are lithographically defined so that the photonic crystal microcavity regions of <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are exposed. The procedure applies to all microcavities <b>20</b><i>n</i>. The PDMS microchannels are depicted by the dotted elements <b>423</b>. Molecules and target biomolecules <b>431</b> and <b>432</b> corresponding respectively to biomolecular specific coatings on photonic crystal microcavities <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are flown in through the microfluidic channels in the direction of the arrows. Biomolecules <b>431</b> and <b>432</b> correspond to <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> respectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Since the open areas in <b>412</b> have been silanized, biomolecules <b>301</b> (<b>431</b>) and <b>302</b> (<b>432</b>) preferentially bind to the photonic crystal substrate above the photonic crystal microcavities <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> respectively. The same principle applies to all N photonic crystal microcavities arrayed along the length of the photonic crystal waveguide <b>100</b>. Thus, there is no cross-contamination between <b>301</b> (<b>431</b>) and <b>302</b> (<b>432</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> show how the detection sensitivity can be amplified as well as how more confidence is derived regarding the selectivity or specificity of the binding between an analyte molecule or biomolecule and its corresponding molecule or biomolecule on the one or more optical microcavities. The detection sensitivity of the device is determined from the magnitude of the shift in the minimum in the transmission intensity corresponding to the magnitude of the change in the resonance frequency of the resonance mode of the corresponding photonic crystal microcavity. The specificity of the detection is determined by the binding of the analyte molecule or biomolecule only to specific polymer molecules or biomolecules. Sensitivity amplification is achieved by an enhancement of the magnitude of the shift by the secondary molecule or biomolecule. Enhancement of detection specificity is achieved by the binding of the analyte molecule or biomolecule to two polymer molecules or biomolecules, namely, the polymer molecule or biomolecule attached to the photonic crystal microcavity device, and the secondary polymer molecule or biomolecule introduced in solution. The principle is described with respect to the resonance <b>515</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. We consider that &#x3bb;<sub>5151 </sub>is the minimum in the transmission wavelength corresponding to the resonance <b>5151</b> of the particular photonic crystal microcavity <b>201</b> that is coated with a polymer molecule or biomolecule <b>301</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. We consider that &#x3bb;<sub>5161 </sub>is the minimum in the transmission wavelength corresponding to the resonance <b>5161</b> of the particular photonic crystal microcavity <b>202</b> that is coated with a polymer molecule or biomolecule <b>302</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When an analyte molecule or biomolecule <b>3011</b> that binds to <b>301</b> is introduced in solution, a resonance wavelength shift is observed and the resonance minimum &#x3bb;<sub>5151 </sub>in the transmission spectrum shifts to the new wavelength position &#x3bb;<sub>5152 </sub>corresponding to the changed resonance <b>5152</b> of the photonic crystal microcavity <b>201</b> coated with polymer molecule or biomolecule <b>301</b>. The net wavelength shift is thus (&#x3bb;<sub>5152 </sub>minus &#x3bb;<sub>5151</sub>) where &#x3bb;<sub>5152 </sub>is greater in magnitude than &#x3bb;<sub>5151</sub>. No resonance wavelength shift will be observed in the resonance &#x3bb;<sub>5161</sub>. When a secondary polymer molecule or biomolecule <b>3012</b> is next introduced in solution, which also binds to the analyte molecule or biomolecule <b>3011</b> that has bound to <b>301</b>, a secondary resonance wavelength shift is observed and the transmission minimum &#x3bb;<sub>5152 </sub>shifts to a new transmission minimum &#x3bb;<sub>5153 </sub>corresponding to the further modified resonance frequency of the photonic crystal microcavity <b>201</b>. The analyte molecule or biomolecule <b>3011</b> is thus sandwiched between the two polymer molecules or biomolecules <b>301</b> and <b>3012</b>, both of which recognize the analyte molecule or biomolecule <b>3011</b>. No resonance wavelength shift is observed in the transmission minimum at &#x3bb;<sub>5161 </sub>corresponding to the resonance <b>5161</b> that corresponds to the resonance frequency of the photonic crystal microcavity <b>202</b> that is coated with a polymer molecule or biomolecule <b>302</b> that does not bind to the analyte molecule or biomolecule <b>3012</b>. The secondary wavelength shift due to the sandwich thus amplifies the resonance wavelength shift of the corresponding photonic crystal microcavity to (&#x3bb;<sub>5153 </sub>minus &#x3bb;<sub>5151</sub>) where (&#x3bb;<sub>5153 </sub>minus &#x3bb;<sub>5151</sub>) is greater than (&#x3bb;<sub>5152 </sub>minus &#x3bb;<sub>5151</sub>) and represents a method of amplifying the sensitivity in label-free optical microarrays. In addition, the secondary wavelength shift due to the sandwich further proves that the analyte molecule or biomolecule <b>3011</b> that has bound to <b>301</b> on top of the photonic crystal microcavity <b>201</b> is indeed the analyte molecule or biomolecule <b>3011</b> that must be detected and is not any other non-selective molecule or biomolecule which sticks to the molecule or biomolecule due to other physical reasons not determined by the binding kinetics between <b>301</b> and <b>3011</b>. In addition to sensitivity amplification, the sandwiched detection method applied to the photonic crystal label free microcavity thus adds to detection specificity and detection selectivity. The sensor surface <b>201</b> may be regenerated by removing the analyte molecules or biomolecules <b>3011</b> and the secondary molecules or biomolecules <b>3012</b> by subjecting the sensor device to appropriate solutions such as solutions with a low pH. Consequently, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, after regeneration, the resonance wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>5153 </sub>or &#x3bb;<sub>5152 </sub>returns to &#x3bb;<sub>5151</sub>.</p>
