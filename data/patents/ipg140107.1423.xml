<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the earlier filing date of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/995,329, filed on Sep. 25, 2007. The entire disclosure of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/995,329 is considered to be part of the disclosure of the accompanying application and is incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates generally to fluid flow devices. More particularly, the application relates to devices and methods of manufacturing high-throughput fluid micro-mixers and micro-reactors having micro-channels for mixing of reactants with different viscosities, mixing immiscible liquids, gas-liquid mixing, and controlled incremental introduction of limiting reagents.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Micro-fluid processing is a rapidly evolving area in research and industry. The need for control over biochemical and chemical reactions is useful for reducing reagent waste and minimizing sample sizes, in addition to reducing exposure risks that may be associated with working with certain hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past, molding and lithography techniques have been used to construct planar micro-fluid devices out of pliable materials such as flexible polymers and the like. Though these materials are useful for single-layer mixing devices, the process times and workspace requirements for handling large volume of reagents, for example, can become very large, which makes processing such devices both difficult and expensive.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, devices and methods are provided for mixing reactants with different viscosities, mixing immiscible liquids, gas-liquids mixing, and controlled incremental introduction of limiting reagents. The devices and methods can include micro-mixers and micro-reactors arrays having micro-channels for mixing the reactants.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The foregoing and other features and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Interdigital Micro-Mixer</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">This interdigital micro-mixer is created by stacking patterned laminae. Fluid streams are channeled so that very thin fluid layers are interleaved, resulting in very short paths for diffusion of one fluid into the other (and therefore, rapid mixing). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show features created using chemical etching with different masks on front and back. Plenums for inlet and outlet reservoirs are creating by etching from both sides while the channels defined the mixer are etched from the front side only.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This design can accommodate mixing of any number of streams as well as sequential or staged mixing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view looking upstream at the channel outlets from the mixing chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another embodiment of the micro-mixer, with a common die next to it for size comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Fabrication techniques used thus far include diffusion bonding (using a vacuum hot press) and wire EDM for separating the individual parts from the array. Layout conventions from the integrated circuit industry have been used to achieve high separation ratios, as well as to create a volume throughput device (see disclosure with OSU docket number 07-32 below). The high separation ratio concept allows lower aspect ratio spans between channel (width vs. thickness of span) to be used and still achieve high volumetric throughput. Lower aspect ratio spans are easier to manufacture, as demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>. Desirably, the aspect ratio is less than 10:1. More desirably, the aspect ratio is less than 8:1, and even more desirably, less than 5:1.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The device in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> has photochemically etched channels in 100 um thick stainless steel that are approximately 300 um in width and 70 micron in depth, leaving a span 30 um (minimum ) in thickness and an aspect ratio of 10:1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the structure in the inlet, where the span is supported by a full thickness (100 um) layer, giving an effective minimum span thickness of 130 um and an aspect ratio of 2.3:1. As can be seen this configuration is structurally sound. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the outlet of the mixer, where the fluid layers are interdigitated. Some modest warpage or buckling can be seen in these 10:1 spans, indicating a practical limit of the span aspect ratio at this material thickness when constructing using diffusion bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> has photochemically etched channels in 50 um thick stainless steel that are approximately 250 um in width and 35 micron in depth, leaving a span 15 um (minimum ) in thickness and an aspect ratio of 17:1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the structure in the inlet, where the span is supported by a full thickness (50 um) layer, giving an effective minimum span thickness of 85 um and an aspect ratio of 2.9:1. As can be seen, this configuration shows some warpage, due to the decreased material strength, which is function of the cube of the thickness. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the outlet of the mixer, where the fluid layers are interdigitated. Severe warpage or bucking can be seen in these 17:1 spans, indicating that the span aspect ratio has a practical limit that decreases with decreasing span thickness when constructed using diffusion bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Because the mixing time is an inverse function of the square of the thickness of the fluid laminae created by the interdigital micro-mixer, it is desirable to make these an this as possible. To do so also requires thin spans between the fluid laminae. Thus, to achieve the highest degree of mixing the approach presented here is to reduce the aspect ratio in individual devices to dimensions that are robust in manufacturing, then array them densely to create a highly parallel system capable of high throughput. Example architectures to create such arrays are discussed in more detail below and in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/995,329, which is incorporated herein by reference. Further development activities include making devices in polymeric materials, reducing the cost of welding the tubing on the stainless steel devices (through fixturing or alternate welding techniques), reducing bonding costs per part through alternative techniques or increasing the separation ratio of the platform.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">One example of a polymeric device currently being developed is made by embossing polycarbonate using a diffusion bonded structure as the embossing master. A double transfer embossing process, developed in the MBI, is used to make the final parts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows details of the embossed part. A cover plate defines the fourth wall of the inlet chambers and provides the reservoir for the mixing chamber. This embodiment is low cost and easy to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another embodiment (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) is a planar device that can be created using photolithography and soft molding or embossing. This embodiment can be manufactured at very low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A composite structure has also been designed. The interdigital mixing portion is created in metal, taking advantage of the material strength to create the thin laminae. The mixer is then fitted into a polymer housing providing the fluidic connections. One concept for sealing the metal to polymer interfaces is to use infrared radiation. Polymers can be transparent to radiation, while metals will absorb the energy, heating it, and creating localized melting of the polymer at the metal surfaces. By reducing the metal portion to such a small size, very high separation ratios can be achieved (&#x3e;10 times of a full metal device) and, thus, low cost. The polymer portion can be injection molded as two halves and include integrated fittings or screw threads. Accordingly, a low cost device (&#x3c;$5 manufacturing cost) can be achieved compared to currently available commercial devices (retail costs from $125 to over $2000).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The construction of devices describe below preferably comprise embossed polymer devices and composite metal and polymer structures.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Interdigital Micro-Mixer Column</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A key advantage of microchannel technology is the reduction of fluid layer thicknesses to reduce diffusion limitations. This design re-divides the mixed fluids to thin layers again, effectively creating mixing stages in a column. This design also has improved heat transfer with the mixed fluid stream. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show how the fluid dividers are staggered, allowing for control of the fluid divisions.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">A schematic cross section view of the fluid flow is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">COMSOL plots comparing the concentration profiles for the standard interdigital micro-mixer and the column micro-mixer, thereby demonstrating mixing efficiencies, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A long column design is shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The interdigital micro-mixer column design can be fabricated with several short column parts and an array of the long column design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> can be constructed. This design may be particularly well suited for transesterfication of oils (i.e., biodiesel production).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If desired an unequal flow ratio device for diluting a concentrate, multistage designs for multiple operations, polymer and composite constructions, and testing devices can be configured for specific applications.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">An example planar design can be fabricated (using both SU-8 molding and a triple transfer embossing technique) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref>. The interdigital bottom component is a well published embodiment, with the interleaved left and right mixed streams in the figure flowing perpendicular out from the page into a relatively large mixing chamber. The design below divides the streams after mixing to maintain thin film fluid layers, thereby reducing diffusion limitations and enhancing mixing.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Microscale Reactor</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">This design is a microscale reactor that enables applications including mixing of reactants with different viscosities, mixing immiscible liquids (for either liquid-liquid reactions or creating emulsions), gas-liquid mixing, and controlled incremental introduction of limiting reagents. The design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> includes a layout method that serves to eliminate a separate processing step (and therefore cost) for defining the orifices.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A schematic cross section view of the fluid flow is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. By introducing the limiting reagent periodically (though spacing of the orifices), a continuous flow multistage reactor is created. Spacing of the orifices can be calculated from reaction rates and residence times. While this design shows only two component system, multiple streams can be accommodated just as easily. Additionally, the laminated architecture allows coupling of different devices within the same device body, e.g., column mixers feeding microscale reactors.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Desirably, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> can function as a glycerol to methanol reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Development for the microscale reactor can include graduated introduction designs for specific applications and multistage devices. Additionally, designs to reduce manufacturing costs by using polymers and higher device densities can be utilized.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Architecture for Fluidic Interconnections for Arrays of Interdigital Micro-Mixers</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">This architecture provides fluidic connections to many individual devices placed in a dense array. This allows predictable scaling from an individual device of both performance and manufacturing. This architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can be used for many microchannel device designs, including those described above and below, in both metal and polymer materials.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further development of the arrayed architecture includes increasing the density of devices, simplifying the plate stack, and constructing devices in polymer material.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Integrated Micro-Mixer and Jetting Device</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">This device combines the interdigital mixing device with active fluid drivers to create a drop-on-demand chemical deposition device. Mixing or reacting chemical streams just prior to ejection allows deposition of short-lived or unstable reaction products (for example, silver nanoparticles). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows a schematic view of an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">More mature designs include designed bores for droplet size control and a design where the streams merge at the nozzle exit (mixing occurs in the droplet in flight and on the substrate after deposition). Examples of these are discussed below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows the construction of a two component stack. Reactants enter from the side inlets, are mixed through a column mixer construction then jetted out a designed nozzle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a cross sectional view showing the details of the column mixer portion and the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> show an embodiment where the fluids do not mix until they leave the nozzle. Miscible fluids will coalesce into a single droplet in flight. This phenomenon is well characterized by the inkjet printing industry. By using methods such as differential chemical etching, the dividers between the channels can be very thin, thereby enhancing the coalescence of the droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Future developments can include prototyping of externally driven devices. For example, integrated pulse drivers can be utilized. Externally driven devices can include nozzle bore, reaction chamber characterization, &#x201c;mix in flight&#x201d; designs, and composite polymer and metal constructions.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Nanoparticle Generator</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">This device is an integration of an interdigital micro-mixer with an internal nozzle array. Reactant or emulsion fluid droplets are pulsed from the nozzles into excess reactant or continuous phase stream using a driver such as a piezo micropump. The driver may be integrated into the device or external to the device. This device can be used to generate nanoparticles, emulsions, or controlled reactions of immiscible reactants by jetting small (picoliter) reactant droplets into a fluid or reactant in excess. By creating a stream of consistently sized droplets, continuous, precision methods for making nanoparticles and microemulsions can be realized. The device can include subsequent micromixing stages to quench reactions, or complete additional reaction steps. The device architecture lends itself to multiple reaction stages within one small device. For example, precursor reactants may be mixed prior to jetting into subsequent fluid streams.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows the construction of a multi-nozzle design. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows a perspective view looking back towards the exit from the nozzle array.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-35</figref> show the components of a two stage single nozzle device. The layers are stacked to form the construction. With respect to figure orientations below, the nozzle fluid enters from the bottom plenum, the first stage fluid enters from the right plenum, the second stage fluid enters from the left plenum, and the mixture exits from the top plenum.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> shows a perspective view looking back towards the exit from the nozzle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A single layer device has been created using soft lithography, the details of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, as well as a still picture of the device in operation. The device is creating a microemulsion of water in oil.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">An alternate design that is amenable to creating a dense array of nozzles in a planar device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> shows coalescing and separation stages that have been added and are can be used in PDMS structures.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A dual layer device using a thin kapton piece sandwiched between PDMS layers. A laser cut in the kapton creates the nozzle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">This design has also been applied to metal laminae construction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Development of this device can be performed in multiple stages. First, fluid flow can be characterized using non-reactive systems. Second, specific reaction chemistries can be developed with the design being refined as needed for each specific application. In addition, a full system for precision deposition of nanomaterials can be constructed.</p>
