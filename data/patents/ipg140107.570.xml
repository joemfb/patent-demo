<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of electronic circuit fabrication and, more particularly, to a non-deleterious technique for creating continuous conductive circuits upon the surfaces of a non-conductive substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Circuit design and fabrication is an arduous process involving many precise steps. While these steps create precise, high-quality circuitry, the design/fabrication process has become fixed and unyielding to change. Changes to the circuit design propagate into an exponential number of changes to elements of the fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in integrated circuit (IC) chip fabrication, a change to the circuit design often requires changing the masks of multiple layers and/or parameters for performing a specific step.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This inflexibility that has become inherent in conventional circuit fabrication processes stifles a company's ability to implement design changes in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, conventional fabrication processes rely upon working within the non-conductive substrate used to contain the circuitry. The circuit elements are embedded or formed within the non-conductive substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present invention can include a non-deleterious method for producing a continuous conductive circuit upon a non-conductive substrate and a product produced by said method. This aspect can begin with the application of a metallic base layer upon a surface of a non-conductive substrate. The metallic base layer can be compromised of palladium, rhodium, platinum, iridium, osmium, gold, nickel, and/or iron. A circuit pattern can be created within the metallic base layer based upon a circuit design. The metallic base layer comprising the circuit pattern can be physically separated from the remainder of the metallic base layer on the non-conductive substrate. The region of the non-conductive substrate surface that encloses the circuit pattern can be called the plating region. The remainder of the non-conductive substrate surface can be called the non-plating region. A first metal layer can then be added upon the metallic base layer. A second metal layer can be added upon the first metal layer of the plating region. The second metal layer can be electrically conductive and restricted from being added upon the first metal layer of the non-plating region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the present invention can include a method for producing a continuous conductive circuit upon a non-conductive substrate and a product produced by said method. In this aspect, a non-conductive substrate can be submerged in an active metal solution for a predefined amount of time. The active metal solution can contain metallic particles. When the predetermined amount of time has elapsed, the non-conductive substrate can be removed from the active metal solution. The removed non-conductive substrate can comprise a metallic base layer formed from the metallic particles. A circuit pattern can be formed by removing a portion of the metallic base layer from the non-conductive surface. The resulting substrate with the circuit pattern can be referable to as an intermediary. The metallic base layer can comprise at least two distinct continuous regions separated from each other so that the two distinct continuous regions are electrically isolated from each other. The intermediary can be placed in a chemical plating solution that results in a first metal layer being formed on top of the metallic base layer. The intermediary can be electroplated by attaching electrodes to only the first metal layer of one of the at least two distinct continuous regions to form a second metal layer on top of the first metal layer for that continuous region. At least one of the at least two distinct continuous regions can lack the second metal layer after the electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present invention can include a conductive circuit comprising a non-conductive substrate, a metallic base layer, a first metal layer, and a second metal layer. The non-conductive substrate can be formed from at least one of the following materials: a high-molecular polymer, glass, a ceramic, wood, and a fabric. The metallic base layer can be formed upon a portion of the non-conductive substrate. The metallic base layer can form a circuit pattern on the conductive circuit. The metallic base layer can be comprised of at least one of palladium, rhodium, platinum, iridium, osmium, gold, nickel, and iron. A portion of the non-conductive substrate lacking the metallic base layer can comprise a plurality of laser patterns produced when creating the circuit pattern was created within the metallic base layer using a laser. The first metal layer can exist and can be bonded on top of the metallic base layer. The portion of the non-conductive substrate that lacks the metallic base layer will also lack the first metal layer. The first metal layer can have structural characteristics indicative of the first metal layer being added using a chemical plating process. The second metal layer can exist and can be bonded on top of the metallic base layer. The portion of the non-conductive substrate that lacks the metallic base layer will also lack the second metal layer metal layer. The second metal layer can have structural characteristics indicative of the second metal layer being added using an electroplating process.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention discloses a non-deleterious process that creates continuous conductive circuits upon the surface of a non-conductive substrate. A metallic base layer can be applied to one or more surfaces of the non-conductive substrate. A circuit pattern can be formed in the metallic base layer by removing the metallic base layer around the elements of the circuit pattern. A first metal layer can then be added to the metallic base layer. A second metal layer of an electrically conductive metal can be added upon the first metal layer of the circuit pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>100</b> providing a high-level overview of a non-deleterious process for creating continuous conductive circuits upon the surface of a non-conductive substrate in accordance with embodiments of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-conductive substrate&#x201d; can be used to refer to a variety of materials that do not conduct any or conduct only a negligible amount of electricity. Examples of non-conductive substrates that can be used in the process described herein can include, but are not limited to, high-molecular polymers, glass, ceramics, wood, fabric, stainless steel, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-deleterious&#x201d; can be used to indicate that the described process does not cause damage to or impair the integrity of the non-conductive substrate. That is, a continuous conductive circuit created using the described process can exist upon the surface of the non-conductive substrate without compromising the properties and/or original shape of the non-conductive substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Method <b>100</b> can begin in step <b>105</b> where a metallic base layer can be applied to the surface or surfaces of the non-conductive substrate. Metals used to create the metallic base layer can include, but are not limited to, palladium, rhodium, platinum, iridium, osmium, gold, nickel, iron, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A circuit pattern can then be formed within the metallic base layer in step <b>110</b>. In step <b>115</b>, a first metal layer can be added on top of the metallic base layer using a chemical plating process. A second metal layer can be added on top of the first metal layer using an electroplating process in step <b>120</b>, creating a continuous conductive circuit upon the surface or surfaces of the non-conductive substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Upon completion of step <b>120</b>, the non-conductive substrate and/or continuous conductive circuit can be further utilized in an electronics fabrication process (i.e., electronic components can be connected to the created continuous conductive circuit and/or the non-conductive substrate can be installed within a device).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>200</b> describing the non-deleterious process for creating continuous conductive circuits upon the surface of a non-conductive substrate in a finer detail in accordance with embodiments of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. Method <b>200</b> can represent a more specific embodiment of method <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Method <b>200</b> can begin in step <b>205</b> where a prepared non-conductive substrate can be placed in an active metal solution. Preparation of the non-conductive substrate can include actions such as cleaning, degreasing, etching, and so on, as required for the specific implementation of the non-deleterious process and/or type of non-conductive substrate being used. After formation of a metallic base layer of the active metal upon the surface or surfaces of the non-conductive substrate, the non-conductive substrate can be removed from the active metal solution in step <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Performance of step <b>210</b> can be based upon quantitative parameters like time in the solution and/or thickness of the active metal layer. These parameters can vary based upon the type of non-conductive substrate, application of continuous conductive circuit, and/or the specifics of the metallization process (e.g., molarity, specific active metal used).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step <b>215</b>, portions of the metallic base layer can be removed to realize a circuit pattern in the metallic base layer. The removal of the metallic base layer to realize the circuit pattern can separate circuit elements from the metallic base layer on the remainder of the non-conductive substrate. The region of the surface or surfaces of the non-conductive substrate in which the circuit pattern has been realized can be referred to as the plating region; the remainder of the non-conductive substrate surface or surfaces can be referred to as the non-plating region.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one contemplated embodiment, preparation of the non-conductive substrate of step <b>205</b> can include applying a substance on a portion of the non-conductive substrate that prevents or inhibits to a degree a bonding of the metallic base layer when the non-conductive substrate is placed in the active metal solution. This bonding inhibitor can make removal of portions of the metallic base layer to create the plating region (of step <b>215</b>) easier than would be otherwise possible.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The patterned non-conductive substrate can then be placed into a chemical plating solution in step <b>220</b>. In step <b>225</b>, the non-conductive substrate can be removed from the chemical plating solution after the formation of a first metal layer, composed of the metal contained in the chemical plating solution, upon the metallic base layer. Areas of the non-conductive substrate exposed by the removal of the metallic base layer in step <b>215</b> can be unaffected by the chemical plating solution.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The plating region can then be prepared (e.g., rinsed, dried, electrodes attached, etc.) for an electroplating process in step <b>230</b>. In step <b>235</b>, a second metal layer can be electroplated upon the first metal layer of the plating region.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be emphasized that the electroplating process is only performed upon the plating region and the plating region is conductively separated from the non-plating region; hence, the second metal layer cannot form upon the first metal layer of the non-plating region.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In step <b>240</b>, the first metal layer and the metallic base layer can be removed from the surface or surfaces of the non-conductive substrate in the non-plating region. Thus, leaving a pattern for a continuous conductive circuit comprised of a metallic base layer, a first metal layer, and a second metal layer upon the surface or surfaces of the non-conductive substrate without affecting the non-conductive substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustrated process flow <b>300</b> depicting the non-deleterious creation of a continuous conductive circuit <b>380</b> upon a non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> in accordance with embodiments of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. Process flow <b>300</b> can represent a specific embodiment of methods <b>100</b> and/or <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Process flow <b>300</b> can begin with a non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> that the surface or surfaces upon which the conductive circuit <b>380</b> is to be formed have already been prepared for metallization. It should be emphasized that the surface or surfaces of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> need not be limited to a planar silhouette. That is, the described process can create a conductive circuit <b>380</b> upon a non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> where the receiving surface includes concavity and/or convexity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, this process can create conductive circuits <b>380</b> upon an external (convex) or internal (concave) surface of a spherical or cylindrical object. Alternately, the surface can have minor convexities and/or concavities like waves or ripples.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As such, the described process can broaden the type of non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> topographies, in addition to shapes, that can be used as the basis for conductive circuits <b>380</b>. The described process can allow the use of non-conductive substrates <b>305</b> whose surface imperfections can be considered unacceptable for conventional techniques and/or reduce the need for steps to improve surface flatness like chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). That is, using the process described herein, no surface flatness improvements following by a photochemical machining (PCM) technique are necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the example illustrated in process flow <b>300</b>, the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> can be a piece of polycarbonate. The non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> can be placed in an active metal solution <b>310</b>, such as a palladium solution having a molarity of 10-70 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Submersion in and the subsequent removal of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> from the active metal solution <b>310</b> can result in intermediary <b>315</b>. As shown in this example, intermediary <b>315</b> can have a metallic base layer <b>320</b>, indicated in light grey, upon the surface of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>, formed from the active metal supplied by the active metal solution <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The specific thickness of the active metal layer <b>320</b> can vary based upon the type of active metal, the type of non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>, the type of conductive circuit <b>380</b> being formed, as well as other process-specific variables.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that the metallic base layer <b>320</b> can be formed on the entirety of the surface area presented by the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>, and that the layering shown in process flow <b>300</b> can represent a cut-away view so as to emphasize layer distinctions. That is, if all surfaces of the plate-shaped non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> are exposed when placed in the active metal solution <b>310</b>, then the resultant intermediary <b>315</b> would have a metallic base layer <b>320</b> covering the entirety of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>, and not just the &#x201c;top&#x201d; layer, as shown in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A circuit pattern <b>330</b> can be realized in the metallic base layer <b>320</b>, resulting in intermediary <b>325</b>. Realization of the circuit pattern <b>330</b> can involve the removal of the metallic base layer <b>320</b> from the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> around areas comprising the circuit pattern <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, an yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser can be used to remove the metallic base layer <b>320</b>. In such a process, the YAG laser can provide a power of 4-10 W at a frequency of 5-30 kHz with a power density of 1-7%.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the process to realize the circuit pattern <b>330</b> in the metallic base layer <b>320</b> can physically separate the metallic base layer <b>320</b> into two separate regions. The plating region <b>335</b> can include the circuit pattern <b>330</b> and any other auxiliary areas to be electroplated later in the process. The remainder of the metallic base layer <b>320</b> not included in the plating region <b>335</b> can be referred to as the non-plating region <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an alternate embodiment of process flow <b>300</b>, the metallic base layer <b>320</b> of the non-plating region <b>340</b> can be removed as well, leaving only the plating region <b>335</b> upon the surface of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Intermediary <b>325</b> can then be placed in a chemical plating solution <b>345</b> to create intermediary <b>350</b>. As shown by intermediary <b>350</b>, the chemical plating solution <b>345</b> can form a first metal layer <b>355</b>, indicated by the medium grey layer, upon the metallic base layer <b>320</b>, the light grey layer.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, an electroless copper plating process can result in a first metal layer <b>355</b> of copper or an electroless nickel plating process can produce a nickel layer <b>355</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is important to note that the first metal layer <b>355</b> can be formed on the metallic base layer <b>320</b> in both the plating region <b>335</b> and the non-plating region <b>340</b>. While the first metal layer <b>355</b>, in essence, is only needed on the metallic base layer <b>320</b> of the circuit pattern <b>330</b>, creation of the first metal layer <b>355</b> in both regions <b>335</b> and <b>340</b> can be more cost-effective and time-saving than processing the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> to inhibit the formation of the first metal layer <b>355</b> in the non-plating region <b>340</b>. That is, coating the entirety of the metallic base layer <b>320</b> with the first metal layer <b>355</b> and later removing the first metal layer <b>355</b> from the non-plating region <b>340</b> can be easier and more efficient than attempting to limit formation of the first metal layer <b>355</b> to the plating region <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An electroplating process <b>360</b> can be used on the plating region <b>335</b> of intermediary <b>350</b> to produce intermediary <b>365</b>. The electrodes used in the electroplating process <b>360</b> can be connected such that contact is made with only the plating region <b>335</b>. Therefore, the second metal layer <b>375</b>, indicated by the dark grey layer, can only form upon the first metal layer <b>355</b> contained within the plating region <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, since the first metal layer <b>355</b> of the plating region <b>335</b> and the first metal layer <b>355</b> of the non-plating region <b>340</b> are physically separated, the non-conductive nature of the substrate <b>305</b> can provide additional insulation and limit the electroplating process <b>360</b> to only the plating region <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Intermediary <b>365</b> can then be used as an input medium for other electronic circuit processes. Alternately, the first metal layer <b>355</b> and metallic base layer <b>320</b> can be removed from intermediary <b>365</b> to produce the end state <b>375</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">End state <b>375</b> can include the conductive circuit <b>380</b> formed to the surface of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>. The conductive circuit <b>380</b> can include the metallic base layer <b>320</b> that binds the first and second metal layers <b>355</b> and <b>370</b> to the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is important to note that the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> has not been altered by the formation of the conductive circuit <b>380</b> shown in end state <b>375</b>. Process flow <b>300</b> can create the conductive circuit <b>380</b> without breaking the surface of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>, unlike other conventional formation techniques that embed one or more layers of the conductive circuit <b>380</b> within the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b>. This can keep the integrity of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> intact.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, since this non-deleterious process does not need to take into account modifications of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> to accommodate the design or circuit pattern <b>330</b>, the time required to implement a new circuit pattern <b>330</b> or a modification to an existing circuit pattern <b>330</b> can be significantly decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the typical fabrication process for an integrated circuit (IC) (i.e., micro-processor or chip) can involve specialized substrates (i.e., doped silicon wafers) and multiple lithographic, etching, and/or deposition steps to form the conductive circuit <b>380</b>. Implementing a single design change to this type of process can result in reworking and/or changing the each mask that comprises the circuit pattern <b>330</b>, not to mention reconfiguring the machinery to work with the new/changed masks.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Because of this large amount of overhead, design changes can take a larger amount of time to realize in terms of actual fabrication. Thus, many IC manufacturers tend to roll design changes or considerations into a new product line in lieu of attempting to change the design while in fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With the described process, however, a design can be implemented in a more timely fashion with less difficulty. Since the circuit pattern <b>330</b> is applied to the surface of the non-conductive substrate <b>305</b> as a single structure, a change to the design can be realized within this process by simply adjusting the process to the new circuit pattern <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the realization of the circuit pattern <b>330</b> within the metallic base layer <b>320</b> can be altered to utilize the new circuit pattern <b>330</b> (i.e., the laser operator would follow the new circuit pattern <b>330</b>). The new circuit pattern <b>330</b> may also require a change in the placement of the electrodes during the electroplating process <b>360</b>. These process changes can be considered relatively minor when compared to those encountered in conventional conductive circuit <b>380</b> formation processes.</p>
