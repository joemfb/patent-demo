<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a gas sensor including a sensor element and measuring a predetermined gas component in a measurement gas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, various measuring apparatuses have been used for recognizing a concentration of a desired gas component in a measurement gas. For example, as a device for measuring a NOx concentration in a measurement gas such as a combustion gas, known is a gas sensor having an electrochemical pumping cell structured by forming a Pt electrode and a Rh electrode on an oxygen-ion conductive solid electrolyte layer, such as a zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) layer. In this gas sensor, a diffusion control part communicating with the outside is formed so as to take a measurement gas from the outside into a sensor element and to apply a diffusion resistance suitable for measurement of a concentration of a desired gas component to the measurement gas.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, known is a gas sensor in which an opening communicating with the outside is provided in an end portion of a sensor element and a diffusion control part configured as a horizontally elongated slit is provided (for example, see Japanese Patent No. 3701124). Japanese Patent No. 3701124 discloses a gas sensor further including a gas inlet space before the slit-shaped diffusion control part mentioned above. Also known is a gas sensor including a diffusion control part formed by a porous body being filled in a portion of a sensor element for introducing a measurement gas from the outside so that a diffusion resistance suitable for measurement of a concentration of a desired gas component can be applied to the measurement gas during take-in of the measurement gas into the sensor element from the outside (for example, see Japanese Patent No. 3176890).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The gas sensors disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3701124 and Japanese Patent No. 3176890 are, for example, installed in an exhaust pipe of an internal combustion engine such as an automobile engine, and used to measure a concentration of a desired gas component contained in an exhaust gas. In such an internal combustion engine, in a case where driving thereof is stopped, water vapor contained in the exhaust gas may be condensed to form a water droplet. Such a water droplet is not only accumulated in the exhaust pipe but also adheres to the gas sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, a gas sensor is mounted in an exhaust pipe so as to be substantially perpendicularly to a flow of an exhaust gas while a protective covering having a gas inlet hole through which a gas can freely pass is provided at the outer side of a sensor element. Therefore, in a case where a water droplet adheres to the inside of the protective covering, a part of the water droplet is discharged through the gas inlet hole. However, the water droplet still stays at a bottom portion of the protective covering. Since the bottom portion of the protective covering is in close contact with an end portion of the sensor element, when an internal combustion engine is re-driven, a considerable part of the water droplet staying at the bottom portion of the protective covering adheres to the end portion of the sensor element. Additionally, a water droplet staying within the exhaust pipe may splash within the protective covering to adhere to the end portion of the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result, the adhering of the water droplet partially cools only the end portion, to cause a temperature gradient between the end portion and the inside of the sensor element. Moreover, a thermal stress resulting from this temperature gradient may cause cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, water adhering to the end portion of the sensor element may reach an internal space through a slit-shaped diffusion control part formed in the end portion of the sensor element due to the capillarity. In a case where the internal combustion engine is driven in this state, the water rapidly vaporizes in the internal space to cause cracking in the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this manner, occurrence of cracking in the sensor element largely changes a diffusion resistance to be applied to the measurement gas, which is not preferable because a measurement accuracy is deteriorated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is directed to a gas sensor for measuring a predetermined gas component in a measurement gas, and particularly relates to a structure of a sensor element forming the gas sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the present invention, a gas sensor detecting a predetermined gas component in a measurement gas includes a sensor element constituted by an oxygen-ion conductive solid electrolyte as a main component. The said sensor element includes: an external communication part having an opening opened to the outside, and introducing the measurement gas from the outside under a predetermined diffusion resistance; an internal space communicating with the external communication part; a first electrode formed on a surface of the internal space; a second electrode formed in a space different from the internal space; and a pumping cell operable to pump out oxygen existing in the internal space when a predetermined voltage is applied between the first electrode and the second electrode. The thickness of the external communication part is 50% or more and 100% or less of the thickness of the internal space.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This can achieve a gas sensor whose measurement accuracy is stably maintained even if water adheres to an end portion of the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the sensor element included in the gas sensor according to the present invention further includes a buffer space provided between the external communication part and the internal space.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This can achieve a gas sensor in which a concentration fluctuation in the measurement gas can be suitably suppressed even if the measurement gas is abruptly taken into the sensor element along with a pressure fluctuation in the measurement gas existing in the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, in the gas sensor according to the present invention, the external communication part has the opening formed in a side portion or an end portion of the sensor element.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C, for simplification, components other than the gas distribution part <b>111</b> are omitted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a cross-section as sectioned along the arrow A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a cross-section as sectioned along the arrow B-B&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a cross-section as sectioned along the arrow C-C&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an example of a detailed configuration of the gas sensor <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sensor element <b>101</b> is an elongated plate-shaped element having a structure in which six layers, namely, a first substrate layer <b>1</b>, a second substrate layer <b>2</b>, a third substrate layer <b>3</b>, a first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b>, a spacer layer <b>5</b>, and a second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b>, are laminated in the mentioned order from the bottom side seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the layers being formed as an oxygen-ion conductive solid electrolyte layer such as a zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) layer. The solid electrolyte forming these six layers is densely airtight. The sensor element <b>101</b> is manufactured by, for example, performing a predetermined process and printing a circuit pattern on ceramic green sheets, each of which corresponds to each of the layers, then laminating the green sheets, then cut the laminated body into element units, and furthermore baking the laminated body to integrate it.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Between a lower surface of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> and an upper surface of the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b> at one end portion of the sensor element <b>101</b>, an external communication part <b>11</b>, a first internal space <b>20</b>, a first diffusion control part <b>30</b>, and a second internal space <b>40</b> are adjacently formed in the mentioned order so as to be in communication with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The external communication part <b>11</b> is a space within the sensor element <b>101</b> provided by hollowing out the spacer layer <b>5</b>, in which its upper portion is defined by the lower surface of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> or an internal surface <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the spacer layer <b>5</b>, its lower portion is defined by the upper surface of the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b> or an internal surface <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the spacer layer <b>5</b>, and its side portion is defined by side surfaces <b>5</b><i>c </i>and <b>5</b><i>d </i>of the spacer layer <b>5</b>. In more detail, the position where the external communication part <b>11</b> is formed is adjusted in accordance with the degree of a diffusion resistance suitable for measurement of a nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentration, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first internal space <b>20</b> and the second internal space <b>40</b> are also spaces within the sensor element <b>101</b> provided by hollowing out the spacer layer <b>5</b>, in which their upper portions are defined by the lower surface of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b>, their lower portions are defined by the upper surface of the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b>, and their side portions are defined by the side surfaces of the spacer layer <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first diffusion control part <b>30</b> is configured as two horizontally long slits (whose openings are elongated in a y-axis direction). A part extending from the external communication part <b>11</b> to the second internal space <b>40</b> is also referred to as a gas distribution part <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the other end portion of the sensor element <b>101</b>, at a position which is farther from an end portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the element than the gas distribution part <b>111</b> is, a reference gas inlet space <b>43</b> is provided between an upper surface of the third substrate layer <b>3</b> and a lower surface of the spacer layer <b>5</b>. A side portion of the reference gas inlet space <b>43</b> is defined by a side surface of the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b>. As a reference gas for measuring a NOx concentration, for example, air is introduced into the reference gas inlet space <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An air introduction layer <b>48</b> is constituted by porous alumina. The reference gas is introduced through the reference gas inlet space <b>43</b> into the air introduction layer <b>48</b>. The air introduction layer <b>48</b> is fowled so as to cover a reference electrode <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reference electrode <b>42</b> is an electrode formed so as to be interposed between the upper surface of the third substrate layer <b>3</b> and the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b>. As described above, the air introduction layer <b>48</b> leading to the reference gas inlet space <b>43</b> is provided around the reference electrode <b>42</b>. By using the reference electrode <b>42</b>, an oxygen concentration (oxygen partial pressure) in the internal space can be measured, as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">&#x3c;Details of Gas Distribution Part and Associated Parts&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The external communication part <b>11</b> applies a predetermined diffusion resistance suitable for measurement of a nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentration to the measurement gas introduced through an opening <b>11</b><i>a </i>formed in the end portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the sensor element from the outside, and then guides the resistant measurement gas to the first internal space <b>20</b> communicating with the external communication part <b>11</b> through a communication part <b>11</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A width a of the external communication part <b>11</b> in the y-axis direction and a thickness b thereof in a z-axis direction are defined in accordance with the degree of the diffusion resistance to be applied to the measurement gas introduced from the opening <b>11</b><i>a </i>into the first internal space <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Here, it is preferable that the thickness b of the external communication part <b>11</b> is 50% to 100% of a thickness (hollow-chamber thickness) d of the first internal space <b>20</b> in the z-axis direction, and the width a of the external communication part <b>11</b> is 5% to 60% (desirably 10% to 40%) of a width (hollow-chamber width) c of the first internal space <b>20</b> in the y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The thickness b less than 50% of the thickness d is not preferable, because the opening <b>11</b><i>a </i>has a reduced opening area so that water adhering to the end portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the sensor element may easily enter the first internal space <b>20</b> due to the capillarity. The width a less than 5% of the width c is not preferable, because the opening <b>11</b><i>a </i>has a reduced opening area so that water adhering to the end portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the sensor element may easily enter the first internal space <b>20</b> due to the capillarity. The width a more than 60% of the width c makes it difficult that a diffusion resistance suitable for measurement of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentration is applied to the measurement gas.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this manner, in the gas sensor <b>100</b>, the width a and the thickness b of the external communication part <b>11</b> are defined within the range mentioned above, thereby suppressing entry of water adhering to the end portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the sensor element into the first internal space <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first internal space <b>20</b> is provided as a space for adjusting the oxygen partial pressure in the measurement gas introduced through the external communication part <b>11</b>. This oxygen partial pressure is adjusted by an operation of a main pumping cell <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The main pumping cell <b>21</b> is an electrochemical pumping cell constituted by an inside pump electrode <b>22</b>, an outside pump electrode <b>23</b>, and a part of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> interposed between these electrodes. The inside pump electrode <b>22</b> has a ceiling electrode portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>provided on a substantially entire part of the lower surface of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> facing the first internal space <b>20</b>. The outside pump electrode <b>23</b> is provided in a region on an upper surface of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> corresponding to the ceiling electrode portion <b>22</b><i>a</i>, so as to be exposed to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The inside pump electrode <b>22</b> is formed over the upper and lower solid electrolyte layers (the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> and the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b>) which define the first internal space <b>20</b>, and the spacer layer <b>5</b> which provides a side wall to the first internal space <b>20</b>. To be specific, the ceiling electrode portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>is formed on the lower surface of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> which provides a ceiling surface to the first internal space <b>20</b>. A bottom electrode portion <b>22</b><i>b </i>is formed on the upper surface of the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b> which provides a bottom surface to the first internal space <b>20</b>. A side electrode portion (not shown) connecting the ceiling electrode portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>to the bottom electrode portion <b>22</b><i>b </i>is formed on side wall surfaces (inner surfaces) of the spacer layer <b>5</b> which form both side wall portions of the first internal space <b>20</b>. Thus, the inside pump electrode <b>22</b> has a tunnel-like shape at a location where the side electrode portion is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each of the inside pump electrode <b>22</b> and the outside pump electrode <b>23</b> is formed as a porous cermet electrode (for example, a cermet electrode including Pt containing Au by 1% and zirconia). The inside pump electrode <b>22</b> which is brought into contact with the measurement gas is formed using a material having a weakened reduction ability with respect to a NOx component in the measurement gas, or having no reduction ability with respect to the NOx component in the measurement gas.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the main pumping cell <b>21</b>, a desired pump voltage Vp<b>0</b> is applied between the inside pump electrode <b>22</b> and the outside pump electrode <b>23</b> to make a pump current Ip<b>0</b> flow in a positive direction or a negative direction between the inside pump electrode <b>22</b> and the outside pump electrode <b>23</b>, and this allows oxygen existing within the first internal space <b>20</b> to be pumped out to the outside or oxygen existing in the outside to be pumped into the first internal space <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to detect an oxygen concentration (oxygen partial pressure) in the atmosphere of the first internal space <b>20</b>, an electrochemical sensor cell, in other words, a main-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>80</b> is formed with the inside pump electrode <b>22</b>, the second solid electrolyte <b>6</b>, the spacer layer <b>5</b>, the first solid electrolyte <b>4</b>, the third substrate layer <b>3</b>, and the reference electrode <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The oxygen concentration (oxygen partial pressure) in the first internal space <b>20</b> can be recognized by measuring an electromotive force V<b>0</b> of the main-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>80</b>. Moreover, the pump current Ip<b>0</b> is controlled by feedback-controlling Vp<b>0</b> so as to maintain the electromotive force V<b>0</b> constant. Thereby, the oxygen concentration in the first internal space <b>20</b> can be maintained at a predetermined constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first diffusion control part <b>30</b> applies a predetermined diffusion resistance to the measurement gas whose oxygen concentration (oxygen partial pressure) has been controlled in the first internal space <b>20</b> by the operation of the main pumping cell <b>21</b>, and guides the measurement gas to the second internal space <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second internal space <b>40</b> is provided as a space for performing a process concerning measurement of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentration in the measurement gas introduced through the first diffusion control part <b>30</b>. In the second internal space <b>40</b> in which the oxygen concentration in the measurement gas is adjusted by an auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b>, the NOx concentration is measured by the operation of a measuring pumping cell <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the second internal space <b>40</b>, the auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b> performs further adjustment of oxygen partial pressure on the measurement gas whose oxygen concentration (oxygen partial pressure) has been adjusted in advance in the first internal space <b>20</b> and which has then been introduced through the first diffusion control part <b>30</b>. This enables an oxygen concentration in the second internal space <b>40</b> to be accurately maintained constant. Therefore, the gas sensor <b>100</b> can measure a NOx concentration with a high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b> is an auxiliary electrochemical pumping cell constituted by an auxiliary pump electrode <b>51</b>, the outside pump electrode <b>23</b> (not limited to the outside pump electrode <b>23</b> but may be any appropriate electrode positioned outside the sensor element <b>101</b>), and the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b>. The auxiliary pump electrode <b>51</b> has a ceiling electrode portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>provided on a substantially entire part of the lower surface of the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> facing the second internal space <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Similarly to the inside pump electrode <b>22</b> provided in the first internal space <b>20</b>, the auxiliary pump electrode <b>51</b> has a tunnel-like shape and provided in the second internal space <b>40</b>. That is, the ceiling electrode portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>is formed on the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b> which provides a ceiling surface to the second internal space <b>40</b>. A bottom electrode portion <b>51</b><i>b </i>is formed on the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b> which provides a bottom surface to the second internal space <b>40</b>. A side electrode portion (not shown) connecting the ceiling electrode portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>to the bottom electrode portion <b>51</b><i>b </i>is formed on both wall surfaces of the spacer layer <b>5</b> which provides side walls to the second internal space <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Similarly to the inside pump electrode <b>22</b>, the auxiliary pump electrode <b>51</b> is unwed using a material having a weakened reduction ability with respect to a NOx component in the measurement gas, or having no reduction ability with respect to the NOx component in the measurement gas.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b>, a desired voltage Vp<b>1</b> is applied between the auxiliary pump electrode <b>51</b> and the outside pump electrode <b>23</b>, and this allows oxygen existing in the atmosphere of the second internal space <b>40</b> to be pumped out to the outside or oxygen existing in the outside to be pumped into the second internal space <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In order to control oxygen partial pressure in the atmosphere of the second internal space <b>40</b>, an electrochemical sensor cell, in other words, an auxiliary-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>81</b> is formed with the auxiliary pump electrode <b>51</b>, the reference electrode <b>42</b>, the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b>, the spacer layer <b>5</b>, the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b>, and the third substrate layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A variable power source <b>52</b> causes the auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b> to perform pumping. The variable power source <b>52</b> is voltage-controlled based on an electromotive force V<b>1</b> which is detected by the auxiliary-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>81</b>. Therefore, the oxygen partial pressure in the atmosphere of the second internal space <b>40</b> is lowered to have substantially no influence on the NOx measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At the same time, a pump current Ip<b>1</b> of the auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b> is used for a control of the electromotive force of the main-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>80</b>. Specifically, the pump current Ip<b>1</b> is inputted as a control signal to the main-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>80</b>, and its electromotive force V<b>0</b> is controlled, so that a gradient of the oxygen partial pressure in the measurement gas introduced into the second internal space <b>40</b> through the first diffusion control part <b>30</b> is maintained so as to be always constant. When used as a NOx sensor, the oxygen concentration in the second internal space <b>40</b> is maintained at a constant value of approximately 0.001 ppm, by the operations of the main pumping cell <b>21</b> and the auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, in the gas sensor <b>100</b>, by operating the main pumping cell <b>21</b> and the auxiliary pumping cell <b>50</b>, the oxygen partial pressure is always maintained to be a constant low value (value having substantially no influence on the measurement of NOx).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The measurement gas whose oxygen concentration has been adjusted in the second internal space <b>40</b> is measured for the NOx concentration by the operation of the measuring pumping cell <b>41</b>. The measuring pumping cell <b>41</b> is an electrochemical pumping cell constituted by a measuring electrode <b>44</b>, the outside pump electrode <b>23</b>, the second solid electrolyte layer <b>6</b>, the spacer layer <b>5</b>, and the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b>. The measuring electrode <b>44</b> is provided at a position on the upper surface of the first solid electrolyte layer <b>4</b> facing the second internal space <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The measuring electrode <b>44</b> is a porous cermet electrode. The measuring electrode <b>44</b> also functions as a NOx reducing catalyst which reduces NOx existing in the atmosphere of the second internal space <b>40</b>. The measuring electrode <b>44</b> is covered with a second diffusion control part <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The second diffusion control part <b>45</b> is a film constituted by a porous body containing alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) as a main component. The second diffusion control part <b>45</b> serves to limit the amount of NOx flowing into the measuring electrode <b>44</b>, and also functions as a protective film of the measuring electrode <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The measuring pumping cell <b>41</b> can pump out oxygen generated by decomposition of nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere around the measuring electrode <b>44</b>, and detects the amount of the generated oxygen as a pump current Ip<b>2</b>.</p>

A variable power source <b>46</b> is controlled based on an electromotive force V<b>2</b> detected by the measuring-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As described above, the measurement gas introduced into the second internal space <b>40</b> reaches the measuring electrode <b>44</b> through the second diffusion control part <b>45</b> while the oxygen partial pressure in the measurement gas is being controlled. Nitrogen oxide in the measurement gas existing around the measuring electrode <b>44</b> is reduced (2NO&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>), to generate oxygen. The generated oxygen is pumped by the measuring pumping cell <b>41</b>. At this time, a voltage Vp<b>2</b> of the variable power source is controlled such that a control voltage V<b>2</b> detected by the measuring-pump-controlling oxygen-partial-pressure detection sensor cell <b>82</b> can be maintained constant. The amount of oxygen generated around the measuring electrode <b>44</b> is proportional to a nitrogen-oxide concentration in the measurement gas. Thus, the nitrogen-oxide concentration in the measurement gas is calculated by using the pump current Ip<b>2</b> of the measuring pumping cell <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In other words, in the gas sensor <b>100</b>, the NOx concentration in the measurement gas can be recognized based on the pump current Ip<b>2</b> which flows when the oxygen generated by the reduction of NOx is pumped out by the measuring pumping cell <b>41</b> substantially in proportion to the NOx concentration in the measurement gas.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a result of measurement of the cracking water droplet amount of each of the eight types of gas sensors corresponding to the first preferred embodiment. The eight types of gas sensors are different from one another in the width a of the external communication part <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a result of measurement of the cracking water droplet amount of each of the five types of gas sensors corresponding to the second preferred embodiment. The five types of gas sensors are different from one another in the thickness b of the external communication part <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a result of measurement of the cracking water droplet amount of each of five types of gas sensors corresponding to the third preferred embodiment. The five types of gas sensors are different from one another in the thickness for the external communication part <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a result of measurement of the cracking water droplet amount of each of eight types of gas sensors corresponding to the fourth preferred embodiment. The eight types of gas sensors are different from one another in the width e of the external communication part <b>12</b>. For each type of the gas sensor, the number of measured gas sensors was five. Here, it is to be noted that, the cases where the ratio of the width of the external communication part to the hollow-chamber width was 100% in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 14</figref>, and the cases where the ratio of the thickness of the external communication part to the hollow-chamber thickness was 5% in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> were results of measurement with respect to the gas sensor G which is a comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 14</figref> indicate average values of measurement values, and the lines above and below the circles indicate the maximum values and the minimum values of the measurement values. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 14</figref>, it is observed that the cracking water droplet amount of any of the gas sensors according to this example was larger than that of the gas sensor G according to the comparative example, irrespective of the width or the thickness of the external communication part. This result means that any of the gas sensors according to this example had a larger fracture strength than that of the gas sensor G according to the comparative example, irrespective of the width or the thickness of the external communication part. Particularly, in a case where the ratio of the width of the external communication part to the hollow-chamber width was 5% or more and 60% or less, and a case where the ratio of the thickness of the external communication part to the hollow-chamber thickness was 50% or more and 100% or less, the cracking water droplet amount was twice or more of that of the gas sensor according to the comparative example. This indicates that providing the external communication part so as to satisfy these sizes can achieve a gas sensor having a doubled fracture strength as compared with the conventional gas sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">From the results of the examples 1 and 2, it is confirmed that providing the external communication part whose size is set so as to satisfy the above-mentioned requirements is effective in improving the fracture strength. In both of the examples 1 and 2, it is confirmed that providing the external communication part having an opening in a side portion of the sensor element (corresponding to the third and fourth preferred embodiments) is more effective in improving the fracture strength. This result means that providing the above-described external communication part is effective in suppressing a deterioration in the measurement accuracy which may otherwise be caused by occurrence of cracking in the sensor element.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In this example, the respective gas sensors of the example 1 were examined for the responsiveness. In a test of the responsiveness, in a case where an air-fuel ratio (a oxygen concentration in a measurement gas) of a measurement gas was changed from &#x3bb;=0.9 to &#x3bb;=1.1, a sensor output (Ip<b>2</b>) obtained at a time when the inside of the sensor element was substantially fully replaced with the measurement gas having an air-fuel ratio of &#x3bb;=0.9 was defined as 0%, and the sensor output (Ip<b>2</b>) obtained at a time when the inside of the sensor element was substantially fully replaced with a measurement gas having an air-fuel ratio of &#x3bb;=1.1 was defined as 100%. Under this condition, a time (response time) from the time point when the sensor output (Ip<b>2</b>) corresponding to 33% was detected to the time point when the sensor output (Ip<b>2</b>) corresponding to 66% was detected was measured three times for each of the gas sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a result of measurement of the response time of each of the gas sensors A to G. In each of the gas sensors A to F, the relationship between the width of the external communication part and the width c, and the relationship between the thickness of the external communication part and the thickness d were the same as those of the gas sensors used in the water drop test shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the circles indicate average values of the measurement values, and the lines above and below the circles indicate the maximum values and the minimum values of the measurement values. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, no significant difference was observed between the response times of the gas sensors A to F and the resonse time of the gas sensor G.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The above-described results reveal that responsiveness equivalent to the responsiveness of the conventional gas sensor can be obtained also by the gas sensors A to F provided with the external communication part that satisfies the above-mentioned requirements.</p>
