<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor wafer is aligned using a double patterning process. A first resist layer having a first optical characteristic is deposited and foams at least one alignment mark. The first resist layer is developed. A second resist layer having a second optical characteristic is deposited over the first resist layer. The combination of first and second resist layers and alignment mark has a characteristic such that radiation of a pre-determined wavelength incident on the alignment mark produces a first or higher order diffraction as a function of the first and second optical characteristics.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of provisional application 61/168,382 filed on Apr. 10, 2009. The subject matter of that application is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to an illumination system of the type used in lithographic apparatus for semiconductor wafer manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A lithographic apparatus is a machine that applies a desired pattern onto a substrate, usually onto a target portion of the substrate. A lithographic apparatus can be used, for example, in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs). In that instance, a patterning device, which is alternatively referred to as a mask or a reticle, may be used to generate a circuit pattern to be formed on an individual layer of the IC. This pattern can be transferred onto a target portion (e.g., comprising part of, one, or several dies) on a substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer). Transfer of the pattern is typically via imaging the pattern using a UV radiation beam onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist) provided on the substrate. In general, a single substrate will contain a network of adjacent target portions that are successively patterned. Known lithographic apparatus include so-called steppers, in which each target portion is irradiated by exposing an entire pattern onto the target portion at one time, and so-called scanners, in which each target portion is irradiated by scanning the pattern through a radiation beam in a given direction (the &#x201c;scanning&#x201d;-direction) while synchronously scanning the substrate parallel or anti-parallel to this direction. It is also possible to transfer the pattern from the patterning device to the substrate by imprinting the pattern onto the substrate. Another lithographic system is an interferometric lithographic system where there is no patterning device, but rather a light beam is split into two beams, and the two beams are caused to interfere at a target portion of substrate through the use of a reflection system. The interference causes lines to be formed on at the target portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lithography apparatus typically includes an alignment system that detects positions of alignment marks on a wafer and for aligning the wafer to ensure accurate exposure from a mask. In a double patterning process, a first resist layer having an alignment mark is coated with a second resist layer prior to etching the first and second resist layers. In double patterning systems, the alignment marks in the first resist layer are used to align a mask and expose the second resist layer. However, the alignment mark in the first resist layer may be obliterated or may provide poor contrast and weak diffraction orders when illuminated at an alignment wavelength since it is coated over with the second resist layer. Methods and systems are needed to overcome the above alignment deficiencies in double patterning systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method to align a wafer in a double patterning process. A first resist layer having a first optical characteristic is deposited and forms at least one alignment mark having the first optical characteristic in the first resist layer. The first resist layer is developed. A second resist layer is deposited over the first resist layer. This second resist layer has a second optical characteristic. The combination of first and second resist layers and alignment mark is configured such that radiation of a pre-determined wavelength incident on the alignment mark produces a first or higher order diffraction as a function of the first and second resist layers' optical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the alignment mark in the first resist layer and a portion of the second resist layer together form a diffraction grating. The grating enhances first or higher order diffractions while substantially reducing zero<sup>th </sup>order diffraction and specular reflection when illuminated with the wavelength used for alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method further includes the step of infusing one or both of the first and second resist layers with a dye or a photoactive compound that absorbs, fluoresces or luminesces when illuminated with radiation of the pre-determined wavelength used for alignment. A photoactive compound/dye can be added to the first resist layer prior to depositing the first resist layer. The dye or photoactive compound may be added to the first resist layer while depositing the first resist layer. Alternatively, the dye or a photoactive compound can be added to the first resist layer after developing the first resist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the method comprises the step of freezing the first resist layer after the developing step and adding a photoactive compound to a freeze agent used to freeze the first resist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment, the dye or photoactive compound is added only to the second resist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the dye or photoactive compound is added to the first resist layer after patterning the first resist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further embodiment, a first dye or photoactive compound is added to the first resist layer and a second photoactive compound or dye is added to the second resist layer so as to increase optical contrast between the first and second resist layers and to improve diffraction of radiation incident on the alignment mark in the first resist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another embodiment of the present invention, an optical element is provided comprising, a first resist layer having a first optical characteristic and a second resist layer deposited over the first resist layer and having a second optical characteristic. An alignment mark formed by the combination of the first and second resist layers provides enhanced contrast when illuminated with a pre-determined wavelength used for alignment. In an embodiment, one or both of the first and the second resist layers is infused with a dye or photoactive compound that affects the resist layer's optical characteristics when illuminated with a wavelength used for alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a lithographic apparatus comprising an illumination source configured to condition a radiation beam; and a reflective substrate, the substrate including alignment targets for aligning the substrate. The substrate includes a first resist layer having a first optical characteristic and a second resist layer deposited on top of the first resist layer and having a second optical characteristic. A grating formed by the combination of the first and second resist layers provides enhanced contrast when illuminated with a pre-determined wavelength used for alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, one or both of the first and the second resist layers is infused with a dye or photoactive compound that affects the resist layer's optical characteristics when illuminated with a wavelength used for alignment.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> schematically depicts an embodiment of lithographic apparatus suitable for use with the invention. The apparatus comprises: an illumination system (illuminator) IL configured to condition a radiation beam B (e.g., UV radiation or DUV radiation); a support structure (e.g., a mask table) MT constructed to support a patterning device (e.g., a mask) MA and connected to a first positioner PM configured to accurately position the patterning device in accordance with certain parameters; a substrate table (e.g., a wafer table) WT constructed to hold a substrate (e.g., a resist-coated wafer) W and connected to a second positioner PW configured to accurately position the substrate in accordance with certain parameters; and a projection system (e.g., a refractive projection lens system) PS configured to project a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B by patterning device MA onto a target portion C (e.g., comprising one or more dies) of the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The illumination system may include various types of optical components, such as refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic, electrostatic or other types of optical components, or any combination thereof, for directing, shaping, or controlling radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The support structure supports, i.e., bears the weight of, the patterning device. It holds the patterning device in a manner that depends on the orientation of the patterning device, the design of the lithographic apparatus, and other conditions, such as for example whether or not the patterning device is held in a vacuum environment. The support structure can use mechanical, vacuum, electrostatic or other clamping techniques to hold the patterning device. The support structure may be a frame or a table, for example, which may be fixed or movable as required. The support structure may ensure that the patterning device is at a desired position, for example with respect to the projection system. Any use of the terms &#x201c;reticle&#x201d; or &#x201c;mask&#x201d; herein may be considered synonymous with the more general term &#x201c;patterning device.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;patterning device&#x201d; used herein should be broadly interpreted as referring to any device that can be used to impart a radiation beam with a pattern in its cross-section such as to create a pattern in a target portion of the substrate. It should be noted that the pattern imparted to the radiation beam may not exactly correspond to the desired pattern in the target portion of the substrate, for example if the pattern includes phase-shifting features or so called assist features. Generally, the pattern imparted to the radiation beam will correspond to a particular functional layer in a device being created in the target portion, such as an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The patterning device may be transmissive or reflective. Examples of patterning devices include masks, programmable mirror arrays, and programmable LCD panels. Masks are well known in lithography, and include mask types such as binary, alternating phase-shift, and attenuated phase-shift, as well as various hybrid mask types. An example of a programmable mirror array employs a matrix arrangement of small mirrors, each of which can be individually tilted so as to reflect an incoming radiation beam in different directions. The tilted mirrors impart a pattern in a radiation beam which is reflected by the mirror matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, in an interferometric lithographic system there is no patterning device, but rather a light beam is split into two beams, and the two beams are caused to interfere at a target portion of substrate through the use of a reflection system. The interference causes lines to be formed on at the target portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d; used herein should be broadly interpreted as encompassing any type of projection system, including refractive, reflective, catadioptric, magnetic, electromagnetic and electrostatic optical systems, or any combination thereof, as appropriate for the exposure radiation being used, or for other factors such as the use of an immersion liquid or the use of a vacuum. Any use of the term &#x201c;projection lens&#x201d; herein may be considered as synonymous with the more general term &#x201c;projection system.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As here depicted, the apparatus is of a transmissive type (e.g., employing a transmissive mask). Alternatively, the apparatus may be of a reflective type (e.g., employing a programmable mirror array of a type as referred to above, or employing a reflective mask).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The lithographic apparatus maybe of a type having two (dual stage) or more substrate tables (and/or two or more mask tables). In such &#x201c;multiple stage&#x201d; machines the additional tables may be used in parallel, or preparatory steps may be carried out on one or more tables while one or more other tables are being used for exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the illuminator IL receives a radiation beam from a radiation source SO. The source and the lithographic apparatus may be separate entities, for example when the source is an excimer laser. In such cases, the source is not considered to form part of the lithographic apparatus and the radiation beam is passed from the source SO to the illuminator IL with the aid of a beam delivery system BD comprising, for example, suitable directing mirrors and/or a beam expander. In other cases the source may be an integral part of the lithographic apparatus, for example when the source is a mercury lamp. The source SO and the illuminator IL, together with the beam delivery system BD if required, may be referred to as a radiation system.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The illuminator IL may comprise an adjuster AD for adjusting the angular intensity distribution of the radiation beam. Generally, at least the outer and/or inner radial extent (commonly referred to as &#x3c3;-outer and &#x3c3;-inner, respectively) of the intensity distribution in a pupil plane of the illuminator can be adjusted. In addition, the illuminator IL may comprise various other components, such as an integrator IN and a condenser CO. The illuminator may be used to condition the radiation beam, to have a desired uniformity and intensity distribution in its cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device (e.g., mask MA), which is held on the support structure (e.g., mask table MT), and is patterned by the patterning device, in this case mask MA, in accordance with a pattern MP. Having traversed the mask MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the beam onto a target portion C of the substrate W. The projection system has a pupil PPU conjugate to an illumination system pupil IPU. Portions of radiation emanate from the intensity distribution at the illumination system pupil IPU and traverse a mask pattern without being affected by diffraction at a mask pattern create an image of the intensity distribution at the illumination system pupil IPU.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF (e.g., an interferometric device, linear encoder or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately, e.g., so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B. Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor (which is not explicitly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be used to accurately position the mask MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B, e.g., after mechanical retrieval from a mask library, or during a scan. In general, movement of the mask table MT may be realized with the aid of a long-stroke module (coarse positioning) and a short-stroke module (fine positioning), which form part of the first positioner PM. Similarly, movement of the substrate table WT may be realized using a long-stroke module and a short-stroke module, which form part of the second positioner PW. In the case of a stepper (as opposed to a scanner) the mask table MT may be connected to a short-stroke actuator only, or may be fixed. Mask MA and substrate W maybe aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. Although the substrate alignment marks as illustrated occupy dedicated target portions, they may be located in spaces between target portions (these are known as scribe-lane alignment marks). Similarly, in situations in which more than one die is provided on the mask MA, the mask alignment marks may be located between the dies.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Mask table MT and patterning device MA can be in a vacuum chamber, where an in-vacuum robot IVR can be used to move patterning devices such as a mask, similar to patterning device MA, in and out of vacuum chamber. Alternatively, when mask table MT and patterning device MA are outside of the vacuum chamber, an out-of-vacuum robot can be used for various transportation operations, similar to the in-vacuum robot IVR. Both the in-vacuum and out-of-vacuum robots need to be calibrated for a smooth transfer of any payload (e.g., mask) to a fixed kinematic mount of a transfer station.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The depicted apparatus could be used in at least one of the following modes:</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">1. In step mode, the mask table MT and the substrate table WT are kept essentially stationary, while an entire pattern imparted to the radiation beam is projected onto a target portion C at one time (i.e. a single static exposure). The substrate table WT is then shifted in the X and/or Y direction so that a different target portion C can be exposed. In step mode, the maximum size of the exposure field limits the size of the target portion C imaged in a single static exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">2. In scan mode, the mask table MT and the substrate table WT are scanned synchronously while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam is projected onto a target portion C (i.e. a single dynamic exposure). The velocity and direction of the substrate table WT relative to the mask table MT may be determined by the (de-)magnification and image reversal characteristics of the projection system PS. In scan mode, the maximum size of the exposure field limits the width (in the non-scanning direction) of the target portion in a single dynamic exposure, whereas the length of the scanning motion determines the height (in the scanning direction) of the target portion.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">3. In another mode, the mask table MT is kept essentially stationary holding a programmable patterning device, and the substrate table WT is moved or scanned while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam is projected onto a target portion C. In this mode, generally a pulsed radiation source is employed and the programmable patterning device is updated as required after each movement of the substrate table WT or in between successive radiation pulses during a scan. This mode of operation can be readily applied to maskless lithography that utilizes programmable patterning device, such as a programmable mirror array of a type as referred to above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Combinations and/or variations on the above described modes of use or entirely different modes of use may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary alignment system. Alignment system <b>10</b> may be part of the lithographic apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Alignment sensor <b>10</b> comprises a coherent illumination source <b>12</b>, such as a laser, providing electromagnetic radiation <b>13</b>, to a beamsplitter <b>14</b>. A portion of the electromagnetic radiation is reflected off coating <b>16</b> to illuminate an alignment mark or target <b>18</b>. The alignment mark <b>18</b> is placed on or within a photosensitive substrate or wafer <b>20</b>. The alignment mark or target <b>18</b> may have one hundred and eighty degree symmetry. By one hundred and eighty degree symmetry, it is meant that when the alignment mark or target <b>18</b> is rotated one hundred and eighty degree about an axis of symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the alignment mark <b>18</b>, the alignment mark is substantially identical to the unrotated alignment mark. The axis for which this is true is called the axis of symmetry. In an embodiment, alignment mark <b>18</b> is a series of defined marks such as a chevron.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The alignment mark <b>18</b> is placed on or within a photosensitive substrate or wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The photosensitive substrate is placed on a stage <b>22</b>. The stage <b>22</b> may be scanned in the direction indicated by arrow <b>24</b>. Electromagnetic radiation reflected from the alignment mark <b>18</b> passes through the beamsplitter <b>14</b> and is collected by the image rotation interferometer <b>26</b>. It should be appreciated that a good quality image need not be formed, but that the features of the alignment mark should be resolved. The image rotation interferometer <b>26</b> may be any appropriate set of optical-elements, and is preferably a combination of prisms, that form two images of the alignment mark, rotate one of the images with respect to the other one hundred and eighty degrees and then recombines the two images interferometrically so that when aligned with the alignment target <b>18</b>, the electromagnetic radiation will interfere either in a polarization sense or in an amplitude sense, constructively or destructively, making readily detectable the center of the alignment mark <b>18</b>. The optical ray passing through the center of rotation established by the interferometer, <b>26</b>, defines the sensor alignment axis <b>27</b>. Detectors <b>28</b> receive the electromagnetic radiation from the image rotation interferometer <b>26</b>. The detectors <b>28</b> then provide signals to the signal analyzer <b>30</b>. The signal analyzer <b>30</b> is coupled to the stage <b>22</b> such that the position of the stage is known when the center of alignment mark <b>18</b> is determined. Therefore, the position of the alignment mark <b>18</b> is very accurately known with reference to the stage <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the location of the alignment sensor <b>10</b> may be known such that the center of the alignment mark <b>18</b> is known with reference to the alignment sensor <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the exact location of the center of the alignment target <b>18</b> is known relative to a reference position. Thereby, by using an alignment with an image rotation interferometer, the alignment system is self referencing to the center of the alignment mark.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-E</figref> are plan views of examples of different possible alignment marks.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The signal detected from illuminated alignment marks <b>18</b> can be affected by how well the illumination wavelengths are matched to the physical, optical or chemical characteristics of the alignment marks <b>18</b>, or physical, optical or chemical characteristics of materials in contact with or adjacent to the alignment marks <b>18</b>. Since the aforementioned characteristics can vary depending on the lithographic process used, state of the art alignment systems may offer a set of discrete, relatively narrow band illumination wavelengths in order to maximize the quality and intensity of alignment mark signals detected by the alignment system. Improved alignment mark signals that carry accurate information about the position of the marks can enhance overlay performance of the lithographic tool. Alignment marks are placed in different configuration and locations on a wafer to aid in alignment of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates example placement of alignment marks <b>18</b>A-D. Fields <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B are part of a larger wafer (e.g. wafer W) and include 4 dies each. The dies are separated by inner scribe lances such as scribe lanes <b>31</b>, <b>33</b> and outer scribe lanes such as scribe lanes <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>. Alignment marks <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B are placed in inner scribe lanes <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> respectively. Alignment marks <b>18</b>C and <b>18</b>D are placed in outer scribe lanes <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> respectively. Alignment marks <b>18</b> are used to align wafers in double patterning processes as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a double patterning process, resist lines are printed twice, the second print being interstitial on the first print. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of double patterning. Pattern <b>402</b> is interstitially patterned between the gaps <b>408</b> of resist lines <b>404</b> of pattern <b>400</b> so as to form double pattern <b>406</b>. Double patterning allows for finer resolution lithography and greater utilization of available wafer area. A number of double patterning process sequences are available. For example, spacer; Lithography Etch Lithography Etch (LELE) and Lithography Process Lithography Etch (LPLE) processes may be used for double patterning. LPLE is more cost effective than LELE since a first etching process in LELE is not required in LPLE. A variant of LPLE is Litho Freeze Litho Etch (LFLE), that is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates example steps in a Litho Freeze Litho Etch (LFLE) process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step 1, a first pattern (including one or more alignment marks such as alignment mark <b>18</b>) is defined in first resist layer <b>502</b> that is deposited on top of a layer of Bottom Anti-Reflective Coating (BARC) <b>504</b>, polysilicon <b>506</b> and Silicon di-oxide SiO2 <b>508</b>. The first pattern may be defined using mask <b>500</b> that has a 1:1 line/space (L/S) ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step 2, first resist layer <b>502</b> is &#x201c;frozen&#x201d; or hardened by one or more of ion implantation, Deep Ultra-Violet (DUV) exposure, or chemical hardening.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step 3, the first resist layer <b>502</b> is coated over with second resist layer <b>510</b> and patterned using mask <b>512</b>. Mask <b>512</b> is aligned using alignment marks <b>18</b> in first resist layer <b>502</b>. Mask <b>512</b> may also have a 1:1 line/space (L/S) ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step 4, the second resist layer <b>510</b> is developed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step 5, polysilicon layer <b>506</b> is etched.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">One problem in double patterning techniques such as the one described above is that of alignment using the alignment mark <b>18</b> in first resist layer <b>502</b> when it is coated over with the second resist layer <b>510</b>. The alignment mark <b>18</b> defined in first resist layer <b>502</b> may be obliterated, with respect to contrast provided when illuminated with an alignment wavelength, when coated over with resist <b>510</b> that has the same or similar optical properties as resist used in resist layer <b>502</b>. Therefore, the alignment mark <b>18</b> in the first resist layer <b>502</b> cannot be imaged by the alignment system <b>10</b>. This forces conventional alignment systems to use an alignment mark defined by in previous processing step (i.e. an alignment mark that is lower in an alignment mark stack) for alignment of mask <b>512</b> with the first resist layer <b>502</b>. For example, in step 3, an alignment mark <b>18</b> in the first resist layer <b>502</b> may be obliterated or may provide poor contrast and weak diffraction orders <b>600</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) when illuminated with radiation <b>13</b> of an alignment wavelength used to align mask <b>512</b> with the first resist layer <b>502</b>. This is because the alignment mark <b>18</b> in first resist layer <b>502</b> is coated over with the second resist layer <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Embodiments presented herein provide means of highlighting the definition of the patterned alignment mark <b>18</b> in the first resist layer <b>502</b>, even when the alignment mark <b>18</b> is coated over with second resist layer <b>510</b>. These embodiments enable more accurate alignment of a wafer by increasing the contrast of the alignment mark <b>18</b> in the first resist layer <b>502</b> when illuminated with radiation of a predetermined wavelength that is used for alignment. Accordingly, a photoactive compound or dye is added before, mixed together with, or added after the first resist layer <b>502</b> is deposited. The dye or photoactive compound is selected such that it does not interfere with the first resist layers' actinic properties or the ability to freeze the first resist layer <b>502</b> in step 2. The dye or the photoactive compound is configured to change the optical characteristics of the first resist layer so as to generate first or higher order diffractions <b>700</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and provide a strong, high contrast alignment signal when illuminated with radiation <b>13</b> of a predetermined alignment wavelength. Alternatively, the dye or photoactive compound may cause the alignment mark to fluoresce or be luminescent when exposed with a predetermined wavelength used for alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an embodiment, the first resist layer <b>502</b> and the second resist layer <b>510</b> may combine to form a diffraction grating that is detectable by the alignment system <b>10</b>. Reflected diffraction orders may be created by the grating formed by the dyed resist image in resist layer <b>502</b> interspaced with un-dyed resist layer <b>510</b>. According to an embodiment of the invention, the combination of first and second resist layers and alignment mark is configured such that radiation <b>13</b> of a pre-determined wavelength incident on the alignment mark produces a first or higher order diffraction <b>700</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) as a function of the first and second optical characteristics or first resist layer <b>502</b> and second resist layer <b>510</b> respectively. In an embodiment, based on respective first and second optical characteristics of the respective first resist layer <b>502</b> and second resist layer <b>510</b> an alignment mark in the first resist layer exhibits high contrast and/or high order diffraction when illuminated with radiation <b>13</b> of a predetermined wavelength. The optical characteristics of the first and second resist layer are derived from a dye or a photoactive compound added to them as described below. If no dye is added to the first or second resist layer then they have the optical characteristic of a native resist solution used to create the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an embodiment, the dye or photoactive compound may be added to first resist layer <b>502</b> before or after developing the first resist layer <b>502</b>. A pattern such as an alignment mark <b>18</b> in the first layer of resist may be frozen by the utilization of a spin-coated freezing material. In an embodiment, the freezing material can be modified such that, apart from freezing, it simultaneously provides the first layer resist <b>502</b> with the dye or photoactive compound to provide high contrast diffractions at an alignment system wavelength. Examples of alignment wavelengths including but not limited to may be 532 nm, 635 nm, 780 nm, and 850 nm. In yet another embodiment, the dye can be added to the a liquid resist solution used to form first resist layer <b>502</b>, before it is applied to BARC <b>504</b>, or during the application of the resist solution onto BARC <b>504</b>. In a further embodiment, the dye or photochromic compound can be added to first resist layer <b>502</b> after developing and freezing the first resist layer <b>502</b>. The dye can also be added to the freeze agent so that resist freeze and dying of first resist layer <b>502</b> is accomplished in the same process sequence. In an embodiment, the dye or photoactive compound added to first resist layer <b>502</b> can cause photon absorption. In another example, the dye can be a photochromic material such as a spyropiran which changes its optical properties after a bleaching/flood exposure. In another embodiment, second resist layer <b>510</b> may be treated with a dye or photoactive compound, rather than the first resist layer, so as to change the optical properties of the second resist layer <b>510</b> such that the combination of first and second resist layers and alignment mark <b>18</b> is configured such that they form a grating that enhances first or higher order diffractions while substantially reducing zero<sup>th </sup>order diffraction and specular reflection when illuminated with the wavelength used for alignment. An advantage of treating second resist layer <b>510</b> with dye as opposed to the first resist layer <b>502</b> is that critical processes such as developing and freezing of the first resist layer <b>502</b> remain unchanged.</p>

Graph <b>800</b> illustrates transmittance percentage for magenta dyed resist, graph <b>802</b> illustrates transmittance percentage for cyan dyed resist and graph <b>804</b> illustrates transmittance percentage for yellow dyed resist.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Conventionally dyes are added to resist layers to reduce scattering effects from underlying pattern edges. In conventional cases, a dye is selected such that when a resist layer is exposed with an actinic wavelength, the dye leaves the chemical properties of the resist unaffected and only impacts the resist transparency at aligning wavelengths. As seen in graph <b>800</b>, at example alignment wavelengths such as 532 nm, percentage transmittance of magenta colored resist is approximately 15%. Graph <b>804</b> illustrates percentage transmittance for yellow dye. In graph <b>802</b>, at an alignment wavelength of 635 nm, the percentage transmittance of cyan colored resist is approximately 10%. Thus, most conventional dyes used to dye resist layers provide low transmittance at alignment wavelengths.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In graph <b>900</b>, at an alignment wavelength of approximately 532 nm, molar extinction coefficient of merocyanine is at its peak. At an alignment wavelength of 780 nm, molar extinction coefficient of thiatricarbocyanine is at its peak. Thus merocyanine dye can be used to dye resists if an alignment wavelength of 532 nm is to be used and thiatricarbocyanine can be used to dye resists if an alignment wavelength of 780 nm is to be used. In an embodiment both dyes may be added to one or both of first resist layer <b>502</b> and second resist layer <b>510</b> so that either alignment wavelength can be used for illumination alignment marks <b>18</b>. As seen in graphs <b>900</b> and graph <b>902</b>, these dyes have a high molar extinction coefficient only near the alignment wavelength. Dyes with properties of being absorbing, fluorescing, or luminescing at alignment wavelengths are not limited to the two examples dyes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. Dyes can be found that support actinic exposure at, for example, 193 nm, 248 nm, 365 nm, 405 nm, and 435 nm while remaining absorbent at alignment system wavelengths. It is to be appreciated by a person of skill in the art that the type of dye can be selected based on the alignment wavelength in use and is not limited to the dyes disclosed herein.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step <b>1002</b>, a first resist layer with a first optical characteristic is deposited on a wafer and patterned to include at least one alignment mark. For example, first resist layer <b>502</b> with a first optical characteristic of being absorbent, fluorescent or luminescent when illuminated with radiation of the pre-determined wavelength <b>13</b> used for alignment while being transparent when illuminated with radiation of an actinic wavelength is deposited and patterned to include at least one alignment mark <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In step <b>1004</b>, the first resist layer is developed and freezed. For example, first resist layer <b>502</b> is developed and frozen using one of ion implantation, DUV exposure or chemical hardening.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In step <b>1006</b>, a second resist layer is deposited on the first resist layer. The second resist layer has a second optical characteristic such that an alignment mark in the first resist layer is absorbent, fluorescent or luminescent when illuminated with radiation of the pre-determined wavelength used for alignment while being transparent when illuminated with radiation of an actinic wavelength through the second resist layer. For example, second resist layer <b>510</b> is deposited on first resist layer <b>502</b>. In an embodiment, the second resist layer <b>510</b> may be dyed along with the first resist layer <b>502</b>. In another embodiment, only the second resist layer <b>510</b> is dyed to render the second optical characteristic. In yet another embodiment, the second resist layer <b>510</b> may be un-dyed and therefore the second optical characteristic of the second resist layer <b>510</b> is the same as that of an un-dyed resist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In step <b>1008</b>, an alignment target in the first resist layer is illuminated with radiation of a pre-determined wavelength.
