<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a branch current monitor and, more particularly, to a system for configuring a branch current monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The total power consumption of a building or other facility is monitored by the electric utility with a power meter located between the utility's distribution transformer and the facility's power distribution panel. However, in many instances it is desirable to sub-meter or attribute the facility's power usage and cost to different occupancies, buildings, departments, or cost centers within the facility or to monitor the power consumption of individual loads or groups of loads, such as motors, lighting, heating units, cooling units, machinery, etc. These single phase or multi-phase electrical loads are typically connected to one or more of the branch circuits that extend from the facility's power distribution panel. While a power meter may be installed at any location between a load and the distribution panel, it is often advantageous to install a power meter capable of monitoring a plurality of circuits proximate the power distribution panel to provide centralized monitoring of the various loads powered from the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flexibility has favored adoption of digital branch current monitors incorporating data processing systems that can monitor a plurality of circuits and determine a number of parameters related to electricity consumption by the individual branch circuits or groups of circuits. A branch current monitor for measuring electricity consumption by respective branch circuits comprises a plurality of voltage and current transducers that are periodically read by the monitor's data processing unit which, in a typical branch current monitor, comprises one or more microprocessors or digital signal processors (DSP). For example, a branch current monitor from Veris Industries, Inc. enables up to ninety circuits to be monitored with a single meter and utilizes the MODBUS&#xae; RTU network communication interface to enable remote monitoring as part of a building or facility management system. The data processing unit periodically reads and stores the outputs of the transducers quantifying the magnitudes of current and voltage samples and, using that data, calculates the current, voltage, power, and other electrical parameters, such as active power, apparent power and reactive power that quantify the distribution and consumption of electricity. The calculated parameters are typically output to a display for immediate viewing or transmitted from the meter's communication interface to another data processing system, such as a building management computer for remote display or further processing, for example formulating instructions to the facility's automated equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The voltage transducers of digital branch current monitors commonly comprise a voltage divider network that is connected to a conductor in which the voltage will be measured. The power distribution panel provides a convenient location for connecting the voltage transducers because typically each phase of the electricity is delivered to the power distribution panel on a separate bus bar and the voltage and phase is the same for all loads attached to the respective bus bar. Interconnection of a voltage transducer and the facility's wiring is facilitated by wiring connections in the power distribution panel, however, the voltage transducer(s) can be connected anywhere in the wiring that connects the supply and a load, including at the load's terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The current transducers of digital power meters typically comprise current transformers that encircle each of the power cables that connect each branch circuit to the bus bar(s) of the distribution panel. Bowman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,937,003 B2, discloses a branch current monitoring system that includes a plurality of current transformers mounted on a common support facilitating installation of a branch current monitor in a power distribution panel. Installation of current transformers in electrical distribution panels is simplified by including a plurality of current transformers on a single supporting strip which can be mounted adjacent to the lines of circuit breakers in the panel. The aforementioned branch current monitor from Veris Industries, Inc. is commonly used to monitor up to four strips of current sensors; each comprising 21 current transformers on a common support. In addition, the branch current monitor provides for eight auxiliary current transformer inputs for sensing the current flow in two 3-phase mains with two neutrals and six voltage connections enabling voltage sensing in six bus bars of two 3-phase mains.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While physical installation of the branch current monitor is simplified by mounting the branch circuit current transformers on common supports, system commissioning can be complicated. After the monitor's hardware is installed in the power distribution panel, the panel's hardware and electrical connections and the desired operating attributes of each circuit must be defined in the monitor's memory so that the monitor's data processing unit can access the various sensors and determine the appropriate use of the data received from the sensors. For example, the current rating, high and low voltage limits and current alarm thresholds must be established for each of the circuits and time delays and hysteresis must be defined for the various alarms. In addition, branch current monitoring requires identification of the various circuits that are conducting single-phase, two-phase or three phase power. Data describing the hardware, circuits and desired operating attributes can be entered in a spreadsheet and mapped to a memory in the branch current monitor but it is easy to make a typographical error or other mistake when entering the data describing several characteristics of ninety circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is desired, therefore, is a simplified system for configuring a branch current monitor.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring in detail to the drawings where similar parts are identified by like reference numerals, and, more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a branch current monitor <b>20</b> arranged to monitor the voltage and current in a plurality of branch circuits comprises, generally, a data processing module <b>22</b>, a current module <b>24</b> and a voltage module <b>26</b>. The data processing module <b>22</b> comprises a data processing unit <b>30</b> which, typically, comprises at least one microprocessor or digital signal processor (DSP). The data processing unit <b>30</b> reads and stores data received periodically from the voltage module and the current module, and uses that data to calculate the current, voltage, power and other electrical parameters that are the meter's output. The resulting electrical parameters may be output to a display <b>32</b> for viewing at the meter or output to a communications interface <b>34</b> for transmission to another data processing system, such as a building management computer, for remote display or use in automating or managing facility functions. The data processing module may also include a memory <b>36</b> in which the programming instructions for the data processing unit and the data manipulated by the data processing unit may be stored. In addition, the branch current monitor typically includes a power supply <b>38</b> to provide power to the data processing unit and to the voltage and current modules.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The voltage module <b>26</b> includes one or more voltage transducers <b>42</b> each typically comprising a resistor network, a voltage sampling unit <b>48</b> to sample the output of the voltage transducers and convert the analog measurements to digital data suitable for use by the data processing unit and a multiplexer <b>44</b> that periodically connects the voltage sampling unit to selected ones of the voltage transducers enabling periodic sampling of the magnitude of the voltage at each of the voltage transducers. Typically, each phase of the electricity supplied to a distribution panel is connected to a bus bar <b>23</b> to which are connected the circuit breakers <b>16</b> that provide a conductive interconnection to each of the respective loads, by way of examples, a single-phase load <b>21</b>A and a three-phase load <b>21</b>B. Since the voltage and phase supplied to all commonly connected loads is the same, a meter for measuring three-phase power typically includes three voltage transducers <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, <b>42</b>C each connected to a respective bus bar <b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C. A clock <b>40</b>, which may be included in the data processing unit, provides periodic timing signals to trigger sampling of the outputs of the voltage transducers by the voltage sampling unit. The voltage module may also include a voltage sensor memory <b>46</b> in which voltage sensor characterization data, including relevant specifications and error correction data for the voltage transducers are stored. If a portion of the voltage module requires replacement, a new voltage module comprising a voltage sensor memory containing sensor characterization data for the transducers of the new module can be connected to the data processing unit. The data processing unit reads the data contained in the voltage sensor memory and applies the sensor characterization data when calculating the voltage from the transducer data output by the replacement voltage module.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The current module <b>24</b> typically comprises a current sampling unit <b>50</b>, a multiplexer <b>52</b> and a plurality of current transducers <b>54</b> communicatively connected to respective sensor positions <b>55</b> of the current module. The multiplexer <b>52</b> sequentially connects the sampling unit to the respective sensor positions enabling the sampling unit to periodically sample the output of each of the current transducers <b>54</b>. The current sampling unit comprises an analog-to-digital converter to convert the analog sample at the output of a current transducer selected by the multiplexer, to a digital signal for acquisition by the data processing unit. The clock <b>40</b> also provides the periodic timing signal that triggers sampling of the current transducer outputs by the current sampling unit. The current module may also include a current sensor memory <b>56</b> in which are stored characterization data for the current transducers comprising the module. The characterization data may include transducer identities; relevant specifications, such as turns ratio; and error correction factors, for examples equations or tables enabling the phase and ratio errors to be related to a current permitting correction for magnetization induced errors. The characterization data may also include the type of transducers, the number of transducers, the arrangement of transducers and the order of the transducers' attachment to the respective sensor positions of the current module. At start up, the data processing unit queries the current sensor memory to obtain characterization data including error correction factors and relevant specifications that are used by the data processing unit in determining the monitor's output.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, monitoring current in a plurality of branch circuits requires a plurality of current transducers, each one encircling one of the branch power cable(s) <b>88</b> that connect the power distribution panel to the load(s) of the respective branch circuit. Current sensing may be performed by an individual current sensor, such as the current transformer <b>54</b>D, which is connected to the current module. On the other hand, a branch current monitor may comprise one or more sensor strips <b>80</b> each comprising a plurality of current sensors attached to a common support, such as sensors <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>54</b>C. The sensors <b>54</b> are preferably current transformers but other types of sensors may be used. Each current transformer comprises a coil of wire wound on the cross-section of a toroidal metallic or non-metallic core. The toroidal core is typically enclosed in a plastic housing that includes an aperture <b>82</b> enabling a power cable <b>88</b> to be extended through the central aperture of the core. The openings <b>82</b> defined by the toroidal cores of the transformers are preferably oriented substantially parallel to each other and oriented substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>90</b> of the support <b>86</b>. To provide a more compact arrangement of sensors, the sensors <b>54</b> may be arranged in substantially parallel rows on the support and the housings of the sensors in adjacent rows may be arranged to partially overlap in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the support. To facilitate routing the power cables of the branch circuits through the cores of the current transformers, the common support maintains the current transformers in a fixed spatial relationship that preferably aligns the apertures of the toroidal coils directly opposite the connections of the power cables <b>88</b> and their respective circuit breakers <b>16</b> when the strip is installed in a distribution panel <b>100</b>. For protection from electrical shock, a transient voltage suppressor <b>94</b> may be connected in parallel across the output terminals of each sensor to limit the voltage build up at the terminals when the terminals are open circuited.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transducer strip <b>80</b> may include the current sensor memory <b>56</b> containing characterization data for the current transformers mounted on the support <b>86</b>. The current sensor memory may also include characterization data for the transducer strip enabling the data processing unit to determine whether a transducer strip is compatible with the remainder of the meter and whether the strip is properly connected to the data processing module. Improper connection or installation of an incompatible transducer strip may cause illumination of signaling lights or a warning message on the meter's display. In addition, the transducer strip <b>80</b> may comprise a current module of the power meter with one or more current transformers <b>54</b>, the multiplexer <b>52</b>, the current sampling unit <b>50</b> and the current sensor memory all mounted on the support <b>86</b>. A connector <b>98</b> provides a terminus for a communication link <b>102</b> connecting the current transducer strip (current module) to the data processing module <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The branch current monitor may also include one or more errant current alarms to signal an operator or data processing system that manages the facility or one or more of its operations of an errant current flow in one of the monitored branch circuits. When a current having a magnitude greater or lesser than a respective alarm current limit is detected in one of the branch circuits an alarm annunciator is activated to notify the operator or another data processing system of the errant current flow. An alarm condition may be announced in one or more ways, including, without limitation, periodic or steady illumination of a light <b>71</b>, sounding of an audible alarm <b>73</b>, display of a message on the meter's display <b>32</b> or transmission of a signal from the communications interface <b>34</b> to a remote computer or operator.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A commercial power distribution panel commonly supplies a substantial number of branch circuits and a branch current monitor for a distribution panel typically includes at least an equal number of current transformers. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an exemplary electrical distribution panel includes two three-phase mains <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B which respectively are connected to main circuit breakers <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B. Each of the phases of each main is connected to a bus bar <b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C. The three bus bars extend behind each of two rows of branch circuit breakers <b>16</b> that respectively conductively connect one of the bus bars to a conductor <b>54</b> that conducts current to the branch circuit's load(s). A single phase load is connected to single bus bar, a two-phase load is typically connected to two adjacent circuit breakers which are connected to respective bus bars and a three-phase load is typically connected to three adjacent circuit breakers which are each connected to one of the three bus bars. Typically, a two-phase load or three phase load is connected to the appropriate number of adjacent circuit breakers in the same row. The exemplary distribution panel has connections for 84 branch circuit conductors which can be monitored by a branch current monitor produced by Veris Industries, Inc. The branch current monitor monitors the current, voltage and energy consumption of each circuit of the distribution panel, including the mains. The accumulated information can be transmitted to a remote consumer through a communications interface or viewed locally on a local display. Data updates occur approximately every two seconds and as a circuit approaches user configured thresholds, alarms are triggered by the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the main acquisition circuit board <b>108</b> of the branch current monitor <b>20</b> is connectable to as many as four current transformer strips or support units <b>80</b>A, <b>80</b>B, <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>D each supporting <b>21</b> current transformers. The transformers of the support units are connectable to the data processing unit of the branch current monitor by communication links <b>102</b> comprising multi-conductor cables. In addition, the branch current monitor includes connections for six auxiliary current transformers <b>114</b> which are typically used to monitor the current in the mains. Since the voltage and phase are common for all loads connected to a bus bar, the branch current monitor also includes six voltage connections <b>116</b>. A data channel <b>120</b> connected to the communications interface enables transmission of data captured by the branch current monitor to other data processing devices that are part of a building management system or other network.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The branch current monitor is installed in the distribution panel by mounting the current transformer strips to the panel adjacent to the rows of circuit breakers and by passing each of the branch circuit conductors <b>88</b> through a central aperture in one of the toroidal current transformers and connecting the conductors to the respective circuit breakers. The main acquisition board <b>108</b> is attached to the electrical panel and the multi-conductor cables <b>102</b> are connected to the board. The mains conductors are passed through the apertures in the auxiliary current transformers and the auxiliary current transformers are connected to the main acquisition board. The voltage taps are connected to respective bus bars and to the main acquisition board. The data channel <b>120</b> is connected and the branch current monitor is ready for configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For the branch current monitor to perform its various functions, the various items of hardware comprising the branch current monitor and the power distribution panel and their interconnections must be described to the data processing unit of the monitor and the applicable alarm limits established by the user. For example, the current rating of each circuit breaker, the high and low alarm limits for each circuit and any time delays or other characteristics applicable to the alarms must be defined. In addition, the source of the voltage, the phase of the power conducted by each of the branch circuits, must be defined. The information can be entered in a spreadsheet which is mapped to the branch current monitor's memory but entering the data for ninety circuits is fraught with opportunity for typographical errors and other mistakes making configuration of the monitor potentially problematic. The inventors concluded that configuring a branch current monitor could be simplified and the chance of errors reduced with a configuration tool including a graphical user interface and a plurality of configuration templates related to relevant elements of the monitor and the monitored circuits. In addition, configuration could be simplified if information stored in branch current monitor by the manufacturer or the configuration of one branch current monitor could be uploaded to the configuration tool for use in configuring another monitor. Moreover, configuration could be simplified if the configuration tool aided in the discovery of the connections in the power distribution system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the branch current monitor configuration tool is typically installed on a computer <b>75</b>, typically, comprising a data processing unit to execute instructions; a memory for storing instructions and data utilized by the data processing unit; one or more input devices, such as a keyboard and a mouse; and a display. The computer <b>75</b> may be part of or in communication with a data processing network <b>77</b>, such as a facility management system, and is communicatively connected to the data processing unit of the branch current monitor through the monitor's communication interface. When the configuration tool is activated, instructions executed by the data processing unit of the computer <b>75</b> cause a series of templates to be displayable by the computer enabling an installer of a branch current monitor to enter various attributes of elements of the monitor and the power distribution system, for example, the circuit breakers, which are represented as objects in the configuration tool. The tool also prompts the installer by suggesting values of certain attributes of the various objects. Through communication with the data processing unit of the branch current monitor, the tool can both read attributes of the monitor, the power distribution system and their objects that are stored in the monitor's memory, enabling the configuration of a monitor to be copied to another monitor, and can store attributes of the various objects input by the installer in the memory of the monitor to configure the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an initial template <b>200</b> of the configuration tool comprises an interface enabling specification of general characteristics of the branch current monitor and its relationship to a larger data processing network, such as a building management system. The data processing unit of the exemplary branch current monitor <b>20</b> can communicate with another data processing network utilizing the MODBUS&#xae; protocol. Each device in a network utilizing the Modbus protocol must have a unique address. By selecting a scan button <b>202</b> on the template, the configuration tool can identify other devices making up a larger system by the product name <b>204</b>, serial number <b>206</b>, location <b>208</b> and Modbus address <b>210</b>. The initial template includes a plurality of user selectable buttons, including configure device button <b>222</b>, which, when selected, displays a tabbed file <b>223</b> to facilitate the specification of various attributes of the branch current monitor. When the general tab <b>225</b> of the initial template is selected, the installer can enter a general description of the branch current monitor that is being configured. Each distribution panel has a location identification <b>212</b> which is used in reporting the operation of the branch current monitor and which can be entered from the template. The template also includes icons <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> representing the four possible arrangements of four current transducer strips that can supported by the monitor enabling the installer to easily select and specify the arrangement of the transducer strips in the particular distribution panel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, selecting the AUX Breaker Size tab <b>234</b> on the initial display <b>200</b> displays a template enabling specification of the auxiliary circuit breaker, typically the mains circuit breaker, current rating <b>300</b>. A typical mains circuit breaker is rated at 225 amps and the configuration tool suggests this size for the mains circuit breakers of the panel. If all the auxiliary circuit breakers have the same current rating the installer can enter the single rating <b>302</b> or if the auxiliary circuit breakers have different ratings, for example if one is not used, each auxiliary circuit breaker's rating can be specified separately <b>304</b>. Clicking a button <b>306</b> saves the selected values to the device. On the other hand, if the ratings of the auxiliary circuit breakers are stored in the branch current monitor, for example, in the current sensor memory <b>56</b>, selecting a button <b>308</b> in the template causes the monitor's data processing system to be queried and to upload the ratings into the configuration tool.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, selecting the Branch Breaker Size tab <b>236</b> on the initial display <b>200</b> produces a template enabling specification of the current ratings of the branch circuit breakers <b>320</b>. If the branch circuit breakers have a common rating, the common rating can be entered <b>322</b> or, if various breakers have different ratings or are not used, the rating can be entered for a specific circuit breaker <b>324</b>. The template suggests a default value for the circuit breaker current rating that is common for branch circuit breakers. If the ratings of the branch circuit breakers are stored in the branch current monitor, for example, in the current sensor memory, the template enables querying the monitor's data processing system to upload the ratings to the configuration tool by selecting a button <b>308</b> on the template.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, selecting the AUX CT Size tab <b>232</b> produces a template enabling the installer to specify the ratings of the auxiliary current transformers <b>342</b> that monitor high amperage current, typically the current in the mains.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, selecting the Current Alarms tab <b>238</b> produces a template enabling the installer to specify the characteristics of the branch current monitor's current alarms <b>350</b> and suggests characteristic values for the alarm thresholds <b>352</b> and alarm timers <b>354</b>. The branch current monitor may have both latching and non-latching alarms. If the current crosses a latching alarm threshold, the alarm is activated and will continue to operate until the alarm is manually reset. If the current crosses an alarm threshold for a non-latching alarm, the alarm is initiated, but the alarm will terminate if the current returns to a non-alarm level. A non-latching alarm hysteresis setting <b>356</b> specifies a difference between the threshold current for alarm activation and the threshold for alarm deactivation; the amount the current must fall below the high alarm threshold or rise above the low alarm threshold to deactivate the alarm. Hysteresis in the alarm prevents repeated initiation and termination of an alarm as a result of minor fluctuations in a current having a nominal value that is near the alarm threshold. A plurality of alarm current limits, for example, a high latching alarm and a high-high latching alarm having a higher alarm threshold, enables a user to determine the seriousness of a current excursion.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition to the alarm thresholds, the installer can specify alarm timers <b>354</b> for each of the latching alarms. The time delay <b>358</b> is the number of seconds that the current in the circuit must be beyond the respective alarm threshold before the alarm is initiated. The latching alarm on time <b>360</b> specifies the time in seconds that the current needs to stay above the low-low alarm threshold before the latching alarms are activated and the latching alarm off time <b>362</b> specifies the number of seconds that the current must be less than the low-low alarm threshold before the latching alarms are deactivated. Typical values are provided for the alarm thresholds and alarm timers as default values. The values of any alarms presently specified in the branch current monitor can be retrieved from the monitor's data processing unit by selecting a button <b>308</b> and the specified alarm characteristics can be saved to the current monitor by selecting another control button <b>364</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, selecting the voltage alarm tab <b>240</b> on the initial display produces a voltage alarm template <b>380</b> enabling the installer to specify the alarm delay <b>382</b> and alarm thresholds <b>384</b> of the branch current monitor's voltage alarms. The alarm timers specify the time intervals that the input voltage must be in an alarm state; i.e. exceeds the over voltage threshold or is less than the under voltage threshold, before the alarm is activated. If the voltage crosses an alarm threshold and then returns to a normal level before the alarm timer interval expires, the alarm timer is reset. The over voltage threshold <b>386</b> and the under voltage threshold <b>388</b> specify the values of the voltage that will activate the respective voltage alarms. The non-latching alarm hysteresis <b>390</b> specifies how much the voltage must fall below the over voltage threshold or rise above the under voltage threshold, as a percentage of the respective alarm threshold voltage, before a voltage alarm will be deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, selecting the Demand tab <b>230</b> produces a template <b>395</b> enabling the user to specify the interval at which the current and power values will be output. The demand is calculated by summing the average of the subinterval current and power samples divided by the number of subintervals in the specified demand interval. The subinterval average is recalculated every second from the RMS values of the power and current.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, selecting the global resets button <b>224</b> on the initial display produces a template enabling a user to reset all of the registers of the monitor's memory that are storing data produced by the monitor <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, selecting the alarm status button <b>326</b> on the initial display enables displaying the status of the current alarms <b>422</b> and the voltage alarms <b>420</b>. The display identifies the transducer channel in which the alarm is activated, the size of the circuit breaker and the type of alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, selecting the data monitoring button <b>228</b> displays a template <b>420</b> that enables input of descriptive names for the various data channels for use during reporting by the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The inventors concluded that the physical location of the circuit breakers, the identity of the bus bar or the phase of the power connected to a circuit breaker and the current in the respective branch circuits would enable the configuration tool to map the connections of the power distribution system. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the configuration tool facilitates mapping the branch circuits of the power distribution panel. For example, while the panel is de-energized a low power source can be connected, respectively, to the ones of the panels' bus bars. A continuity tester can be used to determine which bus bar is connected to each of the panel's circuit breakers and the results are stored in the computer's memory. When the panel is energized and the mapping method <b>500</b> initiated <b>502</b>, the method reads the current for the first circuit breaker <b>504</b> and retrieves the phase (&#x3c6;) of the power, the identity of the bus bar to which the circuit breaker is connected, conducted by the circuit breaker <b>506</b>. If the circuit breaker is the first circuit breaker being queried <b>508</b>, the current and the phase are also read for the circuit breaker of the immediately adjacent branch circuit <b>510</b>. Branch circuits conducting multiphase power are commonly connected to adjacent circuit breakers in the power distribution panel. If the phases of the two branches are the same <b>512</b>, the first branch is designated as conducting single phase power <b>518</b>. If the phases for the two branches are different <b>512</b>, the method determines whether the current in the two branches is approximately equal, that is, the current in the first branch is more than a specified percentage of the current in the second branch <b>514</b> and less than specified percentage of the current in the second branch <b>516</b>. If the currents in the two branches are substantially different, the power conducted by the first branch is designated as single phase power <b>518</b>. If a branch is designated as supplying single-phase power, the method determines if the branch is the last branch of the panel <b>538</b> and, if not, the branch counter is reset <b>539</b> and the method moves to the next branch <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">On the other hand, if the phases for two adjacent circuit breakers (B<sub>N </sub>and B<sub>N+1</sub>) are different and the currents are approximately equal, the power in the two circuits is presumed to either two phase or three phase power. The next branch (B<sub>N+2</sub>) is accessed <b>520</b> and the current <b>522</b> and phase <b>524</b> is determined. If the phase of the third circuit is different than the phase of the first circuit <b>526</b> and the phase of the second circuit <b>530</b>, the currents in the second and third circuits are compared. If the current in the third circuit is not approximately equal to the current in the second circuit, that is, the current in second circuit is less than a specified percentage of the current in the third circuit <b>532</b> or the current in the second circuit is greater than a specified percentage of the current in the second circuit <b>534</b>, the two branches are designated by the method as conducting two-phase power <b>528</b>. However, if the phases of the three circuits are different and the currents in three circuits are approximately the same, the three branches are designated as parts of a three-phase circuit <b>536</b>. If the latest branch accessed by the method is not the last branch monitored by the branch current monitor, the branch counter is reset <b>539</b> and the method proceeds to the next branch <b>510</b>. If the latest branch accessed by the method, is the last monitored branch, the method ends <b>540</b> and the arrangement of branch circuit connections is stored in the monitor's memory.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The configuration tool simplifies the configuration of the branch current monitor by providing templates for entry of monitor characteristics and suggesting values of those characteristics and by automating the mapping the connections of the branch circuits.</p>
