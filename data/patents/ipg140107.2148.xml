<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Dermatoses are common diseases of the skin that take many forms, including seborrheic dermatitis. Dermatoses present with several symptoms, including desquamation, erythema, pruritus, inflammation, lichenification, and scaling. In general, dermatoses alter the stratum corneum structure, in turn compromising barrier function and leading to increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and exposure to environmental irritants. TEWL is indicative of a disturbed barrier function, and has been correlated to pruritus (itch) intensity in patients. Improvement in skin barrier function prevents the penetration of contact allergens and irritants into the epidermal layer, leading to reductions in inflammation, erythema, desquamation, and scaling. Improved skin moisturization reduces the appearance of scaling improving self image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More specifically, seborrheic dermatitis is a common disease of the skin presenting with dry or greasy scaling of the scalp, hairline and nasolabial folds, sometimes accompanied by itching. In more severe cases, yellowish to reddish scaly pimples appear along the hairline, behind the ears, in the ear canal, on the eyebrows, on the bridge of the nose, around the nose, on the chest, and on the upper back.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Topical drug treatments for seborrheic dermatitis include steroids, antifungals, and keratolytics. In addition to drug treatments, seborrheic dermatitis can be managed through the use of drug-free medical devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the invention relates to oil-in-water emulsions. In certain embodiments, the compositions do not contain volatile lower alcohols (e.g., ethanol). In certain embodiments, the compositions comprise an aerosol propellant. In certain embodiments, the aerosol propellant is a hydrofluoroalkane propellant (HFA). In certain embodiments, the compositions produce a foam upon actuation of an aerosol container charged with the composition. In certain embodiments, the foams are stable against collapse. In certain embodiments, the foams are both time- and temperature-stable. In certain embodiments, the foams rub-in quickly without a greasy residue. In certain embodiments, the foam is moisturizing. In certain embodiments, the foam is non-irritating.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain embodiments, the dispensed foam is suitable for the management of seborrheic dermatitis, and exerts its therapeutic effect without the inclusion of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. In certain embodiments, these &#x201c;drug-free&#x201d; compositions are equally or more therapeutically-effective than prescription creams and lotions for the management of the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. In certain embodiments, the dispensed foam has a density between about 0.05 and about 0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, is easily spread over large body surface areas, is time- and temperature-stable, moisturizes the skin, and/or is non-irritating. In certain embodiments, the foam rapidly collapses when subjected to shear forces, allowing for quick and efficient application to large body surface areas. In certain embodiments, skin moisture levels continue to be improved up to eight hours after application of a composition to the skin.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Propellants</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">There are several possible choices of propellants for an aerosol foam, including, but not limited to, CFCs, hydrocarbons, compressed gases, and HFAs. The Montreal Protocol has banned the use of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) due to their ability to deplete the ozone layer. Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, United Nations Environmental Programme, 1987. In contrast, hydrocarbon propellants demonstrate very low reactivity and good resistance to free-radical attack. However, hydrocarbon propellants are highly flammable. Moreover, compressed inert gases, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, can be used as an aerosol propellant. While offering good chemical stability due to their inertness, they are unable to provide consistent product delivery throughout the life of an aerosol can due to their high vapor pressures. Fortunately, HFAs (hydrofluoroalkanes, also known as hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs) are pharmaceutically acceptable, generally non-reactive, and ozone-friendly.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Exemplary Constituents of Emulsions and Compositions of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Exemplary identities of various constituents of the emulsions and compositions of the present invention are described below.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">1. Propellants</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the propellant is a HFA or a mixture of one or more hydrofluoroalkanes. Suitable hydrofluoroalkanes include 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a); 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227); and mixtures and admixtures of these and other HFAs that are currently approved or may become approved for medical use are suitable. Hydrocarbon as well as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants can also be used in the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">2. Vehicles</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Suitable topical vehicles and vehicle components for use with the formulations of the invention are well known in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical arts, and include such vehicles (or vehicle components) as water; organic solvents such as alcohols (particularly lower alcohols readily capable of evaporating from the skin such as ethanol), glycols (such as propylene glycol, pentylene glycol, butylene glycol, and glycerol (glycerin)), aliphatic alcohols (such as lanolin); mixtures of water and organic solvents (such as water and alcohol), and mixtures of organic solvents such as alcohol and glycerol (optionally also with water); lipid-based materials such as fatty acids, acylglycerols (including oils, such as mineral oil, and fats of natural or synthetic origin), phosphoglycerides, sphingolipids and waxes; protein-based materials such as collagen and gelatin; silicone-based materials (both non-volatile and volatile) such as cyclomethicone, dimethiconol and dimethicone copolyol; hydrocarbon-based materials such as petrolatum and squalane; and other vehicles and vehicle components that are suitable for administration to the skin, as well as mixtures of topical vehicle components as identified above or otherwise known to the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the compositions of the present invention are oil-in-water emulsions. Liquids suitable for use in formulating compositions of the present invention include water, and water-miscible solvents such as glycols (e.g., ethylene glycol, butylene glycol, isoprene glycol, propylene glycol, pentylene glycol), glycerol, liquid polyols, dimethyl sulfoxide, and isopropyl alcohol. One or more aqueous vehicles may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, formulations without methanol, ethanol, propanols, or butanols are desirable.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">3. Surfactants and Emulsifiers</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Many topical formulations contain chemical emulsions which use surface active ingredients (emulsifiers) to disperse dissimilar chemicals in a particular solvent system. For example, most lipid-like (oily or fatty) or lipophilic ingredients do not uniformly disperse in aqueous solvents unless they are first combined with emulsifiers, which form microscopic aqueous soluble structures that contain a lipophilic interior and a hydrophilic exterior, resulting in an oil-in-water emulsion. In order to be soluble in aqueous media, a molecule must be polar or charged so as to favorably interact with water molecules, which are also polar. Similarly, to dissolve an aqueous-soluble polar or charged ingredient in a largely lipid or oil-based solvent, an emulsifier is typically used which forms stable structures that contain the hydrophilic components in the interior of the structure while the exterior is lipophilic so that it can dissolve in the lipophilic solvent to form a water-in-oil emulsion. It is well known that such emulsions can be destabilized by the addition of salts or other charged ingredients which can interact with the polar or charged portions of the emulsifier within an emulsion droplet. Emulsion destabilization results in the aqueous and lipophilic ingredients separating into two layers, potentially destroying the commercial value of a topical product.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Surfactants suitable for use in the present invention may be ionic or non-ionic. These include, but are not limited to: polysorbates (e.g., Polysorbate 20 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate), Polysorbate 40 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monopalmitate), Polysorbate 60 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monostearate), Polysorbate 80 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate)), steareth-10 (or other octadecyl polyoxyethylene ethers), sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium lauryl sulfate), lauryl dimethyl amine oxide, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyethoxylated alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitan, octoxynol, N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HTAB), polyoxyl 10 lauryl ether, bile salts (such as sodium deoxycholate or sodium cholate), polyoxyl castor oil, nonylphenol ethoxylate, cyclodextrins, lecithin, dimethicone copolyol, lauramide diethanolamine (lauramide DEA), cocamide DEA, cocamide monoethanolamine (coamide MEA), oleyl betaine, cocamidopropyl betaine, cocamidopropyl phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, dicetyl phosphate (dihexadecyl phosphate), ceteareth-10 phosphate, and methylbenzethonium chloride.

<heading id="h-0032" level="1">Skin Moisturization</heading>
<p id="p-0157" num="0445">The measurement of the moisture content of the outermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum) by corneometry is a well established technique widely used in the development of cosmetic, pharmaceutical and medical device products. Corneometry is based on capacitance measurement of a dielectric medium. Any change in the dielectric constant due to variation in skin surface hydration alters the capacitance of a precision measuring capacitor. One of the greatest advantages of the capacitance measurement method, compared to other measurement methods, is the fact that products applied to the skin only have minimal influence on the measurements. Due to the sensitivity of the method, the measurement can detect small changes in hydration level. The materials used in the study were as follows:
