<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method for document management in an industry where mass volumes of drawings are exchanged and worked upon is facilitated and streamlined. The system has a server in communication with a plurality of remote workstations. Each of the workstations includes a display and interface. The system standardizes the documents, and is operable to display the same document in each of the workstations. Thus, revisions by an authorized person may be made and seen by the other workstations. The system and method disclosed herein also ensures that drawings are delivered to the appropriate personnel as only authorized users may access the system, and eliminates the potential use of outdated drawings in planning as each drawing is automatically time and date stamped and placed in sequential order.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/089,572 filed Aug. 18, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to system and method for document management and in particular to a system and method for document management having a plurality of work stations in communication with each other so as to allow for simultaneous collaboration in the design of a part.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Document management has become an extremely valuable tool for saving resources. Specifically, document management reduces the amount of money spent on paper and the amount of time spent organizing, updating, and sorting. Document management becomes even more important in industries where the production of documents is high because proper document management can bring down costs, save time, and save resources.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The automotive industry, building construction industry, and the like are typical examples of high document production industries in need of efficient document management. In the automotive industry a supplier often works side by side with the automobile manufacturer to ensure that the supplies and the parts provided comply with the remaining specifications of the manufactured vehicle. For instance, the supplier providing the parts for a fender works closely with the automobile manufacturer to assure that the fender is in compliance with adjoining parts such as the side panels or the front hood. Other associated parts may be provided by a different supplier thus making the collaborative process time consuming as representatives from different suppliers must know the specifications of adjoining parts to ensure that the part provided fits. In most instances, the parts are represented to the manufacturer by use of a diagram or drawing showing the dimensions of the parts and the interrelation between the proposed parts and remaining vehicle body. Thus, one part change can have an effect on various other vehicle parts and requires other suppliers to make changes to their part. These changes can also come due to the manufacturer's need or desire to make aesthetic changes or structural changes to support weight and load compliance to meet either federal regulations or the manufacturer's own standards. Thus, it is not uncommon that a part may be represented hundreds of times in various different drawings due to different changes that the manufacturer desires to make. This process can be exhaustive and wasteful, where hundreds of paper drawings are reviewed, produced, and then later discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The flow of documents in such a process can also hinder industry production, especially when drawings for a manufactured part need to be delivered to a specific site so as to provide the workers with the necessary drawings to complete a project. Delivering such documents can be a very costly procedure as the documents tend to be drawn on large pieces of paper and there tends to be hundreds of documents showing various perspectives of the same part. In certain instances, the delivery cost is paid at a premium, such as when the documents need to be delivered overnight in order to meet production demands or to maintain a production schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, as natural resources begin to dwindle and as the collective conscious of global warming and environmental stewardship begins to take hold in society, it is preferable to provide a system whereby the reduction of document production can occur without hindering the collaborative design process between a supplier and a manufacturer. Accordingly, a system and method is hereby provided that can manage the production of documents while at the same time facilitate the collaborative process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, a designer prints the drawings and retrieves the drawings from the printer and then releases said drawings to the vendor. The designer then takes the drawings to the project manager and if the vendor is offsite will have to deliver the drawings to the offsite vendor location. The prints are then obtained offsite, and the offsite vendor will begin to identify and categorize the drawing by first placing a time date stamp on the drawing to make certain that the drawing's status within the process is identified. This process allows revisions to the drawing to be known and therefore helps ensure that manufacturers and suppliers do not rely upon outdated drawings when manufacturing a part. Usually these drawings require additional copies to be made and distributed to the various personnel associated with a design team. These drawings are then worked on by the various individuals and then brought together once more for a final review. One master copy of the drawing is then made to reflect the various changes. As easily seen, the current document management method and system creates potential for error, especially when a final document does not incorporate all of the designs made by various design personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The delivery of drawings in high drawing production industries such as the automotive industry may include numerous steps. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a prior art method of drawing delivery in the automotive industry is shown. In the prior art, the automotive industry uses sixteen steps for drawing delivery. These steps were necessary to ensure the security of the drawings, track the drawings so as to verify the status of the drawing, disseminate the drawings to authorized personnel, and ensure that only authorized personnel made the changes. Accordingly, as shown in the prior art of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, many checks were implemented and as a result the steps became numerous and encumbered the collaborative process. Furthermore, in many instances a part drawing is worked upon by different people in different locations, thus the part drawing needed to be provided to the different people and therefore the process consumed a lot of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the drawings may be formatted in any one of a number of different applications. For instance, the drawings may be provided in CAD, CATIA, jpg, or the like. Thus, in order to view all of the drawings, the necessary viewing application is needed. This may be quite expensive as the cost of licensing such applications may be high. Furthermore, depending on the computer, loading all of the necessary applications may burden and slow the processing speed of the computers. Thus, it remains desirable to have a system that may view drawings in any format and allow users to make changes to those drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>10</b> for document management having a database <b>12</b> in communication with a server <b>14</b> is provided. Preferably, the server <b>14</b> is web-based and in communication with a plurality of off-site or otherwise remote computer processing units. The server <b>14</b> executes a software application <b>16</b> to create a website to perform document management. Preferably, each of the computer processing units is housed in a workstation <b>18</b>. The workstation <b>18</b> includes a visual display <b>20</b> and an interface <b>22</b> allowing offsite users to access various documents and to collaborate with other users in remote locations so as to make real time changes to the drawings. The website contains many features directed towards facilitating the management of documents, including real time and simultaneous editing of documents, automatic time and date stamp of documents, and storing and categorization of documents.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the database <b>12</b> is organized in a hierarchical structure <b>24</b>. The hierarchical structure <b>24</b> has a plurality of sub-databases <b>26</b>. Each sub-database <b>26</b> stores a predetermined group of documents so as to organize the documents by a category of information. Each of the sub-databases <b>26</b> may be labeled with a predetermined label. For instance, one sub-database <b>26</b> may be related to a particular type of document, while yet another of the predetermined group of documents may be related to the originator of the document. Another category of sub-databases <b>26</b> may be related to various offsite locations. Yet another category of sub-databases <b>26</b> may be related to the identification of personnel and further yet, another sub-database <b>26</b> may be related to the various access levels provided for each identified personnel or for each of the said offsite locations. The entry (information or documents) within each of the sub-databases <b>26</b> may be further divided and sorted into subcategories. Each entry is tagged with a value, so as to allow the server <b>14</b> to search for a particular document using known techniques such as data mining.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The system <b>10</b> further includes a document viewing processor <b>28</b>. The document viewing processor <b>28</b> is in communication with the server <b>14</b> and display <b>20</b>. The document viewing processor <b>28</b> is operable to process the documents so as to display <b>20</b> the document on the display <b>20</b>. For instance, the document viewing processor <b>28</b> may convert a drawing in a format such as CAD or CATIA into a tiff format so as to allow users with CAD or CATIA software to view the drawings. The server <b>14</b> automatically actuates the document viewing processor <b>28</b> when any one of the documents is selected by the user. The document viewing processor <b>28</b> is further operable to format each of the documents so as to convert the document to fit onto a predetermined sheet. For instance, the document viewing processor <b>28</b> may convert a drawing completed on an 8.5&#x2033;&#xd7;11&#x2033; page to an 11&#x2033;&#xd7;17&#x2033; page.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The database <b>12</b> is accessible by and in communication with the server <b>14</b>. The server <b>14</b> executes a software program, whereby a web-based application <b>16</b> is provided. The web-based application <b>16</b> is interactive and in communication with each of the workstations <b>18</b>. The web-based application <b>16</b> actuates a document organizing processor <b>30</b> operable to organize the inputted documents and stored documents. For example, the document organizing processor <b>30</b> may store and organize the documents every time after a document is amended by authorized personnel located at any one of the workstations <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The document organizing processor <b>30</b> is in communication with the database <b>12</b>. Each document may contain metadata to facilitate the retrieval and search of documents. Additionally, the document organizing processor <b>30</b> may process the database <b>12</b> so as to organize the documents by title. For example, documents may be categorized by projects, and each project may be supported by numerous documents. Each project may be associated with a sub-database <b>26</b> of the hierarchical structure <b>24</b>. Preferably, the documents are listed sequentially by the earliest revision date so as to provide the user with visual reference of which of the documents contain the most current revisions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The system <b>10</b> includes a collaborative facilitating processor <b>32</b> and an authorization processor <b>34</b>. The collaborative facilitating processor <b>32</b> is also in communication with the interface <b>22</b>, display <b>20</b>, and the server <b>14</b>. The collaborative facilitating processor <b>32</b> is operable to receive input from each of the workstations <b>18</b> so as to display <b>20</b> a change made on one workstation <b>18</b> to each of the other workstations <b>18</b> in real time. In one embodiment, the authorization processor <b>34</b> is automatically actuated once changes are made, and the user closes the revised document.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The authorization processor <b>34</b> processes the database <b>12</b> so as to determine who is authorized to make revisions to the document. The authorization processor <b>34</b> requests the identification of the person making the revisions and processes the database <b>12</b> to determine if the person is authorized to make changes. The authorization processor <b>34</b> may further request a password. Upon receiving the identification of an authorized person and the password, the revised changes are stored in the database <b>12</b>. More particularly, the document organizing processor <b>30</b> stores the document in the appropriate sub-database <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The system <b>10</b> may further include a date stamping processor <b>36</b>. The date stamping processor <b>36</b> is actuated when the document is being closed. The date stamping processor <b>36</b> is in communication with the authorization processor <b>34</b>. As the document is being closed, and before being processed by the document organizing processor <b>30</b>, the date stamping processor <b>36</b> identifies the date and time the revision was made, and who made the revision. The document organizing processor <b>30</b> is further operable to store the documents according to the latest revision, or the person who made the revision.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The system <b>10</b> may further include a notification processor <b>38</b>. The notification processor <b>38</b> is in communication with the database <b>12</b>, and is operable to process the database <b>12</b> so as to detect any revisions made to any one of the plurality of documents. The notification processor <b>38</b> is also in communication with authorization processor <b>34</b> so as to all personnel authorized to make changes to a particular drawing that a change has been made.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As stated above, the web-based system <b>10</b> may be displayed on an offsite computer processing unit/workstation <b>18</b>. The workstation <b>18</b> includes an interface <b>22</b>, such as a mouse, keyboard, touch screen or the like. The interface <b>22</b> is operable to allow each authorized user to collaborate in the design process. The web-based application <b>16</b> includes a messaging application <b>16</b> whereby authorized users can communicate to each other while simultaneously viewing the same document in real time, similar to current instant messaging programs. Thus, every designer or engineer involved in the design of a particular part is able to discuss and identify the aspects of the drawing that are of concern and understand the specific revisions that were made to each drawing and why those revisions were made to each drawing in real time. Any messaging application <b>16</b> currently known and used in the art is adaptable for use herein, illustratively including video conferencing, digital voice communications, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus the system <b>10</b> is very helpful for collaboration as it allows the manufacturer to understand what the design process entailed and gives the manufacturer a better understanding of the considerations that were given to effect a certain change. For instance, if a part is not in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications, the manufacturer is able to look through the sequentially ordered drawings stored in the database <b>12</b> to determine how and why the vendor made certain changes. Thus the manufacturer is given a basis for which to approve of or reject the change. Furthermore, the system <b>10</b> eliminates the need for vendors and manufacturers to deliver paper documents in support of each revised drawing. Furthermore, paper documents are standardized to ensure that the views of the drawings as seen on the workstations <b>18</b> are consistent with each offsite location.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>d</i>, a preferred embodiment of the system <b>10</b> is provided. In the preferred embodiment, the system <b>10</b> is configured for documents having design drawings, referred to herein simply as &#x201c;drawings.&#x201d; The drawings support various projects, such as a fender or front grille for an automotive vehicle. Each of the projects may contain subparts, and each of the subparts may be further contained in a corresponding sub-database <b>26</b>. The hierarchical structure <b>24</b> allows the system <b>10</b> to identify common parts or sub-parts and store the common subparts in corresponding sub-databases <b>26</b>. Thus, a bracket which may be used for both a fender and a front grille may be found in each of the corresponding sub-databases <b>26</b> relating to the fender and front grille.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">These drawings may be further subdivided into parts related to the project and then placed in order, such as sequentially by parts, so as to represent the most current updated drawing. Other entries such as the project leader or the site location of the project members may be stored so as to facilitate the project collaboration between different users.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The interface <b>22</b> is operable to selectively choose a drawing. In instances where multiple workstations <b>18</b> are collaborating to make design changes to a particular part, the part may be displayed at each of the workstations <b>18</b>. Upon selection of the drawing, the document viewing processor <b>28</b> converts the drawing into the same standard format so that the display <b>20</b> of each workstation <b>18</b> displays <b>20</b> the same drawing. Preferably, the drawings are all converted to a &#x201c;tiff&#x201d; file and reconfigured to fit onto an 11&#x2033;&#xd7;17&#x2033; page.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The collaborative facilitating processor <b>32</b> is in communication with the server <b>14</b> and each of the workstations <b>18</b>. More specifically, the collaborative facilitating processor <b>32</b> is in communication with each interface <b>22</b> and display <b>20</b>. The collaborative facilitating processor <b>32</b> receives input from each interface <b>22</b> so as to display <b>20</b> a change made on one workstation <b>18</b> to each of the other workstations <b>18</b> in real time. When the users at each of the workstations <b>18</b> agree to the revisions, the user closes the revised document and the authorization processor <b>34</b> is automatically actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The authorization processor <b>34</b> processes the database <b>12</b> so as to determine who is authorized to make revisions to the document. The authorization processor <b>34</b> requests the identification of the person making the revisions. The authorization processor <b>34</b> may further request a password. Upon receiving the identification of an authorized person and the password, the revised changes are stored in the database <b>12</b>. More particularly, the document organizing processor <b>30</b> stores the document in the appropriate sub-database <b>26</b>. The date stamping processor <b>36</b> identifies the date and time the revision was made and who made the revisions. The document organizing processor <b>30</b> may then store the documents according to the latest revisions or the person who made the revisions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, a user may access the web-based system <b>10</b> and determine for each various part drawings of a particular project which of the part drawings represents the original drawings, which of the part drawings is the most current revised drawing, who is responsible for a particular amendment, and the personnel authorized to make an amendment. Through the sequential ordering of the drawing, a user is able to determine the design process and understand the reasons why certain changes were made. Thus, the proposed system <b>10</b> helps eliminate the possibility of the wrong drawing being relied upon when making a change to a part and facilitates the collaborative work process by providing pertinent information to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The web-based system <b>10</b> also includes a searching processor <b>40</b> operable to search the database <b>12</b> for a desired part or drawing. The searching processor <b>40</b> may be in communication with the authorization processor <b>34</b>, whereby only authorized users can search the database <b>12</b> for specific parts, personnel, and the like. The web-based system <b>10</b>'s searching processor <b>40</b> may utilize tags <b>42</b> associated with each drawing. The tags <b>42</b> provide information relating the corresponding drawing. For instance the tag <b>42</b> may indicate who the originator of the drawing is, thereby ensuring that only the originator or authorized personnel can make changes to the parts. This makes certain that personnel having access to the drawings do not make errant marks or changes which have not been approved by appropriate personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The system <b>10</b> may further include a drawing specification database <b>12</b> containing the specifications for each drawing part. The authorization processor <b>34</b> is further operable to process the specification database <b>12</b> so as to ensure that each revision made to a particular part does not violate the specifications for the part. Additionally, the authorization processor <b>34</b> is operable to process the other parts to ensure that the revisions, though made within specification of the revised part, do not cause the project to fall outside of the project specification.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an illustration of a workstation <b>18</b> is provided. Preferably, the workstation <b>18</b> is mobile. Thus the workstation <b>18</b> is in communication with the server <b>14</b> wirelessly, thereby allowing the workstation <b>18</b> to move within the offsite location to better support the collaborative process. For instance, if the workstation <b>18</b> is disposed within a manufacturing plant and there is a particular part or drawing which requires referencing, the workstation <b>18</b> can be moved to that particular part and the design team will be able to look at the actual physical part and the drawings when making a recommendation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The remote workstation <b>18</b> includes a base <b>18</b><i>a </i>having a plurality of rollers <b>18</b><i>b </i>so as to facilitate the movement of the workstation <b>18</b> to different areas of the workstation <b>18</b> site. The workstation <b>18</b> includes a processor <b>30</b>, an interface <b>22</b>, and a display <b>20</b>. The processor <b>30</b> may be powered by a mobile battery pack, or may be plugged into a standard electrical plug. The interface <b>22</b> includes a keyboard and a mouse, operable to communicate changes in drawings to the server <b>14</b>. The remote workstation <b>18</b> may be rolled to different areas of the design location, where comparison between the drawings and the actual part may be made. Thus, mobile feature of the workstation <b>18</b> facilitates the collaboration of the design process.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a method <b>44</b> of managing drawings utilizing a web-based system <b>10</b> is provided. The method <b>44</b> delivers drawings in electronic form from any location within a predefined network. The method <b>44</b> comprises the steps of: creating the drawing; standardizing the drawing forms; uploading the standardized drawings into a database <b>12</b>; sorting each drawing and storing the drawings into predetermined sub-databases <b>26</b>; providing a server <b>14</b> that executes a software application <b>16</b>, wherein the software application <b>16</b> further organizes and sorts the drawings into various categories within each sub-database <b>26</b>; identifying all the users and providing authorized users with an access; identifying all the remote sites; supplying the drawings to authorized users; and providing a display <b>20</b> at each of the workstations <b>18</b>, wherein the display <b>20</b> is operable to display <b>20</b> a selected drawing so as to allow users to collectively view the same drawing from remote offsite locations. The method <b>44</b> also includes the step of restricting communication and collaboration on a particular drawing to only authorized users, wherein the authorized users may communicate in real time with each other while viewing the same drawing. The method <b>44</b> also includes the step of tagging each drawing to ensure that the date and time of creation or revision is documented.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus provided is a system <b>10</b> and method <b>44</b> whereby drawing management in an industry where mass volumes of drawings are exchanged and worked upon is facilitated and streamlined. Specifically, the need to reproduce in a hard copy a drawing to support the collaborative process and refinement of a part is eliminated. Furthermore, the system <b>10</b> and method <b>44</b> delivers drawings by electronic means and therefore expedites the work flow as the need for delivering hard (paper) copies is eliminated. Furthermore, the document management system <b>10</b> enables the delivery of drawings from any location that has a workstation <b>18</b> equipped to communicate with the server <b>14</b>. The system <b>10</b> and method <b>44</b> disclosed herein also ensures that drawings are delivered to the appropriate personnel as only authorized users may access the system <b>10</b>. The system <b>10</b> and method <b>44</b> disclosed herein also eliminates the potential use of outdated drawings in planning as each drawing is automatically time and date stamped and placed in sequential order.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described while within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
