<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to the field of power saws, and particularly to power miter saws that have a fence.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A power miter saw is a cutting tool used to make crosscuts in a work piece, such as a piece of wood. Miter saws typically include a base equipped with a turntable and fence. The turntable is rotatable in relation to the base and has an upper surface that supports a work piece during cutting operations. The fence extends over the turntable to provide an abutment surface for locating an edge of the work piece at a predetermined position on the base.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The saw assembly of the miter saw includes a bevel arm, a cutting arm, and a cutting assembly. The bevel arm is pivotably attached to the turntable for pivotal movement about a bevel axis. The cutting arm is in turn pivotably attached to the bevel arm for pivotal movement toward and away from the turntable. The cutting arm supports the cutting assembly, comprising a circular saw blade and a motor, above the turntable. During cutting operations, the cutting arm is pivoted downwardly to bring the saw blade into contact with a work piece positioned on the turntable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Miter saws have a cut capacity that defines the maximum sizes and dimensions of work pieces that a miter saw is capable of cutting through. The cut capacity includes a vertical component, also referred to as the cut height capacity, and a horizontal component, also referred to as the cut width capacity. The cut height and cut width capacity of a miter saw depend on a number of factors, such as the size of the saw blade, the depth that the blade is able to plunge below the upper surface of the turntable, the pivot location of the support arm with respect to the abutment surface of the fence, and the size of the motor, gearbox, and blade arbor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cut height capacity of a miter saw may have to be adjusted to accommodate taller work piece sizes. One method used to increase the cut height capacity of a miter saw is to attach a sacrificial fence to the front of the fence. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> depict the cut width and cut height capacity of a miter saw before and after attaching a sacrificial fence to the miter saw fence. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the miter saw has a cut width capacity of 190 mm, and a cut height capacity of 88 mm. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the sacrificial fence has a thickness on the front of the fence of approximately 20 mm that results in an increase in cut height capacity to 102 mm and a decrease in cut width capacity to 150 mm. The use of the sacrificial fence allows the miter saw to have a cut capacity capable of cutting a 100 mm&#xd7;100 mm cross section beam.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While effective in increasing cut height capacity, the use of sacrificial fences requires that time be spent selecting and/or fabricating a fence with a desired width and suitable shape for attachment to the miter saw fence. Time must also be spent in the installation and removal of the sacrificial fence. Because sacrificial fences are often made with scrap materials, sacrificial fences are often discarded after use requiring that another sacrificial fence be selected and/or fabricated to increase the cut height capacity of the miter saw for another job.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is a method or device that enables the cut height capacity of a miter saw to be increased without requiring the fabrication and installation of a separate sacrificial fence or spacer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A miter saw includes a base, a turntable rotatable in relation to the base and including a work piece support surface, a support assembly attached to the turntable, and a saw assembly attached to the support assembly and configured to cut a work piece supported on the turntable. A fence assembly includes an elongate fence body that extends along a first axis. The elongate fence body is supported by the base and positioned over the turntable. The fence body has a first connecting structure, and a fence insert defining an elongate work piece abutment surface and having a second connecting structure. The fence assembly is positionable in a first configuration and a second configuration. In the first configuration, the second connecting structure cooperates with the first connecting structure to secure the fence insert at a first position in relation to the fence body. When the fence assembly is positioned in the second configuration, the second connecting structure cooperates with the first connecting structure to secure the fence insert at a second position in relation to the fence body. A second axis intersects the first axis in a perpendicular manner. When the fence insert is secured at the first position, the elongate work piece abutment surface is positioned to intersect the second axis at a first point. When the fence insert is secured at the second position, the elongate work piece abutment surface is positioned to intersect the second axis at a second point, and the first point is offset from the second point along said second axis.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and described in the following written specification. It is understood that no limitation to the scope of the invention is thereby intended. It is further understood that the present invention includes any alterations and modifications to the illustrated embodiments and includes further applications of the principles of the invention as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of a miter saw <b>10</b> including an adjustable fence assembly <b>12</b> is depicted. As explained below, the adjustable miter fence <b>12</b> includes an elongate body <b>54</b>,<b>56</b> having an insert component <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>. The insert component <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> includes a work piece abutment surface <b>60</b>. The insert component <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> is positionable in a first position and a second position with respect to the elongate body <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. In the first position, the abutment surface <b>60</b> is arranged at the normal or default position in relation to the base <b>14</b>. In the second position, the abutment surface <b>60</b> is offset a predetermined distance in front of the elongate body <b>52</b>. The offset position of the abutment surface <b>60</b> increases the cut width capacity of the miter saw <b>10</b> and causes a corresponding increase in the cut height capacity of the miter saw <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition to the adjustable fence assembly <b>12</b>, the miter saw <b>10</b> includes a base <b>14</b>, a turntable <b>16</b>, and a saw assembly <b>18</b>. The base <b>14</b> is designed to sit in a stationary position on a solid surface or support structure. The base <b>14</b> is generally comprised of a hard metal material, such as aluminum, and provides a structure that supports the remaining components of the miter saw <b>10</b>. The turntable <b>16</b> is rotatably supported on the base <b>14</b>. The turntable <b>16</b> has a generally planar upper surface <b>20</b> that defines a slot <b>22</b>. The planar upper surface <b>20</b> serves as a horizontal support surface for supporting a workpiece, such as wood or lumber. The slot <b>22</b> provides clearance for the saw blade <b>24</b> to extend below the horizontal support surface <b>20</b> during cuts so that a particular cut width capacity is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The saw assembly <b>18</b> of the miter saw <b>10</b> includes a bevel arm <b>26</b>, a cutting arm <b>28</b>, and a cutting assembly <b>30</b>. The bevel arm <b>28</b> is pivotably attached to the turntable <b>14</b> for pivotal movement about a bevel axis <b>32</b>. The bevel arm <b>30</b> is pivotable about the bevel axis <b>32</b> between a vertical orientation (90&#xb0;), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to an angle of 45&#xb0; or more left of vertical (not shown). This pivoting allows the blade <b>24</b> to approach the turntable <b>16</b> from a bevel angle to perform angled cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cutting arm <b>28</b> is pivotably attached to the bevel arm <b>26</b> for pivotal movement about an axis <b>34</b> toward and away from the turntable <b>14</b>. The cutting arm <b>28</b> supports the cutting assembly <b>30</b> above the turntable <b>14</b>. The cutting assembly <b>28</b> includes a motor <b>42</b>, a circular saw blade <b>24</b>, a handle <b>44</b>, a switch <b>46</b>, and a blade guard <b>48</b>. The motor <b>42</b> that is operable to rotate the circular saw blade <b>24</b>. The handle <b>44</b> is connected to the bevel arm <b>30</b> to facilitate movement of the cutting head <b>28</b> in relation to the turntable <b>16</b>. The handle <b>44</b> is designed and dimensioned to be grasped by a human hand when performing a cutting operation. This allows the user to easily pivot the cutting head <b>28</b> about axis <b>34</b>. The switch <b>46</b> is positioned on the handle <b>44</b> to allow the user to easily energize and de-energize the motor <b>42</b> during a cutting operation. The blade guard <b>48</b> covers the top portion of the circular saw blade <b>24</b>. During cutting operations, the cutting arm <b>28</b> is pivoted downwardly to bring the saw blade <b>24</b> into contact with a work piece positioned on the turntable <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the adjustable fence assembly <b>12</b> the elongate fence body includes a left lateral body portion <b>54</b> and a right lateral body portion <b>56</b> that define a first gap <b>62</b> therebetween. A part of the elongate work piece abutment surface <b>60</b> is positioned on each side of the gap <b>62</b>. The fence insert includes a left lateral insert portion <b>66</b> and a right lateral insert portion <b>68</b> that define a second gap <b>64</b> therebetween. The first gap <b>62</b> and the second gap <b>64</b> are aligned with each other and with the slot <b>22</b> defined in the turntable <b>16</b>. The gaps <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> provide clearance for the saw blade <b>24</b> to pass therethrough and toward the slot <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each fence body portion <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> extends along an axis A defined on the turntable support surface <b>20</b>. Each fence body portion <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> is positioned at least partially over the turntable <b>16</b> and is attached to the base <b>14</b> at each side of the turntable. Each fence insert portion <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> is removably secured to a body portion <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and includes a part of the elongate work piece abutment surface <b>60</b> that is arranged substantially perpendicular to the turntable support surface <b>20</b>. When a work piece is positioned on the support surface <b>20</b> of the turntable, an edge of the work piece is held against the elongate work piece abutment surface <b>60</b> to facilitate accurate cuts at desired angles with respect to the fence assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with the present disclosure, the fence assembly <b>12</b> is positionable in a first configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a second configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) based on the position of the fence insert portions <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> in relation to the fence body portions <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. The fence body portions <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and the fence insert portions <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> include complementarily configured connecting structures <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that cooperate to removably secure the fence insert <b>66</b> to the fence body <b>54</b> in at least a first position and a second position with respect to each other. In the first position, the abutment surface <b>60</b> of the insert portions <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and the abutment surface <b>76</b> of the body portions <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are aligned at the normal or default position for the fence assembly <b>12</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the second position, the abutment surface <b>60</b> of the insert portions <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> is offset a distance F from the abutment surface <b>76</b> of the body portions <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. Offsetting the abutment surface <b>60</b> from the fence body causes the cut height capacity to be increased. The offset distance F selected is dependent upon the configuration and dimensions of the miter saw <b>10</b> and the desired increase in cut height capacity. In one embodiment, the offset distance F is approximately 20 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fence insert <b>66</b> includes a connecting structure <b>72</b> that comprises a pair of vertically oriented channel structures arranged at each lateral end of the fence insert. The fence body <b>54</b> defines an insert opening <b>75</b> for receiving the fence insert <b>66</b>. The connecting structure <b>70</b> of the fence body <b>54</b> comprises a vertically oriented rail positioned at each lateral end (only visible at one end) of the insert opening <b>75</b>. The rail <b>74</b> is configured to be received in a respective one of the channel structures <b>72</b> defined in the fence insert.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pair of channel structures <b>72</b> includes a first channel structure <b>72</b>A and a second channel structure <b>72</b>B. The first channel structure <b>72</b>A corresponds to the first position of the fence insert <b>66</b> relative to the fence body <b>52</b>, and the second channel structure <b>72</b>B corresponds to the second position of the fence insert <b>66</b> relative to the fence body <b>52</b>. The vertical orientation of the channel structures <b>72</b> and rails <b>70</b> enables the fence inserts <b>66</b> to be switched between the first and second positions by sliding the inserts <b>66</b> upwardly until the rails <b>70</b> and channel structures <b>72</b> are disengaged. The inserts may then be reinserted into the fence bodies by aligning the channel structures and rails and sliding the inserts downwardly until the rails are received in the corresponding channel structures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a retaining mechanism <b>91</b> is utilized to secure the insert <b>66</b> to the fence body <b>54</b>. Any suitable type of retaining mechanism may be used. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the retaining mechanism <b>91</b> comprises a fastener or screw. The fastener <b>91</b> and the channel structures cooperate to secure the insert <b>66</b> to the fence body <b>54</b> once the insert has been seated in the fence body <b>54</b>. In one embodiment, head of the fastener defines a cut out section. When the head of the fastener <b>91</b> is turned to a first predetermined angle or orientation with respect to the fence body <b>52</b>, the cut out section is positioned to provide clearance for the channel structures <b>72</b>A, <b>72</b>B of the insert <b>66</b> to slide along the rail <b>70</b>. Once the insert <b>66</b> is seated in the fence body, the head of the fastener <b>91</b> is rotated to a second position to secure the insert <b>66</b> to the fence body <b>54</b>. In one embodiment, the channel structures <b>72</b>A, <b>72</b>B define cut-outs <b>93</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that interlock with the head of the fastener <b>91</b> when the fastener is turned to the second position to secure the insert <b>66</b> to the fence body <b>54</b>. In an alternative embodiment, a spring loaded detent may be utilized in a similar manner to secure the insert <b>66</b> to the fence body <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the fence insert <b>66</b> is in the first position as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rails <b>70</b> is received in the first channel structures <b>72</b>A at each end of the fence insert. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fence body <b>54</b> has a front surface <b>76</b> that defines a portion of the work piece abutment surface of the fence assembly <b>12</b>. The front surface <b>76</b> of the fence body <b>54</b> lies in a plane C, and the front surface <b>60</b> of the fence insert <b>66</b> lies in a plane D. With the fence insert <b>66</b> and fence body <b>54</b> in the first position with respect to each other, the plane C is coplanar with the plane D and perpendicular to the plane E defined by the turntable support surface <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When in the second position, the work piece abutment surface <b>60</b> of the fence insert <b>66</b> lies in a plane D that is parallel to and offset the distance F from the plane C. The fence insert <b>66</b> is offset from the fence body <b>54</b> along an axis B that intersects the axis A in a perpendicular manner, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When the fence insert <b>66</b> is in the first position relative to the fence body <b>52</b>, the work piece abutment surface <b>60</b> of the fence insert <b>66</b> and the abutment surface <b>76</b> of the fence body <b>54</b> are each positioned to intersect the axis B at a first point <b>57</b> along the axis B. When in the second position, the abutment surface <b>60</b> of the fence insert intersects the axis B at a second point <b>59</b> along the axis B that is offset from the first point <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the fence inserts <b>66</b> may be configured so that the lower edge <b>78</b> of the work piece abutment surface <b>60</b> is lowered when the insert is moved from the first position to the second position. The inserts <b>66</b> define channel structures <b>72</b>A, <b>72</b>B at the lateral ends of the inserts <b>66</b> that are used to removably secure the inserts to the fence bodies <b>52</b>. In one embodiment, the channel structures <b>72</b>A, <b>72</b>B are provided with varying lengths to enable the lower edge <b>78</b> of the work piece abutment surface <b>60</b> to be lowered when the insert <b>66</b> is moved to the second position. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the channel structure <b>72</b>A is positioned a distance G from the lower edge <b>78</b>, and the channel structure <b>72</b>B is positioned a distance H from the lower edge <b>78</b>. When the insert is positioned in the second position (channel structure <b>72</b>B), the lower edge <b>78</b> is moved closer to the turntable surface <b>20</b>. When the insert <b>66</b> is moved forward, the lower edge <b>78</b> is moved closer to the support surface <b>20</b> to limit the ability of a work piece to pass under the lower edge <b>78</b> during cutting operations.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, positioning a fence insert <b>66</b> in front of the miter saw fence poses the risk of the fence insert <b>66</b> being placed in the path of the saw blade <b>24</b> when the saw assembly is fully mitered to the left or right. To prevent the fence insert <b>66</b> from being placed in the path of the saw blade when the saw is mitered, the end portions of the inserts <b>66</b> are made shorter than the length of the fence bodies so that when the fence inserts are in the forward position, i.e., the second position, the inner lateral extent of the inserts does not intersect the path of the blade. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the left lateral end portion <b>54</b> includes a body end portion <b>84</b> that is positioned contiguous with the first gap <b>62</b>, and the left lateral insert portion <b>66</b> includes an insert end portion <b>86</b> positioned contiguous with the second gap <b>64</b>. The body end portion <b>84</b> is located a first distance <b>88</b> from the axis B, and the insert end portion <b>86</b> is located a second distance <b>90</b> from the axis B with the distance <b>88</b> being greater than the distance <b>90</b>. Thus, when the insert <b>66</b> is in the forward position, the body end portion <b>84</b> and the insert end portion <b>86</b> are each approximately the same distance from the gaps <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> when the saw is in the fully mitered left position as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The distances <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> selected to space the insert end portion <b>86</b> from the gap <b>64</b> depends on the dimensions and configuration of the miter saw <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the distances <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> are selected such that the difference between the first <b>88</b> and second distance <b>90</b> is between approximately 20.0 mm and 30.0 mm. In one particular embodiment, the difference between the first and second distances equals approximately 25.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned above, the bevel arm <b>26</b> of the saw assembly enables the saw blade to be tilted with respect to turntable <b>16</b> to enable bevel cuts to be performed. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bevel arm <b>26</b> enables the saw blade to be tilted from vertical to approximately 45&#xb0; left of vertical. In alternative embodiments, the bevel arm <b>26</b> may be configured to allow the blade to be tilted to approximately 45&#xb0; right of vertical as well. When the saw blade is tilted to perform bevel cuts, a portion of the fence may be located in the path of the blade <b>24</b>. To enable cuts to be performed with the saw tilted to the left (or right) of vertical, the fence assembly <b>12</b> is configured as a sliding fence. As a sliding fence, the upper portion of the fence on the left side of the turntable is configured to slide radially outwardly from the center of the turntable to provide clearance for the saw blade when it is beveled to the left. The upper portion of the fence to the right of the turntable may also be configured to slide radially outwardly if the saw assembly is capable of being beveled to the right.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to enable the slide functionality for the fence <b>12</b>, the left lateral body portion <b>54</b> of the fence includes a base attachment portion <b>100</b> and a sliding portion <b>102</b>. The base attachment portion <b>100</b> is fixed to the base <b>14</b> of the miter saw <b>10</b>, and the sliding portion <b>102</b> is slidably connected to the base attachment portion <b>100</b>. The sliding portion <b>102</b> of the fence body <b>54</b> includes the connecting structure <b>70</b> and opening <b>75</b> for the insert <b>66</b> so that the insert <b>66</b> is slidable with the sliding portion of the fence body <b>54</b>. The sliding portion is supported by the base attachment portion <b>100</b> in a manner that enables the sliding portion <b>102</b> to slide with respect to the base attachment portion <b>100</b> along axis A between a default position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a lateral position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the default position, the fence <b>12</b> provides full height support to perform cuts with the saw blade oriented vertically. In the lateral position, the upper portion of the fence is moved out of the way of the saw blade to allow bevel cuts to be performed. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sliding portion and the base attachment portion are slidably connected using a tongue and groove type connection <b>104</b> although any suitable type of connection or connecting structure may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment of the fence assembly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the insert portion of the fence is adjustable between the normal position and the forward position by sliding the insert portion upwardly to remove the insert from the fence body and sliding the insert downward to install the insert to the fence body. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> depict an embodiment of a fence assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032; in which the insert portion <b>68</b> of the fence is movable between the normal position and the forward position by sliding the insert generally horizontally with respect to the fence body <b>56</b>. Although only the right lateral body portion <b>56</b> of the fence assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032; is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the discussion below is applicable to the left lateral portion of the fence assembly as well.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the insert <b>68</b> includes a pair of beam-like structures <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> that protrude from the rear side <b>110</b> of the insert component <b>68</b> (i.e., the side opposite the abutment surface <b>60</b>). Each beam defines a longitudinal slot <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> that extends therethrough. The fence body <b>56</b> includes beam support surfaces <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> that support the beams <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and allow movement of the beams along the axis B relative to the fence body <b>56</b>. The support surfaces <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> each define a bore <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) for receiving a fastener, such as a screw or knob, (not shown). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the insert <b>68</b> is positioned on the fence body <b>56</b>, the longitudinal slots <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> are aligned with the bores <b>120</b>. A fastener is passed through each slot <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and into the bores <b>120</b> to secure the insert <b>68</b> to the fence body <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The longitudinal dimension of the slots <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> is arranged generally perpendicular to the abutment surface <b>60</b> of the fence to enable the insert to be slid in the forward and rearward directions along axis B with respect to the fence body <b>56</b>. The positions of the ends of the slots <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> in relation to the positions of the bores/fasteners <b>120</b> define the forward and rearward limits of movement for the insert. In the rearward position, the abutment surface <b>60</b> of the insert <b>68</b> is aligned with the front surface <b>76</b> of the fence body as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The insert <b>68</b> may be secured at any position between and including the forward and rearward positions by tightening and loosening the fasteners in the slots.</p>
