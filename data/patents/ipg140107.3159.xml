<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to memory devices, and more particularly to variable impedance structures in memory devices for storing data values.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> shows a conventional conductive bridging random access memory (CBRAM) type element <b>2100</b> having a bottom cathode (i.e., inert electrode) <b>2199</b>, an ion conducting layer (solid electrolyte) <b>2197</b>, and a top anode (i.e., active electrode) <b>2195</b>. Conventional element <b>2100</b> can be programmed between different resistance states by application of a potential between the electrodes (<b>2199</b> and <b>2195</b>). Application of a programming potential can cause metal atoms to ionize and ion conduct within ion conducting layer <b>2197</b> to form conductive regions, e.g., a &#x201c;filament&#x201d; <b>2193</b>. The presence or absence of such a filament <b>2193</b> can determine a data value stored by the memory element <b>2100</b>. Anode <b>2195</b> can be a source of a metal that can ion conduct within ion conducting layer <b>2197</b>. In the conventional CBRAM type element <b>2100</b>, ion conducting layer <b>2197</b> has a large contact area with the anode <b>2195</b> and the cathode <b>2199</b>, being in contact with a bottom surface of the anode <b>2195</b> and a top surface of the cathode <b>2199</b>. In addition, a filament <b>2193</b> remains unconstrained in a direction transverse to filament creation. That is, a filament <b>2193</b> can generally grow in the vertical direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, and be relatively unconstrained in a horizontal direction (as well as in a direction directed into cross sectional view shown).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A drawback to some conventional CBRAM type elements can be a tendency for a filament to agglomerate back into an electrode and/or within ion conducting layer <b>2197</b> in a fashion detrimental to a conductive path between the electrodes (<b>2199</b> and <b>2195</b>). A representation of undesirable agglomeration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> shows element <b>2100</b> after the passage of time and/or after temperature cycles. Agglomeration of atoms of the filament <b>2193</b>&#x2032; can result in an undesirable change in resistance of element <b>2100</b> from a low resistance to a higher resistance. This can present limits to data retention and/or thermal stability of the memory element <b>2100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another drawback to some conventional CBRAM type elements can be insufficient thermal stability. In particular, if subject to sufficiently high temperatures, or sufficient durations at elevated temperatures, the anode <b>2195</b> can agglomerate in an amount large enough to create an electrical short between the electrodes (e.g., <b>2199</b> and <b>2195</b>) through the ion conducting layer (e.g., <b>2197</b>). A representation of undesirable agglomeration of the anode <b>2195</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>. Grain <b>2196</b> of agglomerated anode <b>2195</b>&#x2032; can contact electrode <b>2199</b>. Such a contact can be detrimental to the ability of a memory element <b>2100</b> to be programmed to a high-resistance state. This can present limitations on the ability of a memory cell <b>2100</b> to store data based on changes in impedance.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A memory layer <b>106</b> can extend in a lateral direction (shown by an x-axis) on first insulating layer <b>108</b>.

In the embodiment shown, first and second electrodes (<b>102</b> and <b>104</b>) can be laterally offset from one another by a separation distance (L). In a particular embodiment, a distance L can be less than a minimum width (W) of an opening (<b>112</b> or <b>114</b>) containing the first or second electrodes (<b>102</b> or <b>104</b>).

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a ratio between a memory layer thickness (t) and a separation distance (L) can be greater than 1:2, preferably greater than 1:3, even more preferably greater than 1:4. In some embodiments, such a ratio can be greater than 1:20.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A memory element <b>100</b> can store data based on, at least in part, the impedance of the memory layer <b>106</b> between the two electrodes (<b>102</b> and <b>104</b>). In a particular embodiment, an impedance of memory layer <b>106</b> varies according to the presence (or absence) of a conductive filament created by ions (or atoms reduced from ions) that can ion conduct between the electrodes (<b>102</b> and <b>104</b>) in response to one or more electric fields.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, a second electrode <b>104</b> can be an &#x201c;active&#x201d; electrode (e.g., an anode) that can be a source of atoms that can ionize and ion conduct through memory layer <b>106</b>. In other embodiments, a first electrode <b>102</b> can be an anode. It is noted that in such an embodiment, in sharp contrast to the conventional CBRAM type memory cell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>, a memory layer <b>106</b> has a relatively small contact area with anode <b>104</b>. Further, such a contact area can be dictated by a thickness of the memory layer <b>106</b>, and not a lithographic limit (i.e., a minimum feature size attainable by etching).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Such a reduced contact area structure can add to cell reliability and reduce defects. In particular, such a structure may not be susceptible to agglomeration affects arising from exposure to heat that lead to a shorting path (conductive path through an ion conducting layer), such as the agglomeration of the anode discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>. In particular, for such a shorting path to form, metal ions or atoms from one or both electrodes would have to migrate and form a thin conductive layer between the first insulating layer <b>108</b> and second insulating layer <b>110</b> (i.e., the ions would essentially &#x201c;un-agglomerate&#x201d;). Such tendency to migrate into a thin layer may be counter to a natural tendency for one or both electrodes to agglomerate in the manner described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, such a reduced contact area can provide greater control the number of, and the manner in which, ions are injected into the memory layer <b>106</b>, and hence provide greater control in how a filament is formed and/or dissolved. In addition, by having a memory layer <b>106</b> contact a side surface of anode <b>104</b>, contact with a top surface of the electrode can be avoided. In some conventional devices, a top surface of an electrode can have irregular surface features, leading to different programming characteristics, including variations in field flux (among different elements) during programming.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In very particular embodiments, a memory layer <b>106</b> can include a chalcogenide, metal oxide, and/or metal oxyhydride that can enable metal ions to ion conduct and form conductive structures (e.g., filaments). An ion conductible metal can include silver and/or copper, as but two of many possible examples. A memory layer <b>106</b> can have one or more ion conductible metals incorporated into the layer. In particular embodiments, a memory layer <b>106</b> can have a thickness of less than 100 &#x212b;, preferably less than 50 &#x212b;, even more preferably less than about 10 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a memory layer <b>106</b>, a filament can grow on, or immediately adjacent to, a surface of dielectric layer <b>108</b> (and/or dielectric layer <b>110</b>), which is not an ion conducting material. It is believed filaments on such surfaces can agglomerate, or dissolve, at a slower rate than filaments in a conventional element, like that of FIGS. <b>21</b>A/B, in which a filament can be substantially surrounded by an ion conducting material. Accordingly, filaments formed on non-ion conducting surfaces, as disclosed herein and in equivalent structures, can more robust and less susceptible to agglomeration, leading to greater data retention and/or thermal stability than a conventional approach. We refer to a layer that provides a surface with such an influence on filament stability as a &#x201c;filament stabilization layer&#x201d; (FSL).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a memory element <b>200</b> according to another embodiment is shown in a side cross sectional view. Memory element <b>200</b> shows an arrangement like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, but with a memory layer <b>206</b> being oriented in a vertical, rather than a lateral direction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in some embodiments a first or second electrode (<b>202</b> or <b>204</b>) can fill its corresponding insulating layer opening (<b>212</b> or <b>214</b>).

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a memory element <b>500</b> according to another embodiment is shown in a side cross sectional view. A memory element <b>500</b> can include a first electrode <b>502</b>, a second electrode <b>504</b>, a memory layer <b>506</b>, and a filament stabilization layer (FSL) <b>516</b>. A first electrode <b>502</b> can be formed in an opening <b>512</b> in a first insulating layer <b>508</b>. An FSL <b>516</b> can be formed over first insulating layer <b>508</b>, and can have an FSL opening <b>522</b> that exposes a first electrode <b>502</b>. A second electrode <b>504</b> can be formed on FSL <b>516</b> in a manner that exposes the FSL <b>516</b> in a region between the two electrodes (<b>502</b> and <b>504</b>). A memory layer <b>506</b> can form a contiguous layer from second electrode <b>504</b> over FSL <b>516</b> to first electrode <b>502</b>. A memory layer <b>506</b> can include any of the materials described herein, or equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An FSL <b>516</b> can provide a surface upon which a conductive filament can be formed when an electric field is formed between first and second electrodes (<b>502</b> and <b>504</b>). An FSL can be a layer over (or through) which a conductive filament can be forced to grow. An FSL can be formed from a material across which a conductive ion does not diffuse quickly. In particular embodiments that include silver and/or copper as a conducting ion, an FSL <b>516</b> can include any suitable insulating material, including but not limited to: an insulating nitride, oxide, oxynitride, or oxyhydride, including silicon nitride, silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon oxyhydride.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Optionally, a memory element <b>500</b> can include a third electrode <b>520</b> for further controlling an electric field generated during programming operations. During a programming operation (e.g., an operation that alters an impedance of memory layer), first, second and third electrodes (<b>502</b>, <b>504</b> and <b>520</b>) can each be biased to predetermined voltages separately, to arrive at a desired electric field between first and second electrodes (<b>502</b> and <b>504</b>) over FSL <b>516</b>. Inclusion of a third electrode <b>520</b> can enable an electric field to be &#x201c;focused&#x201d; to provide an optimal field for a desired filament growth pattern and/or growth rate. Inclusion of a third electrode <b>520</b> can also enable an electric field to have a component that is substantially perpendicular to the electric field components produced by a voltage difference between a first electrode <b>502</b> and a second electrode <b>504</b>. This can cause ions in a memory layer <b>506</b> to ion conduct in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction in which they would ion conduct due to the application of a voltage difference between a first electrode <b>502</b> and a second electrode <b>504</b> alone. Such perpendicular ion conduction may aid in a programming operation, and in one very embodiment may aid in the programming operation which causes the impedance of the memory layer <b>506</b> to increase.</p>
