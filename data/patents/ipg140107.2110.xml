<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A channel control mechanism for a microchip has a laminated structure formed of members including elastic members, and includes: a sample reservoir for packing a sample therein; a reaction reservoir in which mixture and reaction of the sample are performed; and a channel formed in a middle layer of the laminated structure, for bringing the sample reservoir and the reaction reservoir into communication with each other. The channel control mechanism performs the reaction and analysis in such a manner that the sample is delivered into the reaction reservoir through the channel. A shutter channel (pressurizing channel) is provided in a layer different from a layer in which the channel is formed so that the pressurizing channel partially overlaps the channel. The channel is closed through applying a pressurized medium to the shutter channel (pressurizing channel), and the channel is opened through releasing a pressure of the pressurized medium.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, for a chip which includes a packing vessel and a micro channel on one chip, and is referred to as a microchip, a lab-on-chip, a microreactor, a fluidic chip, or a chemical reaction cartridge, there have been studied various delivering mechanisms and methods for controlling and delivering a sample or a liquid sample to allow the sample or the liquid sample to react, to thereby perform analysis of micro components such as gene. As technologies relating to the mechanisms and methods, there are disclosed, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2003-212152 (Patent Document 1), Japanese Patent No. 3746207 (Patent Document 2), Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2005-308200 (Patent Document 3), and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2007-101200 (Patent Document 4).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to Patent Document 1, in &#x201c;a substrate which is formed of an elastic body and includes a micro channel in an inside thereof&#x201d;, the following structure is adopted as delivering means. Specifically, &#x201c;the micro channel is pressed through applying a mechanical pressure onto the substrate by a gear-shaped roller. Then, through rotating the roller while applying the pressure thereon, a periodic pressure is applied onto the substrate, and thus a fluid is moved.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to Patent Document 2, in &#x201c;a sheet-type microreactor&#x201d;, the following structure is adopted as delivering means. Specifically, &#x201c;rotary drive means performs rotation for applying a centrifugal force to a specimen, and moving means moves the centrifugally separated specimen from the second gap part to the third gap part.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to Patent Document 3, in &#x201c;a fluidic chip in which a part of an upper portion of a micro channel is formed of an elastic member&#x201d;, the following structure is adopted as deliver opening/closing means. Specifically, &#x201c;a micro-valve mechanism includes a pressure control port erected on the elastic member on the fluidic chip, and opens/closes a valve by applying/releasing a pressure via the pressure control port.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to Patent Document 4, in &#x201c;a chemical reaction cartridge&#x201d; having a laminated structure including an elastic member, the following structure is adopted as delivering means or opening/closing means. Specifically, &#x201c;the chemical reaction cartridge causes deformation to occur upon application of an external force, and transfers or seals substances contained therein.&#x201d;</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the conventional technology regarding delivering disclosed in Patent Document 1, when delivering a sample into a reaction reservoir serving as a sample-delivered side through the channel from a sample reservoir provided on the chip to serves as a sample-delivering side, delivering is performed while crushing the channel by the gear-shaped roller. Thus, the sample remains in the channel, and it is impossible to completely deliver the sample remaining in the channel just before the reaction reservoir serving as the delivered side. In addition, in the reaction reservoir as the delivered side, steps of sequentially delivering, mixing, and disposing of a plurality of samples are generally performed. Thus, the sample previously delivered is not completely disposed of from the channel or the reaction reservoir so that a micro amount of the sample remains, which may adversely affect the sample to be delivered in the subsequent step.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, complex control means is required to control and drive the gear-shaped roller, and a function of the delivering means depends on a press-contact force of the roller itself pressing the chip. Thus, in the case where a plurality of opening/closing mechanisms are required, a large number of rollers are required, and the sample reservoir and the reaction reservoir serving as a packing side and a packed side are restricted in position. In addition, there is a problem in that the mechanism structure is increased in size, complicated, and high-priced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, it is impossible to completely discharge and control the sample remaining in the channel just before the sample reservoir and the reaction reservoir serving as the packing side and the packed side and being continuous with the channel, and hence a micro amount of the sample remains and is mixed with the sample to be used in the subsequent step. As a result, there is a problem in that contamination occurs and adversely affects reliability of analysis results.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, in the conventional technology regarding delivering disclosed in Patent Document 2, the following structure is adopted. Specifically, the microreactor itself including a plurality of channels and a plurality of gaps for a sample is mounted to a centrifugal separator, and the sample packed in the gap by a centrifugal force is delivered into another gap through the channels. With this structure, the centrifugal separator is needed as the delivering means, and hence the device structure is complicated, increased in size, and high-priced. Further, only a structure including a single channel and a single gap can be formed in a delivering direction, in other words, there is a problem in that it is impossible to deliver the sample into the plurality of gaps stepwise.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, in the conventional technology regarding opening/closing of the channel disclosed in Patent Document 3, a pressing body is brought into press-contact with the channel provided inside the chip from an upper surface of the fluidic chip formed of the elastic member, to thereby close the channel. Further, the channel is opened along with releasing the pressure. However, in the case of sequentially delivering a plurality of samples, it is impossible to remove the sample remaining in the channel other than a valve portion. As a result, there is a problem in that the remaining sample adversely affects the sample to be delivered in the subsequent step and affects reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in the conventional technology regarding delivering disclosed in Patent Document 4, a roller-like pressing body is brought into press-contact with the channel provided inside the chip from an upper surface of the cartridge formed of the elastic member, and the roller is moved while crushing the channel, to thereby deliver the samples remaining in the vessel and the channel. However, in the case of delivering the samples into the reaction reservoir serving as the sample-delivered side through the channel from the sample reservoir provided on the chip to serves as the sample-delivering side, when the roller completely crushes the channel, it is impossible to completely discharge the samples remaining in the channels just before the sample reservoir and the reaction reservoir due to capillary phenomenon caused by surface tension of the sample. As a result, there are problems in that the sample remains in the channel, and that it is impossible to completely deliver the sample remaining in the channel just before the reaction reservoir serving as the delivered side.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, in the reaction reservoir as the delivered side, steps of delivering, mixing, and disposing of a plurality of samples are generally performed. Accordingly, when the sample previously delivered is not completely disposed of, there is a problem in that the sample to be delivered later is adversely affected. Still further, in the case where a plurality of opening/closing mechanisms are required, a large number of rollers are required, and the sample reservoir and the reaction reservoir serving as the packing side and the packed side are restricted in position. In addition, there is a problem in that the mechanism structure is increased in size, complicated, and high-priced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This invention has been made in view of the problems of the above-mentioned conventional technologies, and therefore it is an object of this invention to provide a channel control mechanism which uses a simple mechanism, and in which, in order to prevent mutual contamination during delivering, no sample remains even just before a delivered-side vessel and no sample remains in the channel during discharge of liquid.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means to Solve the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to this invention, a channel control mechanism for a microchip having a laminated structure formed of members including elastic members, includes: a sample reservoir for packing a sample therein; a reaction reservoir in which mixture and reaction of the sample are performed; and a channel formed in a middle layer of the laminated structure, for bringing the sample reservoir and the reaction reservoir into communication with each other, the channel control mechanism performing the reaction and analysis in such a manner that the sample is delivered into the reaction reservoir through the channel, in which: a pressurizing channel is provided in a layer different from a layer in which the channel is formed so that the pressurizing channel partially overlaps the channel; the channel is closed through applying a pressurized medium to the pressurizing channel; and the channel is opened through releasing a pressure of the pressurized medium.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, according to this invention, there is provided a channel control mechanism for a microchip for performing reaction and analysis of a sample, the microchip including: a first member which has a laminated structure formed of members including stretchable members, and includes: a sample reservoir for packing the sample therein; a reaction reservoir in which mixture and the reaction of the sample are performed; and a channel formed in a middle layer of the laminated structure, for bringing the sample reservoir and the reaction reservoir into communication with each other, the first member performing the reaction and the analysis in such a manner that the sample is delivered into the reaction reservoir through the channel; and a second member which has a laminated structure formed of members including stretchable members, and includes a pressurizing channel, in which: the pressurizing channel partially overlaps the channel when the first member and the second member are superimposed on each other; the channel is closed through applying a pressurized medium to the pressurizing channel; and the channel is opened through releasing a pressure of the pressurized medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to this invention, there is structured a closing mechanism in which the pressurizing channel crushes the channel from a layer near the channel formed in the elastic members, and hence it is possible to reliably block the channel.</p>

Further, the channel <b>72</b><i>g </i>continuous with the extraction reservoir <b>52</b><i>e </i>is closed in the previous step, and hence the sample <b>100</b><i>c </i>packed in the extraction reservoir <b>52</b><i>e </i>is sealed. In addition, as described in each step, the sample <b>100</b><i>c </i>which is packed in the extraction reservoir <b>52</b><i>e </i>and contains the dissolved and desired micro components does not include the samples <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>adversely affecting analysis.

Thus, there is obtained a structure in which the samples are less likely to remain in the intersecting portion C. In other words, a shutter function can be exerted just before the point where the channels intersect. As a result, it is possible to prevent the samples from remaining in a vicinity of the intersecting portion C, and cleaning efficiency of the samples to be delivered is remarkably increased.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, the common region C with a circular shape is described in the above-mentioned embodiment.

Further, through increasing the number of channels continuous with the shutter port owing to an increase of layers for channels continuous with the shutter port, etc., it is possible to squeeze all of the sample remaining in the channel through which the sample passes.</p>

In other words, unlike the above-mentioned embodiment, the channel <b>272</b> is sandwiched between the shutter channels <b>283</b><i>b </i>and <b>283</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With the above-mentioned structure, when the pressurized medium is applied to the shutter ports <b>263</b><i>b </i>and <b>263</b><i>c </i>simultaneously, the shutter channels <b>283</b><i>b </i>and <b>283</b><i>c </i>compress the channel <b>272</b> from the upper layer and the lower layer. Thus, in comparison with the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a function of closing the channels and a function of squeezing are remarkably improved. That is, in the microchip having a laminated structure formed of elastic members, it is not always necessary that one shutter channel corresponds to one channel serving as an object to be controlled. Also in the case where a plurality of shutter channels correspond to one channel, the same or higher function is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, another embodiment according to this invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref> are sectional views of a microchip <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The microchip <b>350</b> has a laminated structure including a main plate <b>351</b><i>a</i>, a second plate <b>351</b><i>b</i>, a third plate <b>351</b><i>c</i>, and a fourth plate <b>351</b><i>d </i>which are each formed of an elastic member. A channel <b>372</b> has a micro linear shape, and is constituted by a channel portion in a non-bonded state between the third plate <b>351</b><i>c </i>and the fourth plate <b>351</b><i>d</i>. Further, a shutter channel <b>383</b> has a micro linear shape, and is constituted by a channel portion in a non-bonded state between the second plate <b>351</b><i>b </i>and the third plate <b>351</b><i>c</i>. For convenience of description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrate the channels as if each of the channels has a volume. However, the actual volume is next to zero. Further, in a table <b>303</b> on which the microchip <b>350</b> is mounted, a dented portion <b>303</b><i>a </i>with a recessed shape is provided at a position corresponding to an intersecting portion of the channel <b>372</b> and the shutter channel <b>383</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, an operation of the dented portion <b>303</b><i>a </i>is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. Under the device structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, when the pressurized medium is applied to the shutter channel <b>383</b>, the shutter channel <b>383</b> deforms the main plate <b>351</b><i>a</i>, the second plate <b>351</b><i>b</i>, the third plate <b>351</b><i>c</i>, and the fourth plate <b>351</b><i>d </i>which are each formed of the elastic member. At this time, the third plate <b>351</b><i>c </i>and the fourth plate <b>351</b><i>d </i>are deformed downward together with the channel <b>372</b> formed between the third plate <b>351</b><i>c </i>and the fourth plate <b>351</b><i>d</i>, and are swelled in a protruding manner toward the inside of the dented portion <b>303</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the channel <b>372</b> is brought into press-contact with a periphery of the dented portion <b>303</b><i>a</i>, and is closed firmly. That is, with provision of the dented portion in the table <b>303</b>, a function of closing the channel is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The case of providing the dented portion <b>303</b><i>a </i>is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>. However, the same effect is provided also in the case of providing a hole portion in the microchip or laminating a separate microchip provided with a hole portion. That is, no limitation is imposed on the shape.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, another embodiment according to this invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a plan view illustrating a part of a microchip <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the same manner as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), sample reservoirs <b>452</b><i>a</i>, <b>452</b><i>b</i>, and <b>452</b><i>c </i>on the microchip <b>450</b> are packed with the samples <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and <b>100</b><i>c</i>, respectively, and upper portions of the sample reservoirs are covered with a film <b>491</b>. Further, in the same manner as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d </i>is in the form of a balloon. Moreover, channels <b>472</b><i>a </i>and <b>472</b><i>b </i>are continuous with the sample reservoirs <b>452</b><i>a </i>and <b>452</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and one end of each of the channels <b>472</b><i>a </i>and <b>472</b><i>b </i>is continuous with the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d </i>through an intersecting portion N. Further, one end of a channel <b>472</b><i>c </i>is continuous with the sample reservoir <b>452</b><i>c</i>, and the other end thereof is continuous directly with the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, shutter ports <b>463</b><i>a</i>, <b>463</b><i>b</i>, and <b>463</b><i>c </i>having the same structures as those of the shutter ports <b>63</b><i>a</i>, <b>63</b><i>b</i>, and <b>63</b><i>c </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref> are provided in the microchip <b>450</b>. Shutter channels <b>483</b><i>a</i>, <b>483</b><i>b</i>, and <b>483</b><i>c </i>are continuous with the shutter ports <b>463</b><i>a</i>, <b>463</b><i>b</i>, and <b>463</b><i>c</i>, respectively. In the same manner as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one end of each of the shutter channels <b>483</b><i>a</i>, <b>483</b><i>b</i>, and <b>483</b><i>c </i>is provided while extending below the channels <b>472</b><i>a</i>, <b>472</b><i>b</i>, and <b>472</b><i>c</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">With the above-mentioned structure, similarly to the microchip <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the samples <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and <b>100</b><i>c </i>packed in the sample reservoirs <b>452</b><i>a</i>, <b>452</b><i>b</i>, and <b>452</b><i>c </i>are sequentially delivered into the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d </i>in the same manner as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this case, the channel <b>472</b><i>c </i>and a channel group including the channels <b>472</b><i>a </i>and <b>472</b><i>b </i>are independently continuous with the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d</i>, and hence the sample <b>100</b><i>a </i>adversely affecting analysis of the sample <b>100</b><i>c </i>does not contaminate the channel <b>472</b><i>c </i>for the sample <b>100</b><i>c</i>. Moreover, for the sample <b>100</b><i>c </i>to be injected into the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d</i>, the inside of the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d </i>is cleaned by the sample <b>100</b><i>b </i>which is delivered after the sample <b>100</b><i>a </i>and has a cleaning function. In other words, the sample <b>100</b><i>c </i>and the sample <b>100</b><i>a </i>are not mixed with each other before being introduced into the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d</i>, and thus no mutual contamination occurs. In addition, at least one of the sample reservoirs <b>452</b><i>a</i>, <b>452</b><i>b</i>, and <b>452</b><i>c </i>is packed with a sample for stabilizing the channels at an initial stage, and the sample is delivered at the initial stage or a desired step to separate the non-bonded portions of the channels of the microchip, to thereby enable to achieve stabilization.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, at least one of the sample reservoirs <b>452</b><i>a</i>, <b>452</b><i>b</i>, and <b>452</b><i>c </i>is packed with a sample which stabilizes the channels and does not adversely affect another samples, and the sample is delivered at the initial stage or the desired step to be packed into the points just before the sample reservoirs and the reaction reservoir of the microchip and narrow portions between the channels owing to capillary phenomenon. In this way, the samples to be used in respective steps are prevented from entering the narrow portions of the microchip, and hence it is possible to prevent mixture of the samples before introduction into the reaction reservoir <b>452</b><i>d</i>, and to eliminate the mutual contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As a result, mixture of the samples causing the mutual contamination is prevented, and accuracy in analyzing the micro components is increased. In each of the above-mentioned embodiments, the case where the number of the sample reservoirs is three is described. However, channels for samples, in which the mutual contamination occurs, are independently provided, and thus the same effect is provided also in the case where the number of the sample reservoirs is plural. That is, the number of the sample reservoirs is not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As described above, in the channel control mechanism for a microchip according to each of the embodiments of this invention, a channel opening/closing mechanism has the following structure. Specifically, the channel opening/closing mechanism partially intersects a sample channel which is formed in the microchip to be sealed by the elastic members, and a pressurizing channel is provided to a layer different from a layer provided with the channel. When the pressurized medium is applied to the pressurizing channel, the pressurizing channel is brought into press-contact with the channel at the intersecting portion, to thereby close the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Under this structure, the pressurizing channel serves as a closing mechanism for pressing the channel from the layer near the channel formed and sealed in the elastic members. Thus, it is possible to reliably block the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Further, the delivering channels, which are continuous with the reaction reservoir as a delivered side and through which samples are sequentially and concentratedly delivered from a plurality of sample reservoirs as a delivering side, are constituted by channels independent for each sample group which adversely affects analysis when being mixed with another sample group. The delivering channels have a channel structure of preventing, during sequent deliver, contamination caused by the sample remaining in the channel and bringing adverse effect and of avoiding the adverse effect on analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Under this structure, through separating the inflow channels through which the samples adversely affecting each other are delivered into the reaction reservoir, the samples are not delivered through overlapping channels, and hence reliability of analysis is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, as a mechanism for squeezing the sample remaining in the channel, the following mechanism is adopted. Specifically, in the mechanism, the pressurizing channel and the channel, which are provided to different layers, overlap each other at an overlapping portion in a length direction of the channel through a film of the elastic member. When the pressurized medium is applied to the pressurizing channel, the pressurizing channel closes the channel, and sequentially squeezes the sample remaining in the channel along with forward swelling of the overlapping portion.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Under this structure, the channel and the pressurizing channel formed and sealed in the elastic members overlap each other at the overlapping portion in the length direction of the channel, and exert the function of squeezing the sample in the channel. As a result, the sample remaining in the channel is delivered into the delivered side and the sample reservoirs as the delivering side, and hence the sample does not remain in the channel. Thus, it is possible to prevent contamination caused by the sample to be delivered through the same channel in a next step, to thereby increase reliability of analysis. In addition, the sample remaining in the channel can be used after being squeezed, and hence it is possible to save an expensive sample, that is, to reduce analysis cost.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, at the intersecting portion of the plurality of channels, one end of the pressurizing channel for closing/opening each of the channels is protruded in the intersecting portion. Thus, when another channel is opened in the intersecting portion and the sample is delivered therein, the sample is prevented from contaminating the inside of the channel closed by the pressurizing channel, and the sample is prevented from remaining in the intersecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Under this structure, at the position where the plurality of channels intersect, the pressurizing channel for closing each of the channels overlaps a part of the intersecting portion to be protruded in the intersecting portion, and thus the sample, which is being delivered into the channel other than the channel closed in the intersecting portion, does not flow into a vicinity of the intersecting portion of the closed channel. Therefore, the channel is reliably cleaned when a cleaning sample is delivered into the intersecting portion, contamination caused by mixture of the samples is avoided, and reliability of analysis is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, the channel opening/closing mechanism has the following structure. Specifically, the channel opening/closing mechanism partially intersects the sample channel which is formed in the microchip to be sealed by the elastic members. Moreover, the pressurizing channel is provided to a layer different from the layer in which the channel is formed, and a hole portion or a recessed portion is provided in the microchip or a member for sandwiching the microchip at a position corresponding to the intersecting portion of the channel. When the pressurized medium is applied to the pressurizing channel, the channel formed of the elastic members is deformed at the intersecting portion, and is deformed to enter the hole portion or the recessed portion, to thereby sandwich and close the channel at an edge portion of the hole portion or the recessed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Under this structure, in the structure in which the pressurized medium is applied to the pressurizing channel and thus the elastic members are deformed to close the channel in a press-contact state, the channel is deformed to enter the hole portion or the recessed portion, to thereby increase the closing function. As a result, the pressure of the pressurized medium is reduced, and energy saving is achieved. In addition, another samples are prevented from entering, and hence reliability of analysis is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Further, for a method of injecting the sample, the following structure is adopted. Specifically, at least one of the plurality of sample reservoirs as the delivering side is packed with a sample or a cleaning sample for preparing the states of the sample reservoirs as the delivering side and the states of the channels, and the sample is delivered at the beginning of the delivering step or during the desired step.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Under this structure, the cleaning or channel-stabilizing sample packed in the at least one of the sample reservoirs is delivered into the channel in the microchip at an initial stage of analysis or at the necessary time. Thus, the delivering mechanism changes the sample remaining in the channel into the sample not adversely affecting analysis in the post-steps, removes the sample remaining and bringing adverse effect, and stabilizes the state of the channel, to thereby increase reliability of analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described above, according to the channel control mechanism for a microchip according to each of the embodiments of this invention, it is possible to squeeze and analyze the sample remaining in the channel, and hence an expensive sample is saved.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Further, according to the channel opening/closing mechanism for a microchip as described above, it is possible to reliably close the channels involved in delivering the samples, and thus the samples are not mixed with each other. As a result, it is possible to avoid deterioration of analyzing accuracy caused by the mutual contamination, and to remarkably increase reliability of analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Still further, according to the channel opening/closing mechanism for a microchip as described above, it is possible to achieve simple control, a reduction in size and weight of the device, energy saving, and provision of an inexpensive device.</p>
