<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims priority from prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/494,635, filed on Jun. 12, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a graphene based electrically tunable nanoconstriction device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Quantum dot (QD) technology, in particular the double-dot spin qubit scheme, has been a serious contender among solid state qubits because of its compactness and scalability. See for example &#x201c;<i>Coherent manipulation of coupled electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots</i>&#x201d;, J. R. Petta, A. C. Johnson, J. M. Taylor, E. A. Laird, A. Yacoby, M. D. Lukin, C. M. Marcus, M. P. Hanson, A. C. Gossard, Science 309, 2180 (2005). Current QD devices have predominantly been built using III-V materials, such as the GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The intrinsic noise generated by the nuclear spin fluctuations in these materials severely limits the number of quantum-gate operations before decoherence sets in, posing a grave challenge for implementing quantum error correction. See for example &#x201c;<i>Dephasing time of GaAs electron</i>-<i>spin qubits coupled to a nuclear bath exceeding </i>200 &#x3bc;s&#x201d;, H. Bluhm, S. Foletti, I. Neder, M. Rudner, D. Mahalu, V. Umansky, A. Yacoby, Nature Physics 7, 109 (2011).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Graphene, as a zero nuclear-spin system, can easily bypass the bottleneck stated above, giving graphene QDs a clear advantage over the 2DEG QDs in III-V materials. See &#x201c;<i>Spin qubits in graphene quantum dots</i>&#x201d;, Bj&#xf6;rn Trauzettel, Denis V. Bulaev, Daniel Loss, Guido Burkard, Nature Physics 3, 192 (2007). The most crucial step in building a graphene QD is the fabrication of nanoconstrictions for control of electron tunneling on and off the dot and between dots within a qubit. It is therefore essential that NO strong impurity resonance state sits in the constriction region to trap electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite the clear research direction and countless efforts devoted to reap the benefits of graphene for quantum computation, graphene QD qubits are still yet to exist. Besides, the only report on graphene quantum point contact has been a one-shot suspended device with very limited practical value, since the constriction size is neither controllable nor tunable. See for example &#x201c;<i>Quantized conductance of a suspended graphene nanoconstriction</i>&#x201d;, Nikolaos Tombros, Alina Veligura, Juliane Junesch, Marcos H. D. Guimaraes, Ivan J. Vera-Marun, Harry T. Jonkman, Bart J. van Wees, Nature Physics 7, 697 (2011).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The root cause of this stalled progress lies in the lack of band-gap in graphene. Because of its zero band-gap, electrostatic gating for charge depletion and charge confinement is extremely difficult. Nearly all efforts on making graphene quantum devices have thus relied on defining the constriction and quantum-dot geometry using reactive-ion etching (RIE) instead of tunable electrostatic gating. See for example &#x201c;<i>Tunable Coulomb blockade in nanostructured graphene</i>&#x201d;, C. Stampfer, J. G&#xfc;ttinger, F. Molitor, D. Graf, T. Ihn, and K. Ensslin, Appl. Phys. Lett. 92, 012102 (2008) and &#x201c;<i>Chaotic Dirac billiard in graphene quantum dots</i>&#x201d;, L. A. Ponomarenko, F. Schendin, M. I. Katsnelson, R. Yang, E. W. Hill, K. S. Novoselov, and A. K. Geim, Science 320, 356 (2008). This etching-based geometrical confinement approach incurs severe damage to the edge of the already narrow graphene nanoconstrictions (&#x3c;50 nm), causing inevitable localized resonant states and rendering the graphene dots useless for qubit applications. See for example &#x201c;<i>Quantum Dot Behavior in Graphene Nanoconstrictions</i>&#x201d; K. Todd, H. T. Chou, S. Amasha, D. Goldhaber-Gordon, Nano Lett. 9, 416 (2009) and &#x201c;<i>Imaging localized states in graphene nanosctructures</i>&#x201d; S. Schnez, J. Guttinger, M. Huefner, C. stampfer, K. Ensslin, T. Ihn, Phys. Rev. B 82, 165445 (2010).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A novel semiconductor device and process for forming the device is disclosed. More specifically a graphene-based gate-tunable electronic nanoconstriction device is described</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The device includes a back-gate dielectric layer formed over a conductive substrate. The back-gate dielectric layer in one example is hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), mica, SiOx, SiNx, BNx, HfOx, AlOx, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Next a graphene layer is formed over the back-gate dielectric layer. The graphene layer in one example is an AB-stacked bi-layer graphene layer or an ABC-stacked tri-layer graphene layer or an ABC-stacked few-layer graphene layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Contacts are formed over a portion of the graphene layer including at least one source contact, at least one drain contact, and at least one side-gate contact. Next, a graphene channel with one or more graphene side gates is formed in the graphene layer in between the side-gate contact, the source contact, and the drain contact. In another example, a set of side-gate contacts is formed and the graphene channel with graphene side gates is formed in between the set of side-gate contacts, the source contact, and the drain contact. In another example, the graphene channel is formed between the set of side-gate contacts, the source contact, and the drain contact, and the side gates are then formed next to the graphene channel using any conductive materials.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A top-gate dielectric layer is formed over the graphene layer. In one example, the top-gate dielectric is an oxide, a nitride, a hexagonal boron nitride, SiOx, SiNx, BNx, HfOx, AlOx, or a combination thereof. Finally, a top-gate electrode is formed on the top-gate dielectric layer over the graphene channel.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail hereinbelow with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The inventors have developed an electrically tunable nanoconstriction in graphene. In one example the present invention includes a gate-defined graphene nanoconstriction structure that uses AB-stacked bilayer, ABC-stacked trilayer, or ABC-stacked multilayer graphene as the channel material. This novel nanostructure employs a combination of top gates and planer side gates for electrostatic electron confinement, which circumvents the edge-defect scattering problem that plagues the existing graphene nanoconstriction and quantum dot devices made by the reactive-ion etching (RIE) based method.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention reduces defect and impurity scattering. With proper choice of top and back-gate dielectrics that minimizes hysteresis and trap-charge problems, the nanoconstriction would then turn into a quantum point contact which, as an electron-wave beam splitter, is extremely valuable for manipulating quantum information encoded in the propagating electron-wave &#x201c;flying qubits.&#x201d;</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Starting with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref>, a back gate dielectric layer <b>110</b> material is formed over a substrate <b>100</b> e.g. highly doped silicon substrate or any other conductive substrate. The back-gate dielectric layer <b>110</b> material may be, for example, a thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) single-crystalline film or a thin lead zirconate titanate (PZT) or a combination thereof. Back gate dielectrics may also be formed from, for example, SiOx, SiNx, BNx, AlOx, HfOx, mica, and combinations thereof deposited by, for example, atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), or physical transfer techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, shown is the formation of graphene layer <b>112</b> over the back-gate dielectric layer <b>110</b>. The graphene layer <b>112</b> may be formed over the back-gate dielectric layer <b>110</b> in any suitable manner known in the art, such as by deposition or physical transfer. The graphene layer <b>112</b> may be AB-stacked graphene bilayers, ABC stacked graphene trilayers, ABCA stacked graphene tetralayers, and other ABC stacked graphene multilayers, or graphene bilayers, trilayers, and multilayers with slight stacking misorientations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Then, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, metal source/drain electrodes or contacts <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and side-gate contacts <b>128</b> to the graphene layer <b>112</b> are formed. The metal contacts <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> may be formed by any suitable process, such as blanket deposition and etch, or by lithography resist patterning, deposition and lift-off, for example. In addition, exemplary metals for the source drain contacts <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and side-gate contact <b>128</b> may include, but are not necessarily limited to, titanium (Ti), gold (Au), palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref> a graphene channel <b>130</b> is formed surrounded by spacers <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> defining graphene side gates <b>132</b> and <b>138</b> as shown. A mask for producing the desired pattern for the graphene channel <b>130</b> may comprise, for example, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), e-beam resist, or photoresist. The unwanted areas of graphene layer <b>112</b> are etched away by oxygen reactive ion etching or oxygen plasma to produce the desired pattern to form spacers <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>. After formation of the graphene channel <b>130</b>, a top gate dielectric layer <b>140</b> is formed over the graphene channel <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (B). The top gate dielectric layer <b>140</b> need not cover the metal contacts <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>128</b>. For the device to work, it only needs to cover the graphene channel <b>130</b>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref> illustrates layer <b>140</b> covering all metal contacts simply because this requires one less lithography step and therefore is easier to implement. Exemplary top gate dielectric materials include oxides and nitrides, but are not necessarily limited to, h-BN, SiNx, BNx, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and HfO<sub>2</sub>, deposited by, for example, atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), or physical transfer techniques. Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref>, a top gate electrode <b>150</b> is formed on the top gate dielectric layer <b>140</b> and over the channel <b>130</b>. The top gate electrode <b>150</b> may be of the same material and formed in the same manner as the metal source/drain electrodes or contacts <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and side-gate contacts <b>128</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>. The process described above provides the electrically tunable graphene based electronic nanoconstriction device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref>. In one example, the dimension of the graphene channel is greater than or equal to 100 nm as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Tunable Nanoconstriction Device</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Operation of the gate tunable graphene based electronic nanoconstriction device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref> thus formed may be further understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of a tunable graphene nanoconstriction device <b>600</b>, similar to that fabricated in the process flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also depicts a schematic band diagram along a cross-section of the device channel, in which a dashed line <b>670</b> denotes the channel chemical potential &#x3bc;<sub>F</sub>, a solid curved line <b>672</b> denotes the conduction band edge and a solid curved line <b>674</b> denotes the valence band edge.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one example, the present invention employs the electrostatic engineering of band-gap opening and band bending in bilayer graphene for local depletion of electrons. More specifically, the overall band-gap opening is achieved by breaking the bilayer symmetry with an applied vertical field between the top gate (TG) <b>650</b> and the conducting back gate <b>610</b>. Local band bending is achieved by biasing the graphene side gates (SG) <b>627</b> and <b>628</b> to raise or lower the potential locally. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, near the edges of the channel <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, band bending is most severe, pushing the chemical potential deep into the band-gap to deplete electrons and create an electrostatically tunable nanoconstriction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a top view of a prototypical globally side-gated graphene device with graphene side gates (SG) <b>728</b>, a source contact <b>724</b>, a drain contact <b>726</b> and a channel <b>730</b>. To quantitatively analyze a spatial extent of band bending under electrostatic gating, a numerical result of the prototypical globally side-gated graphene device is given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. In the prototypical globally side-gated graphene device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the channel width is approximately 400 nm and the side gate to channel distance is approximately 200 nm. Numerical simulation of the prototypical globally side-gated graphene device indicates that the side-gate induced E-field penetrates about 50-100 nm into the channel to create carrier doping and band bending. The induced carrier density profile in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is determined by the side-gate voltages and the device geometry. By varying the channel width and the proximity of side gates to the channel, a larger band bending can be engineered, which would then narrow the opening of the nanoconstriction to reduce the number of electron wave modes passing through the nanoconstriction. For instance, narrowing the channel width from approximately 400 nm to approximately 100 nm increases the extent of E-field induced band bending by approximately 75%. Similarly, bringing the side gates closer to the channel from approximately 200 nm to approximately 100 nm increases the effectiveness of E-field induced band bending by &#x3e;50%.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Channel Geometries</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">One example of the graphene channel geometry is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref> has symmetrical channel geometry with a leftside gate <b>527</b> and rightside gate <b>528</b> illustrating an overall rounded, smooth, hour-glass shape. This graphene channel geometry is easy to fabricate and provides immunity to impurities induced by edge defects. However, a variety of constriction geometries may work under the same concept.
