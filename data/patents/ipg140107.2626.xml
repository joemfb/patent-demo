<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, the present disclosure relates to the manufacturing of sophisticated semiconductor devices, and, more specifically, to various methods of forming semiconductor devices that have capacitor and via contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, as the integration density of semiconductor devices increases, the area occupied by individual devices continues to decrease. Specifically, a capacitor for storing data of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) is required to have sufficient capacitance irrespective of the decrease in the area occupied by the capacitor. Accordingly, a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor, in which a lower electrode and an upper electrode are formed of metal and separated by a layer of insulating material, have been used in many integrated circuit products. Additionally, MIM capacitors have been used extensively in semiconductor devices that perform analog-to-digital conversions and digital-to-analog conversions. Conversion between analog signals and digital signals requires that capacitors employed in such conversion processes be stable, i.e., the capacitance of the capacitor must be relatively stable over a range of applied voltages and temperatures. The capacitance of capacitors with polysilicon electrodes tends to be relatively unstable as the capacitance of such capacitor structures tends to vary with changes in temperature and applied voltage. Accordingly, capacitors with polysilicon electrodes are typically not used for such conversion applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In forming the upper and lower metal electrodes of a MIM capacitor an etching process is typically performed to pattern a metal layer. However, as the integration density of semiconductor devices has increased over the recent years, it has become more difficult to etch such metal layers. In particular, copper, which has good electro-migration resistance and a desirable low resistivity, is very difficult to etch. Accordingly, various methods for forming the upper and lower metal electrodes through a damascene process, a process which does not involve etching a metal layer, has been proposed. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,649,464. A copper damascene process generally comprises forming a trench for a copper structure in an insulation layer, forming a sufficient amount of copper to overfill the trench, and removing the excess copper from the substrate, thereby leaving the copper structure in the trench. However, the damascene process used in forming copper based capacitors and conductive lines and vias is a very time-consuming, expensive, multiple step process where chances for creating undesirable defects always exists.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to various methods and of forming semiconductor devices that have MIM capacitors and via contacts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an exhaustive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally, the present disclosure is directed to various methods of forming semiconductor devices that have capacitor and via contacts. In one example, the method includes forming a first conductive structure and a bottom electrode of a capacitor in a layer of insulating material, forming a layer of conductive material above the first conductive structure and the bottom electrode and performing an etching process on the layer of conductive material to define a conductive material hard mask and a top electrode for the capacitor, wherein the conductive material hard mask is positioned above at least a portion of the first conductive structure. This illustrative method includes the further steps of forming an opening in the conductive material hard mask and forming a second conductive structure that extends through the opening in the conductive material hard mask and conductively contacts the first conductive structure. In some illustrative embodiments, the conductive material is a metal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another illustrative example, a method is disclosed that includes forming a first conductive structure and a bottom electrode of a capacitor in a layer of insulating material, forming a metal diffusion barrier layer above said conductive copper structure and the bottom electrode, forming a second layer of insulating material above the metal diffusion barrier layer and forming a layer of metal above said second layer of insulating material. In this embodiment, the method further includes the steps of performing an etching process on the layer of metal to define a metal hard mask and a top electrode for the capacitor, wherein the metal hard mask is positioned above at least a portion of the first conductive structure, forming an opening in the metal hard mask, an opening in the second layer of insulating material and an opening in the metal diffusion barrier layer and forming a second conductive structure that conductively contacts the first conductive structure, wherein the second conductive structure extends through the openings in the metal hard mask, the second layer of insulating material and the metal diffusion barrier layer.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the schematically depicted conductive structure <b>18</b> may be comprised of a variety of conductive materials such as copper, copper manganese, silver, etc., and it may be formed using a variety of known techniques. In one specific example, the conductive structure <b>18</b> is a copper line that is formed using known damascene techniques. The conductive structure <b>18</b> may be part of the overall metallization system for the device <b>100</b>. Of course, the size, shape and configuration of the conductive structure <b>18</b> may vary depending upon the particular application. In one specific example, the conductive structure <b>18</b> may have a thickness that ranges from about 40-60 nm. So as not to obscure the present inventions, some details and layers associated with the formation of the conductive structure <b>18</b> may not be depicted in the drawings. In certain embodiments, one or more barrier layers <b>23</b> may be formed in the trench <b>19</b> prior to depositing the conductive material, e.g., copper in the trench <b>19</b>. Similarly, the bottom electrode <b>20</b>A may be comprised of a variety of conductive materials such as copper, copper manganese, silver, etc., and it may be formed using a variety of techniques.

In one illustrative embodiment, the bottom electrode <b>20</b>A may be comprised of copper, it may be formed using known damascene techniques, and it may have a thickness of about 40-60 nm. The lateral width of the bottom electrode <b>20</b>A may also vary depending upon the particular application. Also similar to the conductive structure <b>18</b>, one or more barrier layers <b>25</b> may be formed in a trench <b>21</b> as part of the process of forming the bottom electrode <b>20</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, one or more etching processes are performed through the patterned mask layer <b>22</b> to define the opening <b>24</b>. Either dry or wet etching processes may be employed in forming the opening <b>24</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, the opening <b>24</b> if formed by performing dry anisotropic etching processes to define the opening <b>24</b>, with appropriate changes in the etch chemistry of such etching processes as may be required to etch through the hard mask layer <b>16</b> and the second layer of insulating material <b>14</b>. The size and configuration of the opening <b>24</b> may vary depending upon the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a conductive material layer <b>26</b> is formed above the device <b>100</b> and in the opening <b>24</b>. As will be described more fully below, a portion of the conductive material layer <b>26</b> will eventually become the upper electrode for the MIM capacitor to be formed on the device <b>100</b>. The conductive material layer <b>26</b> may be comprised of a variety of different materials that may be suitable as an electrode for the MIM capacitor such, for example, titanium, titanium nitride, tantalum, tantalum nitride, etc. In one specific example, the conductive material layer <b>26</b> may be a layer of titanium nitride having a thickness of about 30-50 nm that is initially formed by performing a conformal PVD or CVD process. Thereafter, another patterned mask layer <b>28</b>, e.g., a photoresist mask, is formed above the conductive material layer <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, one or more etching processes are performed on the conductive material layer <b>26</b> through the patterned mask layer <b>28</b> to define a top electrode <b>20</b>B for the MIM capacitor <b>20</b> and to define a conductive material hard mask <b>26</b>A positioned above the conductive structure <b>18</b>. Either dry or wet etching processes may be employed in etching the conductive material layer <b>26</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, the conductive material layer <b>26</b> is etched by performing a dry anisotropic etching process. The size and configuration of the top electrode <b>20</b>B and the conductive material hard mask <b>26</b>A may vary depending upon the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the patterned mask layer <b>28</b> is removed and, in one illustrative process flow, a hard mask layer <b>30</b> and a third layer of insulating material <b>32</b> are formed above the device <b>100</b>. It should be noted that the hard mask layer <b>30</b> may not be employed in all applications. In the illustrative process flow described herein, the hard mask layer <b>30</b> will ultimately be used as a polish stop layer when a CMP process is performed to remove portions of the third layer of insulating material <b>32</b>, as describe more fully below. Thus, in this illustrative example, it may be beneficial to make the hard mask layer <b>30</b> from a material that is harder than the material selected for the third layer of insulating material <b>32</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, the hard mask layer <b>30</b> may be comprised of a variety of materials such as, for example, a TEOS based silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc. In one specific example, the hard mask layer <b>30</b> may be a layer of TEOS based silicon dioxide having a thickness of about 30-50 nm that is initially formed by performing a CVD process. In one illustrative embodiment, the third layer of insulating layer <b>32</b> may be comprised of a materials such as a so-called low-k insulating material (k value less than 2.7) or an ultra-low-k insulating material (k value of less than 2.3), etc. In one specific example, the third insulating layer <b>32</b> may be a layer of a low-k insulating material having a thickness of about 600-800 nm that is initially formed by performing a CVD process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, one or more process operations are performed to remove portions of the third layer of insulating material <b>32</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process is performed to remove the excess portions of the third layer of insulating material <b>32</b> with the hard mask layer <b>30</b> acting as a polish stop layer. In other applications, an etching process may be performed to remove the excess portions of the third layer of insulating material <b>32</b>. Of course, if desired, a combination of a CMP process and an etching process may be employed in removing portions of the third layer of insulating material <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, a plurality of process operations are performed to form what will become a conductive structure <b>40</b> that will be electrically coupled to the conductive structure <b>18</b>, e.g., a metal line, positioned in the first layer of insulating material <b>10</b>. The conductive structure <b>40</b> may be comprised of a variety of different materials, e.g., copper, a metal, copper manganese, silver, etc. and it may be formed using a variety of known techniques. Thus, the particular material used for the conductive structure <b>40</b> and the manner in which it is formed should not be considered to be a limitation of the present inventions. In one illustrative embodiment, the conductive structure <b>40</b> may be comprised of copper and it may be formed by using known damascene processing techniques, such as those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,649,464. In general, as noted previously, copper damascene processing generally comprises forming a trench for a copper structure in an insulation layer, forming a sufficient amount of copper to overfill the trench, and removing the excess copper from the substrate, thereby leaving the copper structure in the trench. In the example depicted herein, the conductive structure <b>40</b> is formed using a so-called via-first, trench-last technique. Using this technique, a via <b>42</b> and a trench <b>44</b> are formed through the various material layers depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>. This process includes forming an opening <b>27</b> through the conductive material hard mask <b>26</b>A. The via <b>42</b> exposes the underlying conductive structure <b>18</b>. Thereafter, one or more layers of conductive material <b>41</b> are formed in the via <b>42</b> and the trench <b>44</b>. So as not to obscure the present inventions, some details and layers associated with the formation of the conductive structure <b>40</b> may not be depicted in the drawings. In at least some embodiments, one or more barrier layers <b>45</b> may be formed in the via <b>42</b> and the trench <b>44</b> prior to depositing the conductive material <b>41</b>, e.g., copper in the via <b>42</b> and the trench <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, a CMP process is performed to reduce the conductive structure <b>40</b> to the desired final height. Thereafter, a second non-conductive diffusion barrier layer <b>12</b> is formed above the device <b>100</b>. The second non-conductive diffusion barrier layer <b>12</b> will help prevent or at least reduce any undesirable migration of the conductive materials in the conductive structure <b>40</b> and/or the top electrode <b>20</b>B of the MIM capacitor <b>20</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, the second non-conductive diffusion barrier layer <b>12</b> may be a layer of NBLoK&#x2122; having a thickness of about 20-40 nm that is initially formed by performing a CVD process.</p>
