<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Application No. 2008-252559 filed in Japan on Sep. 30, 2008, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming device and a developer supply method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, as an image forming device, the constitution to control the amount of toner to be supplied to a developer bottle on the basis of the concentration of the toner in a developer bottle has been publicly known (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-6090).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, as other image forming device, the constitution to control the supply amount of the toner to a developer bottle in response to the number of printing dots (a dot count value) has been publicly known (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-40408).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, in the image forming device, variations are generated in the aspect of the toner (a capacity, a concentration, and a bulk density or the like) to be supplied depending on a difference in an environmental condition such as a temperature and humidity. However, in the above-described conventional image forming device, it is impossible to appropriately maintain the concentration of the toner in a developing device in consideration of change of the aspect of the toner due to such a difference in an environmental condition. In other words, this is because it is not possible to eliminate the influence of change in the aspect of the toner to be actually supplied to the inside of the developing device merely by measuring the concentration of the toner in the developing device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an image forming device and a developer supply method that can obtain a desired concentration of the toner in consideration of change in the aspect of a toner to be supplied.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hereinafter, the embodiment(s) according to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. However, in the following explanation, unless specifically described, the technical scope of the present invention is not limited only to kinds, combinations, shapes, and relative arrangements or the like of the constituent elements. In addition, as necessary, the terms showing specific directions and positions (for example, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;one end&#x201d;, and &#x201c;other end&#x201d; or the like) are used; however, these terms are used in order to make the understanding of the invention with reference to the drawings easy and due to meanings of these terms, the technical scope of the present invention is not limited.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Constitution)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Among image forming devices of an electro photographic system using a binary developer, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> particularly illustrates an image forming device of a so-called trickle system that supplies not only toner but also a small amount of carrier. This image forming device is largely provided with image forming units <b>1</b>, a transcription unit <b>2</b>, an exposure unit <b>3</b>, a paper feeding unit <b>4</b>, a cleaning unit <b>5</b>, and a control unit <b>6</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The image forming units <b>1</b> are arranged on four places along an intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> of the transcription unit <b>2</b>, and by forming images of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (Bk), from the left side, respectively, the image forming units <b>1</b> form color images on the surface of the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, respective image forming units <b>1</b> are provided with a charging device <b>8</b>, a developing device <b>9</b>, and a cleaning device <b>10</b> or the like around a photo conductor drum <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The charging device <b>8</b> forms a predetermined surface potential on the surface of the photo conductor drum <b>7</b>. This surface potential is made into an electrostatic latent image when the surface of the photo conductor drum <b>7</b> is exposed by the exposure unit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the developing device <b>9</b> has an agitation screw <b>12</b>, a supply screw <b>13</b>, and a developing roller <b>14</b>, which are respectively contained in a developer container <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the developer container <b>11</b> is formed as a long box that is elongated from one end to other end, and the developer container <b>11</b> is divided into two parts by a partition wall <b>15</b>, namely, a first containing part <b>16</b> and a second containing part <b>17</b> along a longitudinal direction. However, the opposite end sides of the first containing part <b>16</b> and the second containing part <b>17</b> are communicated with each other by communication parts <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i>, and the contained developer is cyclically moved, being agitated. In addition, the developer container <b>11</b> is provided with a first toner concentration detection sensor <b>25</b> as means of detecting the amount of the toner per unit volume. The first toner concentration detection sensor <b>25</b> is a conventionally well-known one that outputs a difference in a magnetic permeability of the developer as a frequency and calculates a concentration of a toner (a weight ratio of the toner for the developer) in accordance with the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A developer supply port <b>19</b> is formed on one end side of the first containing part <b>16</b>, and as described later, the developer is supplied from a corresponding developer supply container <b>23</b>. Here, as the developer, a binary developer containing a toner and a carrier is used. However, the developer may further contain an external addition agent or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, a developer discharge port <b>20</b> is formed on one end side of the second containing part <b>17</b> so as to prevent a carrier that is deteriorated from remaining in the developer container <b>11</b> over a long period by appropriately discharging the developer.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The agitation screw <b>12</b> is structured being provided with a spiral wing <b>12</b><i>b </i>around a rotation shaft <b>12</b><i>a </i>to be arranged in the first containing part <b>16</b>. The agitation screw <b>12</b> is rotary-driven to agitate the developer, conveying the developer from one end side to other end side.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The supply screw <b>13</b> is arranged in the second containing part <b>17</b> having a spiral wing <b>13</b><i>b </i>placed around a rotation shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>as well as the above-described agitation screw <b>12</b>. The supply screw <b>13</b> is rotary-driven to transport the developer from the side of the communication parts <b>18</b><i>b </i>to the side of the communication part <b>18</b><i>a </i>and supplies the developer to the developing roller <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the developing roller <b>14</b> has a plurality of permanent magnets <b>22</b> in the cylindrical sleeve <b>21</b> (here, five permanent magnets S<b>2</b>, N<b>2</b>, S<b>1</b>, N<b>1</b>, and S<b>3</b> are arranged in this order in a clockwise direction). The sleeve <b>21</b> is structured so as to be rotated in an arrow direction in the drawing by sleeve driving means (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the developer supply container <b>23</b> for supplying a binary developer for supply composed of toner and a carrier (hereinafter, merely described as a developer) is detachably located above the developing device <b>9</b>. The developer contained in the developer supply container <b>23</b> is appropriately agitated by an agitation member <b>24</b>. The agitation member <b>24</b> is formed by integrally arranging paddles <b>24</b><i>b </i>of tabular shapes with predetermined intervals on plural places around a rotation shaft <b>24</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The lower surface of the developer supply container <b>23</b> and the upper surface of the developer container <b>11</b> are connected by a supply tube <b>26</b> that forms a supply path. Further, a concentration of a toner of the developer to be contained in the developer container <b>11</b> in advance is 7%; and a concentration of a toner of the developer to be supplied from the developer supply container <b>23</b> is 80% (a carrier concentration is 20%, generally, 10 to 20%).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the middle of the supply tube <b>26</b>, a sub hopper <b>28</b> is connected. Paddles <b>29</b> (they may be a rotation coil or the like) are contained in the sub hopper <b>28</b>, and when the paddles <b>29</b> are appropriately rotated, the developer is supplied. On the upper side surface of the sub hopper <b>28</b>, an empty sensor <b>30</b> is placed. As the empty sensor <b>30</b>, a photo sensor, a piezoelectric sensor, and a magnet lead sensor or the like can be used. The empty sensor <b>30</b> detects that the amount of the developer in the sub hopper <b>28</b> is not more than a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, at a lower surface corner portion of the sub hopper <b>28</b>, as means of detecting the amount of the toner per unit volume, a second toner concentration detection sensor <b>31</b> is provided. As the second toner concentration detection sensor <b>31</b>, one having a sufficient sensitivity even in a high concentration region with a concentration of a toner (a weight ratio) not less than 50% is available. For example, a magnetic type of a sensor may be used, which is configured to detect a concentration of a toner component in the developer by change in a frequency of a resonance circuit formed by an inductance and a capacitance (in detail, refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-119538). Further, a method of calculating a concentration of a toner from a detection signal detected by the second toner concentration detection sensor <b>31</b> is identical with that of the above-described first toner concentration detection sensor <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After transcription of the toner to the surface of the photo conductor drum <b>7</b>, collecting the toner remaining on this surface, the cleaning device <b>10</b> cleans this surface.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transcription unit <b>2</b> is structured in such a manner that the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> is rounded between a pair of support rollers <b>32</b>, and driving the support rollers <b>32</b> by means of driving means (not illustrated), the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> is cyclically moved in an arrow direction. The transcription unit <b>2</b> is provided with a primary transcription part <b>34</b> and a secondary transcription part <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The exposure unit <b>3</b> irradiates a laser beam to the above-described photo conductor drum <b>7</b> to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding to the image data that is read by a scanner (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The paper feeding unit <b>4</b> conveys recording medium <b>38</b> contained in a cassette <b>36</b> to the secondary transcription part <b>35</b> in series via a conveyance roller <b>37</b>. A toner image is transcribed to the recording medium <b>38</b> that is conveyed to the secondary transcription part <b>35</b>, and after the toner image transcribed by a fuser unit <b>39</b> is fixed, the recording medium <b>38</b> is conveyed to a discharge tray <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The cleaning unit <b>5</b> is capable of coming contact with and being detached from the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> and the cleaning unit <b>5</b> collects the remaining toner on the surface of the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> when the cleaning unit <b>5</b> gets close to the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> and cleans the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The control unit <b>6</b> carries out the supply processing of the developer on the basis of the detection voltages to be inputted from respective toner concentration detection sensors <b>25</b> and <b>31</b> as described later.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(Operation)</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the operation of the image forming device that is formed by the above-described constitution will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At the time of forming images, the color print data that is obtained by reading the image, or the image data that is outputted from a personal computer or the like is transmitted to each of the image forming units <b>1</b> as an image signal of each color, yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (Bk) after being applied with predetermined signal processing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Respective image forming units <b>1</b> form latent images by projecting the laser beam that is modulated by image signals on the photo conductor drum <b>7</b>. Then, respective image forming units <b>1</b> supply the toner from the developing device <b>9</b> to the photo conductor drum <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">By rotary-driving the agitation screw <b>12</b> and the supply screw <b>13</b>, the developing device <b>9</b> circulates the developer contained in the developer container <b>11</b> while agitating the developer. Then, supplying the toner from the supply screw <b>13</b> to the developing roller <b>14</b>, the toner is scraped out by a regulation member <b>11</b><i>a </i>to be a constant amount. After that, the developing device <b>9</b> conveys the toner to the photo conductor drum <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thereby, on respective photo conductor drums <b>7</b>, toner images of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black are formed. The formed yellow, magenta, cyan, and black toner images are primarily transcribed by the primary transcription part <b>34</b> being superimposed on the moving intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> in series. Thus, the superimposed toner images that are formed on the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> are moved to the secondary transcription part <b>35</b> in accordance with movement of the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the recording medium <b>38</b> is supplied from the paper feeding unit <b>4</b>. The supplied recording medium <b>38</b> is conveyed between the secondary transcription part <b>35</b> and the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> by the conveyance roller <b>37</b>, and then, the toner images formed on the intermediate transcription belt <b>33</b> are transcribed on this recording medium <b>38</b>. The recording medium <b>38</b> having the toner images transcribed is further conveyed to a fuser device <b>39</b>, and after the transcribed toner images are fixed there, the recording medium <b>38</b> is discharged to the discharge tray <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the mean time, in the developing device <b>9</b>, the concentration of the toner of the contained developer is lowered by supplying the toner to the photo conductor drum <b>7</b>, and the carrier is deteriorated by usage over a long period. Therefore, by appropriately discharging and supplying the developer, the amount of the developer in the developer container <b>11</b> is maintained approximately constant.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, the supply processing of the developer will be carried out as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(First Supply Processing of Developer)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other words, in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when predetermined time has been passed (step S<b>1</b>), a detection signal to be outputted from the first toner concentration detection sensor <b>25</b> is read (step S<b>2</b>). Here, by driving the agitation screw <b>12</b> and the supply screw <b>13</b> and moving the developer for a predetermined tine, the concentration of the toner after the concentration of the toner is made to be approximately unified is read. The developer may be moved for full circle, or quarter circle. The bottom line is that the developer is moved so as to obtain nearly unified concentration of the toner across the developing device <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then, on the basis of the read detection signal, the reference supply amount is calculated (step S<b>3</b>). Then, on the basis of a relation between the preliminarily-obtained reference supply amount and the rotation-driving time of the paddles <b>29</b> in the sub hopper <b>28</b>, the rotation-driving time of the paddles <b>29</b> is set. The more the detected concentration of the toner is decreased, the longer the rotation time of the paddles <b>29</b> is set.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the reference supply amount of the developer is calculated in this way, the correction processing for correcting the supply amount of the developer is carried out. According to the correction processing, as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at first, a detection signal in the empty sensor <b>30</b> is read (step S<b>11</b>). Then, on the basis of the read detection signal, it is judged whether or not the developer in the sub hopper <b>28</b> is nearly empty (step S<b>12</b>). Here, &#x201c;nearly empty&#x201d; means the state such that the first driving member <b>23</b> is vacant, the developer is not supplied to the inside of the sub hopper <b>28</b>, and the amount of the developer in the side hopper <b>28</b> is not more than the reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the developer is judged to be nearly empty, the supply processing in response to the state is carried out (step S<b>13</b>). In other words, without correcting the supply amount of the developer as described later, as shown in the above-described steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b>, the reference supply amount of the developer is calculated and this reference supply amount is defined as a legitimate supply amount. This is because, if the developer is the state of nearly-empty, the amount of the developer in the sub hopper <b>28</b> is decreased, and this makes it impossible to correctly detect the concentration of the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the developer is not judged to be nearly-empty, a detection signal detected by the second toner concentration detection sensor <b>31</b> (means of detecting toner amount before supply) is read (step S<b>14</b>). Then, on the basis of the read detection signal, namely, the concentration of the toner, with reference to the supply amount correction table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the correction amount with respect to the reference supply amount of the developer is calculated (step S<b>15</b>). In other words, on the basis of the concentration of the toner in the sub hopper <b>28</b> that is detected by the second toner concentration detection sensor <b>31</b>, the correction amount with respect to the reference supply amount that is obtained as described above is obtained. Here, the correction amount with respect to each reference supply amount is to be decided in six stages, namely, up to 50%; 50 to 60%; 60 to 70%; 70 to 80%; 80 to 90%; and 90 to 100%. In detail, if the concentration of the toner to be detected is in the range of 80 to 90%, the correction amount is made into 0 because this is within the range of the desired concentration (the reference concentration). In addition, if the concentration of the toner to be detected is less than 80%, the toner amount to be supplied is smaller than the desired amount. Therefore, in response to a decrease level of the concentration of the toner, the supply amount of the developer is corrected so as to be increased. On the contrary, if the concentration of the toner to be detected is not less than 90%, the amount of the toner to be supplied is increased than the desired amount, so that the supply amount of the developer is corrected so as to be limited. If the supply amount is calculated, adding the correction amount to the reference supply amount, a legitimate supply amount is calculated (step S<b>16</b>). Further, the segment of the concentration of the toner to be detected is not limited to the above-described six stages, but the segment may be further broken (according to the circumstances, no stage) or the concentration of the toner to be detected may be divided into the stages less than six.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">If the supply control processing is completed, by rotating the paddles <b>29</b> for a time on the basis of the calculated supply amount of the developer, the developer is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Thus, according to the above-described supply processing of the developer, detecting the concentration of the toner of the developer just before being supplied to the developer container <b>11</b>, on the basis of this detection result, not only the reference supply amount from the corresponding developer supply container <b>23</b> is decided, but also this reference supply amount is corrected. Thereby, it is possible to stabilize the amount of the toner to be supplied to the inside of the developer container <b>11</b>, so that it is possible to correctly control the concentration of the toner in the developer container <b>11</b> to be a desired value.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Second Supply Processing of Developer)</p>
