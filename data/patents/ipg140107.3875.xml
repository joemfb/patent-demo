<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0089948, filed on Sep. 14, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a luminance correction system, and more particularly, to a luminance correction system applied to an organic light emitting display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An organic light emitting display is a type of a flat panel display (FPD), in which an organic compound is used as an emission material, has high luminance and color purity, is thin and light, is driven with low power consumption, and may be used for various displays such as a portable display.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Organic light emitting displays generate data signals having voltages in accordance with the respective gray scale levels based on reference gamma voltages and displays an image corresponding to the generated data signals. The luminance components of the respective completed processes may be different from the target luminance due to variations in manufacturing processes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the luminance components of the products whose manufacturing products are completed do not reach the target value, the products are determined as being defective. Therefore, in FPDs (e.g., completed FPDs) the measured luminance components of the respective products are to be corrected to be suitable for the target luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When only the luminance of the organic light emitting display is corrected, due to difference in efficiency, among red pixels, green pixels, and blue pixels, a white balance may be distorted. Therefore, in order to solve such a problem, color coordinates may be corrected together with the luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conventionally, the luminance and the color coordinates are corrected only for predetermined reference gray scale levels and the offset value generated during the correction of the reference gray scale levels is directly applied to other gray scale levels. In this case, correction close to the target value is performed in the reference gray scale levels. However, for other gray scale levels, especially those gray scale levels that are remote from the reference gray scale levels, the luminance and the color coordinates of the gray scale level become different from the target value.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, aspects of embodiments of the present invention provide a luminance correction system for an organic light emitting display, in which reference offset values are set in order to correct gamma voltages of reference gray scale levels and an additional offset value is set for at least one gray scale level among the remaining gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale levels to apply the offset value to the correction of the gamma voltage corresponding to the gray scale level so that it is possible to prevent color coordinates from being twisted (e.g., distorted) in the respective gray scale levels and luminance components.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve the foregoing and/or other aspects of the present invention, there is provided a luminance correction system for an organic light emitting display, including: a screen analyzing unit configured to analyze a screen displayed on a display unit of the organic light emitting display to measure luminance and color coordinates for reference gray scale levels; a reference offset value setting unit configured to set reference offset values for the reference gray scale levels to correspond to a screen analyzing result obtained by the screen analyzing unit; a gamma voltage correcting unit configured to correct reference gamma voltages for the reference gray scale levels to correspond to the reference offset values set by the reference offset value setting unit and to output the corrected reference gamma voltages; and a gamma voltage applying unit configured to apply the reference gamma voltages corrected by the gamma voltage correcting unit to the data driver of the organic light emitting display.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The reference gray scale levels may be set to be a maximum gray scale level and a medium gray scale level.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The screen analyzing unit may include: a measuring unit configured to measure chrominance and luminance of the screen; a color coordinate determining unit configured to determine color coordinates based on the measured chrominance; and a luminance comparing unit configured to obtain a difference between a target luminance and a measured luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The reference offset value setting unit may be further configured to set reference luminance offset values that have luminance controlled to correspond to a difference between measured luminance and target luminance for reference gray scale levels obtained by the luminance comparing unit and reference color coordinate offset values that have chrominance controlled to correspond to color coordinates for the reference gray scale levels obtained by the color coordinate determining unit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The gamma voltage correcting unit may be further configured to add reference offset values to the reference gamma voltages to control the reference gamma voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The luminance correction system may further include: an additional offset value setting unit configured to set an additional offset value for at least one gray scale level among gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale levels; and a storage unit configured to store a lookup table from which additional offset values of red, green, and blue pixels are determined based on the reference offset value.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When the reference offset values are negative (&#x2212;) values, additional offset values corresponding to the reference offset values may be 0 or positive (+) values. Gamma voltages for gray scale levels, other than the reference gray scale levels, may be corrected by adding together the reference offset values and the additional offset values.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described above, according to embodiments of the present invention, in order to correct gamma voltages of reference gray scale levels, reference offset values are set and the additional offset value is set for at least one gray scale level among the remaining gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale levels so that the offset value is applied to the correction of the gamma voltage corresponding to the gray scale level and that it is possible to prevent the color coordinates from being distorted in the respective gray scale levels and luminance components.</p>

Therefore, images corresponding to the data signals are displayed on the display unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The scan driver <b>20</b> sequentially generates scan signals to correspond to scan control signals supplied from the outside (e.g., a timing controller). The scan signals generated by the scan driver <b>20</b> are supplied to the pixels <b>15</b> through the scan lines S<b>1</b> to Sn.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The data driver <b>30</b> generates data signals to correspond to data and data control signals supplied from the outside (e.g., the timing controller). The data signals generated by the data driver <b>30</b> are supplied to the pixels <b>15</b> through the data lines D<b>1</b> to Dm in synchronization with the scan signals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The data driver <b>30</b> generates data signals having voltages in accordance with the gray scale levels of data based on a gamma voltage (e.g., a predetermined gamma voltage). When dispersion is generated in panel characteristics due to variations in manufacturing processes, images with different luminance components may be displayed on panels for the same data signal. Therefore, in the organic light emitting displays as completed products, the measured luminance components of the respective products are to be corrected to be suitable for the target luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a luminance correction system is provided in which a difference in luminance generated by dispersion of the characteristics of the panels of the organic light emitting displays is corrected so that the respective panels may have the same luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a luminance correction system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a luminance correction system <b>200</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention, includes a screen analyzing unit <b>220</b>, a reference offset value setting unit <b>230</b>, a gamma voltage correcting unit <b>240</b>, and a gamma voltage applying unit <b>210</b>. The luminance correction system <b>200</b> may be applied to correct the luminance and color coordinates of the organic light emitting display.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The screen analyzing unit <b>220</b> analyzes a screen displayed on the display unit of the organic light emitting display to measure luminance and color coordinates for reference gray scale levels.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an embodiment of the present invention, when data are realized by 256 gray scale levels, that is, gray scale levels (e.g., gray scale levels or gray scale values) 0 to 255, the reference gray scale levels may be the gray scale level <b>255</b> and the gray scale level <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">That is, with the data of the highest gray scale level (the gray scale level <b>255</b>), data of the other gray scale level at the inflection point displayed on a luminance curve in accordance with gray scale levels, for example, the data of the gray scale level <b>127</b> may be further applied to the panel. In this case, since screen analysis for a plurality of gray scale levels may be performed, the precision degree of luminance correction may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the screen analyzing unit <b>220</b> may include a measuring unit <b>222</b> for measuring the chrominance and the luminance of a screen, a color coordinate determining unit <b>224</b> for determining color coordinates based on the measured chrominance, and a luminance comparing unit <b>226</b> for obtaining a difference between target luminance (e.g., a predetermined target luminance) and measured luminance based on the measured luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The reference offset value setting unit <b>230</b> sets reference offset values for the reference gray scale levels to correspond to screen analyzing results obtained by the screen analyzing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In detail, the reference offset value setting unit <b>230</b> may set reference luminance offset values for controlling luminance to correspond to a difference between the reference gray scale levels obtained by the luminance comparing unit <b>226</b> and the target luminance and reference color coordinate offset values for controlling chrominance to correspond to color coordinates for the reference gray scale levels obtained by the color coordinate determining unit <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the reference offset value setting unit <b>230</b> sets gamma control values capable of compensating for a difference between the target luminance and the measured luminance as reference luminance offset values and may set color coordinate movement values capable of correcting color coordinates distorted by problems in luminance correction or processes as reference color coordinate offset values.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Here, the reference offset value setting unit <b>230</b> may determine the offset value corresponding to a luminance difference and/or color coordinates by, for example, an equation (e.g., a predetermined equation) or graph.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The gamma voltage correcting unit <b>240</b> corrects reference gamma voltages for the reference gray scale levels to correspond to the reference offset values set by the reference offset value setting unit <b>230</b> and supplies the corrected reference gamma voltage to the gamma voltage applying unit.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In particular, the gamma voltage correcting unit <b>240</b> may correct luminance by controlling the reference gamma voltages to correspond to the reference luminance offset values. For example, the reference gamma voltages are controlled by the sums of the reference gamma voltages and the reference luminance offset values to correct luminance. Here, the reference luminance offset values are set to negative (&#x2212;) values so that luminance may be reduced when the measured luminance is higher than the target luminance, and may be set to positive (+) values so that luminance may be increased when the measured luminance is lower than the target luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, the reference gamma voltages are ideal gamma voltages corresponding to (e.g., predetermined to correspond to) the above-described reference gray scale levels, which are ideal gamma voltages in which variations between the characteristics of panels are not considered. As described above, when the reference offset values are applied to the reference gamma voltages, variations in the characteristics of the panels may be compensated for.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the gamma voltage correcting unit <b>240</b> controls color coordinates using the reference color coordinate offset values to correct chrominance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, chrominance correction may be simultaneously performed with luminance correction according to (or corresponding to) a result of analyzing a screen. However, the chrominance correction may be performed by controlling color coordinates after first performing luminance correction, and then analyzing the screen corresponding to the luminance correction result. In this case, the color coordinates distorted by the luminance correction may also be corrected (e.g., compensated for) so that the variations in the characteristics of the panels may be corrected more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The gamma voltage applying unit <b>210</b> applies the gamma voltages may be corrected by the gamma voltage correcting unit <b>240</b>, that is, the reference gamma voltages corrected in accordance with the reference gray scale levels to the data driver of the organic light emitting display.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is experimental data illustrating luminance and color coordinate characteristics corrected by the luminance correction system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the experimental data illustrate results of correcting the gamma voltages of four different panels and of providing the corrected gamma voltages to the panels. Not only the luminance and color coordinate characteristics for the above-described reference gray scale levels, that is, the gray scale level <b>255</b> and the gray scale level <b>127</b>, but also the luminance and color coordinate characteristics for gray scale levels (the gray scale level <b>168</b>, the gray scale level <b>40</b>, and the gray scale level <b>12</b>) other than the reference gray scale levels, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Here, for example, the target white color coordinates (x, y) for the gray scale levels of the panels are (0.297, 0.320).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the measured color coordinates for the corrected reference gray scale levels, that is, the gray scale level <b>255</b> and the gray scale level <b>127</b>, are considerably close to the target color coordinates. However, the measured color coordinates for the remaining gray scale levels are different from the target color coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In more detail, for the remaining gray scale levels, the y color coordinate of the white color coordinates (x, y) is shifted too far to the left. This is because gamma voltages applied to green pixels are excessively reduced in the gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale levels where correction is not directly performed since the reference offset values for the green pixels are shifted too far to negative (&#x2212;) values.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to another embodiment of the present invention, in order to perform gamma value correction for the reference gray scale levels, the reference offset values are set, an additional offset value for at least one gray scale level among the remaining gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale levels is set, and the reference offset values and the additional offset value are applied to the gamma voltage correction corresponding to the gray scale level so that it is possible to prevent color coordinates from being distorted in the gray scale levels and luminance.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The same elements as those of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are denoted by the same reference numerals and description of the same elements will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a brightness correction system <b>200</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention further includes the screen analyzing unit <b>220</b>, the reference offset value setting unit <b>230</b>, the gamma voltage correcting unit <b>240</b>, and the gamma voltage applying unit <b>210</b>. The brightness correction system <b>200</b> also includes an additional offset value setting unit <b>250</b> and a storage unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The additional offset value setting unit <b>250</b> sets additional offset values for the gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale levels, and not the reference offset values for the reference gray scale levels, that is, the gray scale level <b>255</b> and the gray scale level <b>127</b>. The additional offset values are set based on the reference offset values.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The gray scale levels to which the additional offset values are applied may be the gray scale level <b>168</b> between the gray scale level <b>255</b> and the gray scale level <b>127</b> and/or the gray scale level <b>40</b> as a low gray scale level.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the gamma voltage for the gray scale level <b>168</b> is additionally corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, the reference offset value for the reference gamma voltage corresponding to the reference gray scale level, that is, the gray scale level <b>255</b> is set so that the reference gamma voltage and the reference offset value are added to generate a corrected reference gamma voltage, which is the same, or substantially the same as the structure and the operation of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">That is, for the gray scale level <b>255</b>, the reference offset values applied to red, green, and blue pixels are set through the above process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, an additional offset value is set for the gray scale level <b>168</b> with reference to the set reference offset value. When the additional offset value is set, the gamma voltage for the gray scale level <b>168</b> is corrected by adding the reference offset value and the additional offset value and the corrected gamma voltage is output to the data driver.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, the additional offset value is set with reference to the lookup table LUT stored in the storage unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lookup table LUT may be realized, for example, by selecting a plurality of panels as models and by experimentally evaluating how much color coordinates for lower gray scale levels deviate from the target color coordinates in comparison with the reference gray scale level for the reference offset value applied to the red, green, and blue pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lookup table LUT may be implemented to determine additional offset values (a, b, c) from red (R), green (G), and blue (B) pixels for the reference offset value.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, when the reference offset value is &#x2212;16, the additional offset value for the red (R) pixel is 1, the additional offset value (b) for the green pixel (G) is 2, and the additional offset value (c) for the blue pixel B is 1.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, when the reference offset value is 16, the additional offset value (a) for the red pixel (R) is &#x2212;2, the additional offset value (b) for the green (G) pixel is &#x2212;3, and the additional offset value (c) for the blue pixel (B) is &#x2212;1.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The additional offset values are applied to the gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale level using the lookup table LUT so that it is possible to prevent the gamma voltage applied to the green pixel from being excessively reduced in the gray scale levels other than the reference gray scale level where correction is not directly performed since the reference offset value for the green (G) pixel is shifted too far to a negative (&#x2212;) value.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">That is, when it is assumed that the reference offset value is &#x2212;16, since the additional offset value (b) for the green (G) pixel is 2, it is possible to prevent correction from being performed in the state where the gamma voltage applied to the corresponding gray scale level is excessively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view illustrating experimental data representing luminance and color coordinate characteristics corrected by the luminance correction system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
