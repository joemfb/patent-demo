<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A remote initiator breaching system for initiating breaching charges over a short range requiring no physical link between the breacher and the demolition charge. The remote initiator breaching system has at least one transmitter, at least one receiver, at least one shock tube connectable to a breaching charge and a power source for each of the transmitter and receiver. The transmitter is able to generate and transmit a coded signal. The transmitter has an input for inputting operational commands into the transmitter for generating the coded signal, The transmitter has a plurality of channels representing different frequency bands, and multiple addresses for each channel such that transmission of the coded signal from the transmitter to the receiver is possible per individual addresses or all addresses simultaneously.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase of PCT Appln. No. PCT/NZ2009/000276 filed Dec. 2, 2009, which claims priority to New Zealand application 579690(NZ) filed on Sep. 16, 2009 the disclosures of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a remote initiator breaching system, typically a remote initiator breaching system for initiating breaching charges over a short range requiring ho physical link between the breacher and the demolition charge.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The safety aspect and reliability of detonating of explosives is paramount as the consequences associated unsafe and unreliable detonation can be castrophic. As such there are requirements for the military, other related defence agencies and other users of explosives to safely detonate explosives. Safely in this context means: safely separated in distance; safely separated in time and security of initiation. Explosives can be initiated by electrical circuit cable or other non-electrical &#x2018;cable&#x2019;, however in cases of electrical initiation, long cable lengths allow greater susceptibly to initiation of the charge via electro-magnetic induction onto the cable (radio signals or lightning strikes).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Security of initiation requires that the explosive must not be initiated falsely, either because of erroneously decoded signals or deliberately spoofed signals. Also to ensure the extremely high level security required, the equipment must be protected against the possibility of the failure of microprocessors and the program code. The firing circuits must also be designed and analysed to a very high standard to ensure that component failure will not result in the firing voltage being incorrectly applied to the explosive circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The remote initiation equipment needs to be as small in volume and as light weight as possible. The radio transmission system needs to operate over a good distance. The equipment needs to be very robust, being carried in an environment that includes; temperatures from &#x2212;4&#xb0; C. to +60&#xb0; C., water depths of 20 metres and in aircraft flying to 30,000 ft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current remote initiator (RI) equipment are generally bulky and heavy with weights around 1.5 kg and volumes around 1500 cubic cm. This weight and volume is driven by the need to increase power endurance which leads to existing cumbersome battery solutions. Further the frequency bands may not be well chosen to achieve the required distances. This can also lead to increased power demand through the selected transmitter power level.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">RI's having a single microprocessor can be suspect, as either a simple failure of the electronic machine or an untested software path could result in the triggering of the firing circuit. The safest assumption to make about a microprocessor and its program is that it could arbitrarily decide to initiate a firing event. To guard against such an event, a secondary processor with its own independent control of the firing circuit can be incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">None of the existing remote initiators provide simplicity of use. A considerable amount of training and experience is required in any but the most simple of deployments. Also none of the existing RI's would appear to be applicable or designed for explosive method of entry and/or for initiating breaching charges over a short range requiring no physical link between the breacher and the demolition charge.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0063">The following description will describe the invention in relation to preferred embodiments of the invention, namely a remote initiator breaching system, typically a remote initiator breaching system for initiating breaching charges over a short range requiring no physical link between the breacher and the demolition charge. The invention is in no way limited to these preferred embodiments as they are purely to exemplify the invention only and that possible variations and modifications would be readily apparent without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &#x26; 2</figref> show the remote initiator breaching system <b>10</b> of the invention consists of a primary transmitter <b>20</b> and up to ten receivers <b>30</b>, both of small size and weight. The remote initiator breaching system <b>10</b> can and preferably includes a standby transmitter <b>21</b>, capable of replacing the primary transmitter <b>20</b> in case of loss or failure. Transmitter <b>21</b> acts as a reserve to maintain functional reliability in case of loss or damage to the primary a transmitter <b>20</b>. In operation the transmitter <b>20</b> can be attached to the wrist of the breacher, while the receiver <b>30</b> can be installed in close proximity to the demolition charge and connected to the charge by a shock tube. The receiver <b>30</b> will initiate the shock tube on receiving a radio frequency (RF) <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> command from the transmitter <b>20</b>. A multiple of up to ten receivers can be bonded to the same transmitter <b>20</b> and initiated individually or all at the same time (<b>31</b>). Different system configurations may be assembled according to operational need with the receivers <b>30</b> being associated (bonded) with a particular transmitter <b>20</b> by means of both frequency and group code. Unbonded receivers <b>30</b> maybe purchased or warehoused for replacement of consumed receivers within a set. Bonded receivers may also be unbonded and returned to the warehouse facility.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0065">The receiver <b>30</b> has a spark-initiator <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for shock-lube detonators. The receiver shock tube interface <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is designed to handle a wide range of environmental conditions. The receiver <b>30</b> is designed as a disposable unit and is intended to be used operationally only once. To maintain safety the receiver records internally a count of the firing commands received. This count can be inspected pre-deployment, to ensure that a potentially damaged receiver is not carried on deployment. Recovered receiver parts can be forensically examined for evidence of multiple use. In a training situation users may wish to use receivers on multiple occasions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0066">The remote initiator breaching system <b>10</b> can also be used to initiate shock-tube manually by clipping the receiver <b>30</b> on the top of its group transmitter <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). When used in this way there is no RF transmission, the command is issued directly from the transmitter <b>20</b> through contacts to the single attached receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0067">The remote initiator breaching system <b>10</b> is designed with safety engineering factors incorporated from its conception. The transmitter <b>20</b> and receiver <b>30</b> both include dual separate processors each, that must concur over the whole initiation process before initiation of the detonator can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0068">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 to 7</figref> the controls and indicators will now be described. The transmitter <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) has a power ON/OFF Switch <b>25</b> mounted on the top the transmitter battery tube <b>54</b>. To switch the transmitter ON the switch <b>25</b> is rotated clockwise. When switch is in the ON position firing is possible, when switch is located in the OFF position (counterclockwise) firing is not possible. The fire button <b>23</b> is mounted on the top face of the transmitter <b>30</b> orthogonal to the keypad. It is used in conjunction with the Enable button <b>22</b> to send a fire command. Orientation is given with the display and three button keypad held vertically in front of the face and with the battery tube ON/OFF Switch to the left. The Enable button <b>23</b> is mounted on the bottom of the transmitter orthogonal to the keypad. Mounted on the front face of the transmitter is a 3 key tactile keypad. The functions are as follows:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0072">The Transmitter LCD Display <b>53</b> is a back-light LCD display and is used to display: the channel number, select the receiver unit (including ALL), and error conditions. The transmitter also includes a docking part <b>52</b> to allow the receiver to be docked and held during manual firing (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Also the transmitter <b>20</b> has two strap holders <b>41</b> to allow a wrist band <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to be attached, preferably by clip-on action, to allow the transmitter <b>30</b> to be worn on the wrist of a user. Also the transmitter is adapted to be attached to the clothing of user using the same clip-on action for the wrist band.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0073">The receiver <b>30</b> has a Power ON/OFF Switch <b>35</b> mounted on the top the receiver battery tube <b>54</b>. To switch the receiver ON, the switch <b>25</b> is rotated clockwise. A receiver LCD Display <b>63</b> is situated on an upper face of the receiver. When the receiver is switched ON, the LED Display <b>63</b> carries out its build-in-tests, displays unit number, health, and channel number. Once the built-in-tests are complete, the receiver <b>30</b> can be ARMED with a &#x2018;double tap&#x2019; of the ARM button <b>61</b>. On entry into ARMED state the LED indicator will flash 3 times then display for continuously for 15 seconds before extinguishing. The receiver <b>30</b> has internal LEDs <b>64</b> with 180&#xb0; field of view to indicate status. The LED is able do display Green &#x26; Red states. The Green state is used to indicate a healthy state: e.g. communication status after a Communications Check command from the transmitter. The Red state indicates various fault conditions: e.g. battery low. Protruding from the receiver is a shock tube interface <b>33</b> for interfacing with a shock tube.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0074">Both transmitter <b>20</b> and receiver <b>30</b> both employ dual independent processors. Each processor is of a different type whereby the code for each processor written by independent software teams to avoid common coding errors. The software is developed in accordance with Def Stan 00-55 and maintained in a controlled document environment. Software written in C code following strict coding practices including:

<p id="p-0078" num="0178">As mentioned previously the remote initiator breaching system is a short range initiator of the explosives used during an Explosive Method Of Entry (EMOE) operation. A remote initiator breaching system set normally consists of two transmitters (one is a back-up) and ten receivers. The units are small in size, light weight and as simple to use as is consistent with the operational scenarios. The remote initiator breaching system is optimised for short range use in urban environments and within steel compartments. Unbonded receivers (not bonded to any transmitter identity) maybe purchased to replace receivers consumed in operations. The current receiver initiates Shock-tube with an electro-static discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> pertains to a flow chart showing and describing the operational steps for bonding a receiver (or receivers) to a transmitter. Receivers may be supplied to a remote initiator breaching system unbonded (not holding any transmitter identification) or may need to be reconfigured from a current configuration to an at hand to transmitter Unit. The bonding of a receiver to a transmitter involves turning the TX on <b>110</b>, change the ADR <b>110</b> if required <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. The RX whilst off is fitted to the TX <b>140</b> and the RX dock bar indicates bonding commencement <b>150</b>. Bond flashes 3 times on RX and CHAN and ADR are displayed on the RX <b>160</b> and the ne the RX is removed <b>170</b> and if more RX are to be <b>180</b> steps <b>110</b> to <b>170</b> are repeated for each RX, an then once bonding is done <b>190</b> the RX's are ready for deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> pertains to a flow chart showing and describing the operational steps involved for the deployment of receiver(s). The receiver(s) are activated at the operational site. The defined safe condition is with receiver switched ON which ensures that the safety gates are in their defined safe states. To deploy the receivers involves the following steps. The RZ are turned on in which the CHAN and ADR flash and then go steady after 30 seconds <b>200</b>. The EX is then connected <b>210</b> and the ARM button is double tapped <b>220</b>. The LED light flashes green and then goes steady <b>230</b> and times out after 15 seconds and deployment is then continued <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> pertains to a flow chart showing and describing the operational steps involved carrying out communications check on receivers. Note from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> a deployed receiver display times-out (goes blank) after 30 seconds. If the operator wishes to observe the receiver information display or check that RF path to the receiver is open, they carry out the communications check (Comm.s Check). Communication checks on the receiver involves having the TX on with CHAN steady and ADR flashing and the receiver deployed <b>300</b>. Then a check on if the RX ADR number is displayed is carried out <b>310</b>. If it is not then it is corrected so that it is <b>320</b>. Upon the ADR being displayed on the receiver the OK button is pressed <b>330</b> followed by the Fn button and the OK button such that the TX bar displays transmit progress <b>340</b>. The deployed receiver is then observed <b>350</b> to check <b>360</b> if the Rx LED flashes green and goes steady. If not Incorrect equipment is deployed <b>380</b>. Otherwise correct equipment is deployed <b>370</b> and operations are able to be continued <b>390</b>. Note: the superscript numeral <b>1</b> in box <b>380</b> denotes No flashing=no reception, Red Flashing, equipment failure or not Armed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> pertains to a flow chart showing and describing the operational steps involved in remote initiation firing. Individual receivers may be initiated separately provided that they have a unique ADR, or initiated groups of same ADR or all the receivers active within a set initiated with the (A)ll ADR. Remote initiation firing involves having the TX on with CHAN and ADR displayed as steady <b>400</b>. The EN button is held and Fire is pressed <b>410</b> and the RX fires <b>420</b>. The CHAN remains steady and the ADR flashes on the TX <b>430</b>. Then a check <b>440</b> is undertaken&#x2014;if no more RXs are to be fired then the firing done <b>450</b>, however if more RXs are to be fired then the required RX ADR number is displayed <b>460</b>, if not the up arrow is pressed until it is displayed <b>480</b>. If and once the required ADR number is displayed OK is pressed and the CHAN and ADR are displayed as steady <b>470</b>, then steps <b>410</b> to <b>440</b> are repeated. Note: the superscript numeral <b>1</b> in box <b>460</b> includes &#x201c;A&#x201d; for ALL receivers.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> pertains to a flow chart showing and describing the operational steps involved in manual firing whereby the receiver is docked to a transmitter Manual firing initiation in high electro-magnetic fields (e.g. Radar installation) is preferred as it maybe impossible to establish a RF link from the transmitter to the receiver. In this instance the TX is activated to be on <b>500</b> and then a RX is docked <b>510</b> onto to the TX whereby Dock Bar is displayed in a steady state once docking is complete. The ARM button is then press <b>520</b> followed by the RX indicating an ARMED status <b>530</b>. The EN button is held and Fire is pressed <b>540</b> and the firing is done <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0184">The remote initiator breaching system allows maximum mobility of the user during operations. Overall size and weight is minimised to allow one Breacher to carry a set consisting of two Transmitters and ten receivers during a typical operation. The operating range of the remote initiator breaching system is 80 m (Line of Sight&#x2014;LOS). No Line of Sight (NLOS) operating range will be dependant upon factors such the building/, structure, geographical location, etc, and will be generally be less than LOS. The transmitter is expected to have a life expectancy in the field of 3 years and a shelf life of 5 years when packaged. The receiver shall only have a life of one use and a shelf life of 5 years when packaged. The remote initiator breaching system is designed to be operated with or with gloves.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0185">Channel selection of the remote initiator breaching system includes the capability to select any of 16 operating frequency channels. Collocated systems can therefore be set to different channels, i.e. different frequencies, to prevent mutual interference. The communication code structure allows guaranteed uniqueness of code different system sets and allows guaranteed uniqueness of code for different receiver addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0186">The delay from the initiation of a firing command from the transmitter keypad to appearance of a firing spark on the receiver shock tube interface is not more than 0.5 sec. The remote initiator breaching system is capable of firing ten addresses consecutively with a maximum interval period of &#x3c;4 seconds between each firing command.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0187">The remote initiator breaching system operates in the frequency range 868.7-869.2 MHz and the channel spacing is 12.5 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0188">The firing code includes sufficient data to allow a designated transmitter to fire one or more designated receivers without any possibility of confusion or misinterpretation. A Firing Code Protection recognises the high probability of bit errors in a radio environment such that the firing code includes protection bytes to prevent one or more corrupted bits from misinterpretation leading to a firing event in a receiver other than the targeted receiver. The firing code includes a segment of information which only the primary controller can generate/interpret and a further segment of information which only the secondary controller can generate/interpret. If a controller attempts to interpret the segment for the other the error check sequence shall fail. The structure of the firing code is distinct so that a transmission for any other purpose cannot be confused as a firing code event if that code is corrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0189">The Transmitter is capable of transmitting a firing code at a selected frequency/channel. The initiation of a firing code transmission must require the operation of two keys (Enable and Fire). At power-on the display activates all display segments and illuminate the LEDs for a period of 1.5 s and blank the display for 0.5 s before displaying actual status on the display. The Transmitter has the capability of being set to one of 16 channels, where each channel is associated with a particular frequency band. Once selected, another step can be used for the channel setting to be locked in. To change the channel setting requires a deliberate, e.g. two button process, to minimise the possibility of changing the channel by accident. The transmitter has capability of selecting one of 10 addresses. Once selected, another step shall be used for the address setting to be locked in. Once a transmitter is configured, the configuration settings will not be affected by on/off switching or changing the battery. Once the transmitter is configured by setting the channel and address, this information together with a unique transmitter pair identification code, is made available to be transferred to the receiver. The transfer of information is done through direct electrical connection between RX and TX. The transmitter housing is made from suitable moulded plastic, allowing mass production processing and suitably robust to withstand typical operational handling. A bonding/mounting interface on the transmitter allows for electrical contact between TX and RX to transfer configuration data and allows to positively locate the receiver on the transmitter during bonding. The housing of the transmitter is a fully sealed enclosure to withstand environmental conditions. The battery compartment within the transmitter is constructed and adapted to allow the battery to be easily replaced and to prevent internal interference to the unit during battery replacement. When fitted with a new battery, the transmitter is able to comfortable perform the following sequence without battery replacement:

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0194">The transmitter has a capability to detect specific safety related hardware failures and take appropriate action to identify and report the failure, and to place the transmitter in a safe and non-functional state in the event that a failure is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0195">The receiver is light, small and easy to handle during breaching operations. In most operations it is able to be placed in close proximity to the explosive charge and as a result is a disposable unit. The configuration of the receiver is by the transmitter and this setting ensures that the receiver only responds to this uniquely associated transmitter pair. The receiver is capable of interrogating a firing command and initiating a firing sequence, but only in response to a command from the uniquely associated transmitter. Once the unit has been powered up, the arming sequence is initiated by a dedicated button. The receiver shall generate the required signal (energy/spark) to reliably initiate a shock tube on receiving an appropriate firing command. The receiver displays its configuration data, channel and address while in the On position. When placed on a live transmitter in the bonding position, the receiver activates the transfer of configuration data from TX to RX and a suitable indication confirms the successful transfer of configuration data. On power-on the display activates all segments and illuminate the LEDs for a period of 1.5 s and blank the display for 0.5 s before displaying actual status and configuration. The supplement LEDS provide status reports as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0200">Once a receiver is configured through bonding, the configuration settings are retained, even with battery removed. The display is able to be reset to default through zeroising. The receiver housing is made from moulded plastic that is suitably robust to withstand operational handling. The receiver housing is a fully sealed enclosure to withstand environmental conditions. A bonding/mounting interface on the receiver allows for electrical contact between TX and RX to transfer configuration data and positive positioning on the transmitter. The receiver has a mechanical interface for clipping onto a shock tube, at any position along the length of the shock tube, and to induce a spark to reliably initiate the shock tube. The shock tube interface provides for two diameters of shock tube, 2 mm and 3 mm. The battery compartment receiver is constructed to allow for easy battery removal and replacement, and to prevent internal interference/contamination to the unit during battery replacement.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0208">The receive function of the receiver is inactive at switch-on and is only activated during the bonding process. The frequency shall be set during bonding. The communication signal occupies a bandwidth not exceeding 12.5 kHz. The receive sensitivity of the receiver in conjunction with the transmitter output power, ensures that the required LOS and NLOS communications distances are able to be achieved. The receiver has a capability to detect specific safety related hardware failures and take appropriate action to identify and report the failure, and to place the receiver in a safe but non-function state in the event that a failure is detected. Dual safety timers with independent timing sources are included in the receiver to prevent arming of the receiver until a fixed time has elapsed from the initiation of arming. If the two safety timers do not time out within a specified time of each other the receiver indicates an error and does not proceed to its armed state. The safety timers include timing sources which are independent of each other. The firing capacitor within the receiver discharges any remaining voltage therein within 30 seconds of power-down and on voltage exists over the firing capacitor prior to charging. If the charge voltage is not reached, or if it exceeds specification, the receiver is programmed to place itself in a safe state in a controlled manner. During supply start-up and shutdown the receiver maintains all safety sensitive signals in a safe state.</p>
