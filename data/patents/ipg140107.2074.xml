<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.c &#xa7;119 from China Patent Application No. 201010138327.7, filed on Apr. 2, 2010, in the China Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This application is related to commonly-assigned applications entitled, &#x201c;METHOD FOR MAKING CARBON NANOTUBE FILM,&#x201d; filed on Nov. 23, 2010, and application Ser. No. 12/952,402 [now U.S. Pat. No. 8,431,066]; and &#x201c;CARBON NANOTUBE ARRAY STRUCTURE AND METHOD FOR MAKING THE SAME&#x201d;, filed on Oct. 29, 2010, and application Ser. No. 12/915,263.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a method for making carbon nanotube film.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Carbon nanotubes are hollow tubular structures having excellent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Their unique properties make carbon nanotubes ideal candidates for potential applications in different fields. However, the carbon nanotubes with a nanoscale dimension are difficult to process. Attempts to fabricate a carbon nanotube structure with a macroscale dimension for easy processing include fabricating the carbon nanotube structure into wire shapes, film shapes, or other macroscopic shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, a carbon nanotube film has been fabricated by pressing a carbon nanotube array using a pressing device disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 7,641,885 B2 to Liu et al. The carbon nanotube film is a free-standing structure and includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes attracted to each other by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Thus, the carbon nanotube film has good mechanical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the size of the carbon nanotube film formed by directly pressing the carbon nanotube array is restricted by the size of the carbon nanotube array. During the growth of the carbon nanotube array using a CVD method, the inner gas pressure of the tube furnace is less than the atmospheric pressure outside the tube furnace. Therefore, the sidewall of the tube furnace must bear an inward pressure difference applied thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the tube furnace with a diameter of about 10 inches and a length of about 2 meters has the inner gas pressure of about 10 torrs, the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the tube furnace is about 50,000 Newton. However, if the diameter of the tube furnace is increased to 40 inches, the pressure difference could reach about 200,000 Newton. Further, as the diameter of the tube furnace increases, the curvature of the sidewall of the tube furnace decreases, thus weakening the support of the sidewall and potentially causing damage to the tube furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the tube furnace with a larger diameter can not be achieved. The conventional tube furnace for growing the carbon nanotube array has a diameter of about 10 inches. Therefore, a substrate disposed inside the tube furnace should have a diameter less than 10 inches, such as 8-inches. An original carbon nanotube film formed by directly pressing the carbon nanotube array grown on the 8-inch substrate has a diameter restricted to at most 8 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a method for making a carbon nanotube film having a relatively large size.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an embodiment of a method for making a carbon nanotube film includes steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">S<b>0</b>, providing a bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> having a curved surface; S<b>1</b>, fabricating a carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> on the curved surface;</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">S<b>2</b>, at least partially unbending the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b>, thereby at least partially unbending the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">S<b>3</b>, pressing the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> by a pressing device <b>106</b>, thereby forming a carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In step S<b>1</b>, the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> can be grown on the curved surface of the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> by using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is a super aligned carbon nanotube array. The method for making the super aligned carbon nanotube array includes sub-steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">S<b>11</b>, applying a catalyst layer on at least one curved surface;</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">S<b>12</b>, heating the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> with the catalyst layer at a temperature in an approximate range from about 500&#xb0; C. to about 900&#xb0; C. (e.g. 740&#xb0; C.) in a furnace with a protective gas therein; and</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">S<b>13</b>, supplying a carbon source gas into the furnace for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes and growing the super-aligned carbon nanotube array on the at least one curved surface of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In step S<b>11</b>, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be made of a heat-resistant material, has a planar shape, and can be bent to support the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The flexible substrate <b>104</b> can endure the temperature for growing the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. A melting point of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is greater than a growing temperature of the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the melting point of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is greater than about 500&#xb0; C. The flexible substrate <b>104</b> has a small thickness and has a sheet shape. Specifically, the material of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be metal, quartz, silicon, ceramic, or any combination thereof, wherein the metal can be molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), columbium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), hafnium (Hf), tungsten (W), vanadium (V), stainless steel, or any alloy thereof. Furthermore, a thickness of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be set to ensure that the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be bent without fracture. The smaller the thickness of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, the more the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be bent. If the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is made of metal or alloy, the thickness of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be less than or equal to 3 millimeters (mm) and greater than or equal to 0.005 mm. If the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is made of silicon, quartz, or ceramic, the thickness of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be less than or equal to 0.3 mm (e.g., less than or equal to 0.1 mm and greater than or equal to 1 micrometer (&#x3bc;m)). In one embodiment, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is a quartz slice with a thickness of about 50 &#x3bc;m, and has at least one smooth curved surface.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The flexible substrate <b>104</b> is flexible and can be bent into different shapes such as a tubular shape, a helix shape, or a &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape. Specifically, the at least one curved surface of the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be a surface generated by a straight line with a certain length intersecting and moving along a curve, i.e., the directrix, while remaining substantially parallel to a fixed straight line that is not on or parallel to the plane of the directrix. For example, if the directrix is round, the curved surface is a cylindrical surface, and if the directrix is a helical line, the curved surface is a helical surface. In one embodiment, the curved surface is a helical surface, namely, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is bent into a helical shape. The helical shaped flexible substrate <b>104</b> defines a helical shaped space <b>108</b>. A width of the space <b>108</b> should be larger than a height of the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the catalyst layer can be formed on the flexible substrate <b>104</b> before or after bending the flexible substrate <b>104</b>. A material of the catalyst layer can be iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), or any alloy thereof. The catalyst layer can be formed by thermochemical deposition, electron beam deposition, magnetron sputtering, or evaporation. The thickness of the catalyst layer is determined by actual needs and can be in a range from about 1 nanometer (nm) to about 50 nm. The catalyst layer can be formed on two opposite surfaces of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> for forming two carbon nanotube arrays <b>102</b> thereon. In one embodiment, the catalyst layer is formed on a surface of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, and the catalyst layer is a Fe layer with a thickness of about 5 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> with the catalyst layer is annealed at a temperature in a range from about 300&#xb0; C. to about 900&#xb0; C. (e.g., 700&#xb0; C.) in air for about 30 minutes to about 90 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step S<b>12</b>, when the furnace is a quartz tube furnace and the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is bent into a tubular shape or a helical shape, the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be disposed in the tube furnace with the axis of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> substantially parallel to the axis of the tube furnace. Furthermore, a bracket can be used to fix the bent shape of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> and support the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b>, thereby suspending the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> in the furnace. The structure of the bracket is not limited and should avoid obstructing the heat or the carbon source gas transmitted to the catalyst layer, so as to not influence the growth of the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. The protective gas can be at least one of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), and a noble gas.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step S<b>13</b>, the carbon source gas can be a hydrocarbon gas, such as ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes aligned along a direction substantially perpendicular to the curved surface of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>. The carbon nanotubes are substantially straight. When the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is unbent to a flat shape, the carbon nanotubes are substantially parallel to each other, and perpendicular to the unbent surface of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>. The carbon nanotubes being substantially parallel to each other means that a large number of carbon nanotubes are arranged substantially along the same direction, and a small number of the carbon nanotubes may be randomly arranged, and has a small if not negligible effect on the larger number of the carbon nanotubes. In addition, the carbon nanotubes do not need to be exactly perpendicular to the surface of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, but substantially perpendicular. The carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is substantially pure, and a van der Waals attractive force exists between the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> can be disorderly aligned, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> has a large distribution density with van der Waals attractive force between the carbon nanotubes, and the carbon nanotubes can be curled.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is difficult to process step S<b>3</b> if the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is bent. Thus, after being removed from the furnace, the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> grown on the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> is first unbent in step S<b>2</b> before step S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In step S<b>2</b>, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is unbent to form the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is unbent into a flat shape, and correspondingly, the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is unbent into a flat shape.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step S<b>3</b>, the pressing device <b>106</b> can be a pressure head such as a pressing roller or plate. The pressure head has at least one surface used to contact and press the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the pressure head has a smooth surface. The surface of the pressure head can be a flat surface or a cylindrical surface. If the surface of the pressure head is a flat surface, the pressure head can apply a pressure on the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> along a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the unbent flexible substrate <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> are slanted along different directions, thereby forming an isotropic carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> including a plurality of carbon nanotubes aligned along different directions. If the surface of the pressure head is a cylindrical surface, the pressure head can be continuously rolled along a direction on the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>, thereby pressing the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> along the same direction. Accordingly, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> are slanted along the same direction, thereby forming an anisotropic carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> including a plurality of carbon nanotubes aligned along the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The steps S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> can be executed simultaneously. First, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is partially unbent, thereby partially unbending the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. Second, the partially unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is pressed using the pressing device <b>106</b>. Third, the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> on which the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is not pressed is continuously unbent during the pressing of the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>, thereby continuously supplying the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> and continuously pressing the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> to continuously form the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment, the steps S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> can be separately executed. First, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is entirely unbent, thereby entirely unbending the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. Next, the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is continuously pressed by the pressing device, thereby forming the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the steps S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> are executed simultaneously. The executing process includes the following steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(a) providing a fixing device, an unbending tool, and a support <b>122</b>, fixing one end of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> by using the fixing device, and disposing the support <b>122</b> at one side of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(b) clamping a free end of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> using the unbending tool, and drawing the flexible substrate <b>104</b> toward to the support <b>122</b>, thereby partially unbending the flexible substrate <b>104</b> to partially unbend the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(c) disposing the unbent flexible substrate <b>104</b> on the support <b>122</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(d) pressing the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> on the unbent flexible substrate <b>104</b> disposed on the support <b>122</b> by using the pressure head.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step (a), the fixing device includes two opposite groove fixtures <b>120</b> defining at least one groove, and a fixing bracket for supporting and fixing the two groove fixtures <b>120</b>. The two groove fixtures <b>120</b> are spaced from each other. The shape of each of the two groove fixtures <b>120</b> is not limited and can be set according to the shape of the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b>. Specifically, the shape of the cross section of the groove fixture <b>120</b> is similar to the shape of the cross section of the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the cross section of the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> is helical in shape. Correspondingly, the groove fixtures <b>120</b> defines a helical groove that accommodates the end of the helical shaped flexible substrate <b>104</b>. Specifically, two ends of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> along an axis of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> are movably disposed in the helical grooves of the groove fixture <b>120</b>. Accordingly, the two ends of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> are fixed in the two groove fixtures <b>120</b>, and the middle portion of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is suspended.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In step (b), the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is gradually pulled out from the groove fixtures <b>120</b> along the helical path of the helical groove by the unbending tool. Accordingly, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> and the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> grown on the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is unbent.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step (d), during unbending the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> is continuously formed by pressing the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> using the pressing device <b>106</b>. Namely, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is continuously or discontinuously unbent into a flat shape, thereby continuously or discontinuously supplying the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the pressing device <b>106</b>, thereby gradually forming the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> having a large area, continuously or discontinuously presses the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is discontinuously pressed using the pressing device <b>106</b> by the steps of: (1) discontinuously and partially unbending the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, thereby discontinuously and partially unbending the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>; and (2) discontinuously pressing the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> using the pressing device, thereby forming the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step (1), the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is partially unbent, after which the unbending process of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> is stopped, and the pressing device <b>106</b> begins to press the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> are slanted under pressure, and the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> is formed. Sequentially, the pressing device <b>106</b> stops pressing the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>, and the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> is further unbent to continuously supply the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In step (2), if the pressing device <b>106</b> is the pressure head having a flat surface, the width of the flat surface of the pressure head can be greater than the width of the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. After the carbon nanotubes in the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is slanted under pressure, the pressure head is hoisted along a direction substantially perpendicular to the support <b>122</b>, and the bent flexible substrate <b>102</b> is successively unbent to supply the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> disposed on the support <b>122</b>. Sequentially, the pressure head is moved forward the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> to press the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> along a direction substantially perpendicular to the support <b>122</b>. The pressure head is repeatedly hoisted and pressed, and intermittently presses the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> disposed on the support <b>122</b>, thereby forming the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>. In addition, if the pressing device is the pressure head having a cylindrical surface, the pressure head can roll along a direction or different directions on unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>, thereby pressing the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> along a direction or different directions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is continuously pressed by using the pressing device <b>106</b> by the steps of: (I) continuously unbending the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, thereby continuously unbending the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>; and (II) continuously pressing the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> by using the pressing device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In above step (II), the pressing device <b>106</b> can be the pressure head having a cylindrical surface. First, the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is contacted by the cylindrical surface of the pressure head, and an axis direction of the cylindrical surface is the same as the width direction of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>. Second, the pressure head is continuously rolled to continuously press the unbent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>, thus the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> are gradually slanted under pressure thereby forming the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the pressure head is rolled along a direction opposite to the unbending direction of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> to press the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. Thus, the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> are slanted along the same direction. A rolling speed of the pressure head can be smaller than or equal to the unbending speed of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the process of pressing the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> and the process of unbending the bent carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> can be executed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the support <b>122</b> can have a curved surface, for example, the support <b>122</b> has a cylindrical surface similar to the surface of the pressing device <b>106</b>. The flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be clamped between the support <b>122</b> and the pressing device <b>106</b>. If the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> is grown on the two opposite surface of the flexible substrate <b>102</b>, the support <b>122</b> can be replaced by another pressing device <b>106</b>, and the two pressing devices <b>106</b> can simultaneously press the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. Specifically, the two pressing devices <b>106</b> can be rolled simultaneously along a same direction to press the carbon nanotube arrays <b>102</b> on the two opposite surfaces of the flexible substrate <b>102</b>. Thus, two carbon nanotube films <b>100</b> are formed on two opposite surfaces of the flexible substrate <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> having a great area is gradually formed with the unbending of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>. The used flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be wound on a reel <b>124</b> for saving the occupied space of the unbent flexible substrate <b>104</b>. Specifically, the used flexible substrate <b>104</b> is gradually wound on the reel <b>124</b> along with a rotation of the reel <b>124</b>. Meanwhile, the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> without the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> is gradually unbent. In addition, if the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> is only formed on a surface of the flexible substrate <b>104</b>. The other surface opposite to the surface with the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be further coated by silicon, paraffin, or Teflon, so that the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> can avoid being adhered to another surface of the flexible substrate <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, a small adhesive strength exists between the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> and the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, and the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> are attracted to each other by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Thus, the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> can peel easily off from the flexible substrate <b>104</b> without destruction, and can sustain a free-standing structure.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The area of the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> may be large. When the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b> is unbent into a flat shape, the flat flexible substrate <b>104</b> will take up a large space. Thus, the processes of unbending the flexible substrate <b>104</b>, pressing the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>, and reeling the flexible substrate <b>104</b> with the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> simultaneously can save space during formation of the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>, and only a portion of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> will be unbent during the entire pressing process.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes oriented along a preferred orientation or different preferred orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A large number of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> can be oriented along a preferred orientation, meaning that a large number of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> are arranged substantially along the same direction and parallel to the surface of the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>. A small number of the carbon nanotubes are randomly arranged in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>, and has a small if not negligible effect on the larger number of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> arranged substantially along the same direction. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> can be oriented along different preferred orientations, meaning that parts of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> are arranged substantially along the same direction, and other parts of the carbon nanotubes are arranged along other directions. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> overlap each other and are attracted to each other by van der Waals attractive force. Thus, the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> has a free-standing structure, has good flexibility, and can be bent into different shapes without fracture. The term &#x201c;free-standing structure&#x201d; means that the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> can sustain the weight of itself when it is hoisted by a portion thereof without any significant damage to its structural integrity. So, if the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> is placed between two separate supports, a portion of the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> not in contact with the two supports would be suspended between the two supports and yet maintain film structural integrity. The free-standing structure is different from a powder which would collapse if the powder is not in contact with the two supports. The free-standing structure of the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> is realized by the successive carbon nanotubes attracted to each other by van der Waals attractive force.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, an angle &#x3b1; is existed between the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> and the surface of the flexible substrate <b>104</b> with the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>. The angle &#x3b1; is greater than or equal to about 0 degrees and less than or equal to about 15 degrees. The angle &#x3b1; is related to the pressure applied on the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. The greater the pressure, the less the angle &#x3b1;. The thickness of the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> is related to the height of the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> and the pressure applied on the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>. The larger the height of the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>, the smaller the pressure, and the thicker the thickness of the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b>, and vice versa. In one embodiment, the thickness of the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> ranges from about 1 micrometer to about 1 millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Compared with the conventional rigid substrate, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be bent into a certain shape to accommodate the space of the reaction furnace. Accordingly, the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> having a large area can be grown on the bent flexible substrate <b>104</b>, and the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> having a large area can be formed. In addition, the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can be unbent into a flat shape correspondingly, the carbon nanotube array <b>102</b> grown on the flexible substrate <b>104</b> can also be unbent into a flat shape. Thus, the carbon nanotube film <b>100</b> can be easily formed by pressing the flat carbon nanotube array <b>102</b>.</p>
