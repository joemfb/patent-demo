<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO THE RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage of international application No. PCT/JP2007/072979 filed on Nov. 28, 2009, which also claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC 119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-322419 filed on Nov. 29, 2006 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-018344 filed on Jan. 29, 2007, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL HELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a wireless communication terminal and a method of controlling the same, which wireless communication terminal performs communication by a wireless communication system using a broadband and wide-area network where a base station broadcasts allocation information of downlink burst to a terminal belonging thereto by using an application having real time characteristic.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a mobile phone has a handover function for providing a user carrying the mobile phone with stable communication quality during the user moving from one place to another. Specifically, &#x201c;handover&#x201d; represents a technique which provides a user with stable communication quality by enabling, when a user performing communication by using a mobile phone in the same wireless communication network moves from a wireless zone of one base station to a wireless zone of another base station, the communication to be transferred smoothly in a relatively short processing time from one base station under connection to another base station to be connected.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result of recent progresses of wireless communication techniques, it is now possible that one wireless communication terminal has plural wireless communication devices connectable to different wireless communication networks. In a typical example of such a structure, PDA (Personal Digital Assistance), PC (Personal Computer) or a mobile phone has a first wireless communication device to be connected with a mobile phone network and a second wireless communication device to be connected with a wireless LAN station. In the handover technology, although development of techniques for allowing a mobile phone to move between base stations in a conventional single wireless communication network is in progress, handover technologies based on an environment across plural networks of different types, in a case where plural wireless communication networks of different types are present, have not been well developed yet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of handover to the same wireless network include handover between areas or sectors of a wide-area wireless network system. When a terminal moves between areas or sectors of a wide-area wireless network system, handover is normally done with respect to a base station located in a better area or sector in terms of communication. However, in a wide-area wireless network where a base station broadcasts allocation information of downlink burst to a terminal belonging thereto, it is in principle very difficult to perform satisfactory handover within the same wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As an example of handover to a wireless network of different type, there has been proposed a system using a mobile IP as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> (e.g. C. Perkins, &#x201c;IP Mobility Support (RFC2002)&#x201d;, [online], October 1996, IETF [searched on 15 Mar., 2006], internet&#x3c;URL: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2002.txt&#x3e;. The basic operations of the mobile IP are as follows.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0013">In a case in which a broadband wide-area wireless network is adopting the TDD system according to the OFDMA method, in order to ensure that a terminal can accurately receive data addressed thereto from a base station, it is necessary, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, that the base station transmits by broadcast the modification method and the coding information such as Frame Control Header FCH, Downlink Map Message DL-MAP as the allocation information of the downlink, as well as the allocation information (MAP) of the resource (subchannel) of the downlink, to all of the terminals controlled by the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">Regarding MAP, IE (information element) of each method is prepared so that MAP can address either a communication state in which a subchannel of the data region is allocated according to PUSC (partial Used SubChannelization) method or a communication state in which a subchannel of the data region is allocated according to AMC (Advanced Modulation and Coding) method. Specifically, in PUSC method, since MCS (Modulation Coding Scheme) differs depending on each user, the number of MAP IE for allocation must correspond to the number of the users. In AMC method, since MCS differs depending on each band, the number of MAP IE for allocation must correspond to the number of bands (e.g. 24 Bands). For example, in the case of 3SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access), the maximum 72 (24 Bands&#xd7;3) of MAP IE for allocation are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0015">In the IE at present (IEEE802.16e), since the allocation is rectangular and the Symbol/Subchannel number representing the starting offset and the Symbol/Subchannel number representing the range of allocation are specified respectively, the amount of information contained therein is relatively large. Further, in such an IE, since only one DIUC (Downlink Internal Usage Code) for specifying MCS can be set, the IEs of which number corresponds to the number of Bands are needed according to AMC method. However, in AMC method, the Subchannel numbers representing the starting offset value and the allocation range are fixed, respectively, and thus need not be specified. Further, the Symbol number representing the range of the AMC region is determined by AAS_DL_IE and thus need not be specified.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0016">The frame control header FCH and DL-MAP as the allocation information of the downlink, transmitted by a broadcast as described above, are transmitted by the same wavelength band between adjacent base stations. Therefore, when a terminal exists at a boundary where areas of two base stations or two sectors overlap each other, the frame control header FCH and the allocation information of the downlink DL-MAP can no longer be received in a satisfactory manner due to interference.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0017">Accordingly, when handover to another adjacent base station or another sector is carried out, the quality of communication significantly deteriorates and wireless link may be disconnected. The allocation information of the downlink DL-MAP is particularly important and it has been proposed to strengthen interference resistance by transmitting the allocation information of the downlink DL-MAP immediately before the handover continually in a repeated manner (DL-MAP Repetition) in order to facilitate smooth handover between the base stations as best as possible. Normally, DL-MAP is carried out by 4 to 6 times. However, in this case, there arises a disadvantage that the more DL-MAP Repetition results in the smaller downlink bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">In order to solve the problem in handover due to interference as described above, it has been proposed to divide subcarriers for use between cells or sectors. However, in this case, there arises a disadvantage that a bandwidth available to service extremely deteriorates.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0019">In the case of TDD systems, as compared with FDD systems, it takes 300 to 500 ms to perform handover between cells even when there is no substantial interference. Therefore, in TDD systems, use of an application sensitive to delay or jitter such as VoIP application (which will be referred to as &#x201c;VoIP&#x201d; hereinafter) is a factor of causing deterioration in communication quality such as voice break.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">In the case of a broadband wide-area wireless network according to OFDMA systems, a single area fringe is generally determined according to transmission output from a terminal, based on difference in transmission output between the base station and the terminal. Accordingly, there arises a disadvantage that the uplink communications fails, although the downlink communication is still possible, whereby communication is made impossible after all.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">In a wide-area wireless network, since a terminal performs handover to another base station by using only Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as an indicator, it cannot address handover between sectors occurring at a point where RSSI is higher than a threshold value. As is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> which plots RSSI observed when handover between sectors and handover between cells occur in a wide-area wireless network, handover between sectors occurs at higher RSSI points than handover between cells does.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a packet arrival interval in the uplink direction when handover between sectors and handover between cells occur in a wide-area wireless network, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a packet arrival interval in the downlink direction when handover between sectors and handover between cells occur in a wide-area wireless network. In both uplink and downlink directions, the packet arrival interval tends to become larger (i.e. the instant break time of communication tends to become longer) in handover between sectors, whereby communication quality is kept poor longer, which is increasingly inconvenient in handover within the conventional same wireless network in terms of communication quality. This problem occurs because a terminal is subjected to a relatively large interference from another sector for a relatively long time at a relatively high RSSI. Conventionally, a terminal uses only RSSI as an indicator to support handover to another base station.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">There has been conventionally proposed to use mobile IP to switch plural paths to a seamless state. In this case, simultaneous communication is possible only in the communication using basically a single wireless network and the system does not address simultaneous communication by plural wireless networks. Therefore, when switching (handover) to another wireless network is to be done, communication by the wireless network currently in use must be once disconnected, whereby a considerable time has to be spent for switching of communication paths and thus communication quality during communication switching is significantly deteriorated (e.g. voice break or instant power break). Further, if deterioration in downlink wireless quality is detected by a mobile node and the binding cache is renewed by binding update at a switching server after switching of the communication paths is requested with respected to the switching server, since CoA (Care of Address) is renewed, it is not possible to maintain communication by using different wireless communication networks in uplink and downlink directions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">Further, since mobile IP does not address multi-home, it is not possible to complement an insufficient bandwidth by carrying out communication using plural wireless links simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">Accordingly, in a case in which a wireless communication terminal exists at a boundary overlapped with a sector or at a boundary overlapped with an area or at an area fringe, it is desired to perform excellent communication so as to maintain wireless quality.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">Further, the conventional mobile IP described above is a technique which enables, if a terminal moves between networks in an environment where plural networks are connected to each other, communication to be performed always using the same IP address. That is, the aforementioned conventional mobile IP makes it possible to perform communication by using the same IP address basically in the domestic wireless/wire LAN and the outdoor commercial wireless LAN, respectively. The handover techniques in this case are those for performing handover by using one wireless communication device, i.e. a method of switching the uplink and the downlink simultaneously to another wireless communication network of the same type.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">As described above, since only a method of switching the uplink and the downlink simultaneously to another wireless communication network is available in the background art, there arise following problems:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0028">in some applications, due to latency required for switching thereof, communication quality may significantly deteriorate (decrease in bandwidths, temporary failure in communication etc.);</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0029">a handover system considering policies for selecting wireless communication networks (preference to service quality, preference to communication charge, preference to communication time (battery life/continuous use time) and the like) cannot be selected;</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0030">due to imbalance in link budget between the uplink and the downlink, a link coverage area of the wireless communication network is relatively small. Specifically, among the uplink and the downlink, the link having the narrower link coverage area virtually constitutes a communicable zone, whereby the wider area of the area reached by the uplink transmission and the area reached by the downlink transmission is wasted and cannot be utilized effectively; and</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0031">handover is performed, regardless of the application, although relatively large latency is generated in handover between the same wireless communication network. As a result, service quality may be significantly deteriorated.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0032">Further, as a result of recent progress in wireless communication technology, it is now possible that a single wireless communication terminal has plural wireless communication devices (communication cards) connectable to different wireless communication networks. In a typical example of such a structure, PDA, PC or a mobile phone has a first wireless communication device to be connected with a base station of a mobile phone network and a second wireless communication device to be connected with a wireless LAN station (base stations such as home wireless LAN, WiFi, WiMAX). There has been a good progress in the handover techniques for allowing a mobile phone to move between base stations in a single wireless communication network using a wireless communication device. However, there has been a strong desire for a progress in the handover technologies between systems based on an environment across plural networks of different types.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0033">Yet further, in what is called multi-mode terminal connectable to plural wireless communication networks, although such a terminal can be connected to plural wireless communication networks, bandwidths, communication charge, continuous communication time (the battery life) available to the terminal vary depending on the wireless communication network to be connected, respectively. Further, acceptable &#x201c;allowable delay in time&#x201d; and required bandwidths vary depending on the application used by a user. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to simply perform handover to a wireless network having a relatively large bandwidth or perform handover of the uplink and the downlink simultaneously to another wireless communication network, which handover is simply triggered by deterioration in the communication state at the terminal. Handover techniques considering various network environments are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0034">In view of this, an object of the present invention is to provide techniques (a wireless communication terminal and a method of controlling the same) capable of performing excellent communication so as to maintain good wireless quality at a boundary overlapped with a sector or at a boundary overlapped with an area or at an area fringe.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0035">Further, another object of the present invention is to provide techniques (a wireless communication terminal and a method of controlling the same) capable of achieving advanced handover for selecting an optimum handover system from a plural types of handover systems in a wireless communication apparatus that are connectable to plural wireless networks.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0088">Embodiments of a wireless communication terminal and a method of controlling the wireless communication terminal of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0089">&#x3c;Embodiment 1&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a structural view of a system where a wireless communication terminal according to a first embodiment of the present invention is used. In the system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, virtualization of L<b>3</b> is realized and IP mobility is established by establishing a tunnel by VPN (IPSec) <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> between MN <b>11</b> and a switching server <b>12</b>. As a result, different from mobile IP, communication can be performed between MN <b>11</b> and SS <b>12</b> by simultaneously using plural wireless communication networks. That is, communication can be performed using different wireless communication networks in the wireless up/downlinks.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0091">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, MN <b>11</b> has a unit for detecting deterioration in communication quality in the downlink wireless link and a unit for detecting silence in the uplink sound. SS <b>12</b> has a unit for detecting deterioration in communication quality in the wireless uplink and a unit for detecting silence in the downlink sound. Due to this, when MN <b>11</b> detects deterioration in communication quality in the wireless downlink, the communication path of the wireless downlink is switched to another different communication path after SS <b>12</b> detects silence in the downlink sound and then the communication path of the wireless uplink is switched to another different communication path after MN <b>11</b> detects silence in the uplink sound. As a result, deterioration in communication quality such as voice break and instant power break due to switching of the communication paths can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0092">On the other hand, when SS<b>12</b> detects deterioration in communication quality in the wireless uplink, the communication path of the wireless uplink is switched to another different communication path after MN<b>11</b> detects silence in the uplink sound and then the communication path of the wireless downlink is switched to another different communication path after SS<b>12</b> detects silence in the downlink sound. As a result, deterioration in communication quality such as voice break and instant power break due to switching of the communication paths can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0093">Further, by switching the uplink and the downlink independently to the codec which is the most suitable to the features (bandwidth, delay, jitter and the like) of the wireless up/downlink in the aforementioned switching of communication paths when silence is detected, it is possible to improve communication quality after switching of communication paths and prevent noises in switching of codec.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0094">In a case in which MN <b>11</b> has plural wireless communication units, it is not preferable to maintain all of the communication paths in a communication-on state in terms of saving a battery of MN <b>11</b>. Therefore, when deterioration in communication quality is detected by MN <b>11</b> and SS<b>12</b> as described above, there is a threshold value for each different communication path as a candidate to which switching will be carried out by the two-stage switching. As a result, by first shifting different communication units from a dormant or power-off state to a communication-on state according to a first threshold value and performing communication of predetermined control messages by MN<b>11</b> and SS<b>12</b>, it is possible to check the communication state of the communication paths as the switching candidates and determine the communication path to which switching is to be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0095">Thereafter, by performing switching to another communication path thus determined when the threshold value of deterioration in communication quality at MN <b>11</b> or SS<b>12</b> has reached a second threshold value, switching to another communication path can be realized with achieving battery saving of M<b>11</b> but without deterioration of communication quality.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of MN. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a frame format. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, &#x201c;A&#x201d; represents a frame format of a data packet on the MN side and &#x201c;B&#x201d; represents a frame format of an access control packet on the MN side. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, MN<b>11</b> has a Care-of-IP-Address interface units <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> to which communication cards <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> are connected, an access control unit <b>27</b>, a control unit <b>28</b>, a unit <b>29</b> for detecting silence in the uplink sound, a communication path selection logic unit <b>30</b>, a virtual IP address <b>31</b>, and an application <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0097">The access control unit <b>27</b>, independent of the normal data communication between MN<b>11</b> and SS<b>12</b>, controls an echo back of control packets in switching the communication interfaces and/or between MN<b>11</b> and SS<b>12</b>. An echo back is carried out in a communication path where communication is not performed at present. By monitoring packet reception intervals by MN<b>11</b> and SS<b>12</b>, respectively, a communication state is checked. The result thereof is used by the communication path selection logic unit <b>30</b> to determine to which communication path switching is to be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0098">The control unit <b>28</b> has a processing unit for matching received packets, a processing unit for analyzing wireless information, and a processing unit for analyzing received packets. The processing unit for matching received packets realizes a function of jitter buffer and matches the order of packets received from two or more mobile communication networks. In a case of a real-time application such as VoIP, the sequence number of RTP (Real-time transport protocol) is checked.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0099">The processing unit for analyzing wireless information analyzes wireless information which MN<b>11</b> received in mobile communication in a communication-on state e.g. throughput, SINR, RSSI, DRC, Tx_Power) and the analysis result is used for detecting deterioration in communication quality in the wireless downlink. The processing unit for analyzing received packets analyzes the statistic information of data packets received by MN <b>11</b> (throughput, packet loss, underrun count, overrun count). Then, in a case of a communication path currently in use for communication, the processing unit for analyzing received packets can judge whether or not the communication quality has been deteriorated. In a case of a communication path currently not in use for communication, the communication state is checked and the processing unit for analyzing received packets can judge whether or not the communication path is to be switched.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0100">The unit <b>29</b> for detecting silence in the uplink sound detects that the uplink sound is silence prior to encoding to the RTP packet of VoIP. Due to this, the uplink communication path can be switched when silence is detected therein. The communication path selection logic unit <b>30</b> makes judgment on whether or not the communication path is to be switched to another communication path and judgment on, when the communication path is to be switched to another communication path, to which communication path the switching is to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0101">Regarding the application <b>32</b> of MN<b>11</b>, IP mobility is ensured by providing the application <b>32</b> with the same IP address permanently, if a network of the mobile communication to which MN <b>11</b> is connected is changed, by using a virtual IP address <b>31</b> (hope IP address). Further, regarding different mobile communications, Care-of-IP-Address CoA corresponding to the respective mobile communications are possessed (in many cases, Care-of-IP-Address is provided from each mobile network when MN <b>11</b> is connected to the mobile communication network).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0102">At SS<b>12</b>, it can be known through which communication path the transmission was made by seeing the Care-of-IP-Address. Further, at SS <b>12</b>, IP mobility is ensured by: setting, after decapsulating capsules <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of VPN, the address of the correspondence node CN as the destination address by using the home IP address of the data packet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (this is actually a virtual IP address <b>31</b> exclusively used by the application <b>32</b> of MN <b>11</b>) as the source address; and transmitting payload to CN. Accordingly, it is possible for SS <b>12</b> to perform transmission to MN by using plural communication paths.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0103">Further, at MN<b>11</b>, it is possible to receive packets transmitted by SS <b>12</b> via a communication path different from the communication path by which MN<b>11</b> performed transmission. Since it suffices that the packets received from SS <b>12</b> are transmitted (inputted) with respect to the home IP address exclusively used by the application <b>32</b> of MN <b>11</b> in the packets which have been subjected to decapsulation of VPN, it does not matter through which communication path SS<b>12</b> has made transmission. In other words, through whichever communication path SS <b>12</b> has transmitted packets. The packets can be transmitted (inputted) to the application <b>32</b> of MN <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0104">Accordingly, at either MN <b>11</b> or SS <b>12</b>, packets received from plural communication paths, through whichever communication path these packets are received, are adapted to a frame of the same format after decapsulation of VPN. Therefore, in a case where different communication paths are used for the uplink and the downlink, communication can be maintained if only the matching of the received packets is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a functional block diagram of SS. In this functional block, following processes are carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0106">(1) MN Transmission/Reception Processing</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0107">Since a data packet transmitted from MN <b>11</b> is constituted in a tunnel mode format of IPSec as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a socket is formed according to a data program format and transmission to/reception from MN <b>11</b> is carried out. Since the access control packet is controlled by a TCP protocol, transmission/reception processing to/from MN <b>11</b> is carried out according to a format as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0108">(2) Checking the IP Address of the Transmission Side which Transmitted the Home Packets</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0109">The home IP address of a data packet transmitted from MN <b>11</b> is compared with the home IP address registered in SS <b>12</b>. The home IP address represents the virtual IP address <b>31</b> of MN <b>11</b>, which address is notified from MN <b>11</b> to SS <b>12</b> during the first initialization procedures between MN <b>11</b> and SS <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0110">(3) Processing for Matching Received Packets and Reception Processing</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0111">The jitter buffer is made to carry out the function thereof and the order of packets received from two or more mobile communication networks is matched. In a case of a real-time application such as VoIP, the sequence number of RTP is checked.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0112">(4) Statistic Processing of Received Packets and Reception Processing</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0113">Statistic information of the data packets (packet loss, throughput, underrun count, overrun count and packet arrival interval) is acquired, whereby deterioration in the uplink communication quality is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0114">(5) Control Unit</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0115">The control unit performs the overall control of SS <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0116">(6) Access Control</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0117">An access control packet transmitted from MN <b>11</b> is processed according to the control code. Table 1 shows the access control packets from MN <b>11</b> to SS <b>12</b> and Table 2 shows the access control packets from SS <b>12</b> to MN <b>11</b>. The first one bite at the front end of the payload portion represents a control code. The four bites of the access control code language include the home IP address. When an access control packet is transmitted to SS <b>12</b>, SS <b>12</b> transmits a response packet to MN <b>11</b> after performing a control processing.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram for explaining an operation of a wireless communication terminal according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each circle of solid link represents an area of each base station of a first broadband and wide-area wireless network where the base station broadcasts allocation information of downlink burst to a terminal belonging thereto by using an application having real time characteristic, and each circle of one-dotted link represents an area of each base station of a second wide-area wireless network performing a seamless handover between base stations or sectors of a base station. The boundary A overlapped with a different sector of the base station currently in use for communication is an area where the wireless state is deteriorated due to overlapping of two sectors of the first wireless network. The boundary B overlapped with an area of another base station is an area where the wireless state is deteriorated due to overlapping of areas of two base stations of the first wireless network. The air fringe C of the base station currently in use for communication, not overlapped with another sector of the base station currently in use for communication or an area of another base station, is an area where communication is not possible in the uplink but is possible in the downlink and a second wireless network is available. It should be noted that an area of the second wireless network is not limited to the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and is arranged such that all necessary areas are covered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> does not show the entire arrangement thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0143">In the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, MN <b>11</b>, in order to realize a broadband as a broadband wireless network system, not only performs communication with one wireless communication system using the first wireless network but also performs communication with another wireless communication system using the second wireless network by using the application <b>32</b> having real time characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0144">The first wireless network is set, for example, as a broadband and wide-area wireless network adopting OFDMA/TDD system such as WiMax, so that the link information such as the uplink/downlink subchannel, the modification system and the coding information is transmitted at each base station to all of the terminals belonging thereto as a broadcast message.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0145">The second wireless network is set as a wireless network performing a seamless handover between areas of base stations and sectors of a base station. Examples of such a network include CDMA2000 1x EV-DO system.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0146">The wireless information analyzing unit of MN <b>11</b> periodically measures and acquires RSSI, CIR (carrier to interference power ratio) and SNR (signal to noise ratio) and periodically measures difference in delay between the first wireless network and the second wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart of the boundary judging process at MN. In this routine, MN <b>11</b> first periodically measures and acquires RSSI, CIR and SNR during communication via the first wireless network (Step S<b>1</b>). When a cell or a sector of the first wireless network is overlapped, CIR is decreased due to interference and it is checked whether or not CIR is equal to or below the threshold value YdB (Step S<b>2</b>). In the present embodiment, it is judged whether or not CIR is continuously equal to or below YdB for a predetermined time (T4 ms interval). However, it is acceptable to judge whether or not the average of CIR in a predetermined time (T5 ms interval) is equal to or below YdB.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0148">In a case where it is judged that CIR is equal to or below YdB, since this represents detection that the interference from another sector or cell has reached an unignorable level, it is then judged whether it is deterioration of CIR due to interference by another sector or deterioration of CIR due to interference by a cell of another base station.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0149">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, deterioration in CIR due to interference by another sector occurs at relatively high RSSI, as compared with deterioration in CIR due to interference by a cell of another base station. Therefore, it is judged whether or not RSSI is continuously equal to or below X2 dB for a predetermined time (T3 ms interval) (Step S<b>3</b>). This judgment may be carried out by judging whether or not the average of RSSI in a predetermined time (T6 ms interval) is equal to or below X2 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0150">When RSSI is equal to or below X2 dB, it is judged that deterioration of CIR due to interference by another base station has occurred, i.e. MN <b>11</b> exists at the boundary B overlapped with an area of another base station (Step S<b>4</b>) and the routine is completed. In contrast, when RSSI exceeds X2 dB, it is judged that deterioration of CIR due to interference by another sector of the base station has occurred, i.e. MN <b>11</b> exists at the boundary A overlapped with another sector of the base station in use for communication (Step S<b>5</b>) and the routine is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0151">When it is judged that CIR exceeds the threshold value YdB at Step S<b>2</b>, then it is judged whether or not RSSI is continuously equal to or below X3 dBm for T1 ms (Step S<b>6</b>). In a case where RSSI is continuously equal to or below X3 dBm for T1 ms, then it is judged whether or not SNR is continuously equal to or below ZdB for T1 ms (Step S<b>7</b>). In a case where it is judged that SNR is continuously equal to or below ZdB for T1 ms, it is judged that MN <b>11</b> exists at the air fringe C (Step S<b>8</b>) and the routine is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0152">In a case where it is judged that RSSI continuously exceeds X3 dBm for T1 ms at Step S<b>6</b> or a case where it is judged that SNR continuously exceeds ZdB for T1 ms at Step S<b>7</b>, then it is judged that MN <b>11</b> does not exist at any of the boundary A, the boundary B and the air fringe C, whereby the procedure returns to Step S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0153">In a case where MN <b>11</b> exists at the boundary B, time in which communication quality is poor is relatively short, as compared with the case where MN <b>11</b> exists at the boundary A. Therefore, when an application is used which is a real-time application but can cover a communication disconnection state by a relatively large buffer such as a streaming application (which will occasionally be referred to as &#x201c;streaming&#x201d; hereinafter), handover between base stations is performed within the first wireless network system.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0154">In an application such as VoIP which does not require so broad a bandwidth but requires very high degree of real time characteristic, the service quality of the application is maintained by selecting one of: a first method of performing handover to a second wireless network as another wireless network of the same base station where handoff is smoothly carried out; and a second method of performing simultaneous communication via a first wireless network and a second wireless network and complementing an insufficient bandwidth in the first wireless network with the second wireless network. In the second method of carrying out communication by simultaneously using the first wireless network and the second wireless network, specifically, MN <b>11</b> and SS <b>12</b> transmits/receives packets by using the first wireless network as the primary path and, when a bandwidth (transfer rate) of the primary path is insufficient, the insufficient bandwidth is complemented by a slave path by using the second wireless network as the slave path. The slave path is not limited to one of networks corresponding to the second wireless network, and available plural wireless networks can be simultaneously used as the slave path.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0155">In a case of service such as VoIP which is susceptible to an influence of delay time and/or jitter and requires a relatively small bandwidth, the second wireless network suffices in terms of bandwidth. Therefore, In judging which of the first wireless network and the second wireless network is to be selected, the average difference in delay of the first wireless network and the second wireless network is considered. Specifically, in a case where the difference in delay exceeds a certain threshold value (Pms), the first method is more suitable than the second method because in this case the second method would require jitter buffer to be increased larger than the allowable level due to difference in delay between the first wireless network and the second wireless network and/or cause communication quality to deteriorate due to failure in complementing an insufficient bandwidth in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0156">In contrast, in a case where the difference in delay is equal to or below the allowable level or the threshold value (Pms), since a bandwidth required for VoIP can always be supplied from the first wireless network and the second wireless network, the second method is more suitable than the first method in terms of voice quality. However, in both cases above, the first method may be selected in terms of saving battery of the terminal or depending on the contract forms of the first and second wireless networks.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0157">In a case where MN <b>11</b> exists at the boundary A, since the poor communication-quality state continues longer than a case where MN <b>11</b> exists at the boundary B, the first method is carried out to maintain communication quality regardless of the type of the application. In a case such as streaming where the application is using a bandwidth larger than a bandwidth which can be supplied by the second wireless network, MN <b>11</b> notifies the application of CN (correspondence node, including SS <b>12</b>), of a bandwidth which can be realized. Upon this notification, CN drops the bandwidth to the notified realizable bandwidth as smoothly as possible and carries out the application.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0158">Further, in a case of a dual-direction and real-time application such as VoIP, at MN <b>11</b> and CN, codec is changed to what matches the bandwidth realizable in the second wireless network or, if codec of VBR (variable bit rate) is in use, the bit rate is changed to an appropriate bit rate, whereby communication sound quality is maintained. In a case where such a function is not loaded in CN, SS <b>12</b> negotiates with MN <b>11</b> to make changes of codec or appropriate changes in VBR. In this case, since use of SIP protocol would require a considerable time, a unique control protocol is used between SS<b>12</b> and MN <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0159">After performing handover to the second wireless network, MN <b>11</b> periodically measures CIR in the first wireless network When CIR is equal to or above QdBm (QdB&#x3e;YdB), MN <b>11</b> again performs handover to the first wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0160">In a case in which an insufficient bandwidth is complemented in order to ensure the quality of the application, it is generally assumed that an insufficient bandwidth in the second wireless network is complemented by the first wireless network. However, when a subchannel method FUSC (fully subchannelization) where available subcarriers are assigned to all of the sectors so that a user can enjoy a wide-area service is employed, since a communication state of the first wireless network significantly deteriorates at the boundary A and the boundary B due to interference, an insufficient bandwidth in the first wireless network is complemented by the second wireless, so that the quality of the application is maintained at a satisfactory level.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0161">In the present embodiment, there is carried out a third method in which only the wireless link of which communication quality has been deteriorated is switched to the second wireless network and the other link continues to be used in the first wireless network, i.e. either the uplink or the downlink is switched to the second wireless network as another wireless network of the same base station where handoff is smoothly carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0162">The air fringe C has a characteristic that the downlink communication thereof is good, while the quality of the uplink communication significantly deteriorates. Accordingly, in the case of the air fringe C, communication is performed by the second wireless network for the uplink, while communication is continued by the first wireless network for the downlink by the third method. As a result, an apparent area of the first wireless network is extended.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at first, MN <b>11</b> and SS <b>12</b> are performing communication via a wireless link of the first wireless network. When MN <b>11</b> has detected communication quality deterioration level <b>1</b> as a result of analyzing the wireless information obtained thereby (i.e. when the first threshold value, of the two threshold values, is satisfied), a process for shifting the second wireless network from a dormant or power-off state to a communication-on state is started at MN <b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0172" num="0181">Next, a method of detecting deterioration in communication quality at MN <b>11</b> will be described in detail. Examples of wireless information which can be acquired at MN <b>11</b> include RSSI, SNIR (signal to noise and interference ratio), transmission power, DRC (data rate control), DRC_Lock, throughput, and the like. A communication card such as WLAN and PHS can normally acquire only RSSI among the aforementioned wireless information. However, since the downlink band is correlated to RSSI, communication quality deterioration level can be judged by judging the RSSI level according to a certain threshold value. Further, in EV-DO, the communication quality deterioration level can be more correctly judged by using, in addition to RSSI, the wireless information such as SNIR, transmission power, DRC (data rate control) and DRC_Lock.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0182">First, in the case of EV-DO, communication quality deterioration level <b>1</b> and communication quality deterioration level <b>2</b> are judged under following conditions.

<p id="p-0178" num="0199">Next, a method of detecting deterioration in communication quality at SS<b>12</b> <b>11</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0200">At SS <b>12</b>, deterioration in quality of the uplink communication is detected by monitoring the packet intervals of the received RTP packets by using a time window corresponding to a jitter buffer used in Soft Phone and IP phone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram for explaining path switching at SS <b>12</b>. At SS <b>12</b>, when communication or conversation is started between MN <b>11</b> and CN, transmission of RTP packets is started from Seq=0 in each direction from MN <b>11</b> to CN and from CN to MN <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0201">In this method, given that the path in use for communication is a mobile communication path <b>1</b>, SS <b>12</b> receives Seq=0 of a RTP packet from MN <b>11</b> to CN (Step S<b>101</b>) and a judging timer used for judging path switching is started (Step S<b>102</b>). Next, the sequence number of RTP packets received by CN from MN <b>11</b>, as well as reception time corresponding thereto, are monitored in association with the timer (Step S<b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0202">Next, the communication path selection unit of SS <b>12</b> carries out detection of communication path deterioration level <b>1</b> every time a RTP packet is received through monitoring the sequence number and the timer. Regarding the conditions for detection, communication path deterioration level <b>1</b> is detected when any of following four conditions is met.

</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0203">When the condition of communication path deterioration level <b>1</b> is met upon receiving a RTP packet at Step S<b>104</b>, SS <b>12</b> transmits &#x201c;Detection of deterioration in communication quality&#x201d; to MN <b>11</b> and also commands MN<b>11</b> to start a process for shifting the mobile communication to be changed at MN <b>11</b>, from a dormant or power-off state to a communication-on state (Step S<b>105</b>), then returning to Step S<b>103</b>. In contrast, when the condition of communication path deterioration level <b>1</b> is not met, it is assumed that the uplink wireless path (from MN <b>11</b> to CN) currently in use for communication does not have a problem particularly, whereby the uplink wireless path continues to be used and detection of communication path deterioration level <b>2</b> is carried out (Step S<b>106</b>). Regarding the conditions for detection, communication path deterioration level <b>2</b> is detected when any of following four conditions is met.

<p id="p-0183" num="0204">Threshold value 1, Threshold value 2, Threshold value 3, Threshold value 4, N, M, K are set, for example, at 80 ms, 70 ms, 50 ms, 40 ms, 10, 3, 5, respectively. In this example, seq*20 ms is used, which applies to codec using 20 ms frame. In a case of 30 ms frame, seq*30 ms is used.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0205">When the condition of communication path deterioration level <b>2</b> is met upon receiving a RTP packet at Step S<b>107</b>, it is judged whether the mobile communication to be changed is in a communication-on state or not (Step S<b>107</b>). When the mobile communication to which change is to be made is in a communication-on state, &#x201c;Instruction to change communication paths&#x201d; is transmitted to MN <b>11</b> (Step S<b>108</b>) and the procedure returns to Step S<b>103</b>. When communication path deterioration level <b>2</b> is not detected at Step S<b>106</b> or the mobile communication to which change is to be made is not in a communication-on state, the procedure returns to Steps S<b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0206">According to the operations described above, switching of paths can be carried out by SS<b>12</b> monitoring the state of the uplink path. Due to this, for example, in a situation where the downlink wireless state is good and RTP packets received by MN <b>11</b> are arriving without problems but there is a problem in the uplink path such that uplink RTP packet jitter increases, SS <b>12</b> can start switching paths to suppress generation of voice break on the CN side.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0207">To detect communication quality deterioration level <b>1</b>, it is necessary to prepare parameters of the detection conditions and the threshold values corresponding thereto for each mobile terminal communication to be changed as shown in a table below and make judgment for each communication. This is because time required for a dormant or power-off state to be shifted to a communication-on state varies depending on each mobile body communication.</p>

<p id="p-0188" num="0209"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref> are diagrams for each explaining a relationship between arrival time and replay time of RTP packets on the Soft Phone reception side. In Soft Phone, in consideration of packet jitter in a network, a packet is subjected to buffering, with delayed time before replay, and replay is started when replay time comes. This replay time is equal to a jitter buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0210">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref>, the jitter buffer is 100 ms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows a case where all of the packets have arrived without delay. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, in Soft Phone on the reception side, replay of the first packet is started when 100 ms have passed since the arrival of the first RTP packet. All of the subsequent packets are each reproduced 100 ms after the arrival thereof. Accordingly, in the jitter buffer, replay is performed if there is delay in packet arrival.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> shows a case where the packet of sequence number <b>6</b> is delayed in the network and arrives between sequence number <b>9</b> and sequence number <b>10</b>. In this case, since the packet of sequence number <b>6</b> has arrived prior to the replay time thereof, this packet will be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0212"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> shows a case where the packet of sequence number <b>6</b> arrives between sequence number <b>12</b> and sequence number <b>13</b> due to delay.

<p id="p-0193" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a block diagram of a wireless communication terminal (MN; mobile node) according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In the wireless communication apparatus (a method of controlling the apparatus) of the present invention, the most suitable system is automatically selected according to necessity from following four handover systems, to perform handover.
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0215">Vertical synchronization system: simultaneous handover of the uplink and the downlink is performed,</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0216">Up/down asynchronous system: asynchronous (independent) handover of the uplink and the downlink is performed,</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0217">Synchronization connection bandwidth complementary system: a terminal is simultaneously connected to another wireless communication network, while connection of the terminal with one wireless communication network currently in use for communication is maintained, and handover to the another wireless communication network is performed with complementing an insufficient bandwidth, and</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0004" num="0218">In-the-same-network switching system: handover is performed from a base station or sector currently in use for connection to another base station or sector in the same wireless communication network</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0219">For example, in a case where handover is performed by the up/down asynchronous system, upon occurrence of deterioration in quality of either the uplink or downlink, only the deteriorated link is switched to another wireless communication network or, another base station. Therefore, latency required for handover is shorter than the vertical synchronization system, which is very advantageous in terms of communication quality.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0220">Further, the synchronization connection bandwidth complementary system is a method of complementing a bandwidth insufficient in one wireless communication network as the main path currently in use for communication by simultaneously performing communication with another wireless communication network. As the terminal moves to the area fringe of the main path, the ratio of communication with the another wireless communication network increases and, when the main path goes beyond the area, communication is performed 100% via the another wireless communication network (i.e. handover is completed. Therefore, if delay in the wireless network is ignored, latency required for handover is zero, in principle, which is very advantageous in terms of communication quality. However, since plural wireless communication networks are simultaneously used therein, the synchronization connection bandwidth complementary system and the up/down asynchronous system are disadvantageous, as compared with the vertical synchronization system, in terms of communication charge, communication time and power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0221">Further, in a wireless communication network where an unignorably large magnitude of latency occurs in a handover between (stations or sectors of) the same wireless communication network, as a result of handover being performed unconditionally, quality in service may significantly deteriorate. However, in the present invention, quality in service can be maintained satisfactory by performing handover to another wireless network in consideration of Policy and allowable delay time of the application. By loading a unit for defining/acquiring or notifying Policy, allowable delay time of the application and latency of handover between the same wireless network regarding handover as described above, handover which is the most suitable to the Policy and application selected by the user can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0222">Hereinafter, for convenience, the vertical synchronization system will be referred to as &#x201c;the basic handover&#x201d;, the up/down asynchronous system as &#x201c;up/down independent handover&#x201d;, the synchronization connection bandwidth complementary system as &#x201c;bandwidth complementing handover&#x201d; and the in-the-same-network switching system as &#x201c;the in-the-same-network handover&#x201d;. Further, latency at the application level by the basic handover is assumed to be Lbh[ms]. Latency at the application level in the same network handover is assumed to be Lsnw[ms].</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0223">Typical delay time (up/down) of each wireless communication network will be defined as follows:
<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0224">DNW<b>1</b>: Typical delay time of wireless communication network NW<b>1</b></li>
    <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0225">DNW<b>2</b>: Typical delay time of wireless communication network NW<b>2</b></li>
    <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0226">DNW<b>3</b>: Typical delay time of wireless communication network NW<b>3</b></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0227">Further, since delay can always be monitored in the wireless communication network currently in use for communication, the average delay time in the latest T seconds is obtained as Dcrt. In the wireless network to which handover is to be performed, actual delay can be measured by transmitting Echo command from MN to SS after establishing communication. In the present embodiment, the average delay time measured over T<b>2</b> seconds is expressed for each wireless communication network as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0228">DmNW <b>1</b>: Average delay time (return) measured in a case where the wireless network to which handover is performed is the wireless communication network NW<b>1</b></p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0229">DmNW<b>2</b>: Average delay time (return) measured in a case where the wireless network to which handover is performed is the wireless communication network NW<b>2</b></p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0230">DmNW<b>3</b>: Average delay time (return) measured in a case where the wireless network to which handover is performed is the wireless communication network NW<b>3</b></p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0231">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, The wireless communication terminal (MN) <b>11</b> has Care-of-IP Address interface units <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> to which communication cards <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> are connected, access control unit <b>130</b>, operation input unit <b>140</b>, storing unit <b>142</b>, control unit <b>150</b>, application <b>160</b>, and a virtual IP address <b>161</b>. Further, MN <b>11</b> includes communication path selection logic unit (handover system selection unit) <b>170</b>, measuring unit <b>180</b> for measuring delay time of each mobile communication, and processing unit <b>190</b> for processing bandwidth allocation transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0232">As in the first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a frame format transmitted from the wireless communication terminal MN. However, it is possible to know at Switching server SS, by referring to the Care-of-IP Address, via which communication path the transmission has been made. Further, IP mobility is ensured by: setting at Switching server, after decapsulating VPN, the address of the correspondence node CN as the destination address by using the home IP address of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (this is actually a virtual IP address exclusively used by the application of MN) as the source address; and transmitting payload to CN. Accordingly, in principle, it is possible for the switching server SS to perform transmission to MN by using plural communication paths. Further, At MN, it is possible to receive a packet transmitted by the switching server, by way of a communication path different from the communication path which MN itself used for transmission. It suffices that MN <b>11</b> transmits (inputs) a packet received from the switching server to an application on the basis of the home IP address among the decapsulated VPN packets, which IP address is exclusively used by the MN application. Therefore, it basically does not matter via which communication path the switching server made transmission. In other words, via whichever communication path a packet has been transmitted from the switching server, the packet can always be sent to the application of MN. Accordingly, at either MN or the switching server, via whichever communication path a packet is received, such packets received from plural communication paths will have a frame of the same format after decapsulation of VPN, whereby communication by using different communication paths for the uplink and downlink can be maintained if only matching of the received packets is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0233">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the access control unit <b>130</b> controls, aside from the normal data communication between MN <b>11</b> and SS <b>12</b>, switching of the communication interfaces and echo back of a control packet between MN <b>11</b> and SS <b>12</b>. The access control unit <b>130</b> includes a coverage area monitoring unit (not shown), and the communication area monitoring unit checks the communication environment by performing echo back with respect to the communication path currently not in use for communication. Further, the communication area monitoring unit checks the communication state by monitoring packet reception intervals at MN <b>11</b> and SS <b>12</b>, respectively, and the obtained results are used at the communication path selection logic unit <b>170</b> in order to determine to which communication path the switching is to be made.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0234">The control unit <b>150</b> includes a processing unit <b>151</b> for matching received packets, a processing unit <b>152</b> for analyzing wireless information, a processing unit <b>153</b> for analyzing received packets, a processing unit <b>154</b> for analyzing delay time, a processing unit <b>155</b> for analyzing Policy, an analyzing unit <b>156</b> for analyzing allowable delay time required bandwidth, a processing unit <b>157</b> for calculating a bandwidth ratio, and a handover control unit <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0235">The received packet matching processing unit <b>151</b> realizes a function of a jitter buffer and also matches the order of packets received from two or more mobile communication networks. In the case of a real-time application such as VoIP (Voice Over IP), the sequence number of RTP (Real-time transport protocol) is checked.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0236">The wireless information analysis processing unit <b>152</b> analyzes wireless information which MN <b>11</b> received in mobile communication in a communication-on state e.g. throughput, SINR, RSSI, DRC, Tx_Power) and the analysis result is used for detecting deterioration in communication quality in the wireless downlink. The received packet analysis processing unit <b>153</b> analyzes the statistic information of data packets received by MN <b>11</b> (throughput, packet loss, underrun count, overrun count). Then, in a case of a communication path currently in use for communication, the received packet analysis processing unit <b>153</b> can judge whether or not the communication quality has been deteriorated. In a case of a communication path currently not in use for communication, the received packet analysis processing unit <b>153</b> judges whether or not the communication path is to be switched, while checking the communication state (the radio propagation environment). The judgment result is passed to the communication path selection logic unit (handover system selection unit) <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0237">The operation inputting unit <b>140</b> functions as policy setting unit and is an user interface at which an user sets (or inputs/selects) Policy regarding handover. The storing unit <b>142</b> stores information thus set and the like. The poly analysis processing unit <b>155</b> is a processing unit for analyzing the Policy regarding handover inputted by the user. The each-mobile communication delay time measuring unit <b>180</b> is a processing unit for measuring delay time for each wireless communication network. The delay time analysis processing unit <b>154</b> of each wireless communication network is a processing unit for calculating difference in delay (difference in time) between two different wireless communication networks by using the average delay time of each wireless communication network which is defined in advance and the delay time measured by the each-mobile communication delay time measuring unit <b>180</b>. The allowable delay time required bandwidth analysis unit <b>156</b> is a processing unit for analyzing allowable delay time and required bandwidth notified by the application.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0238">The bandwidth ratio calculation processing unit <b>157</b> is a processing unit for calculating the bandwidth ratio when SS performs allocation transmission via plural wireless communication networks, based on the number of received packets. The bandwidth allocation transmission processing unit <b>190</b> carries out allocation transmission via plural different wireless communication networks, based on the bandwidth ratio notified by SS.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0239">MN <b>11</b> further includes a unit (not shown) for detecting silence in the uplink sound, and the silence detecting unit detects that the uplink sound is silence prior to encoding to the RTP packet of VoIP. Due to this, the uplink communication path can be switched when silence is detected therein. The communication path selection logic unit <b>170</b> makes judgment on whether or not the communication path is to be switched to another communication path and judgment on, when the communication path is to be switched to another communication path, to which communication path the switching is to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0240">Regarding the application <b>160</b> of MN <b>11</b>, IP mobility is ensured by providing the application <b>160</b> with the same IP address permanently, if a network of the mobile communication to which MN <b>11</b> is connected is changed, by using a virtual IP address <b>161</b> (hope IP address). Further, regarding different mobile communications, Care-of-IP-Address CoA corresponding to the respective mobile communications are possessed (in many cases, Care-of-IP-Address is provided from each mobile network when MN <b>11</b> is connected to the mobile communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0241">At SS<b>12</b>, it can be known through which communication path the transmission was made by seeing the Care-of-IP-Address. Further, at SS <b>12</b>, IP mobility is ensured by: setting, after decapsulating capsules <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of VPN, the address of the correspondence node CN as the destination address by using the home IP address of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (this is actually a virtual IP address <b>161</b> exclusively used by the application <b>160</b> of MN) as the source address; and transmitting payload to CN. Accordingly, it is possible for SS <b>12</b> to perform transmission to MN by using plural communication paths.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0242">Further, At MN, it is possible to receive a packet transmitted by SS <b>12</b>, by way of a communication path different from the communication path which MN itself used for transmission. It suffices that MN <b>11</b> transmits (inputs) a packet received from SS <b>12</b> to an application on the basis of the home IP address among the decapsulated VPN packets, which IP address is exclusively used by the application <b>160</b> of MN <b>11</b>. Therefore, it basically does not matter via which communication path the SS <b>12</b> made transmission. In other words, via whichever communication path a packet has been transmitted from SS <b>12</b>, the packet can always be transmitted (inputted) to the application <b>160</b> of MN <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0243">Accordingly, at either MN <b>11</b> or SS <b>12</b>, via whichever communication path a packet is received, such packets received from plural communication paths will have a frame of the same format after decapsulation of VPN, whereby communication by using different communication paths for the uplink and downlink can be maintained if only matching of the received packets is ensured.</p>

<p id="p-0221" num="0255">&#x3c;Transmission Current Value of Wireless Communication Network Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0256">Consumed electric current value during transmission at each wireless communication apparatus mainly influences the total communication time from the previous battery charge until the battery needs to be charged again, i.e. the electric current consumption. Therefore, consumed electric current value during transmission is obtained for each wireless communication apparatus as follows (respective current values I_NW<b>1</b>, I_NW<b>2</b>, I_NW<b>3</b> of wireless communication networks NW<b>1</b>, NW<b>2</b>, NW<b>3</b>). For example, current value I_NW<b>1</b> of wireless communication network NW<b>1</b> is obtained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0257">(i) In a case where the wireless communication is not a multi-carrier communication (i.e. the transmission bandwidth is constant), e.g. CDMA2000 1x EV-DO, electric current during transmission can be obtained from the transmission output power value (which value will be referred to as &#x201c;Tx_pwr&#x201d; hereinafter) and the current value consumed by reception can be ignored. Therefore, the electric current during transmission can be regarded as the current value consumed by the communication. Although the calculation method differs depending on the communication system, in the present embodiment, it is defined as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Current value during transmission=<i>f</i>(<i>Tx</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>pwr</i>).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
If the electric current during transmission cannot be expressed as a function, it may be defined as a table memorizing power values and consumed electric current values during transmission corresponding thereto (unit: 0.5 dBm). Accordingly, for example, the current value during transmission at wireless communication network NW<b>1</b> is obtained by the formula below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>I</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>NW</i>1<i>=f</i>(<i>Tx</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>pwr</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0258">(ii) In a case where the wireless communication is a multi-carrier communication (i.e. the transmission bandwidth is variable), e.g. OFDMA, electric current during transmission is determined by the two factors, i.e. the transmission output power value (Tx_pwr) and the transmission bandwidth (band of subcarrier). Given that the bandwidth during transmission is BW_Tx, it is defined that:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Consumed electric current value during transmission=<i>F</i>(<i>Tx</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>pwr,BW</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>Tx</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Accordingly, for example, the current value during transmission at wireless communication network NW<b>1</b> is obtained by the formula below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>I</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>NW</i>1=(<i>Tx</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>pwr,BW</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>Tx</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<p id="p-0226" num="0260">Regarding the basic handover and the up/down independent handover, since there exist other factors which affect consumed electric current value, such as transmission output power, transmission bandwidth or the like, it not possible to generally conclude that the basic handover requires less transmission electric current than the up/down independent handover does. Accordingly, transmission current values thereof are calculated, respectively, as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0232" num="0272"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flow chart showing an example of handover selection algorithm used in the wireless communication terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention. First, it is assumed that the wireless communication terminal is in a communication-on state in wireless communication network NW<b>1</b>. At Step S<b>21</b>, the wireless communication terminal MN monitors the communication quality of the uplink and the downlink at a predetermined cycle. Regarding the downlink, it is judged that communication quality has been deteriorated when it is known that a certain threshold condition is met as a result of check using PER (packet error), CINR, RSSI or the like. Regarding the uplink, when a certain threshold value is no longer met due to variation in PER, delay, jitter or the like of IP packets in the switching server (SS), the wireless communication terminal is notified that the communication quality has been deteriorated. At Step S<b>22</b>, it is judged whether or not communication quality has been deteriorated in either the uplink or the downlink. In a case where communication quality has been deteriorated, Step S<b>23</b> is executed, while in a case where communication quality has not been deteriorated, the procedure returns to Step S<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0273">At step <b>23</b>, it is judged whether another wireless communication network NW<b>2</b> is available or not.

At Step <b>24</b>, it is judged whether or not the conditions for the handover between (stations or sectors of) the same wireless network are met. If the conditions for the handover between the same wireless network are met, the procedure goes to Step S<b>25</b>. If not, Step S<b>26</b> is executed. At Step S<b>25</b>, it is judged whether or not latency (Lsnw: a preset value) at the application level in the same wireless network handover is equal to or below the allowable delay (Dap) of the application which is being executed.
