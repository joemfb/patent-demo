<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application generally relates to building structures. In particular, the present application relates to systems and methods for efficient construction of a living space during construction of a multi-unit housing structure using highly configurable and customizable building modules.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Constructing a multi-unit housing structure may be expensive and time consuming, particularly in the fitting out of each housing unit. Each housing unit may require plumbers, electricians, joiners, carpenters, and other skilled tradesmen for the installation of different fixtures. Additionally, installing these fixtures after construction of interior and exterior walls prevents this interior work from being performed concurrently with construction of the building.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Construction of a multi-unit residence or housing complex may require the services of various tradesmen, including plumbers, electricians, carpenters, plasterers, painters, and other workers in finishing the interior of each unit. Their activities need to be well coordinated, because some tasks may need to occur before others. For example, it may be more efficient and less expensive to install interior plumbing and electrical lines before drywall is installed. Furthermore, in a large multi-unit building, multiple activities may be performed concurrently to meet project deadlines, such as structural construction on a top floor, interior framing on the next floor down, electrical and plumbing work on the next floor, drywall on the following floor, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When issues and complications inevitably occur during construction, from minor punch list changes to major design revisions or delays with ordering custom fixtures, a tight construction schedule will need to be changed and extended, resulting in increased costs and delay. Bathrooms, for example, require plumbing and electrical fixtures, cabinetry, different accessories such as towel racks, mirrors, lighting, and other features. Minor errors or design changes may be present in any of these, and as a result, bathrooms usually end up with the largest number of construction punch list items to be addressed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One way to reduce the effects of these complications is to reduce flexibility and customization of individual units: if every unit is identical, then it's easier to maintain consistent quality and bulk-order materials. However, this may reduce the marketability of individual units or disappoint potential buyers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present application describes prefabricated building modules that may be constructed and outfitted on or off-site, and placed within a unit during construction. A building module may be created of various materials, and may contain both an interior finished space, and exterior finished surfaces. For example, the interior of a building module may be configured as a bathroom, with a tile floor and walls, a toilet, a shower and/or bath, a sink, a mirror or mirrors, electrical outlets and light switches, ventilation and heating, and other features.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Any of the exterior walls of the module may be used to define or provide other types of living spaces. Using the same wiring and plumbing, one side of the exterior of the building module may include a sink, countertops and cabinetry and appliance connections for a kitchen. Another side may include electrical and cable connections for a home entertainment center. Yet another side may include closet or wardrobe space. Each side may be finished with different surfaces, responsive to the wishes of the buyer or designer. For example, the side of a module designed to determine one border of a kitchen may have a marble backsplash and plaster walls, while a different side designed to border a bedroom may have hardwood walls and an alcove for a flat screen television.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the building module is shorter in height than the ceiling of the housing unit. This allows the building module to slide or fit into the housing unit without being attached to or integrated with the ceiling or walls of the housing unit. As the building module may be mounted only to the floor of the housing unit, the building unit may be positioned or located any where within the housing unit. In some cases, the building module may be positioned centrally to any of the interior walls of the housing unit. In other cases, the building module may be positioned adjacent to or near any interior wall of the housing unit. These building modules may be designed and constructed to any dimensions desired and suitable for the housing unit. This allows great configurability, creativity and flexibility in defining the living space using this building module.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the building module may be designed and constructed to provide lighting for both the interior of the building module as well as the living space exterior to the building module. With a predetermined gap between the height of the building module and the ceiling of the housing unit, the building module may include lighting on top or near the top of the building module such that the light emanates into surrounding living space as well as the interior of the building module. For the example, light from the building module may reflect off the unit's ceiling to provide diffuse illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additionally, the building module may include sliding or extendable dividers or partitions that can be extended from the module outwardly to the walls of the housing unit to define different living space within the unit. For example, a building module may be installed near the center of a housing unit and partitions may be extended out from two adjacent faces of the building module to two adjacent walls of the housing unit to enclose a section of the housing unit, for example, a bedroom. When a resident awakes in the morning, they may slide the partitions back into the building module, opening up the space again. Thus, the partitions allow the resident to dynamically reconfigure their living space at will.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the prefabricated building modules of the present application may be slid or moved into a unit during construction. For example, the building module may be placed on a rolling platform or other mechanism, or include a rolling mechanism, and may be maneuvered into place and mounted or bolted to the floor of the unit. Plumbing and electrical hookups may be made to the module using standardized connectors. Accordingly, installation of a module into each unit may be performed quickly and inexpensively by a small number of laborers, after the designer or buyer has reviewed and confirmed the outfitting, ensuring high quality and consistency and reducing on-site issues. Additionally, because the module may be moved around prior to installation, each unit may be constructed with a customized floor plan. For example, one unit may be constructed based around a single module, while another unit may include two or three or more modules.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The modules may also be positioned differently within the unit, creating and delineating different living areas such as a bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen, or other area, through the use of movable partitions that extend from the building module to the walls of the unit for privacy and noise control. For example, in one unit, a module may be positioned in the center of the unit, so that living areas around the module are of approximately equal size, while in another unit, a module may positioned off-center. In another example, one buyer may wish to have a small bedroom and a large living room area, while another buyer may wish to have a master bedroom, a smaller second bedroom, and a small living room area. The possibility of multiple building modules being installed in a unit, either adjacent or non-adjacent, gives the buyer even more options with little-to-no additional cost of construction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Separate from physical construction of the housing unit, each building module may be outfitted with standard or custom fixtures, responsive to the buyer's wishes. For example, one building module may include a bathroom with a shower, while another may include a bath. In a further example, one bathroom may have standard plumbing fixtures, while another may have deluxe designer fixtures. Because installation of fixtures may be performed separately from construction of the building, buyers can have an increased number of customization options, and installers can ensure consistently high quality without expensive post-construction repair and replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the building modules described in the present application may provide enhanced quality control and consistency, reduce costs and time of construction and increase efficiency of labor, and create greater flexibility and customization for designers and buyers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present application is directed towards systems and methods for building a living space during construction of a housing unit, such as a multi-unit housing structure. In particular, the present application describes various embodiments of prefabricated building modules that may be built and equipped with plumbing, HVAC and/or electrical fixtures prior to installation in a multi-unit housing structure. Because modules may be configured prior to installation in a housing structure, the use of prefabricated building modules may increase efficiency of construction and provide enhanced customization over other non-configurable building units.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one aspect, the present application features a prefabricated building module, which may at times be referred to as a self-contained unit, a preconstructed building module, a service area or prefabricated living space or room.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the method includes installing the prefabricated building module service area with finished outer wall surfaces spaced apart from walls of the housing unit by a distance corresponding to a distance that a partition, in extended position, is extendable outward from a finished outer wall surface of the first module to define, with opposed surfaces of the building module and the housing unit, a further living space exterior to the building module. In a further embodiment, the module is sized, configured, and positioned in the housing unit such that the prefabricated module defines and accessorizes at least one or more living spaces from another living space.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment, the method includes providing a second living space area in the housing unit by installing a pre-constructed second module containing another area for the housing unit, such that finished outer wall surfaces of the second module are spaced apart from walls of the housing unit by a distance corresponding to a distance that a partition disposed within a wall of the second module is extendable outward from one of the finished outer wall surfaces of the second module. In a further embodiment, the method includes installing one or more surfaces extending between the first module and the second module.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, shown is a floor plan of an embodiment of a housing unit with a plurality of prefabricated building modules. Briefly, a housing unit <b>100</b> may comprise one or more prefabricated building modules <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Prefabricated building modules <b>102</b> and/or <b>104</b> may be positioned such that one or more living spaces may be defined external to the prefabricated building module, such as one or more bedrooms <b>106</b>, living room or dining rooms <b>108</b>, and a kitchen <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and in more detail, a housing unit <b>100</b> may comprise one or more walls to define the extents of a housing unit. The one or more walls may be made of any material or combination of materials suitable for building construction, including wood, concrete, drywall, brick, cinderblock, metal, plaster, and plastic. In some embodiments, the one or more walls may comprise one or more doors or entrances. In other embodiments, the one or more walls may comprise one or more windows. In some embodiments, the one or more walls may comprise electrical outlets. Although only one housing unit <b>100</b> is illustrated, a multi-unit building may comprise a plurality of adjacent housing units <b>100</b>, and may comprise one or more adjacent floors of housing units <b>100</b>. The multi-unit building may, accordingly, further comprise one or more hallways between housing units <b>100</b>, stairs, elevators, lobbies, or other building features.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, a prefabricated building module <b>102</b> and/or a building module <b>104</b> may be installed in housing unit <b>100</b>, each discussed in more detail below. A module may be referred to variously and interchangeably as a prefabricated building module, a pre-constructed building module, a building module, a service area, a module, a prefabricated living space, a prefabricated room, or any similar term. Furthermore, although referred to as prefabricated or pre-constructed, in some embodiments, the building module may be partially or fully fabricated during installation, discussed in more detail below. As shown, a building module <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may comprise prefabricated modules with one or more fixtures and/or storage spaces configured within said modules. In some embodiments, a building module <b>102</b> may comprise a bathroom and/or shower room, and may be referred to as a wet module. In some embodiments, a building module <b>104</b> may comprise a storage unit or utility room, and may be referred to as a storage module. As shown, a plurality of building modules may be installed in a unit such that the exterior surfaces of the building modules define one or more additional spaces within the housing unit <b>100</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the rightmost wall of module <b>102</b> and the bottommost wall of module <b>104</b>, along with opposing walls of the housing unit <b>100</b>, define a bedroom <b>106</b>. Similarly, the topmost wall of module <b>102</b> and the leftmost wall of module <b>104</b> define a kitchen <b>110</b>. Additional space within housing unit <b>100</b> may be further defined by the positioning of the modules <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. For example, a living room <b>108</b> may be defined responsive to the positioning of module <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In many embodiments, a building module <b>102</b> and/or building module <b>104</b> may include a predetermined type of living space, such as a bathroom or shower room, discussed above as a wet module. In other embodiments, a building module <b>102</b> and/or building module <b>104</b> may include a different predetermined type of living space, including a closet, a utility room, a bedroom, a living room, a den, an office, or a library. Accordingly, a building module <b>102</b> or building module <b>104</b> may be of sufficient length and width to include one or more of these predetermined type of living spaces. A building module may be designed and constructed for any suitably desired dimension and for any desired portion of a housing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although building modules <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are illustrated with exterior walls on all sides, in some embodiments, a building module may comprise exterior walls on fewer than all sides. For example, a building module may comprise three exterior walls with no fourth wall, such that the building module defines a non-enclosed space. In another example, a building module may comprise two adjacent exterior walls with no additional walls, such that the external space defined by the building module is combined with the internal space defined by the building module to create a contiguous space. In some embodiments, a building module may comprise walls of different heights, such as a full wall adjoining a half-wall or a three-quarters wall. In some embodiments, a building module may have one or more doors. In some embodiments, a building module may have one or more windows.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The building module may define any shape, such as a square, rectangular, half-moon, elliptical, octagon, pentagon, etc. As such, one or more of the walls may be curved and not straight walls. Any of the adjoining walls may form any degree of any angle, such as an angle between 0 and 180 degrees. Although illustrated as rectangular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in some embodiments, a building module may have three straight walls and enclose a triangular space, or have five straight walls and enclose a pentagonal space. In other embodiments, a building module may comprise more or fewer straight walls, or comprise one or more curved walls, to enclose or define a regular or irregular space. In one such embodiment, a building module may comprise one curved wall that defines or encloses an interior space. Thus, in some embodiments, a building module <b>102</b> or <b>104</b> may have one or more straight walls or one or more curved walls.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In many embodiments, a building module may include a floor and/or a ceiling attached to the one or more walls. In other embodiments, the building module may contain only a floor, only a ceiling, or neither. In many embodiments, the building module may have a height within a predetermined distance below a ceiling height of the housing unit. For example, if the ceiling of the housing unit is 10 feet above the floor of the housing unit, the building module may be less than 10 feet tall, such that there is a gap of a predetermined distance between the building module and the ceiling of the housing unit. As discussed below, this gap allows for the building module to be slid or rolled into place in the housing unit via a dolly, forklift, crane, or other means after the ceiling of the housing unit has been constructed. The predetermined distance can be in any unit of measurements, and may be inches, or may be a foot or more.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In many embodiments, the building module may include one or more lighting fixtures for illuminating the interior of the building module and/or the exterior spaces of the housing unit. For example, in one embodiment, the building module may include lighting fixtures located on the top of the one or more walls that provide direct illumination into the interior space of the module or exterior space between the module and the exterior walls of the housing unit, and/or provide indirect illumination via reflection off the ceiling of the housing unit. In other embodiments, such as where the building module includes a ceiling, the module may include internal lighting fixtures to illuminate the interior of the module, and one or more external lighting fixtures to illuminate the exterior spaces around the module via direct or indirect illumination. In some embodiments, lighting fixtures may be located on the interior and/or exterior walls of the building module, such as wall sconces. In many embodiments, the building module may include multiple fixtures such that different areas or zones of the housing unit and building module may be illuminated individually.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, another floor plan of an embodiment of a housing unit with a plurality of prefabricated building modules with extended partition elements is illustrated. As shown, modules <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, discussed below in more detail, may comprise one or more partitions <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>(referred to generally as a partition or partitions <b>112</b>).

A second bedroom may use a second prefabricated building module to define another bathroom or walk-in closet. The remaining living space may also include a prefabricated building module to define a kitchen, bathroom or utility room. In a multi-room housing unit, any combination of one or more different types of prefabricated building modules may be used to create and define the living spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart of a method of constructing a living space using one or more prefabricated building modules. Briefly, at step <b>500</b>, a housing unit may be constructed. At step <b>502</b>, a first prefabricated building module may be installed. In some embodiments, steps <b>500</b> and <b>502</b> may be repeated to create a multi-unit housing structure. In other embodiments, at step <b>504</b>, a second prefabricated building module may be installed. In these embodiments, steps <b>500</b>-<b>504</b> may be repeated to create a multi-unit housing structure.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and in more detail, at step <b>500</b>, a housing unit may be constructed. The entity responsible for establishing the housing unit may receive one or more prefabricated construction modules, such as from one or more manufacturers of such modules. For example, the owner of the housing unit may order such prefabricated construction modules and receive via shipping such modules at the site of the housing unit. In another example, the owner of the housing unit may build such modules on site at the housing unit. In yet a further example, the owner of the housing unit may order one or more components of the module and assemble and/or further build the module at the site of the housing unit or another site controlled by the owner. In some embodiments, the manufacturer of the modules and the owner of the housing unit are one in the same.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, the housing unit may be constructed with predetermined dimensions, including height, length, and width. In some embodiments, a plurality of housing units may be constructed adjacent to one another in a multi-unit building, with identical predetermined dimensions. In another embodiment, a first one or more housing units may be constructed with a first set of predetermined dimensions, and a second one or more housing units may be constructed with a second set of predetermined dimensions. For example, a first set of dimensions may define a one-bedroom housing unit, while a second set of dimensions may define a two-bedroom or luxury one-bedroom housing unit. In some embodiments, constructing a housing unit may comprise erecting and finishing walls, a floor and a ceiling, installing a door or doors, and installing a window or windows. In many embodiments using building modules described above, walls may not need to comprise electrical, HVAC, or plumbing lines, and floors and ceilings may need only an area for pass-through of connections from one housing unit to another housing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although shown as a separate step, in some embodiments, step <b>500</b> may be partially performed, steps <b>502</b> and/or <b>504</b> performed, and step <b>500</b> completed. Based on the design of the module herein, the module may be installed or deployed during any state of construction. For example, in one such embodiment, a housing unit may be partially constructed with a floor and walls, but no ceiling. A first and/or a second prefabricated building module may be placed inside the walls, for instance, with a crane. A ceiling may then be added to the housing unit to complete construction. In another embodiment, a housing unit may be constructed with floor and ceiling and three walls. A first and/or a second prefabricated building module may be placed inside the three walls and rolled, lifted or slid into position. The fourth wall may then be erected, completing construction. In a further embodiment, the fourth wall may be partially constructed, with a portion the width of a building module left open to allow the building module to be installed into the housing unit. In still other embodiments, the fourth wall may be fully constructed, but include an opening, such as one or more doors, of a width sufficient to allow a building module to be rolled or slid into the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, steps <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> may comprise installing a first and second, respectively, prefabricated building module into a housing unit. In some embodiments, installing a prefabricated building module into a housing unit may comprise providing a building module, positioning the building module within the housing unit, and connecting the building module to one or more service or utility lines, such as to any type and form of electrical, plumbing or HVAC system. In another embodiment, installing a prefabricated building module into a housing unit may comprise mechanically fixing the building module to a floor and/or ceiling of the housing unit. For example, in one such embodiment, the building module may be fixed to a sub-floor of the housing unit with a plurality of bolts. In one embodiment, a building module including a service area, such as a bathroom, may be installed into the housing unit. In another embodiment, the building module may be positioned in the housing unit such that finished outer wall surfaces of the module are spaced apart from walls of the housing unit in a manner to define, with the walls of the housing unit, limiting walls of multiple functional living spaces arranged about the prefabricated module in the housing unit. In one embodiment in which the building modules comprise an extendable partition or partitions, the building module may be positioned spaced apart from walls of the housing unit by a distance corresponding to a distance that said partition or partitions may be extended outward from one of the finished outer wall surfaces of the building module to a wall of the housing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments of the methods and systems described above, building modules may be configured prior to installation in a custom manner, responsive to desires of the architect, building owner, or housing unit owner. For example, materials for inner and outer finished surface walls of a building module may be selected on a custom basis, as well as configuration of storage alcoves, partition types, plumbing fixtures and faucets, shelving, cabinetry, and other features. In some embodiments, multiple implementations of building modules may be configured differently and installed into the same multi-unit housing structure. Because custom configuration of a building module may be performed external to the housing structure, the configuration need not delay construction. Accordingly, a housing structure may be built in a highly efficient manner, in spite of having many different configurations of building modules. Furthermore, although embodiments with two building modules are illustrated, in some embodiments, a second storage module may be installed in an adjacent manner to either a first storage module or a wet module to further define additional living spaces. Similarly, in some embodiments, a second wet module may be installed, further defining additional living spaces. Furthermore, these additional modules need not be configured in an identical manner to other modules. For example, a first wet module may include a shower, while a second wet module has a bath. Similarly, a first storage module may include a clothes washer and dryer, while a second storage module includes a refrigerator, or a water heater or furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As discussed above, in many embodiments, a building module may have a height that is less than the interior height of the unit it is to be installed into, such that the unit's floor and ceiling may be constructed and the module may be slid or rolled into the unit. In some embodiments, the building module may include wheels, while in other embodiments, the building module may be lifted via a forklift or crane. In still other embodiments, the building module may be placed on one or more dollies, rolled into place, and lowered from the dollies. Accordingly, the building module may be positioned within the unit at a location chosen by the designer or owner with great flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Although discussed above in connection with residential spaces, the building module or modules described herein may be used in non-residential spaces, such as offices. For example, a building module may be placed within a unit and the partitions and walls of the unit may serve to define one or more offices, meeting rooms, storage spaces, or any combination of residential and non-residential spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While various embodiments of the methods and systems have been described, these embodiments are exemplary and in no way limit the scope of the described methods or systems. Those having skill in the relevant art can effect changes to form and details of the described methods and systems without departing from the broadest scope of the described methods and systems. Thus, the scope of the methods and systems described herein should not be limited by any of the exemplary embodiments and should be defined in accordance with the accompanying claims and their equivalents.</p>
