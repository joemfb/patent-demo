<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0062">In the following paragraphs, some preferred embodiments of the invention will be described by way of example and not limitation. It should be understood based on this disclosure that various other modifications can be made by those in the art based on these illustrated embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0063">As shown in a block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an image processing apparatus <b>1</b> reads a document <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which has a ground pattern <b>102</b> given behind an image <b>101</b> thereon, and detects a password from information embedded in the ground pattern <b>102</b>. The image processing apparatus <b>1</b> is an image forming apparatus that is a MFP or other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0064">The image processing apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises an image reader <b>11</b>, a frame memory <b>12</b>, an information detector <b>13</b>, an operation panel <b>14</b> and a CPU <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0065">The image reader <b>11</b> reads an image on the document <b>100</b> having a ground pattern, and it is a scanner.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0066">The frame memory <b>12</b> temporarily accumulates image data read out from a document by the image reader <b>11</b>, until the CPU <b>15</b> gives permission.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0067">The information detector <b>13</b> detects information that is embedded in the ground pattern <b>102</b> given to the document <b>100</b>, about each of the pages.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0068">The operation panel <b>14</b> is used by users to perform various operations and entry, and comprises a display <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a key board <b>14</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0069">The CPU <b>15</b> controls the entire image processing apparatus <b>1</b> by executing an operation program stored in a recording medium such as a ROM not shown in Figure. For example, a password is detected from the information detected by the information detector <b>13</b>, under the control of the CPU <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0070">Further, under the control of the CPU <b>15</b>, it is judged whether or not different passwords are detected from each of the pages, and if different passwords are detected, it is judged about each of the pages whether or not these passwords are correlated to each other, and depending on the judging result, image data is permitted to be outputted without a password requested to be entered, or a screen requesting entry of a password is displayed on the display <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the operation panel <b>14</b>. If entry of a password is requested, target image data needing the password is also displayed thereon. These operations controlled by the CPU <b>15</b> as described above will be detailed later.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrating a functional configuration of the image processing apparatus <b>1</b>, which focuses on the flow of image data, RGB image data read out by the image reader <b>11</b> is inputted into a first scanner image processor <b>21</b>. The first scanner image processor <b>21</b> performs on the inputted image data, shading correction, alignment correction, chromatic aberration correction, and etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0072">The image data processed by the first scanner image processor <b>21</b> is inputted into a second scanner image processor <b>22</b>. The second scanner image processor <b>22</b> performs on the image data, resolution conversion, background elimination, area judgment, format conversion from RGB to YMCK, text edge correction, error diffusion, and etc.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0073">The image data processed by the second scanner image processor <b>22</b> is inputted into a controller <b>23</b>. The controller <b>23</b> executes compression/expansion of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0074">The image data compressed/expanded by the controller <b>23</b> is inputted into a printer image processor <b>24</b>. The printer image processor <b>24</b> performs on the image data to be printed, image correction, image merger (giving a security ground pattern), a screen process and etc., and then outputs the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0075">On the other hand, the image data processed by the first scanner image processor <b>21</b> is also inputted into a security ground pattern detector <b>25</b> that is the information detector <b>13</b>. The security ground pattern detector <b>25</b> detects the ground pattern <b>102</b> having an embedded password from the image data processed by the first scanner image processor <b>21</b>. Concretely, respective processes such as resolution conversion, pre-processing, code detection, code analysis, and etc. are performed under the control of the CPU <b>15</b>, and thereby the ground pattern <b>102</b> is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0076">Hereinafter, a procedure performed in the image processing apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to judge whether or not to permit image data to be outputted, will be explained with reference to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The procedure is executed by the CPU <b>15</b> according to an operation program stored in a recording medium such as a ROM not shown in Figure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0077">In Step S<b>01</b>, it is judged whether or not image data read out from a document by the image reader <b>11</b> includes a certain ground pattern. If a certain pattern is not detected (NO in Step S<b>01</b>), the image data is immediately permitted to be outputted in Step S<b>14</b>, since the document is a normal one not protected by security.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0078">If a certain pattern is detected (YES in Step S<b>01</b>), information embedded in the certain pattern is detected (Step S<b>02</b>), and it is judged whether or not the detected information includes a password (Step S<b>03</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0079">If there exists no password (NO in Step S<b>03</b>), the routine skips ahead to Step S<b>14</b>, and the image data is permitted to be outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0080">If there exists a password (YES in Step S<b>03</b>), it is judged whether or not all the pages are completely read (Step S<b>04</b>). If all the pages are not yet completely read (NO in Step S<b>04</b>), the routine returns to Step S<b>01</b> to repeat Steps S<b>01</b> through S<b>04</b>. If all the pages are completely read (YES in Step S<b>04</b>), the routine proceeds to Step S<b>05</b>, and it is judged about each of the pages whether or not different passwords are detected. If different passwords are detected (YES in Step S<b>05</b>), the routine proceeds to Step S<b>06</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0081">In Step S<b>06</b>, a correlation between the different passwords is checked about each of the pages.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0082">Any of the following examples can be employed as the correlation between the passwords:
<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0083">The passwords are included in information owned by data of one page of document, and related to each other.</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0084">The passwords share a certain code.</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0085">The passwords are numbers complemented by each other.</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0004" num="0086">The passwords consist of a sequence of one same number.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0087">Subsequently, it is judged in Step S<b>07</b> about each of the pages whether or not the passwords are correlated to each other. If these are correlated to each other (YES in Step S<b>07</b>), the image data of all the pages are permitted to be outputted without a password requested to be entered, in Step S<b>08</b>. Then the routine terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0088">If it is judged in Step S<b>05</b> about each of the pages that different passwords are not detected (NO in Step S<b>05</b>), or if it is judged in Step S<b>07</b> about each of the pages that the passwords are not correlated (NO in Step S<b>07</b>), then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, image data <b>20</b> read out from Page 1 of the document is displayed on the display <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the operation panel <b>14</b> in Step S<b>09</b> and a message requesting entry of a password is also displayed on the display <b>14</b><i>a </i>in Step S<b>10</b>. And thereby a password is entered.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0089">Then, it is judged in Step S<b>11</b> whether or not an appropriate password is entered, in other words, the entered password corresponds to a password given to the Page 1. If it corresponds (YES in Step S<b>11</b>), the image data is permitted to be outputted in Step S<b>12</b>, and then the routine proceeds to Step S<b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0090">If it does not correspond (NO in Step S<b>11</b>), the image data is prohibited from being outputted in Step S<b>13</b>, and then the routine proceeds to Step S<b>15</b>. In this case of copy prohibit, the image data stored in the frame memory <b>12</b> can be deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0091">In Step S<b>15</b>, it is judged whether or not there exists any following image data. If there exists any following image data (NO in Step S<b>15</b>), the routine returns to Step S<b>09</b>, and repeats Steps S<b>09</b> through S<b>15</b> until there exists no following image data. In this way, entry of a password is requested about each of the pages, then it is judged whether or not to permit image data read out therefrom to be outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0092">If it is judged whether or not the image data of all the pages are completely permitted/prohibited to be/from being outputted (YES in Step S<b>15</b>), the routine terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0093">After completing the routine, the image data permitted to be outputted are printed by a printer or other not shown in Figure.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0094">As described above in this embodiment, if it is judged about each of the pages that passwords are correlated to each other, image data of all the pages are permitted to be outputted. Thus, a user such as a right user outputs image data of all the pages by a simple operation without entering a password about each of the pages, which contributes to user conveniences.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0095">On the other hand, if it is judged about each of the pages that the passwords are not correlated to each other, entry of a password is requested about each of the pages, and if an appropriate password is entered about a certain page in response to the request, image data of that page is permitted to be outputted, which ensures higher security, since entry of a password is requested about each of the pages in this case.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0113">Hereinafter, yet another embodiment of the present invention will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0114">An image processing apparatus according to this embodiment of the present invention has the same configuration as those of the image processing apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the image reader <b>11</b> reads an image on a document placed on a document table as well as an image on a document transferred by a document transfer device.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0115">To achieve this configuration above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the image reader <b>11</b> comprises a document table <b>51</b> on which a document is placed, a shading board <b>53</b> provided under the document table <b>51</b>, a white board <b>55</b>, document transfer rollers <b>56</b> that are collectively a document transfer device, a document table <b>54</b> for reading a sliding document, which is provided in the lower location of the white board <b>55</b>, where a document transferred by the document transfer rollers <b>56</b> at a constant speed is read, and a reader <b>52</b> provided in the lower location of the document table <b>54</b> for reading a sliding document.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0116">When a first document <b>110</b> is placed (by a user) on the document table <b>51</b> for loading a document, the reader <b>52</b> reads an image on the first document <b>110</b> on the document table <b>51</b>, moving at a constant speed to the right direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in the lower location of the document table <b>51</b>. Meanwhile, when the reader <b>52</b> reads (skims) an image on a second document <b>120</b> while being transferred by the document transfer rollers <b>56</b> (a sliding document), the reader <b>52</b> keeps still right below the document table <b>54</b> for reading a sliding document, in order to do so. The shading board <b>53</b> adjusts the white level for the reader <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0117">Just like the document <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first document <b>110</b> to be placed on the document table <b>51</b> has a certain ground pattern <b>102</b> embedded therein, and a first password is embedded in the ground pattern <b>102</b>. The first document can be a card or other having a ground pattern in which a first password is embedded.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0118">Meanwhile, the second document <b>120</b> has a certain ground pattern <b>102</b> embedded therein, and a second password is embedded in the ground pattern <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0119">With the image processing apparatus according to this embodiment, the first document <b>110</b> is placed on the document table <b>51</b>, then image data is read out from the first document by the reader <b>52</b>, and then the first password is detected from the read-out data, just like with the image processing apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0120">Subsequently, image data is read out from the second document <b>120</b> transferred by the document transfer rollers <b>56</b>, by the skimming mode, and the second password is detected from the read-out data.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0121">And then, it is judged every time image data is read out from the second document, whether or not the first password and the second password are correlated to each other. If these passwords are correlated to each other, image data of the second document is immediately permitted to be outputted without a password requested to be entered by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0122">As may be understood from above, the first password is used to cancel the second password.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0123">In this embodiment, a correlation between the first password and the second password is whether or not the first password and the second password correspond to each other. However, the correlation is not limited to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0124">Hereinafter, a procedure performed in this image processing apparatus according to this embodiment, to judge whether or not to permit image data to be outputted, will be explained with reference to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The procedure is executed by the CPU <b>15</b> according to an operation program stored in a recording medium such as a ROM not shown in Figure.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0125">In Step S<b>41</b>, a first document (placed by a user) is read by the image reader <b>11</b>, and it is judged in Step S<b>42</b> whether or not image data read out therefrom includes a certain ground pattern. If a certain pattern is detected (YES in Step S<b>42</b>), a first password (Password <b>1</b>) is detected in Step S<b>43</b>, and then the routine proceeds to Step S<b>44</b>. If a certain pattern is not detected (NO in Step S<b>42</b>), the routine directly proceeds to Step S<b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0126">In Step S<b>44</b>, a second document (a sliding document) is read by the image reader <b>11</b>, and it is judged in Step S<b>45</b> whether or not image data read out therefrom includes a certain ground pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0127">If a certain pattern is not detected (NO in Step S<b>45</b>), the image data of the second document is immediately permitted to be outputted in Step S<b>55</b>, since the document is a normal one not protected by security.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0128">If a certain pattern is detected (YES in Step S<b>45</b>), information embedded in the certain pattern is detected (Step S<b>46</b>), and then it is judged whether or not the detected information includes a second password (Password <b>2</b>) (Step S<b>47</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0129">If there exists no second password (NO in Step S<b>47</b>), the routine skips ahead to Step S<b>55</b>, and the image data of the second document is permitted to be outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0130">If there exists a second password (YES in Step S<b>47</b>), the second password is detected in Step S<b>48</b>, then it is judged in Step S<b>49</b> whether or not the first password from that first document and the second password correspond to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0131">If these passwords correspond to each other (YES in Step S<b>49</b>), the image data of the second document is permitted to be outputted in Step S<b>52</b>, and then the routine proceeds to Step S<b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0132">If these passwords do not correspond to each other (NO in Step S<b>49</b>), a message requesting entry of a second password is displayed on the display <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the operation panel <b>14</b> in Step S<b>50</b>, and thereby a password is entered. At the same time, image data of the second document can be also displayed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0133">Subsequently, it is judged in Step S<b>51</b> whether or not the entered password corresponds to the second password. If it corresponds (YES in Step S<b>51</b>), the image data of the second document is permitted to be outputted in Step S<b>52</b>, and then the routine proceeds to Step S<b>53</b>. If it does not correspond (NO in Step S<b>51</b>), the image data is prohibited from being outputted in Step S<b>54</b>, and then the routine proceeds to Step S<b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0134">In Step S<b>53</b>, it is judged whether or not all the pages of second document are completely read. If all the pages are not yet completely read (NO in Step S<b>53</b>), the routine returns to Step S<b>44</b>, where a following page of second document is read and it is judged in the same manner described above whether or not to permit image data of the following page to be outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0135">If all the pages are completely read (YES in Step S<b>53</b>), the routine terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0136">After completing the routine, the image data permitted to be outputted are printed by a printer or other not shown in Figure.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0137">As described above in this embodiment, about each page of second document, a second password given thereto and a first password for cancelling a second password are compared, and if these passwords correspond (are correlated) to each other about a certain page, image data of that page is permitted to be outputted. In this way, a user such as a right user of the second document can output the second document without entering a password, which contributes to user operability.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0138">Meanwhile, if the first password and the second password do not correspond (are not correlated) to each other about a certain page, entry of a second password is requested, and if an appropriate password is entered, image data of that page is permitted to be outputted, which could prevent documents from being abusively outputted and ensures higher security.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0139">If a second document consisting of a plurality of pages each having a different second password is read, a first password is detected from each plurality of pages of first document, and it is judged in Step S<b>49</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, whether or not a second password from a certain page that is read, corresponds to any of the detected first passwords. If it corresponds to any, target image data of that page is permitted to be outputted. If it does not correspond to any, entry of a password is requested.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0140">Each explained above is one embodiment of the present invention. However, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0141">For example, in these embodiments, a certain ground pattern having information that is a password embedded therein is given to each page of document. Alternatively, a ground pattern having a password is not given to each of the pages, but an IC tag or other storing a password, or an identification mark indicating a password can be given to each of the pages.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0142">Further, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a first document is used as a medium from which a first password is detected. Alternatively, a first password is not detected therefrom by the image reader <b>11</b>, but a first password can be detected from a wireless IC tag storing the first password therein, which is given to a card or other, for example.</p>
