<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/313,409, filed Nov. 19, 2008, and also claims priority to Japanese Patent Appl. No. 2007-323382, filed Dec. 14, 2007, all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">There is a marked trend toward the higher recording density in the magnetic disk of the magnetic disk unit such as hard disk drive. An effective means of achieving the higher recording density is by decreasing equal to or below 10 nm the flying height of the magnetic head above the magnetic disk.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">One way to achieve the extremely small flying height equal to or below 10 nm is by allowing the slider of the magnetic head to come into contact with the surface of the magnetic disk, thereby establishing the reference position, and then allowing the magnetic head to float as far as the flying height equal to or below 10 nm, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-135501 (&#x201c;Patent Document 1&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">The extremely small flying height equal to or below 10 nm poses serious problems in the case of the magnetic disk having a lubricating layer formed thereon. The problems involve the sticking to the magnetic head of the lubricant constituting the lubricating layer, the movement of the lubricant resulting from pressure between the magnetic head and the magnetic disk, and the inability of the lubricant to return to its original position after its movement on the surface of the magnetic disk.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In order to avoid the foregoing problems while achieving the flying height equal to or below 10 nm, it is necessary that the lubricating layer on the magnetic disk should have mutually contradictory characteristics&#x2014;abhesion to the magnetic head, adequate flowability on the surface of the magnetic disk, and sufficient binding to the surface of the magnetic disk.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Unfortunately, any of conventional lubricating layers merely satisfies part of these requirements for abhesion, flowability, and binding. There exists no magnetic disk whose lubricating layer possess all of such characteristics.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0020">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the magnetic disk unit includes the magnetic disk mentioned above and a magnetic head to write and read information to and from the magnetic disk.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> comprises a magnetic disk <b>10</b> for information recording and a magnetic head <b>20</b> for information writing and reading to and from the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, both components being accommodated in an enclosure <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">The magnetic disk <b>10</b> is rotatably supported on a spindle motor (SPM) <b>31</b>. The magnetic head <b>20</b> is attached to that side of the forward end of a head assembly <b>21</b> which faces the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. According to this embodiment, the magnetic head <b>20</b> is designed for perpendicular magnetic recording. The head assembly <b>21</b> is slidably supported by a voice coil motor (VCM) <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">The enclosure <b>30</b> is provided with a circuit board <b>40</b>, on which are mounted a motor driver to control SPM <b>31</b> and VCM <b>22</b>, a hard disk controller (HDC) to send and receive data to and from a host computer (not shown) with which the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> is connected, a read/write channel to modulate and demodulate information written and read to and from the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, a microprocessing unit (MPU) to perform operation for information writing and reading to and from the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, and a memory to store date for processing by MPU. Incidentally, MPU is a central processing unit (CPU) and the memory is synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">The circuit board <b>40</b> and the magnetic head <b>20</b> are electrically connected with each other through a flexible cable <b>50</b>. That is, the head assembly <b>21</b> has a wiring (not shown), with one end thereof connected with the magnetic head <b>20</b> and with the other end thereof connected with one end of the flexible cable <b>50</b>. The other end of the flexible cable <b>50</b> is connected with the circuit board <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">For the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> to work, the magnetic head <b>20</b> receives data from the host computer and records and reads information corresponding to the data to and from the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">Information writing to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is accomplished as the head assembly <b>21</b> swings over the magnetic disk <b>10</b> until the magnetic head <b>20</b> is positioned at a desired track containing a sector in which the information is to be written and the magnetic head <b>20</b> generates a magnetic field in synchronism with the rotating magnetic disk <b>10</b>, thereby magnetizing the sector.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">Reading of information from the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is accomplished as the head assembly <b>21</b> swings over the magnetic disk <b>10</b> until the magnetic head <b>20</b> is positioned at a desired track containing a sector in which the information has been written and the magnetic head <b>20</b> detects the magnetic field generated by the sector in synchronism with the rotating magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">According to this embodiment, the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> is so constructed as to work by the load/unload system. That is, there exists in the enclosure <b>30</b> a ramp <b>60</b> that permits the magnetic head <b>20</b> to retract when the magnetic head <b>20</b> moves beyond the periphery of the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">After the magnetic head <b>20</b> in its load state over the magnetic disk <b>10</b> has completed writing or reading of information to or from the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, the head assembly <b>21</b> swings to move the magnetic head <b>20</b> outward (or toward P<b>2</b>) for its retraction onto the ramp <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">On the other hand, when the magnetic head <b>20</b> is in its unload state (or the magnetic head <b>20</b> is resting on the ramp <b>60</b>) and is about to start writing or reading information to or from the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, the head assembly <b>21</b> swings to move the magnetic head <b>20</b> inward (or toward P<b>1</b>) and place it on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. In alternative embodiments, the above-mentioned system may be replaced with the contact start stop (CSS) system in which the magnetic head <b>20</b> retracts to a specific position on the magnetic disk <b>10</b> in place of the ramp outside the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partly sectional view of one example of the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. The magnetic disk <b>10</b> comprises a non-magnetic substrate <b>11</b> and three layers sequentially formed thereon which include a magnetic layer <b>12</b>, a protective layer <b>13</b>, and a lubricating layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">The non-magnetic substrate <b>11</b> may be discoid and made of a non-magnetic material, such as glass and aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">The magnetic layer <b>12</b> on the non-magnetic substrate <b>11</b> is a thin film of magnetic material, such as cobalt alloy. It may be formed by sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">The protective layer <b>13</b> is on that side of the magnetic layer <b>12</b>, which is adjacent to the magnetic head <b>20</b>. It is formed from a carbon-based material, such as diamond-like carbon, by sputtering or ion beam deposition (IBD).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">The lubricating layer <b>14</b> is on that side of the protective layer <b>13</b> which is adjacent to the magnetic head <b>20</b>. It is the outermost layer to cover the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. It is formed from a lubricant (mentioned later) by dipping.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">There may be a seed layer and an underlying layer (both not shown) interposed between the non-magnetic substrate <b>11</b> and the magnetic layer <b>12</b>. In this case the non-magnetic substrate <b>11</b> is coated sequentially with a seed layer of nickel alloy, an underlying layer of chromium alloy, and the magnetic layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">The magnetic layer <b>12</b> may also comprise a lower magnetic layer, an intermediate layer, and an upper magnetic layer (all not shown). In this case the magnetic layer <b>12</b> is coated sequentially with a lower magnetic layer of cobalt alloy, an intermediate layer of ruthenium (Ru), and an upper magnetic layer of cobalt alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">The magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> mentioned above, which is provided with the magnetic disk <b>10</b> having at least the magnetic layer <b>12</b>, the protective layer <b>13</b>, and the lubricating layer <b>14</b>, permits the magnetic head <b>20</b> to float above the magnetic disk <b>10</b> with a flying height of 10 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">The magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> may be designed such that the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b> is 10 nm or smaller than 8 nm, particularly 1 to 5 nm, for the higher recording density. Incidentally, the flying height is a distance between the end (facing the magnetic disk <b>10</b>) of the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the surface (facing the magnetic head <b>20</b>) of the lubricating layer <b>14</b> formed on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">According to this embodiment, the magnetic head <b>20</b> is brought into contact with the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and then allowed to float above the magnetic disk <b>10</b> at a prescribed height (e.g., smaller than 10 nm) from the contact point.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">To be specific, the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> moves the magnetic head <b>20</b> so that the end thereof gradually approaches the magnetic disk <b>10</b> until contact between them. Contact is monitored by the float monitoring section (not shown) in the circuit board <b>40</b>, which detects special signals that appear when the magnetic head <b>20</b> vibrates.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">The float monitoring section recognizes contact between the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the magnetic disk <b>10</b> when it detects that vibration of the magnetic head <b>20</b> has increased beyond a prescribed threshold value. It also keeps the contact position as the reference position to determine the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b>. In other words, the reference position is the position at which the magnetic head <b>20</b> comes into contact with the surface of the lubricating layer <b>14</b> on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">Then, the float monitoring section causes the end of the magnetic head <b>20</b> to gradually leave the magnetic disk <b>10</b> until it reaches a position which is a prescribed distance away from the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. The magnetic head <b>20</b> is fixed at that position (or flying height). In this way the magnetic head <b>20</b> floats above the magnetic disk <b>10</b> while keeping an extremely small flying height (say, 10 nm or less) accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">The extremely small flying height for the magnetic head <b>20</b> may be achieved by applying an electric energy to the end of the magnetic head <b>20</b>, thereby thermally expanding it toward the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">The magnetic head <b>20</b> for this purpose has a heater inside the head element. Upon voltage application, the heater generates heat and expands (or projects) the end of the magnetic head <b>20</b> toward the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. The result is a decrease in flying height (or the distance between the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the magnetic disk <b>10</b>). With the applied voltage reduced, the end of the magnetic head <b>20</b> shrinks, thereby increasing the distance between the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. In this way the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> achieves accurate control of flying height as it controls the amount of projection of the magnetic head <b>20</b> by adjusting the voltage to be applied to the magnetic head <b>20</b>. This process is based on data representing the relation between the magnitude of voltage to be applied and the amount of projection of the magnetic head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">The following is a detailed description of the lubricant of the lubricating layer <b>14</b>. The lubricant comprises two ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">The first ingredient is a first perfluoropolyether compound (&#x201c;the first PFPE compound&#x201d;) represented by the formula (1) which has a weight-average molecular weight of 500 to 6000 and a dispersity smaller than 1.3.

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">If the first ingredient has a weight-average molecular weight smaller than 500, the lubricant would partly vaporize as it increases in temperature under certain operating conditions or environmental conditions of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b>. Moreover, the lubricant creeps outward or flies off due to centrifugal force produced by the magnetic disk <b>10</b> rotating at higher than 5000 rpm (revolutions per minute), which causes the lubricating layer <b>14</b> to remarkably decrease in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">By contrast, if the first ingredient has a weight-average molecular weight larger than 6000, the lubricant would have a high viscosity, which leads to poor flowability (or recoverability). It may be difficult to form a highly viscous lubricant into a uniform thin layer (about 1 nm thick) on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. This leads to incomplete coating on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">For the reasons mentioned above, the first ingredient should have a weight-average molecular weight of 500 to 6000, particularly 1000 to 4000 for the magnetic disk <b>10</b> rotating at 5000 to 15000 rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">The first PFPE compound usually contains three secondary components which are those compounds represented by the formula (1) above in which the terminal group (Rt) is represented by any of the following formulas (8) to (10). These secondary components form during production of the first PFPE compound,</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005">
<img id="EMI-C00005" he="34.63mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US08623800-20140107-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">In other words, the first ingredient may contain not only the first PFPE compound but also the following three compounds as secondary components. The first one is a compound represented by the formula (I) in which the terminal group (Rt) attaching to the main chain (Rf<sup>1</sup>) is that represented by the formula (8). The second one is a compound represented by the formula (1) in which the terminal group (Rt) attaching to the main chain (Rf1) is that represented by the formula (9). The third one is a compound represented by the formula (1) in which the terminal group (Rt) attaching to the main chain (Rf<sup>1</sup>) is that represented by the formula (10).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">The first ingredient containing these secondary components in a large amount has a broad molecular weight distribution, which is harmful to the magnetic head <b>20</b> that is to float at an extremely small flying height of 10 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056">Of the foregoing secondary compounds, the third one having a small molecular weight should be minimized, because it makes the lubricating layer <b>14</b> irregular each time the magnetic head <b>20</b> floats above the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, thereby causing the lubricant to stick easily to the magnetic head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057">The lubricant sticking to the magnetic head <b>20</b> deteriorates the read/write performance of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b>. In addition, the lubricating layer <b>14</b> which has been made irregular deteriorates the long-term reliability of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">The foregoing makes it necessary for the first ingredient to have a dispersity smaller than 1.3, particularly smaller than 1.2. The term &#x201c;dispersity&#x201d; is defined as the ratio (Mw/Mn) of the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to the number-average molecular weight (Mn).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0059">The first ingredient (100 pbw in total) should contain the first PFPE compound in an amount no less thin 80 pbw, preferably no less than 90 pbw. In other words, the amount of the first PFPE compound should be as close to 100 pbw as possible. The higher the content of the first PFPE compound in the first ingredient, the closer the characteristics of the first ingredient is to that of the first PFPE compound.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0060">The lubricant (100 pbw in total) may contain the first PFPE compound in an amount of 8 to 92 pbw. If the content of the first PFPE compound is less than 8 pbw and the content of the second PFPE compound is more than 92 pbw, the lubricating layer <b>14</b> loses its flowability due to the first PFPE compound.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0061">Insufficient flowability leads to incapability of restoring a local decrease of lubricant in the magnetic disk <b>10</b> which occurs when the magnetic head <b>20</b> floats. This impairs the long-term reliability of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0062">On the other hand, if the content of the first PFPE compound is more than 92 pbw and the content of the second PFPE compound is less than 8 pbw, the lubricating layer <b>14</b> loses its adhesion to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> due to the second PFPE compound.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0063">This reduces the durability of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> under severe environmental conditions, such as high temperatures and reduced atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0064">The first ingredient mentioned above may be prepared from any lubricant designated as Z TETRAOL GT Series available from Solvay Solexis Corp.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065">The second ingredient is a second perfluoropolyether compound (&#x201c;the second PFPE compound&#x201d;), which is characterized by a weight-average molecular weight ranging from 500 to 6000 and also by an average number ranging from 6 to 10 for hydroxyl groups contained in one molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">The second PFPE compound should have a weight-average molecular weight of 500 to 6000, preferably 1000 to 4000, for the same reasons as mentioned above for the first PFPE compound.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0067">The lubricant composed of the first and second ingredients may have (as a whole) a weight-average molecular weight of 500 to 6000, and possibly more desirably 1000 to 4000.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0068">Any lubricant containing the second PFPE compound with less than 6 hydroxyl groups in one molecule would be poor in binding to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. By contrast, any lubricant containing the second PFPE compound with more than 10 hydroxyl groups in one molecule has an excessively high polarity and hence is poor in solubility in fluorine-based solvents and in miscibility with other perfluoropolyethers. This causes troubles in processing and makes quality control difficult owing to moisture absorption. Moreover, the second PFPE compound with hydroxyl groups more than specified above tends to coagulate easily, thereby preventing the lubricant from spreading over the magnetic disk <b>10</b> into a uniformly thin layer (about 1 nm thick) as the lubricating film <b>14</b>. It is also subject to degradation by oxidation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0069">Therefore, the number of hydroxyl groups in one molecule of the second PFPE compound should be from 6 to 10, and may be between about 8 to 10.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0070">The second PFPE compound may have its hydroxyl groups in each molecule partly in the form of terminal groups or structural units represented by the formula (4) and/or (5) below. In other words, it may have terminal hydroxyl groups as well as hydroxyl groups attached to the main chain represented by the formula (4) and/or (5):</p>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0072">The second PFPE compound comprising molecules defined above, effectively prevents interaction between the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic head <b>20</b> owing to the less bulky molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0073">The structural unit represented by the formula (4) or (5) has the hydroxyl groups at least partly attached directly to the main chain of the second PFPE compound. This indicates that some hydroxyl groups exist near the straight chain. Thus the second PIPE compound binds to the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> through not only hydroxyl groups attached to its terminals but also hydroxyl groups attached to its main chain.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0074">Thus the individual molecules of the second PFPE bind to the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> in a stable manner and the individual molecules of the second PIPE binding to the surface of the magnetic disk <b>20</b> have a low physical height. This makes the lubricating layer <b>14</b> bind firmly to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and effectively reduces the thickness of the lubricating layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0075">The second PFPE compound may be a compound represented by the formula (6):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Rt-Rf<sup>1</sup>-Rf<sup>2</sup>-Rf<sup>1</sup>-Rt &#x2003;&#x2003;(6)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where, Rf<sup>1 </sup>denotes a perfluoropolyether chain represented by the formula (2), Rt denotes a terminal group represented by the formula (3) which contains part of the hydroxyl groups, and Rf<sup>2 </sup>denotes a straight chain which contains another part of the hydroxyl groups.
</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0076">In this case, too, the individual molecules of the second PFPE compound stably exist on the magnetic disk <b>10</b> while keeping a less bulky state. This effectively prevents interaction between the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0077">The molecule of the second PFPE compound has 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups, in addition to 4 hydroxyl groups in the terminal groups Rt, in the straight chain Rf2 held between the perfluoropolyether chains Rf<sup>1</sup>. Therefore, the individual molecules of the second PFPE compound stably bind to the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> through the terminal parts and central parts while keeping a physically low state.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0078">It follows that both the first PFPE compound and the second PFPE compound have in common the terminal group Rt and perfluoropolyether chain Rf<sup>1</sup>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0084">In this case, too, the second PFPE compound composed of molecules defined above effectively prevents interaction between the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic head <b>20</b> owing to the less bulky molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0085">The second ingredient mentioned above may be prepared from any lubricant designated as Z TMD series available from Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Corp.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0086">The second PFPE compound may be replaced by the first or second secondary compound mentioned above. Having 6 hydroxyl groups in each molecule, these compounds firmly bind to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and stably stay on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0087">The lubricant comprising the first and second ingredients imparts abhesiveness, binding power, and adequate flowability to the lubricating layer <b>14</b> on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0088">The magnetic head <b>20</b> is subject to deterioration in floating characteristics, which in turn adversely affects the read/write characteristics of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b>, as its flying height decreases to such an extent that it could physically contact with the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. Even though no contact occurs in such a case, the magnetic head <b>20</b> interacts with the lubricant present at the top of the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, resulting in the lubricant sticking to the magnetic head <b>20</b> or the lubricant which has once stuck to the magnetic head <b>20</b> drops on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0089">In addition, the lubricant becomes unevenly distributed on the magnetic disk <b>10</b> due to pressure fluctuation that occurs more easily at the air bearing surface as the flying height decreases, because the magnetic head <b>20</b> is so designed as to float above the magnetic disk <b>10</b> at a prescribed flying height by means of pressure against the air bearing surface (or that side of the slider of the magnetic head <b>20</b> which faces the magnetic disk <b>10</b>). The uneven distribution of the lubricating layer <b>14</b> also adversely affects the read/write characteristics of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> and the long-term reliability of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b>. Therefore, the lubricant to be used under severe conditions needs better durability and abhesiveness (to the magnetic head <b>20</b>) than before.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0090">The lubricant to meet requirements for improved performance as well as long-term reliability should also have adequate flowability or ability for restoration. This is because the lubricant becomes distributed irregularly on the magnetic disk <b>10</b> despite its strong binding force as the result of movement that occurs during use for a long period of time under varied environmental conditions (including temperature, atmospheric pressure, and vibration) under which the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> operates. The lubricant receives pressure under the magnetic head <b>20</b> floating above it and also creeps outward due to centrifugal force produced by the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0091">The lubricant should have adequate flowability so that it can restore the irregular distribution mentioned above. Without such flowability, the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> does not have high reliability. For the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> to keep high reliability even though the magnetic head <b>20</b> has a flying height as small as 10 nm or less, a lubricant is necessary that remains stable in the extremely small gap between the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. In other words, the lubricant for the magnetic disk <b>10</b> should have mutually contradictory characteristics&#x2014;ability to strongly bind to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and ability to flow adequately.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0092">With the foregoing in mind, the present inventors investigated the floating characteristics of the magnetic head <b>20</b> whose flying height is as small as 10 nm or less. It was found that it is possible to prevent the sticking of the lubricant to the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the locally irregular distribution of the lubricant on the magnetic disk <b>10</b> if the lubricant contains the first PFPE compound of high purity which binds and flows adequately to and on the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0093">It was also found that the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> retain long-term reliability under severe operating conditions with an extremely small flying height (10 nm or less) if the first ingredient (which is the first PFPE compound of high purity) is incorporated with the second PFPE compound of high polarity capable of firmly binding to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0094">This finding shows that the combination of the first and second ingredients realizes the desirable lubricant. The first ingredient has adequate flowability and adequate power of binding to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. The second ingredient has so high power of binding to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> as to stay thereon under severe operating conditions. Thus the resulting lubricant has abhesiveness to the magnetic head <b>20</b>, adequate flowability, and ability to bind to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0095">The foregoing indicates that embodiments of the present invention realize the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> which keep good reliability for a long period of time even under the operating condition that the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b> is as small as 10 nm or less. Under such operating condition, the lubricant does not stick to the magnetic head <b>20</b> but remains uniformly on the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0096">The following describes the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> by way of typical examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0097">The reference material used for comparison is commercial Z TETRAOL (from Solvay Solexis) composed mainly of the first PFPE compound. It will be referred to as &#x201c;PFPE(I)&#x201d; hereinafter. PFPE(I) has a weight-average molecular weight of 2155 and a dispersity of 1.5 and contains the first PFPE compound in an amount of 71 pbw for its total amount of 100 pbw.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0098">The lubricant that can be used as the first ingredient is Z TETRAOL GT (from Solvay Solexis) composed mainly of the first PFPE compound. It will be referred to as &#x201c;PFPE(II) hereinafter. PFPE(II) has a weight-average molecular weight of 2130 and a dispersity of 1.2 and contains the first PFPE compound in an amount of 89 pbw for its total amount of 100 pbw.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0099">The lubricant that can be used as the second ingredient is ZTMD (from Hitachi Global Storage Technologies). It will be referred to as &#x201c;PFPE(III) hereinafter. PFPE(III) is the second PFPE compound which has 8 hydroxyl groups in one molecule as represented by the formula (7). It has a weight-average molecular weight of 2661.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0100">PFPE(I), PFPE(II), and PFPE(III) are used to form the lubricating layer <b>14</b> on the magnetic disk <b>10</b> as follow. A 2.5-inch circular glass substrate is coated sequentially by sputtering with a seed film of nickel alloy, an underlying film of chromium alloy, a lower magnetic film of cobalt alloy, an intermediate film of ruthenium, and an upper magnetic film of cobalt alloy. The top layer is covered by ion beam method with a 3.5-nm thick film of diamond-like carbon (DLC). On the DLC film is formed by dipping the lubricating layer <b>14</b> composed of PFPE(I), PFPE(II), or PFPE(III), which has a uniform thickness of 1 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0101">Test for Floating</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0102">For test for floating, the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is mounted on a spin stand tester provided with the magnetic head <b>20</b> of load/unload type. The test consists of allowing the magnetic head <b>20</b> to float above the magnetic disk <b>10</b> running at 5400 rpm for 30 minutes. During the test, the magnetic head <b>20</b> is placed at a position which is 16 mm away from the center of the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0103">The magnetic head <b>20</b> is of thermally controlled type, and its flying height is kept at 2 nm. The test is carried out under the environment of normal temperature and normal humidity. Sticking of the lubricant to the magnetic head <b>20</b> is examined by observing the magnetic head <b>20</b> under an optical microscope after the test is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0104">The behavior of the lubricant on the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is evaluated by using an OSA (optical surface analyzer). The lubricating layer <b>14</b> formed on the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is subject to appreciable deformation by the magnetic head <b>20</b> passing over it. This deformation leads to minute convexes and concaves. The difference between the average thickness of the lubricating layer <b>14</b> and the maximum thickness at the highest convex is regarded as the &#x201c;maximum convex height&#x201d;, which is used as an index to show the behavior of the lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0105">Test for Restoration</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0106">For test for restoration, the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is mounted on the spin stand tester as used in test for floating. The test consists of allowing the magnetic head <b>20</b> to float above the magnetic disk <b>10</b> running at 5400 rpm for 4 hours. During the test, the magnetic head <b>20</b> is placed at a position which is 17 mm away from the center of the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0107">The magnetic head <b>20</b> is of thermally controlled type. It is pushed toward the magnetic disk <b>10</b> so that its position is kept at about 2 nm below a point at which it contacts with the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. The test is carried out under the environment of normal temperature and normal humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0108">The self-restoration of the lubricant on the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is evaluated by using an OSA. The test is completed when the magnetic head is unloaded. Immediately after the test is completed, the lubricating layer <b>14</b> is examined for the average decrease in thickness at that position of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> above which the magnetic head <b>20</b> floats. (The average decrease in thickness is an average depth of concaves measured with reference to the average thickness of the lubricating layer <b>14</b>.) The result of measurement is recorded as &#x201c;the first average decrease in thickness D<b>1</b>&#x201d;. The lubricating layer <b>14</b> is also examined for the average decrease in thickness in the same way as mentioned above 24 hours after completion of the test. The result of measurement is recorded as &#x201c;the second average decrease in thickness D<b>2</b>&#x201d;. The value calculated from D<b>2</b>/D<b>1</b>&#xd7;100 is regarded as the ratio (%) of self-restoration. This ratio indicates the ability of the lubricant to restore its uniform thickness after deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the results of the tests for floating and self-restoration. It is noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that the magnetic disk <b>10</b> with PFPE(I) gives the maximum convex height which is largest among the samples tested and also causes the lubricant to stick to the magnetic head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0110">By contrast, it is also noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that the magnetic disk <b>10</b> with PFPE(II) or PFPE(III) gives the maximum convex height which is small and does not cause the lubricant to stick to the magnetic head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0111">The result of test for self-restoration, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, indicates that PFPE(II) gives a higher ratio of restoration than PFPE(I) and PFPE(III), and PFPE(I) gives a higher ratio of restoration than PFPE(III).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0112">As mentioned above, PFPE(II) produces good results in both the test for floating and the test for self-restoration. By contrast, PFPE(III) produces good results in the test for floating but does not produce good results in the test for self-restoration. In addition, PFPE(I) is inferior in characteristic properties to either PFPE(II) or PFPE(III).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0113">Here, the major component of PFPE(I) and PFPE(II) is the first PFPE compound. The difference between them is the content of the first PFPE compound or the content of secondary components other than the major component. This difference may be attributable to the results of test mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0114">In fact, PFPE(I) contains about 10 wt % of the first and second secondary compounds (in total) and about 10 wt % of the third secondary compound, with the remainder (about 80 wt %) being the first PFPE.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0115">The test result of PFPE(I) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> indicates that the lubricating layer <b>14</b> composed of PFPE(I) readily flows to become irregular in thickness and also readily sticks to the magnetic head <b>20</b> when the magnetic disk is run under the condition that the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b> is as small as 10 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0116">The foregoing results may be attributable to the third secondary compound present in PFPE(I). That is, the third secondary compound has a smaller molecular weight than the first PFPE compound as the major ingredient. In addition, having only 2 hydroxyl groups in one molecule, it does not firmly bind to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0117">This is a probable reason that PFPE(I) flows on the surface of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> more easily than necessary, which leads to remarkable increase in the maximum convex height and easy adhesion to the magnetic head <b>20</b> which are observed in the test for floating.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0118">On the other hand, analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicates that PFPE(II) contains only about 5 wt % of the third secondary compound. This content is about one half that of PFPE(I). Consequently, PFPE(II) is less flowable than PFPE(I), and this is a probable reason for no sticking to the magnetic head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0119">PFPE(I) contains the first and second secondary compounds more than PFPE(II). Having 6 hydroxyl groups and high polarity, these secondary compounds bind to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> more firmly than the first PFPE compound.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0120">Therefore, PFPE(I) binds to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> more firmly than PFPE(II). This is a probable reason that as compared with the lubricating film <b>14</b> composed of PFPE(II), the lubricating film <b>14</b> composed of PFPE(I) keeps its irregular state more easily and is poorer in self-restoration once it has become irregular.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0121">The foregoing suggests that the lubricant to be applied to the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> which runs under the severe condition that the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b> is as small as 10 nm or less should not contain any component which has a low molecular weight, contains a small number of hydroxyl groups in one molecule, and is incapable of binding to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0122">It was also found that PFPE(II) containing a less amount of secondary components and the first PFPE compound of high purity has good abhesiveness (properties of non-sticking to the magnetic head <b>20</b>) and adequate flowability to minimize the height of the maximum convex and to achieve good self-restoration.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0123">On the other hand, it was found that owing to the second PFPE compound, which has 8 hydroxyl groups and hence firmly binds to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>, PFPE(III) is poor in self-restoration but is comparable to PFPE(II) in the height of the maximum convex and has good abhesiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0124">Vacuum Test</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0125">The same magnetic disks <b>10</b> as those used for float test and restoration test mentioned above are prepared. Each of them has the lubricating layer <b>14</b> composed of PFPE(I), PFPE(II), or PFPE(III). They are used to construct six each of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> differing in lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0126">The magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> is placed individually in a vacuum chamber and is run to cause the magnetic head to perform reading and writing randomly at room temperature. During this process, the vacuum chamber is gradually evacuated. As pressure decreases in the vacuum chamber, the flying height of the magnetic head decreases. This increases the possibility of interaction between the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the lubricating layer <b>14</b> and contact between the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. Thus the vacuum test creates a severe environment in which contact takes place between the magnetic head <b>20</b> and the magnetic disk <b>10</b>. In this way it is possible to prove the durability of the magnetic disk <b>10</b> or the ability of the lubricant to bind to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0127">To be specific, the pressure in the chamber is kept at 0.459 atm (equivalent to the pressure at an altitude of 20,000 ft), and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> is tested for hard errors under this condition. The number of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> with hard errors is counted for each group of six units having PFPE(I), PFPE(II), or PFPE(III).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the result of the vacuum test. It is noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that no hard errors occur in all the six samples of the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> with the lubricating layer <b>14</b> of PFPE(I) or PFPE(III). By contrast, hard errors occur in 3 samples out of 6 samples with the lubricating layer <b>14</b> of PFPE(II). In other words, the magnetic disk <b>10</b> with PFPE(II) and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> provided with it are remarkably poor in durability.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0129">The result of vacuum test shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be attributable to the difference in content of PFPE(I) and PFPE(II) in the first PFPE compound or the difference in content of secondary components.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0130">How firmly the lubricant binds to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> is an important factor in vacuum test for durability. That component of the lubricant which contributes to binding is a highly polar compound. That is, the second PFPE compound having 8 hydroxyl groups improves the binding performance of the lubricant. Those compounds having many hydroxyl groups in one molecule include the first and second secondary compounds (mentioned above) which has 6 hydroxyl groups. They exist in PFPE(I) in an amount of about 10 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0131">There exist very few of highly polar perfluoropolyether compounds having more than 6 hydroxyl groups in PFPE(II). This is a probable reason that the magnetic disk <b>10</b> with PFPE(II) and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> provided with it are inferior in durability to the magnetic disk <b>10</b> with PFPE(I) and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> provided with it.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0132">The foregoing suggests that a perfluoropolyether compound, such as the first PFPE compound, having 4 hydroxyl groups is not satisfactory in the case where the flying height of the magnetic disk <b>20</b> is as small as 10 nm or less. Its polarity alone is not enough for the long-term durability required. Moreover, the first PFPE compound of high purity does not exhibit all the characteristics required of the lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0133">The foregoing suggests that the lubricant to be applied to the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> which runs under the severe condition that the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b> is as small as 10 nm or less should contain a highly polar component that firmly binds to the magnetic disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0134">It is concluded from the foregoing that the lubricant containing only one of PFPE(I), PFPE(II), or PFPE(III) does not meet all of the three requirements defined below when it is used under the condition that the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b> is as small as 10 nm or less.
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0135">(i) Abhesiveness or ability to prevent adhesion to the magnetic head <b>20</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0136">(ii) Adequate flowability to enhance self-restoration.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0137">(iii) Sufficient binding power to make the lubricant to withstand severe environment.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0138">The foregoing discussion leads to a conclusion that a mixture of PFPE(II) and PFPE(III) gives a lubricant which meets all the requirements of abhesiveness, adequate flowability, and strong binding force.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0139">Studies based on comparison between the PFPE(I) and PFPE(II) about the content of secondary components revealed that the content of the first PFPE compound should preferably be no less than 80 pbw for 100 pbw of the first ingredient in total.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0140">The result of vacuum test on PFPE(I) indicates that the first secondary compound having 6 hydroxyl groups and the second secondary compound can be used as the second ingredient. However, it also indicates that the second PFPE compound, such as PFPE(III) having 8 hydroxyl groups, is also desirable as the second ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0141">The lubricant which contains the first ingredient and the second ingredient as mentioned above remains stable on the surface of the magnetic disk without sticking to the magnetic head <b>20</b> over a long period of time even though the flying height of the magnetic head <b>20</b> is as small as 10 nm or less. This helps realize the magnetic disk <b>10</b> and the magnetic disk unit <b>1</b> provided therewith which have high long-term reliability.</p>
