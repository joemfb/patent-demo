<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A beam combiner has a first coating on a first side capable of imparting a first polarization rotation, and a second coating on a second side capable of imparting a second polarization rotation. A first beam impinging on the first side passes through the first and second coatings as a first beam component. Second and third beams impinging on the second side partially reflect off the second coating as a second beam component, and partially transmit through the second coating to reflect off the first coating and exit through the second coating as a third beam component. The first, second and third beam components are disposed at selected positions and have respective selected polarizations as a combined beam spot. The positions and polarization of the beams components result in a projected image having increased allowable brightness and/or having reduced speckle.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In scanned beam displays or the like, it is often desirable to increase the display brightness in order to project a brighter projected image for a given amount of ambient light. One way to increase the display brightness is to simply increase the power of the projector. The greater the power applied to the light source or sources that generate the scanned image, the greater the brightness in the resulting scanned image. However, governmental regulatory bodies typically place limits on the amount of power for the scanned beam for a given beam spot size. Furthermore, in scanned beam displays interference patterns from the scanned beam may result in speckle artifacts in the projected image. Although the presence of speckle in the display may be tolerable and even unnoticeable to the user, it still may be beneficial to reduce the amount of speckle in the projected image to provide an image that is more aesthetically pleasing. Thus, two overall goals for a scanned beam projector or the like may include the ability to provide a brighter projected image without exceeding regulatory limits, and also to reduce speckle in the projected image.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a diagram of a projector having a beam combiner in accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a projector <b>100</b> may include a beam combiner <b>110</b> to combine the output beams from one or more light sources such as a blue laser <b>116</b>, a green laser <b>122</b>, and a red laser <b>124</b> to generate a red-green-blue (RGB) color image. Although projector <b>100</b> will be discussed for purposes of example having three color lasers, projector <b>100</b> may have more or fewer color light sources with visible or invisible wavelengths, which may be lasers or other types of light sources such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, blue laser <b>116</b> may emit a blue beam (B) <b>120</b> that may be passed through input optics <b>118</b> which may comprise a collimating lens, a top hat lens, and so on, to provide desired shaping of the beam profile. Likewise, green laser <b>122</b> and red laser <b>124</b> may emit a green beam (G) <b>123</b> and a red beam (R) <b>125</b>, respectively, that may pass through input optics <b>126</b> which may be the same or similar to the input optics <b>118</b> for blue laser <b>116</b>. Furthermore, input optics <b>126</b> may comprise a beam combiner to combine the green beam <b>123</b> and the red beam <b>125</b> into a combined beam (G+R) <b>128</b>. As will be discussed in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, below, beam combiner <b>110</b> combines the blue beam <b>120</b> with the combined beam <b>128</b> such that three total output beams or beam groups, beam <b>132</b>, beam <b>134</b>, and beam <b>136</b>, may generate a spot <b>142</b> on a mirror <b>142</b> of an imaging platform <b>138</b>. The blue beam <b>120</b> enters beam combiner <b>110</b> from side <b>110</b> and exits out the other side <b>114</b> of beam combiner <b>110</b> as beam <b>136</b>. When combined beam <b>128</b> impinges on side <b>114</b> of beam combiner <b>110</b>, a portion of the combined beam <b>128</b> is reflected as combined beam <b>134</b>. Another portion of combined beam <b>128</b> enters into beam combiner as beam <b>130</b><i>a </i>and is reflected off of side <b>112</b> as beam <b>130</b><i>b </i>to exit beam combiner <b>110</b> as beam <b>132</b>. Blue beam <b>136</b> is generally located in between the two resulting combined output beams, beam <b>132</b> and beam <b>134</b>, which are separated by a separation distance <b>152</b> to form the beam spot <b>142</b> on mirror <b>140</b> of imaging platform <b>138</b>. It should be noted that blue beam <b>136</b> may be disposed at any location between beam <b>132</b> and beam <b>134</b> such as in the center between the two other beams but also at other non-central positions, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As will be discussed in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, below, controller <b>148</b> controls a vertical drive circuit <b>144</b> and a horizontal drive circuit <b>144</b> to cause imaging platform <b>138</b> to scan the reflection of the spot <b>142</b> as a scanned output beam. Although such an arrangement of imaging platform <b>138</b> comprises a two-dimensional scanner, other types of scanners may likewise be utilized, for example a one-dimensional scanner or two one-dimensional scanners to create a two-dimensional image, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects. In one or more embodiments, imaging platform <b>138</b> may comprise a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) device fabricated from silicon or the like, however the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. When the projector <b>100</b> is provided as an integrated package or unit, projector <b>100</b> may be referred to as a photonics module or integrated photonics module.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The output beam scanned by imaging platform <b>138</b> may comprise the reflection of spot <b>142</b> as an output beam scanned onto a display surface <b>154</b> wherein the scanned beam comprises the individual beams, beam <b>132</b>, beam <b>134</b>, and beam <b>136</b> wherein beam <b>136</b> is generally between beams <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, and wherein beams <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> have are separated by separation distance <b>152</b> or offset. In one or more embodiments, the output beam optionally may pass through output optics <b>150</b> to control and/or shape the resulting projected image and may include, for example, one or more mirrors, total internal reflection (TIR) surfaces, prisms, wedges, and/or lenses, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. The scanning of the output beam generated on a projection surface <b>154</b> results in a projected image.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As will be discussed in further detail, below, beam combiner <b>110</b> provides a desired separation distance or offset of beams <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, and further provides a desired polarity in the beams to affect the image displayed by projector <b>100</b>, for example to increase an allowable amount of brightness and contrast in the displayed image, and to reduce speckle artifacts in the displayed image. Details of the operation of beam combiner <b>110</b> to achieve such results are discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a diagram of the beam combiner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing the combining of multiple beams with a desired beam separation and polarization in accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the details of operation of the beam combiner <b>110</b> in a display such as scanned beam display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein the beam combiner <b>110</b> combines a blue beam <b>120</b> with a combined green and read beam <b>128</b>. Blue beam <b>120</b> is projected onto side <b>112</b> of beam combiner <b>110</b> wherein side <b>112</b> has a coating <b>210</b> disposed thereon that is essentially transmissive to the blue beam <b>120</b> so that the blue beam <b>120</b> passes through beam combiner <b>110</b> as beam <b>160</b> and exits side <b>114</b> of beam combiner <b>110</b> as blue beam <b>136</b> with an expected offset from blue beam <b>120</b> due to the difference between the index of refraction of beam combiner and the index of refraction of air via the operation of Snell's law. Furthermore, coating <b>210</b> on surface <b>112</b> of beam combiner <b>110</b> may comprise a polarization rotator or retarder which rotates beam <b>120</b> by one-quarter wavelength such that if beam <b>210</b> is P polarized then internal beam <b>160</b> is circularly polarized. Beam <b>160</b> then exits surface <b>114</b> which likewise may have a coating <b>214</b> that may comprise a polarization rotator or retarder which rotates beam <b>160</b> by another one-quarter wavelength such that blue beam <b>136</b> is S polarized when it exits beam combiner <b>110</b>. Alternatively, polarization rotation may be achieved on one or both sides of beam combiner <b>110</b> via an internal coating, structure, or material built in or fabricated within the interior of beam combiner. Similarly, the combined green and red beam <b>128</b> may be P polarized and projected onto side <b>114</b> of beam combiner such that a portion of the combined beam <b>128</b> is reflected as combined beam <b>134</b>, and another portion passes through side <b>114</b> as combined beam <b>130</b><i>a </i>with an expected refraction and circular polarization via coating <b>214</b>. The coating <b>210</b> on side <b>112</b> is selected to be reflective for the combined beam <b>130</b><i>a </i>which is rotated in polarization such that the reflected combined beam <b>130</b><i>a </i>exits side <b>114</b> of beam combiner <b>110</b> as combined beam <b>132</b> with S polarization. Due to refraction of combined beam <b>128</b> as it passes through beam combiner as beam <b>130</b><i>a </i>and beam <b>130</b><i>b</i>, beam <b>132</b> is emitted from side <b>114</b> at a separation distance (d) <b>152</b> from beam <b>134</b>. The amount separation distance <b>152</b> is a function of the thickness (T) <b>212</b> of beam combiner <b>110</b> and the index of refraction of beam combiner <b>110</b>. The thickness <b>212</b> and the index of refraction of beam combiner <b>110</b> are selected to result in a desired separation distance <b>152</b> between beam <b>132</b> and beam <b>134</b>. Since beam <b>134</b> is a first, reflected version of combined beam <b>128</b>, beam <b>134</b> may be referred to as a primary beam, and beam <b>132</b> may be referred to as a secondary beam. Optionally, side <b>114</b> may include an additional coating to help select the polarization of combined beam <b>134</b>, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, beam combiner <b>110</b> operates to provide a desired polarization of the output beams. The combined beam <b>128</b> may have a random polarization, circular polarization, or linear polarization, and the beam combiner <b>110</b> operates to impart polarization diversity to the primary and secondary beams. In the example shown, the primary beam, beam <b>134</b>, has a first polarization, P polarization in this example, and the secondary beam, beam <b>132</b>, has a second polarization, S polarization in this example, that is orthogonal to the polarization of the primary beam. The blue beam <b>136</b> is selected to have a polarization that results in a desired output polarization, S polarization in this example, of the secondary beam, beam <b>132</b>. As a result of such beam combing by beam combiner <b>110</b>, in one or more embodiments the resulting spot <b>142</b> is generated on imaging platform <b>138</b> from three component beams or beam groups, a first combined green and red beam <b>134</b> having P polarization, a second combined green and red beam <b>132</b> having S polarization, and a blue beam <b>136</b> also having S polarization, wherein the first combined green and red beam <b>134</b> and the second combined green and red beam <b>132</b> are separated by a separation distance <b>152</b>. The separation of the primary and secondary combined green and red beams results in an increase in the C6 constant which results in a brighter allowable display. The C6 constant is a scale factor defined by the International Electromechanical Commission (IEC) and refers to the ration of the angles of the actual beam versus the diffraction limited beam based on the limit of the human eye. The angles are calculated by calculating the angle between the 1/e value of a Gaussian beam over the minimum focus of the human eye, which is about 100 millimeters (mm). If the beam or beams that produce the spot <b>142</b> on the imaging platform <b>138</b> result in a tighter, non-diffracted spot <b>142</b>, the C6 value of the beam is at or near C6=1. By changing the spot <b>146</b> to be less tight and more diffracted via some separation of the beams, the C6 value may be increased which results in a brighter allowable displayed image. In one or more embodiments, the amount of separation distance <b>152</b> between the primary and secondary combined beams, beam <b>132</b> and beam <b>134</b>, results in an increase in the C6 value of approximately 40% to about 50% compared to unseparated beams, and in some embodiments the C6 value may be approximately doubled compared to unseparated beams, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, the resulting polarization diversity of the combined beams <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> via operation of beam combiner <b>110</b> operates to reduce speckle artifacts in the resulting projected image wherein that interference between beams <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> is reduced due to the beams having orthogonal, or nearly orthogonal, polarizations which reduces speckle in the image.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrate one example arrangement of the blue, green, and red beams, and the resulting polarizations of the beams as a result of the operation of beam combiner <b>110</b>, it should be noted that other combinations of the beam colors may be provided, and/or other polarizations may be provided, without departing from the scope of the claimed subject matter and without substantial change to the operation of projector <b>100</b> or beam combiner <b>110</b>, or the resulting allowable brightness or speckle in the projected image. For example, the position of blue laser <b>116</b> may be interchanged with either one of green laser <b>122</b> or red laser <b>124</b>. Furthermore, although the primary combined beam <b>134</b> may have P polarization and the secondary combined beam may have S polarization, these polarizations may be interchanged in one or more alternative embodiments. In general, green laser <b>122</b> is combined with red laser <b>124</b> and which are in turn separated into a primary beam having a first polarization and a secondary beam having a second polarization orthogonal to the first polarization, at a selected separation distance since the red and green beams have more impact on the C6 value than the blue beam, and further the red and green beams have more impact on speckle than the blue beam. Additionally, the polarization of the blue beam <b>136</b> is selected to be the same polarization as the secondary beam <b>132</b>, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects. Furthermore, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrate a beam combiner <b>110</b> to achieve the results of a brighter allowable displayed image and speckle reduction in the displayed image via operation of the beam combiner <b>110</b>, alternatively a fold mirror may be utilized to achieve such results as shown in and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a diagram of a fold mirror as an alternative to the beam combiner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a fold mirror <b>310</b> may be utilized in lieu of the beam combiner <b>110</b> shown in and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The fold mirror <b>310</b> operates in essentially the same manner as beam combiner <b>110</b> except that the blue beam <b>120</b> may be directed toward fold mirror <b>310</b> from the same side <b>114</b> that combined green and red beam <b>128</b> are directed toward fold mirror <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, side <b>114</b> may have a coating <b>214</b> that is reflective of blue beam <b>120</b> such that blue beam <b>120</b> reflects off of side <b>113</b> of fold mirror <b>310</b> as beam <b>136</b>. Alternatively, via appropriate selection of the coating <b>210</b> and positioning of the point of incidence of the blue beam <b>120</b>, the blue beam could instead enter into fold mirror <b>310</b> and be reflected off of side <b>112</b> to exit fold mirror <b>310</b> as blue beam <b>136</b>. The polarization of the incoming blue beam <b>120</b> may be selected so that the output blue beam <b>136</b> may have the desired resulting polarization that matches that of the secondary combined beam <b>132</b>, S polarization in this example. Furthermore, alternative arrangements and alternative structures for fold mirror <b>310</b> may likewise be provided to result in the desired separation of the combined green and red beams <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, and with the desired polarizations, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects. In one or more embodiments, one or more additional beams <b>314</b> may be applied to surface <b>112</b> in a manner substantially similar to blue beam <b>120</b> as shown in and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> such that fold mirror <b>310</b> provides a beam combiner function to combine the one or more additional beams <b>314</b> with the blue, green, and red beams. In such embodiments, the one or more additional beams <b>314</b> may comprise beams having one or more additional wavelengths different than blue, red, or green, and may be visible wavelength beams or invisible wavelength beams such as infrared or ultraviolet. In some embodiments, the polarization of such one or more additional beams may be selected to combine with beam <b>132</b>, beam <b>134</b> and beam <b>136</b>, for example to provide a three-dimensional projected image when viewed by the user, with or without polarized glasses for viewing a three-dimensional image. However, this is merely one example application for the one or more additional beams, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, diagrams of the beam separation and polarization achieved with the beam combiner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the spot <b>142</b> impinging on mirror <b>140</b> of imaging platform <b>138</b> may comprise three spot components from the corresponding combined green and red beam <b>132</b>, combined green and red beam <b>134</b>, and blue beam <b>136</b>. The operation of beam combiner <b>110</b> or fold mirror <b>310</b> results in the two combined green and red beams to be separated by separation distance <b>152</b> or offset as discussed herein, above. The separation of the combined green and red beams results in the resulting spot <b>142</b> being less tight, that is not as concentrated in a smaller sized area, and more diffused, which results in a higher C6 value and therefore a brighter displayed image. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the beams generating the three spot components have the indicated polarization wherein the first combined green and red beam <b>132</b> has a first polarization (P polarization) that is orthogonal, or nearly orthogonal, to the polarization (S polarization) of the second combined green and red beam <b>134</b> and the blue beam <b>136</b>. Such polarization diversity of the separated beams results in speckle reduction in the displayed image. The amount of increase in brightness and/or the reduction in speckle may be controlled by the amount of separation distance <b>152</b> or offset achieved between combined beam <b>132</b> and combined beam <b>134</b>. A greater amount of separation distance may result in a greater amount of increase in allowable brightness and speckle reduction. Since the separation of the beams also results in a generally larger size of spot <b>142</b>, which may result in lower resolution in the displayed image, the amount of allowable brightness and speckle reduction may be balanced against any decrease in resolution by varying the separation distance <b>152</b> to a desired or selected value accordingly, for example according to the application for which the projector <b>100</b> is intended. The desired separation distance <b>152</b> may be selected via selecting an appropriate thickness <b>212</b> and/or index of refraction of the beam combiner <b>110</b> or fold mirror <b>310</b>. It should be noted that blue beam <b>136</b> and its resulting spot may be disposed at any location between beam <b>132</b> and beam <b>134</b> and their respective spots such as in the center between the two other beams and spots but also at other non-central positions, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.</p>

The increased separation distance <b>152</b> or offset may be achieved via a thicker beam combiner <b>110</b> or fold mirror <b>310</b>, and/or by increasing the index of refraction of the beam combiner <b>100</b> or fold mirror <b>310</b>. It should be noted that blue beam <b>136</b> and its resulting spot may be disposed at any location between beam <b>132</b> and beam <b>134</b> and their respective spots such as in the center between the two other beams and spots but also at other non-central positions, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one or more embodiments, for two dimensional scanning to generate a two dimensional image <b>720</b>, a horizontal axis may refer to the horizontal direction of raster scan <b>716</b> and the vertical axis may refer to the vertical direction of raster scan <b>716</b>. Scanning mirror <b>140</b> may sweep the output beam <b>620</b> horizontally at a relatively higher frequency and also vertically at a relatively lower frequency. The result is a scanned trajectory of output beam <b>620</b> to result in raster scan <b>716</b>. The fast and slow axes may also be interchanged such that the fast scan is in the vertical direction and the slow scan is in the horizontal direction. However, the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects.</p>
