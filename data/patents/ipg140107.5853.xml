<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a tilt and trim sensor apparatus and method. In particular, it relates to a tilt and trim sensor apparatus and method of calibrating the apparatus for a marine craft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to use a rotary trim position sensor for sensing the position of an actuator comprising a trim cylinder and a piston reciprocatingly mounted therein. For a two-wire system with a single gauge application, a variable resistor may be used that varies its output as a function of trim angle. For a three-wire system, a potentiometer having a variable voltage may be used that varies its output as a function of trim angle. There may also be provided dual analog gauges for multiple helms.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the above systems, including for example a two-wire single analog system, a three-wire single/dual analog system, or a three-wire dual analog system, require separate components.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, conventional rotary position sensors require manual calibration. This may be time consuming.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to the drawings and first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is provided a trim and tilt sensor apparatus indicated generally by numeral <b>20</b>. The sensor apparatus <b>20</b> has a housing <b>30</b>. The housing <b>30</b> in this example includes a disc-shaped portion <b>25</b> and a portion <b>27</b> formed by a curved wall <b>21</b> extending from portion <b>25</b> and surrounding a recess <b>32</b>. The disc-shaped portion <b>25</b> includes a pair of spaced-apart apertures as shown by aperture <b>45</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>30</b> has a central aperture <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The sensor apparatus <b>20</b> includes a rotatable portion, in this example a rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b>. The rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> extends through the central aperture <b>34</b>. The rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> is aligned with an axis of rotation <b>39</b> and is rotatably mounted to the housing <b>30</b> via, in this example, a bearing <b>38</b>. The rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> has a first end <b>35</b> and a second end <b>37</b> opposite the first end <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sensor apparatus <b>20</b> includes a magnet <b>24</b> mounted on the first end <b>35</b> of the rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> in this example. The magnet <b>24</b> in this example is a ceramic <b>8</b> magnet. An annular spacer <b>40</b> is disposed on top of the bearing <b>38</b>, from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The annular spacer <b>40</b> is adjacent to the magnet <b>24</b>. A magnet cover <b>26</b> is disposed on top of the annular spacer <b>40</b>, from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The end <b>35</b> of the rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b>, the annular spacer <b>40</b> and the magnet cover <b>26</b> together form an enclosure for containing the magnet <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sensor apparatus <b>20</b> includes a magnetic rotary position sensor, in this example, a magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>. The magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> is disposed upon a semi-conductor substrate <b>29</b> shaped to fit within recess <b>32</b>. The substrate <b>29</b> is secured to the housing <b>30</b> via a protrusion <b>42</b> of the housing that passes through an aperture <b>44</b> of the substrate <b>29</b>. The magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> is disposed adjacent to the magnet <b>24</b> to enable the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> to interact with the magnet <b>24</b>. The magnet cover <b>26</b> in this example is interposed between the magnet <b>24</b> and the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>. The magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> in this example outputs a voltage indicative of the angular position of the magnetic field of the magnet <b>24</b>. Magnetoresistive transducers per se are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, magnetoresistive transducers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,208,940 to Withanawasam, et al., the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The sensor apparatus <b>20</b> includes a microprocessor generally indicated by numeral <b>31</b>. The microprocessor <b>31</b> is disposed on the substrate <b>29</b>. The microprocessor <b>31</b> in this example is an Atmel&#xae; ATTiny84V type CPU, though those skilled in the art will appreciate that other processors may be used. The microprocessor <b>31</b> is operatively connected to and configured to receive signals from the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>. The microprocessor <b>31</b> is configured to ascertain the voltage output across the transducer <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sensor apparatus <b>20</b> in this example receives power via a gauge display unit, such as one of the units <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> or <b>122</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The sensor apparatus <b>20</b> and gauge display unit(s) are operatively and functionally connected together via cables <b>46</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A three-pronged plug <b>43</b> in this example extends from the cables <b>46</b> and is adapted to plug into the sensor apparatus <b>20</b> via a corresponding socket (not shown). The microprocessor <b>31</b> and magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> are thus powered by the gauge display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one preferred embodiment, recess <b>32</b> is completely filled and thereby sealed with over-seal potting compound <b>33</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The potting compound <b>33</b> protects the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>, the microprocessor <b>31</b>, the plug <b>43</b> and various other parts and circuitry, inhibiting damage such as water damage that may otherwise occur.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tilt and trim sensor apparatus <b>20</b> as disclosed herein is shown in combination with a trim and tilt system, indicated generally by reference numeral <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The trim and tilt system <b>47</b> operates to position an outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> between a lower position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and an upper position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The trim and tilt system <b>47</b> is operatively mounted to a stern <b>49</b> of a marine craft <b>48</b> (shown in fragment). The trim and tilt system <b>47</b> includes a stern bracket <b>50</b>. The stern bracket <b>50</b> is mounted on the stern <b>49</b> of the marine craft <b>48</b>. The outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> is pivotally connected to the marine craft <b>48</b> at pivotal connection <b>57</b> which is located in this example midway along the stern bracket <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The trim and tilt system <b>47</b> includes a trim and tilt cylinder apparatus generally indicated by reference numeral <b>53</b>. The trim and tilt cylinder apparatus <b>53</b> has a cylinder <b>58</b>, a rod <b>54</b> and a piston <b>56</b> connected to the rod <b>54</b>. The piston <b>56</b> is slidably engageable with and disposed within the cylinder <b>58</b>. The rod <b>54</b> is partially disposed within the cylinder <b>58</b>. The rod <b>54</b> has an end <b>55</b> spaced-apart from the piston <b>56</b>. End <b>55</b> is pivotally connected to the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> via pivotal connection <b>59</b>. The trim and tilt cylinder apparatus <b>53</b> has an end <b>60</b> spaced-apart from end <b>55</b>. End <b>60</b> is operatively connected to the cylinder <b>58</b>. End <b>60</b> is pivotally supported by the stern bracket <b>50</b> at a pivot point coinciding with the axis of rotation <b>39</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The trim and tilt sensor apparatus <b>20</b> connects to the trim and tilt cylinder apparatus <b>53</b> at end <b>60</b> in this example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, a pair of bolts (not shown) pass through the apertures <b>45</b> of the housing <b>30</b>, and in turn through corresponding apertures (not shown) of the cylinder <b>58</b> near end <b>60</b>, and threadably engage a pair of nuts (not shown). The housing <b>30</b> in this example is thereby operatively connected to the trim and tilt cylinder apparatus <b>53</b>. The rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> mates with a corresponding female part (not shown) operatively connected to the stern bracket <b>50</b>. The rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> in this example thereby operatively rotatably engages with the stern bracket <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> is shown in a fully lowered position relative to horizontal axis <b>61</b> (from the perspective of the figure). In the fully lowered position, the rod <b>54</b> is in a fully retracted mode within the cylinder <b>58</b>. The outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> is at a first angular position or raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>relative to the stern <b>49</b>. The raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>is the angle spanning from a given reference axis. The given reference axis corresponds to the given orientation of the tilt and trim sensor apparatus <b>20</b> once installed onto the trim and tilt cylinder apparatus <b>53</b>. This orientation and thus the given reference axis may vary due to, for example, variations in how the apparatus <b>20</b> is installed. The term &#x201c;raw&#x201d; is used because the raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>is as yet unprocessed. The voltage across the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> corresponds to the raw angle. This voltage varies as a function of the angular position of the trim and tilt cylinder apparatus <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> is shown in a fully raised position (from the perspective of the figure). In the fully raised position, the rod <b>54</b> is in a fully extended mode, extending outwards from the cylinder <b>58</b>. In the fully raised position the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> is at a second angular position or raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a simplified block diagram of the functioning of the tilt and trim sensor apparatus is provided. Raw angle <b>62</b>, as discussed for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, is detected by the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> based on the position of the magnet <b>24</b>, as discussed for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus next undergoes a calibration routine <b>64</b> in order to determine the relative trim angle <b>66</b> of the outboard propulsion unit. Once the relative trim angle <b>66</b> is determined, this information is sent to an output circuit <b>68</b>. For a given relative trim angle, the output circuit <b>68</b> is pre-programmed to provide an output that mimics a variable resistance or variable voltage <b>70</b>. The output <b>70</b> may then be connected to, for example, the gauge display unit of the marine craft.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of these aspects of the tilt and trim sensor apparatus will now in turn be discussed in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a block diagram showing the functioning of the tilt and trim sensor apparatus in greater detail. As the magnet <b>24</b> is rotated, the voltage across the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> will vary. This is shown in the form of a signal <b>105</b> arising from the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>. The signal <b>105</b> undergoes signal conditioning <b>106</b>, resulting in a conditioned signal <b>107</b>. The conditioned signal <b>107</b> is then sent to the microprocessor <b>31</b>. The microprocessor <b>31</b> converts the conditioned signal <b>107</b> from an analog signal to a digital signal representative of the raw angle <b>62</b>, via an analog-to-digital converter <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the magnetoresistive transducer has two sensing regions <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> for detecting the raw angle &#x3b8;. The first sensing region <b>96</b> varies from 0 to 180 degrees and the second sensing region <b>98</b> varies from 0 to 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for a given raw angle &#x3b8; as set out along the x-axis, the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> provides a voltage V<sub>in</sub>, as indicated along the y-axis. The voltage V<sub>in </sub>is indicative of the angular position of the magnetic field of the magnet <b>24</b>, within 0 degree to 180 degree range. The voltage V<sub>in </sub>varies from zero to a given number within the first sensing region <b>96</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. When the transducer rotates past said 180 degrees, the voltage drops to zero once more within the second sensing region <b>98</b>. In the example, raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>corresponds to the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> being in the fully lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>corresponds to the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> being in the fully raised position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, once the raw angle <b>62</b> is in digital form, the microprocessor <b>31</b> employs an algorithm to offset the raw angles &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>so that both angles are transposed so as to be within only one sensing region. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Calibration of the Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The calibration routine for calibrating the tilt and trim sensor apparatus <b>64</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. When the tilt and trim sensor apparatus <b>20</b> is in operation, in start mode <b>69</b>, the apparatus via the microprocessor has hysteresis and therefore first reads any previously saved configuration <b>72</b> from when the apparatus <b>20</b> was last operational. The apparatus <b>20</b> then automatically enters calibration mode <b>74</b>. The apparatus <b>20</b> reads the magnetic sensor data (shown as box <b>76</b>) acquired by the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>, and thereby calculates the raw angle &#x3b8; at <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The microprocessor then determines if it is supposed to be in calibration mode, as indicated by diamond <b>80</b>. In order to determine if the apparatus <b>20</b> is in a valid calibration mode <b>82</b>, the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> undergoes a set routine, or plurality of motions. In this example the routine provides three consecutive calibration values <b>84</b> for a series of readings. Like other specific values stated herein, this could vary in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The calibration routine is completed within a certain amount of time. When the outboard propulsion unit is in a fully lowered position the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> provides a first position output value. When the outboard propulsion unit is in a fully raised position the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> provides a second position output value. In one preferred embodiment, first position output values must be within a certain range, the second position output values must be within a certain range, and the difference between the first and second position output values must be consistent within a certain range. In a preferred example, the outboard propulsion unit is raised and lowered three times between the fully lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the fully raised position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">This shown by way of illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> where the up and down cycles <b>100</b> overlie one another, but are spaced-apart in the drawing for clarity. The three first position output values of the raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>in the fully lowered position of the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> must be within a certain range of each other for a valid calibration to occur. Likewise, the three second position output values of the raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>in the fully raised position of the outboard propulsion unit must be within a certain range of each other. The three readings of angular range &#x3b8;<sub>&#x394;</sub>, which is equal to raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>minus raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>or put another way, the first position output values minus the second position output values, must also be consistent within a certain margin of error.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to one preferred embodiment a degree of variation for the three maximum value readings (fully raised position) of +/&#x2212;5 degrees is acceptable. Likewise a degree of variation for the three minimum value readings (fully lowered position) of +/&#x2212;5 degrees is acceptable and a degree of variation for the three overall span readings of +/&#x2212;5 degrees is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The total raising and lowering must occur within a certain time period or set time. In this case the total time within which the calibration routine must be completed within the set time of 120 seconds or less but this could vary in other embodiments. Each up and down cycle of the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> must occur within a further set time, in this example, 40 seconds in order to obtain a valid calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, once the above described calibration routine has been received in the form of three consecutive values for a series of the above readings, the calibration is saved, as indicated by the box <b>86</b>. The calibration is saved into the non-volatile memory of the microprocessor <b>31</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This may take the form of an average first position output value corresponding to an average raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1AVG </sub>and an average second position output value corresponding to an average raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>2AVG </sub>being saved into the memory of the microprocessor <b>31</b>. The next step is to exit the calibration mode, as shown by box <b>88</b>. If the calibration routine does not provide a series of three consecutive values within the total time allowed, the microprocessor <b>31</b> resorts back to the previously saved data.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The next step is to scale to a calibrated range, as indicated by box <b>90</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example of the voltage across the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, being scaled to a calibrated range. Calibrated voltage V<sub>cal </sub>across the magnetoresistive transducer is shown on the y-axis and the relative trim angle <b>66</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is shown on the x-axis. First calibration end point <b>102</b>, which previously corresponded to average raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>1AVG</sub>, now corresponds to a calibrated voltage of zero. Second calibration end point <b>104</b>, which previously corresponded to average raw angle &#x3b8;<sub>2AVG</sub>, now corresponds to an upper calibrated voltage reading. The scaling is accomplished by the microprocessor <b>31</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The microprocessor <b>31</b> provides a linear interpolation between points <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Multi-linear interpolation is also possible for where a non-linear output is required. Scaling data is well known per se and will therefore not be discussed in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 12</figref>, the microprocessor <b>31</b> next scales the relative trim angle <b>66</b> to an output range <b>92</b> of output voltages. The scaled output range <b>92</b> is pre-programmed into the microprocessor <b>31</b>. A user may specify the up and down output voltage levels for when the outboard propulsion unit is fully raised and fully lowered, respectively. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by the &#x201c;set output&#x201d; box <b>94</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, signal <b>95</b> resulting from the scaling of the output is transmitted to a PWM output driver <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Varying the outboard motor's trim varies the position of the magnetoresistive sensor and this in turn produces a varying output voltage. The calibration routine calibrates this output voltage and the microprocessor is thus able to ascertain the trim or tilt angle of the outboard motor. The microprocessor <b>31</b> must now convey this information in a form intelligible to the given gauge display unit(s).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">The Output Circuitry</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The trim and tilt sensor apparatus <b>20</b> includes output circuitry <b>116</b>. The PWM output driver <b>114</b> via PWM voltage output <b>115</b> is in communication with the output circuitry <b>116</b>. The output circuitry <b>116</b> generates analog or digital outputs depending on the model of the sensor apparatus. As further described below the apparatus <b>20</b> with its output circuitry <b>116</b> is configured to operate with a single/dual digital gauge display unit <b>118</b>, an analog gauge display unit <b>120</b> and/or a further analog gauge display unit <b>122</b>. The apparatus <b>20</b> as herein disclosed thus accommodates a plurality of different 2-wire single analog mode or 3-wire mode systems.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The output circuitry <b>116</b> is schematically shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. It includes a first circuit <b>133</b> having a terminal <b>135</b>, a second circuit <b>148</b> having a terminal <b>149</b> and a third circuit <b>161</b> having a terminal <b>162</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first circuit <b>133</b> further comprises a conductor <b>136</b>, a node <b>139</b>, a diode <b>138</b>, a junction <b>178</b>, a conductor <b>141</b>, a first switch <b>142</b> and ground <b>146</b>. The terminal <b>135</b> is connected in series via the conductor <b>136</b> with the diode <b>138</b> which in turn is connected in series with a voltage regulator <b>140</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first switch <b>142</b>, in this example a mosfet switch, is connected to ground <b>146</b>.

Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a single pin (not shown) of the microprocessor <b>31</b> controls the first switch <b>142</b>. The first switch <b>142</b> is activated when the said single pin of the microprocessor <b>31</b> is activated and this is illustrated by control (box <b>144</b>). The first switch <b>142</b> draws current from the first circuit <b>133</b> by connecting the first circuit <b>133</b> to ground <b>146</b> when activated.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The second circuit <b>148</b>, in addition to including terminal <b>149</b>, further comprises a conductor <b>152</b>, a node <b>180</b>, a diode <b>154</b>, an operational amplifier <b>156</b>, a conductor <b>153</b>, a second switch <b>158</b> and a ground <b>160</b>. The terminal <b>149</b> is connected in series via the conductor <b>152</b> to the diode <b>154</b>. The conductor <b>153</b> connects to the conductor <b>152</b> via node <b>180</b>.

The second switch <b>158</b> is connected to the node <b>180</b> via the conductor <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first circuit <b>133</b> is connectable to the second circuit <b>148</b> via a conductor <b>174</b>, which connects to junction <b>178</b> and node <b>180</b>.

The diode <b>176</b> is oriented to allow current to flow from node <b>180</b> to junction <b>178</b> and thereby to the regulator <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The pin of the microprocessor <b>31</b> that activates the first switch <b>142</b> also activates the second switch <b>158</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Diode <b>154</b> is connected in series with the operational amplifier <b>156</b>. Diode <b>154</b> allows current to flow from the operational amplifier <b>156</b> to the terminal <b>149</b>. Diode <b>154</b> inhibits current from flowing from the terminal <b>149</b> directly to the operational amplifier <b>156</b>. Another pin of the microprocessor, which is different from that for the switches <b>142</b> and <b>158</b>, activates the operational amplifier <b>156</b>. Each pin (the pin for the switches and the pin for the operational amplifier) is controlled separately.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The third circuit <b>161</b>, in addition to including terminal <b>162</b>, further comprises a conductor <b>163</b> and a ground <b>166</b>. The terminal <b>162</b> is directly connected to ground <b>166</b> via the conductor <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As mentioned above the apparatus <b>20</b> with its output circuitry <b>116</b> is configured to operate with a variety of systems. The manner in which the apparatus <b>20</b> operates depends upon the manner in which the gauge display units are connected to terminals <b>135</b>, <b>149</b> and <b>162</b> and depends upon whether they are analog or digital gauge display units. In this example the microprocessor <b>31</b> determines the operational mode, such as a 2-wire single analog mode, a 3-wire dual analog mode, or a 3-wire single/dual digital mode, based on the voltage measured by the microprocessor <b>31</b> at junction <b>178</b>. The microprocessor is operatively ascertaining the voltage across the terminal <b>135</b>. If the voltage is above a pre-programmed or set threshold, such as for example 6 volts at junction <b>178</b>, the apparatus <b>20</b> operates in the 2-wire single analog mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and/or the 3-wire dual analog mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. If the voltage is below the set threshold, having a voltage for example of 4 to 5 volts at junction <b>178</b>, the apparatus <b>20</b> operates in the 3-wire single/dual digital mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Alternatively the microprocessor and accompanying circuitry can measure other electrical characteristics of the gauge such as current consumption or source impedance to determine the operating mode.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">2-Wire Single Analog Mode</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> this shows the operation of the apparatus <b>20</b> with its output circuitry <b>116</b> in the 2-wire single analog mode. Terminal <b>135</b> is connectable to a power/signal wire <b>134</b> of the analog trim gauge display unit <b>120</b> (or trim sender), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Terminal <b>162</b> is connected to a ground wire <b>164</b> of the analog trim gauge display unit. Terminal <b>149</b> is unused because only one analog trim gauge display unit is being used.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The microprocessor ascertains that the voltage at junction <b>178</b> (or across the power/signal wire) is above the set threshold. The microprocessor <b>31</b> thus causes the output circuitry <b>116</b> to operate in 2-wire single analog mode. In this case the microprocessor activates the &#x201c;active&#x201d; components of the output circuitry <b>116</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> by way of slightly darker font lines.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The power/signal wire <b>134</b> provides power to the output circuitry <b>116</b> and the microprocessor <b>31</b>. In the 2-wire single analog mode, the pin of the microprocessor <b>31</b>, as illustrated by control <b>144</b>, is activated for controlling and selectively switching on the first switch <b>142</b>. When the first switch <b>142</b> does not have a signal applied to it from the microprocessor <b>31</b>, junction <b>178</b> sees normal power from the analog gauge display unit <b>120</b> via terminal <b>135</b>. This is used to power the microprocessor <b>31</b> and other supporting electronics. Current passes through diode <b>138</b> to the voltage regulator <b>140</b>, which regulates voltage applied to the microprocessor <b>31</b> and magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>. The voltage regulator <b>140</b> may step down, for example, a supply voltage of 12 volts to, for example, slightly above 6 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the microprocessor applies a &#x201c;high&#x201d; signal to the first switch <b>142</b>, it causes the switch <b>142</b> to connect terminal <b>135</b> to ground which sinks current. Junction <b>178</b> does not see ground because capacitors farther downstream have accumulated sufficient energy to keep the microprocessor <b>31</b> and other electronics operational during this time. Diodes <b>138</b> and <b>176</b> keep this stored up energy from being lost.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The microprocessor <b>31</b> periodically activates the first switch <b>142</b> in accordance with the position of the outboard propulsion unit. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, when the first switch <b>142</b> is &#x201c;on&#x201d; (as indicated by t<sub>ON</sub>), current is drawn from the circuit <b>133</b>. A duty cycle, equal to the ratio of t<sub>ON </sub>over total cycle time T, is generated by the periodic activation of the first switch <b>142</b> thereby. The &#x201c;low time&#x201d; or switch activated time is required to sink current in order to mimic or &#x201c;fake&#x201d; the resistance that would normally be generated by, for example, the rotary trim position sensor of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As the position of the magnet <b>24</b> mounted on the rotatable shaft <b>36</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) varies with respect to the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b>, the microprocessor <b>31</b> will in turn vary the width of the pulses. By varying the duty cycle, the output voltage may be varied in a manner corresponding to the position of the outboard propulsion unit and in a form readable by for example the analog gauge display unit <b>120</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> which shows the output voltage V<sub>out </sub>for the analog gauge display unit as a percentage of duty cycle for a given relative trim angle <b>66</b>. Thus, the microprocessor <b>31</b> reads the signal of the position of the magnet and transmits an output voltage within the range of voltages that the user has specified. Put another way, the extent of current being pulled through activating the mosfet switch determines the position of, for example, the analog trim gauge display. Increasing or decreasing the amount of current sunk will either increase or decrease the needle position on the gauge display unit <b>120</b>. The current sink provided by the system mimics the current sink that traditionally occurs when using a potentiometer to sense trim angle. The power/signal wire <b>134</b> thus also acts as a signal wire, conveying back a variable current to the analog trim gauge display unit <b>120</b>. The microprocessor <b>31</b> alternates the signal to the first switch <b>142</b> so that it can receive power to drive the electronics but also sink current causing the needle of the analog gauge display unit <b>120</b> to move.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The switches <b>142</b> and <b>158</b> are controlled by the same microprocessor signal, and thus both switches <b>142</b> and <b>158</b> are activated. However since only one analog gauge display unit <b>120</b> is connected to terminal <b>135</b>, switch <b>158</b> will simply switch and do nothing since no load is connected to it. Terminal <b>149</b> can simply be left unconnected as it has no effect.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one example the average current output I<sub>avg </sub>may simulate 11 ohms when the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> is in the fully lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The resistance increases as the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> rises upwards, from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, at a rate of, for example, 2.3 ohms per degree angle.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">3-Wire Dual Analog Mode</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, if the voltage measured at junction <b>178</b> is relatively high, because for example a power/signal wire <b>172</b> from the further analog gauge display unit <b>122</b> is also connected to terminal <b>149</b>, the microprocessor determines that is should operate in the 3-wire dual analog mode.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The apparatus <b>20</b> operates in a very similar fashion to that of the 2-wire single analog mode and therefore will not be discussed in great detail. In this case terminal <b>135</b> is connected to the power/signal wire <b>134</b> of the analog gauge display unit <b>120</b> as before, terminal <b>149</b> is connected to the further power/signal wire <b>172</b> of the further analog gauge display unit <b>122</b>, and terminal <b>162</b> is connected to a ground wire <b>165</b>. The microprocessor <b>31</b> ascertains that the voltage at the conductor <b>136</b> (or across the power/signal wire) is above the set threshold of, in this example, 6 volts and that the voltage is relative high. The microprocessor <b>31</b> through a single pin controls and activates both the first switch <b>142</b> and the second switch <b>158</b>, as illustrated by control <b>144</b>. The &#x201c;active&#x201d; components of the output circuitry <b>116</b> are illustrated by way of slightly darker font lines.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a like manner as described above for the 2-wire single analog mode, current is sunk during the switch-activated-time in order to mimic or &#x201c;fake&#x201d; the resistance that would normally be generated by, for example, the rotary trim position sensor(s) of the prior art. By varying the duty cycles of the switches <b>142</b> and <b>158</b>, the output voltages may be varied in a manner corresponding to the position(s) of the outboard propulsion unit(s) and in a form readable by analog gauge display units.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">3-Wire Single Dual Digital Mode</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operation of the apparatus <b>20</b> in the 3-wire single/dual digital mode is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In this case terminal <b>135</b> is connected to a power wire <b>170</b> of the single/dual digital gauge display unit <b>118</b>, terminal <b>149</b> is connected to a signal wire <b>168</b> of the single/dual digital gauge display unit <b>118</b> and terminal <b>162</b> is connected to a ground wire <b>167</b>. Below the set threshold, in this example 6 volts, the microprocessor determines that it should operate in a digital mode. Put another way the microprocessor <b>31</b> ascertains that the voltage at the conductor <b>136</b> (or across the power/signal wire) is below the set threshold of, in this example, 6 volts. The &#x201c;active&#x201d; components of the output circuitry <b>116</b> are illustrated by way of slightly darker font lines. The active components include the operational amplifier <b>156</b>, diode <b>154</b>, and terminal <b>149</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The microprocessor causes the signal from the power/signal wire passing through the conductor <b>136</b> and diode <b>138</b> to pass through to a different circuit. The pin of the microprocessor <b>31</b> controlling the operational amplifier <b>156</b> is activated. The microprocessor causes a signal to pass through the operational amplifier <b>156</b>, diode <b>154</b> and conductor <b>152</b>, resulting in a modified signal passing through the signal wire <b>168</b> for the gauge display unit. The modified signal through signal wire <b>168</b> will have a voltage level between that of the power signal wire and ground. In the 3-wire single/dual digital mode, there is provided therefore a slightly different output range. The PWM signal is filtered and the output from the output circuitry <b>116</b> is a constant voltage signal that will vary in accordance with the position of the outboard propulsion unit.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Advantages Provided by the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed provides many advantages. For example the tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed provides the advantage of being a single part that replaces three different parts. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed works with 2-wire systems, taking the part of a single analog gauge for trim position. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus functions in this manner by simulating a variable resistor. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed also interfaces with 3-wire dual analog gauge display units <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>, which are found, for example, where there is more than one station, such as in a multi-helm situation.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed works with 3-wire sensor systems, taking the part of a 3-wire mode sensor having a digital gauge. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus functions in this manner by simulating a potentiometer. In this situation the tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed plugs into an engine management box or other engine control units. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus can also interface with dual digital systems.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Because the tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed takes the place of the three different parts, this provides the advantage of reducing the number of parts and inventory of parts. It is fully compatible in fit, form and function with the following part numbers available at Teleflex Canada Inc.: Teleflex Part No. 3840830, which has a 2-wire, shaft configuration; Teleflex Part No. 3841840, which has a 3-wire shaft configuration; and Teleflex Part No. 3849411, which has a 3-wire configuration with a slightly different shaft compared to Part No. 3841840.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed provides the advantage of automatically detecting whether it is working with a 2-wire single analog mode system, a 3-wire dual analog mode system, or a 3-wire single/dual digital mode system based on the voltage being received by the tilt and trim sensor apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed provides the advantage of allowing all output and calibration parameters to be customizable to fit customer needs.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one example of the tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed, the total application sensing accuracy for trim applications is &#x3c;&#xb1;0.5 degrees, and a performance: accuracy of &#x3c;0.3 degrees, linearity of &#x3c;0.6 degrees, and a hysteresis linearity of &#x3c;0.3 degrees. This is in contrast to potentiometers of the prior art, which may have a total application accuracy for trim applications of &#x3c;&#xb1;2 degrees, and a performance: accuracy of &#x3c;0.9 degrees, linearity of &#x3c;1.75 degrees, and a hysteresis linearity of &#x3c;3.5 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed has very low operating friction.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed provides an inherently robust design. By completely filling and thereby sealing the recess <b>32</b> of the tilt and trim sensor apparatus with over-seal potting compound for example, the need for any further environmental sealing of the tilt and trim sensor apparatus is reduced and/or eliminated. This is in contrast to a conventional potentiometer of the prior art, which has moving resistive element parts that tend to wear out.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed provides the advantage of being self-calibrating. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus can be installed in any configuration: the angle sensing range for calibration purposes can be anywhere within the 360 degrees of rotation comprising the two 180 degree sensing regions <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus therefore does not require any set initial orientation. Also, the tilt and trim sensor apparatus can be mounted in any rotational position and therefore no mounting adjustment is needed. This is contrast to systems of the prior art where a manual rotation of the rotary trim sensor within mounting slots commonly is required until the trim gauge correctly reads, for example, the fully lowered position of the propulsion unit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">By using magnetic field sensing, in this case via the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> and the magnet <b>24</b>, the apparatus does not need the rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> to be completely aligned with a pivot point recess, as is the case with devices of the prior art. With rotary trim sensors of the prior art, there may be potentiometer shaft binding problems arising from the manner of installation. This is particularly true where the potentiometer shaft is installed in a radially or axially slightly misaligned manner. In such situations, the outboard propulsion unit may for example move before the potentiometer shaft rotates. This may lead to premature wear of the rotary trim sensors and cause reading errors. Also the tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed provides a certain degree of room and play within its bearing <b>38</b>, spacer <b>40</b> and recess <b>34</b>. As a result, the tilt and trim sensor apparatus as herein disclosed advantageously reduces the need for its installation to meet the precise installation alignment requirements of some prior art devices.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Variations to the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many variations are possible within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example the magnet <b>24</b> may be mounted to the housing <b>30</b> instead of the rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b>, with the magnetoresistive transducer <b>28</b> being mounted on the rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> instead of the housing <b>30</b>. Instead of using a magnet as a separate part, the rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> may itself be magnetized or have a magnetic portion. The rotatable interface shaft <b>36</b> may be operatively connectable to the outboard propulsion unit <b>52</b> and the housing <b>30</b> may be operatively connectable to the stern <b>49</b> of the marine craft <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as disclosed herein can be used in combination with a trim limit switch. The tilt and trim sensor apparatus as disclosed herein also can be used in combination with the integrated magnetostrictive linear displacement transducer and limit switch, or parts thereof, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/464,238 to Sall et. al, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In a variation a Hall effect sensor may be used in place of the magnetoresistive sensor. However the magnetoresistive transducer is preferred because it can tolerate a high degree of manufacturing and assembly variation. Magnetoresistive sensing is based of magnetic field angle not field strength as is the case with Hall effect sensors. Magnetization and temperature variation affect Hall effect sensing. More importantly, magnetoresistive sensing allows a high degree of offset between the shaft axis and the sensing element. For example, a 9.5 mm diameter ceramic <b>8</b> magnet allows for a +/&#x2212;3 mm positional tolerance whereas a Hall effect sensor such as Austria Microsystems AS5045 requires a +/&#x2212;0.25 mm positional tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">It will be understood by someone skilled in the art that many of the details provided above are by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention which is to be determined with reference to the following claims.</p>
