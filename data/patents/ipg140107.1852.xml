<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A magnamosis system for auto-anastomosing a region of the body using implants with magnetic members that may be individually delivered to different locations in the body. The implants with their magnetic members have a mating surface and polar alignment that generates an attractive force to compress tissue in the region between them. The tissue in the region necroses as a result of the compressive force such that tissue surrounding the necrosed tissue heals together to form an anastomosis.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to methods, devices and systems for performing anastomosis. In particular, the invention relates to magnamosis devices, which are devices for performing anastomosis using magnets for applying compressive force between two structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Anastomosis is the connection of two structures. It refers to connections between blood vessels or between other tubular structures such as loops of intestine. An example of surgical anastomosis occurs when a segment of intestine is resected and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed) to re-establish continuity of the bowel, for example Roux-en-Y anastomosis. The procedure is referred to as intestinal anastomosis. The present invention advances the art by providing new devices to perform anastomosis.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A magnamosis system is provided for performing an anastomosis. The system has two implants each distinguishing a casing with a magnet. The magnets are of opposite polarity. The casings have mating surfaces. A first implant defines a convex mating surface, and the convex mating surface has a first radius. The second implant defines a concave mating surface and the concave mating surface extends within the body of the second implant. The concave mating surface has a second radius, such that the second radius is greater than the first radius.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the convex mating surface faces the concave mating surface, a magnetic mating of the surfaces, caused by the magnets, causes the convex mating surface of the first implant to extend within the body of the second implant and apply a non--uniform compressive force across two adjacent structures disposed in between the two mating surfaces. The non-uniform compressive force is capable of forming an anastomosis between the two adjacent structures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To ensure the magnamosis system is exerting a force above a certain threshold, an additional element that measures force, distance or some other relatable measurement could be included in magnamosis implants. Accordingly, various examples are provided with force sensors. Furthermore, embodiment of the implants could have different forms, shapes and sizes as well as implants with or without through holes.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a magnamosis system <b>100</b> with a first implant <b>110</b> and a second implant <b>120</b>. First implant <b>110</b> has a first casing <b>112</b> (defining a body) that encloses a first magnet <b>114</b> with a first magnetic polarity. First casing <b>112</b> defines a convex mating surface <b>116</b> with a first radius.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Second implant <b>120</b> has a second casing <b>122</b> (defining a body) that encloses a second magnet <b>124</b> with a second magnetic polarity opposite from the first magnetic polarity. Second casing <b>122</b> defines a concave mating surface <b>126</b> that extends within the body of the second implant <b>120</b>. Concave mating surface <b>126</b> has a second radius, whereby the second radius is greater than the first radius as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one example, the convex mating surface is a single convex mating surface and the concave mating surface is a single concave mating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While the convex mating surface <b>116</b> faces the concave mating surface <b>126</b>, a magnetic mating of the two surfaces, caused by the two magnets, causes the convex mating surface <b>116</b> of the first implant <b>110</b> to extend within the body of the second implant <b>120</b> and apply a non-uniform compressive force across two adjacent structures disposed in between the two mating surfaces. The non-uniform compressive force is capable of forming an anastomosis between the two adjacent structures. In addition, the non-uniform compressive force across the two adjacent structures increases radially inward toward the center of the two surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One of the possibly complicating clinical issues with the use of the magnamosis system for creating compression anastomosis in e.g. a bowel is for the surgeon to know that the system is exerting enough force to ensure a proper anastomosis formation. In certain circumstances, if the bowel is too thick, an anastomosis could not form correctly. To ensure the magnamosis system is exerting a force above the known threshold, an additional element that measures force, distance or some other relatable measurement could be included in magnamosis implants.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> show magnamosis systems <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and <b>400</b>, which are the same as system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the difference of the addition of a force sensor <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>410</b> respectively. Each of the force sensors, in the different examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, measures the attractive magnetic force caused by the two magnets during the magnetic mating of the two surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows force sensor <b>210</b> inside the first casing <b>112</b> located underneath the convex mating surface <b>116</b> (i.e. in between convex mating surface <b>116</b> and first magnet <b>114</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows force sensor <b>310</b> inside the second casing <b>122</b> located underneath the concave mating surface <b>126</b> (i.e. in between concave mating surface <b>126</b> and second magnet <b>124</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Force sensors <b>210</b> and <b>310</b> could be various types of force sensors. In one example, the force sensor, resistor or gauge could ensure that the magnamosis system is exerting a force above a certain threshold or resistance. Such a sensor acts like an on/off sensor and be triggered when a certain force threshold is reached. An example of a force threshold for clinical use is approximately 4 N (1 lb) and the sensitivity does not have to be very high. In case the threshold is reached, the circuit closes and transmits a signal (e.g. wirelessly) via radio frequency identification technology. An external reader both wirelessly powers the internal device as well as reads the signal to ensure the implanting surgeon that the correct force has been met and the device will function as intended. The signal from the force sensor could also be translated to a visual or audible signal that alerts the surgeon that a threshold pressure has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another example of force sensors <b>210</b> and <b>310</b>, one could have a calibrated spring. The spring is calibrated so that when the two implant surfaces are mating and the proper attractive force between the magnets is achieved the spring compresses completely. When the magnet is suspended in the center of the casing indicating no coupling a dark line painted on the magnet is visible through a small opening in an opaque material lining the casing. When for example the first implant couples with the second implant and compresses the spring the dark line is hidden and the reflective surface of the magnet is exposed through the opening. This then could serve as a visual indicator if the surgeon had visual contact with the magnamosis system. If the clinical procedure prevents direct visualization of the magnamosis system, it can be mounted on a delivery device that contains an integrated light (e.g. LED) and a photo detector. The light and photo detector would be oriented such that both were facing the magnamosis system and lined up with the small opening in the opaque material mentioned above. When the magnamosis system is not coupled with another device the dark line on the magnet is visible through the opening and the photo detector will detect very little light reflected from light source. However, when an implant is coupled, the reflective surface of the magnet will be visible through the opening and the photo detector will see a large amount of light reflected from the light source. This signal from the photo detector can be directly correlated to how much the spring has deflected and therefore how much attraction force there is between the magnets of the two implants.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In still another example, FIG, <b>4</b> shows a Hall effect sensor <b>410</b> to indirectly sense a magnetic field strength (flux) caused by the two magnets, <b>114</b> and <b>124</b>. Hall effect sensor <b>410</b> can be embedded in, located outsides or near the magnamosis system <b>400</b> as long as it is able to detect the magnetic flux caused by the two magnets. For example, when the second implant <b>120</b> mates with the first implant <b>110</b>, the magnetic flux will increase by an amount that is directly related to the attractive force between the two implants. The force between the implants is a function of distance and magnetic strength. By measuring the increase (or change) in magnetic flux, the amount of force can be determined by indirectly measuring the distance between the magnets. The measured or determined data can then be displayed to the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The implants of the magnamosis system according to the invention could be with or without through holes. The examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> are implants without through holes, whereas the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-12</figref> are with through holes. The magnamosis system <b>500</b> shows first implant <b>510</b> and second implant <b>520</b> analogous to two discs or two English muffins. The magnamosis system <b>600</b> shows first implant <b>610</b> and second implant <b>620</b> analogous to two Donuts with through holes <b>612</b> and <b>622</b>, respectively. The implants could be circular or ellipsoidal/oval. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a magnamosis system <b>700</b> where implants <b>710</b> and <b>720</b> as well as the respective through holes <b>712</b> and <b>722</b> have an oval shape. Irrespective of the size or shape, the implants conform to the convex and concave mating surfaces with different radii as described supra.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The choice of the shape of the magnamosis system and existence of through holes depends on the clinical applicability and use. Different sizes and shapes of the device accommodate different clinical situations. As one might expect, a smaller person will most likely require a smaller bowel anastomosis than a larger person would. The simplest solution to accommodate these clinical issues is to have different diameter devices. However, this may not provide the best solution for every case. With a circular magnamosis system one can only create an anastomosis that is less than the diameter of that patient's bowel. In some clinical applications, it may be advantageous to create a larger anastomosis.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A larger anastomosis can be obtained by an anastomosis system with an oval shape according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The oval shape increases the area of the anastomosis without increasing the space necessary to implant it. The oval does need not to be a traditional oval shape. The long edges of the oval could be parallel to further increase the size of the hole, but it is not necessary that they be so.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A larger or different type of anastomosis could also be achieved by having sets of multiples of the first and second implants forming a magnamosis system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an example with two first implants <b>1210</b> and two second implants <b>1220</b>. The implants in each set could be encased in the same casing, or somehow attached to each other. It is important to note that the convex and concave mating surfaces with different radii as described supra remains in place for each implant in the respective sets. One can image various structures, arrays and shapes varying based on the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> all of which are part of the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a magnamosis system <b>800</b> with a first implant <b>810</b> and a second implant <b>820</b>. First implant <b>810</b> has a first casing <b>812</b> (defining a body) that encloses a first magnet <b>814</b> with a first magnetic polarity. First casing <b>812</b> further has a first through hole <b>818</b> and a terminal structure defining a convex mating surface <b>816</b> with a first radius.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Second implant <b>820</b> has a second casing <b>822</b> (defining a body) that encloses a second magnet <b>824</b> with a second magnetic polarity opposite from the first magnetic polarity. Second casing <b>822</b> further has a second through hole <b>828</b> and a terminal structure defining a concave mating surface <b>826</b> that extends within the body of the second implant <b>820</b>. Concave mating surface <b>826</b> has a second radius, whereby the second radius is greater than the first radius as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In one example, the convex mating surface is a single convex mating surface and the concave mating surface is a single concave mating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the convex mating surface <b>816</b> faces the concave mating, surface <b>826</b>, a magnetic mating of the two surfaces, caused by the two magnets, causes the convex mating surface <b>816</b> of the first implant <b>810</b> to extend within the body of the second implant <b>820</b> and apply a non-uniform compressive force across two adjacent structures disposed in between the two mating surfaces. The non-uniform compressive force is capable of forming an anastomosis between the two adjacent structures. In addition, the non-uniform compressive force across the two adjacent structures increases radially inward toward the first and second through-holes, <b>818</b> and <b>828</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref> show magnamosis systems <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b> and <b>1100</b>, which are the same as system <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with the difference of the addition of a force sensor <b>910</b>, <b>1010</b> and <b>1110</b> respectively. Each of the force sensors, in the different examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, measures the attractive magnetic force caused by the two magnets during the magnetic mating of the to surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows force sensor <b>910</b> inside the first casing <b>812</b> located underneath the convex mating surface <b>816</b> (i.e. in between convex mating surface <b>816</b> and first magnet <b>814</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows force sensor <b>1010</b> inside the second casing <b>822</b> located underneath the concave mating surface <b>826</b> (i.e. in between concave mating surface <b>826</b> and second magnet <b>824</b>). In still another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a Hall effect sensor <b>1110</b> to indirectly sense a magnetic field strength (flux) caused by the two magnets, <b>814</b> and <b>824</b>. The examples of sensors described with respect to FIG&#x26; <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> would apply to the example of sensor for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 941</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In general and applicable to the embodiments described herein, the non-uniform compressive force could be strong enough to generate a necrosis tissue region of two adjacent structures. The necrosis tissue region could depart from the two adjacent structures to form a flow passage. Such a flow passage could form a fistula, and the fistula could pass the implants therethrough. Furthermore, the non-uniform compressive force could generate a force at the perimeter of the implants that is strong enough to fuse two adjacent structures while still promoting tissue growth within the two fused structures,</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The casing for each implant can either fully enclose the magnet and force sensor if applicable. However, this does not have to be the case since it is only important that the mating surface are fully covered or enclosed and that the magnet and/or force sensor remain one unit. For example, aspects of the non-facing sides could remain open, i.e. not enclosed. Therefore, we refer to the fact that the casings at least partially enclosed the magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The casings could be made out of plastic like a polycarbonate, but any other material is applicable as long as it does not interfere with the magnetic fields of the magnets. The size and shape of the magnets could vary as long as they are capable of generating the non-uniform compressive force as described. The location of magnets inside the casing could vary, but it is typically important that they cover a large enough area to again generate the non-uniform compressive force. The magnets in general extend underneath the surface area of mating surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Force sensors could be combined. For example, one could have a magnamosis system with force sensors in each implant as well as a Hall effect sensor. One can imagine various combinations of sensors which are all applicable and useful to the invention.</p>
