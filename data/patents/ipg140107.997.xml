<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/353,399, filed Jun. 10, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates in general to wheelchairs, and more particularly to braking systems for wheelchairs.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Braking for users of manual wheelchairs can be a challenging task, especially for those with limited mobility/dexterity or while traveling downhill. Descending ramps and sloped sidewalks may present a significant barrier to independent and safe mobility for manual wheelchair users. The most common technique to retard speed is the use of friction on the wheels, either at the tires or push rims.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For persons with poor hand strength and/or sensation, braking action by use of friction on the wheels can be difficult or impossible. A wheelchair user will apply friction to the tires or push-rims with either a bare or gloved hand. Bare hands can be burned from high friction rims during braking, while gloves can reduce sensation for propulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some users will lean forward to engage the wheel locks against the drive wheel tire to slow down. Wheel locks are intended to provide a stationary engagement once the wheelchair has stopped, and to prevent movement. Many devices are either some form of caliper to grasp the rim of the wheel or a friction assembly contacting the tire surface. Most require the user to remove his/her hands from the push-rim for application of the brakes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The application of brakes using a wheel lock is undesirable for several reasons. First, it is an incorrect use of a device, akin to slowing a car by using a parking brake. Second, it puts the user's center of gravity far forward of the base of support provided by the wheelchair, potentially causing the user to fall out of the wheelchair. There are several devices currently available that allow the user to apply braking forces through external mechanical measures, but the majority of these devices require the user to remove their hands from the push-rim to apply the brakes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inability to control the wheelchair speed places the user at risk of collisions, falls and/or tips. The majority of tips and falls occur in the forward direction, consistent with running into an object at too high of speed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A need exists for a braking system for manual wheelchair users who do not have full upper extremity function.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This invention relates to a user-centered design approach, wherein a &#x201c;hand-on&#x201d; brake allows users to maintain control of their wheelchair, while maintaining direct contact with the push rims.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An in-hub braking system for a wheelchair comprises a brake shell fixed against rotation movement in relation to a wheelchair frame. A wheelchair drive wheel having a hub supporting a braking system is supported for rotational movement in relation to the brake shell. A lever is operatively connected to the braking system for activating that braking system to cause the braking system to frictionally engage the brake shell. A push rim, which when urged forward, rotates the drive wheel in a forward direction to propel the wheelchair in a forward direction. When urged rearward together with the drive wheel, the push rim rotates with the drive wheel in a rearward direction to propel the wheelchair in a rearward direction. The push rim is operatively connected to the lever so that the push rim, which when urged rearward independent of the drive wheel, operates the lever to activate the braking system to frictionally engage the brake shell.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment, when read in light of the accompanying drawings.</p>

The frame <b>16</b> is supported in relation to a supporting surface (e.g., the floor or ground) by casters <b>18</b> and drive wheels <b>20</b>, which are respectively mounted in relation to front and rear of the frame <b>16</b> on the right and left sides of the frame <b>16</b>. The drive wheels <b>20</b> on each side of the frame <b>16</b> have common parts. As a consequence, the description of the drive wheel <b>20</b> herein below applies to each of the drive wheels <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The drive wheels <b>20</b> have a hub, generally indicated at <b>21</b>, that is mounted for rotation in relation to the frame <b>16</b>. A tire <b>22</b> is supported by a tire rim <b>24</b>, which in turn is supported concentrically in relation to the hub <b>21</b> by spokes <b>26</b>. A push rim <b>28</b> forms a part of a push ring <b>30</b>, which is supported concentrically in fixed relation to the tire rim <b>24</b>. The push rim <b>28</b> may be grasped by a wheelchair user (not shown) and urged forward to rotate the drive wheels <b>20</b> in a forward direction to propel the wheelchair <b>10</b> in a forward direction. Conversely, and the push rim <b>28</b> may be grasped by the wheelchair user and urged rearward to rotate the drive wheels <b>20</b> in a rearward direction to propel the wheelchair <b>10</b> in a rearward direction. Additionally, the push rim <b>28</b> may be grasped and rotated rearward independent of the drive wheel <b>20</b> to engage an in-hub brake system <b>34</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) within the hub <b>21</b>, as will become apparent in the description that follows. The push rim <b>28</b> and the push ring <b>30</b> return to a neutral position via a return spring <b>32</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) when the wheelchair user releases the push rim <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, an in-hub braking system, generally indicated at <b>34</b>, will be described. The system <b>34</b> comprises a hub shell <b>36</b> that is fixed within the hub <b>21</b> of the drive wheel <b>20</b>, as clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. Brake pads <b>38</b> are mounted in relation to a cam stud <b>40</b> and a fixed stud <b>42</b>, which are in turn affixed or supported in relation to a mounting plate <b>48</b> that is in turn affixed or supported in relation to the hub shell <b>36</b>. The brake pads <b>38</b> may be held in relation to the studs <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> by retaining clips <b>44</b>, <b>45</b>. A release spring <b>46</b> (shown in its entirety in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) cooperates with the brake pads <b>38</b> to bias the brake pads <b>38</b> to a released or unbraked position, as will become apparent in the description that follows.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cam stud <b>40</b> cooperates with an activation lever <b>50</b> (e.g., via mating geometry) and is affixed or supported in relation to the activation lever <b>50</b> via a nut <b>52</b>, which is in threaded engagement with an end of the cam stud <b>40</b>. The cam stud <b>40</b> is allowed to rotate in relation to the mounting plate <b>48</b> to activate the brake pads <b>38</b> against a braking surface <b>60</b> of a brake shell <b>62</b>. As clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the activation lever <b>50</b> is in turn affixed or supported in relation to the push ring <b>30</b> via a fastener <b>54</b> through a bearing plate <b>56</b>. The bearing plate <b>56</b> is in turn affixed to the drive wheel <b>20</b> via a fastener <b>58</b> through the spokes <b>26</b>. The bearing plate <b>56</b> allows for axial rotation of the push rim <b>28</b> and push ring <b>30</b> in relation to the spokes <b>26</b> of the drive wheel <b>20</b> to engage the in-hub braking system <b>34</b>. The hub shell <b>36</b> rotates against a quick release axle pin <b>63</b> via bearings <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, the brake shell <b>62</b> contains the braking surface <b>60</b>. The brake shell <b>62</b> may be affixed to a camber block <b>66</b>. The camber block <b>66</b> may be mounted in relation to the frame <b>16</b> of the wheelchair <b>10</b> in a fixed manner as to not allow for rotation of the brake shell <b>62</b> in relation to the frame <b>16</b>. For example, the camber block <b>66</b> may be mounted in relation to a camber tube (not shown), as is well known in the art, which may be mounted in a fixed manner in relation to the frame <b>16</b>. It should be appreciated that the brake shell <b>62</b> may be mounted in a fixed manner in relation to an axle sleeve (not shown), as is well known in the art, so as to not allow for rotation of the brake shell <b>62</b> in relation to the frame <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A hollow axle housing <b>68</b> may be pressed into the union of brake shell <b>62</b> and camber block <b>66</b> and attached to the hollow axle housing <b>68</b> and the brake shell <b>62</b> via an axle nut <b>70</b>. The drive wheel <b>20</b> supporting the braking system <b>34</b> is affixed or supported in relation to the brake shell <b>62</b> via the quick release axle pin <b>63</b> through the hollow axle housing <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In operation, by applying force to the push rim <b>28</b> in a rearward direction opposed to the forward rotation of the drive wheel <b>20</b>, the push ring <b>30</b> and the bearing plate <b>56</b> rotate and engage the activation lever <b>50</b> (in a clockwise direction when viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), which in turn rotates the cam stud <b>40</b> and expands the brake pads <b>38</b> into the inner circumference of the braking surface <b>60</b>. This creates mechanical amplification of the direct force applied by the wheelchair user. Upon release of the push rim <b>28</b>, the return spring <b>32</b> pulls the push ring <b>30</b> into a neutral position (in a counter-clockwise direction when viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) against a positive stop <b>31</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, thus disengaging the activation lever <b>50</b> and releasing the brake pads <b>38</b> from the inner circumference of the braking surface <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Accordingly, the wheelchair <b>10</b> may use a quick release drive wheel <b>20</b>, with brake pads <b>38</b> inside the hub <b>21</b>. The brake pads <b>38</b> may interface with a braking surface <b>60</b> supported in relation to the frame <b>16</b> of the wheelchair <b>10</b>, such as by a camber tube or an axle block (not shown). The drive wheels <b>20</b> may be machined and pressed from billet aluminum so as to be hollowed-out. A drum brake mechanism inside the drive wheel <b>20</b> may be activated by a floating push rim <b>28</b>, which is mounted to a rotating bearing surface (e.g., via bearing plate <b>56</b>) at the hub <b>21</b>, with a return spring <b>32</b> supported in relation to the perimeter of the tire <b>22</b>. The braking surface <b>60</b> may be supported in relation to the frame <b>16</b> of the wheelchair <b>10</b> so as to maintain standard camber and width.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The push rim <b>28</b> engages a positive stop <b>31</b> on the drive wheel <b>20</b> to normally propel the drive wheel <b>20</b> in a forward direction, effectively without being aware that the push rim <b>28</b> is not actually attached to the drive wheel <b>20</b>. It is not until slowing the drive wheel <b>20</b> down that the push rim <b>28</b> articulates, with the braking system <b>34</b> engaging simply by applying friction to the push rim <b>28</b>. Application of the brakes is akin to applying backwards pressure on the pedals of a coaster-brake equipped bicycle. The torque applied to the push rim <b>28</b> due to the forward momentum of the wheelchair overcomes the force of the return springs <b>32</b>, and articulates backwards. There may be less than 1.18 inches (3 cm) of articulation to engage the brake pads <b>38</b> against the braking surface <b>60</b> and slow down the wheelchair <b>10</b>. This movement may be virtually undetectable until the user comes to a complete stop and releases the push rim <b>28</b>. At this point, the push rim <b>28</b> may return back to a neutral position to release the brake pads <b>38</b>. Reversing in the wheelchair <b>10</b> is unaffected by the braking system <b>34</b>, with the torque applied to the push rim <b>28</b> being less than the force of the return spring <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The braking system <b>34</b> allows a wheelchair user to quickly and easily maintain speed, slow down, and stop as desired. The braking system <b>34</b> allows users to maintain their hands on the drive wheels <b>20</b> in many different and challenging environments, including users with low-dexterity, to users with high-function.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the principle and mode of operation of this invention have been explained and illustrated in its preferred embodiment. However, it must be understood that this invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically explained and illustrated without departing from its spirit or scope.</p>
