<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to an illumination device using a light emitting element such as a light emitting diode (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;LED&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a conventional illumination device using a light emitting element such as an LED, countermeasures are taken to make it waterproof in consideration of the outdoor installation. At least one waterproofing technique has previously been employed in which a case is filled with a transparent resin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-302483 discloses an illumination device providing: a substrate with an LED mounted thereon; and a transparent and nearly box-shaped case with a back surface formed as an opening, wherein: the substrate is stored in the case from the opening; the substrate is supported with a space provided between the substrate and a front inner wall of the case; a transparent filling material is injected and filled in the case along a following path from the opening to the case; the filling material is cured to fix the substrate and the case integrally; and thus the LED along with the substrate are embedded in the filling material in the case and hermetically sealed, thereby ensuring a sufficient waterproof property. When the LED is lighted, the light is emitted through the transparent filling material and the case.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A white or blue-colored LED used for the purpose of the illumination typically has a structure in which an LED chip that emits blue light (light with wavelength of approximately 380 to 480 nm) is sealed with a resin containing a phosphor (e.g., silicon, epoxy). The conversion to a desired color of light is performed by means of the light with a wavelength region of approximately 480 to 780 nm that is converted by exciting the phosphor by the blue light emitted from the LED chip, and blue light that passes through the resin without being converted. Also, in the conversion to a desired color of light, the color of light is adjusted by, for example, changing a mixing ratio of the phosphor in the case where a top surface of the sealing resin containing the phosphor is an air layer. It is not premised on filling the top surface of the sealing resin containing the phosphor with the transparent resin (e.g., silicon).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the case that stores the LED is filled with translucent silicon for the purpose of waterproofing, a refractive index of the sealing resin for the LED is almost equal to that of the silicon to be filled for the purpose of waterproofing. Therefore, there is a problem that the color temperature significantly shifts to a side of high color temperature due to a difference of the ratio between the light converted by exciting the phosphor by the blue light emitted from the LED chip, and the blue light that passes through without being converted, as compared to the case where the top surface of the sealing resin containing the phosphor is the air layer. An increase of the ratio of the blue light makes a white LED appear to be bluish white, and a bulb-colored LED appear to be yellowish white.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide an illumination device capable of correcting the color temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In light of this object, in a particular embodiment of the present invention an LED assembly is provided which includes a substrate with a plurality of coatings applied on a respective plurality of surface portions of a base material. A light emitting device includes one or more light emitting elements of a first color temperature mounted on surface portions of the substrate having a first color coating, and one or more light emitting elements having a second color temperature mounted on surface portions of the substrate having a second color coating. Light emitting elements are individually sealed with a resin containing an excitable phosphor, with a reflectance factor of the first color coating and a reflectance factor of the second color coating set corresponding to light emitted from the light emitting elements having the first and second color temperatures, respectively, with respect to a desired color temperature for the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The assembly may in some aspects further include a translucent resin applied on the light emitting device and the substrate, the translucent resin having a refractive index and correspondingly effective to suppress variations in color temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the assembly may include a transparent case encompassing the light emitting device, the substrate and the translucent resin applied on the light emitting device and the substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a structure of a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an illumination device includes a light emitting device <b>1</b> such as for example an LED <b>1</b>, an LED mounting substrate <b>2</b> on which the LED is mounted, a case <b>3</b> for storing them, and a translucent filling material <b>4</b> such as resin <b>4</b> (e.g., silicon) for filling the inside of the case <b>3</b>. The translucent filling material <b>4</b> may in fact be entirely transparent in alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The LED <b>1</b> comprising the light emitting device may be provided with a blue LED chip <b>5</b> which emits light with a wavelength of approximately 380 to 480 nm, the blue LED chip sealed with a resin <b>6</b> (e.g., silicon) containing a phosphor. One sealing resin <b>6</b> may encompass a plurality of LED chips <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The substrate <b>2</b> on which the LED <b>1</b> is mounted comprises a base material <b>7</b>, and a coating (ink) <b>8</b> applied on the base material <b>7</b>. The LED <b>1</b> and the substrate <b>2</b> are embedded and hermetically sealed in the resin <b>4</b>. The case <b>3</b> is transparent, so that, upon lighting the LED <b>1</b>, the light therefrom is emitted through the translucent resin <b>4</b> and the case <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Conventionally, a white coating (ink) has been generally used as the coating (ink) <b>8</b> to apply on the base material <b>7</b>, in consideration of a reflection efficiency for reflecting light reflected by the case <b>3</b> and an air layer at the surface of the substrate <b>2</b> to emit the light to the outside of the case <b>3</b>; whereas a yellow coating (ink) is applied in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, the substrate surface reflects only light within a high luminosity region (yellow light) and absorbs the blue light among the light reflected by the case <b>3</b> and the air layer. This can reduce the shift of the color temperature to a higher color temperature, without decreasing an optical output.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In alternative embodiments, the same effect as those described above can be achieved by applying on the substrate surface a substance such as a film <b>8</b> which reflects the light within a high luminosity region and absorbs the blue light, instead of coating the base material <b>7</b> with the ink <b>8</b>. Such effect also can be achieved by employing a translucent material other than a resin as the resin <b>4</b> for filling the case <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, references <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>c </i>are LED mounting substrates of the illumination devices different from one another. When the LEDs <b>1</b> of a plurality of illumination devices have different color temperatures respectively (i.e., A, B and C depicted in the figure have the different color temperatures), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the adjustment of a coloration of the coatings (ink) to be applied on the substrate surfaces of the mounting substrates <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the LEDs <b>1</b> can suppress the variation among the color temperatures of the illumination devices. Specifically, a substrate surface having the LED with a low color temperature is colored not to absorb the blue light (for example, white), and a substrate surface having the LED with a high color temperature is colored to absorb the blue light (for example, yellow). Thereby, the variation of the color temperatures can be suppressed among a plurality of illumination devices.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, references <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c </i>are coatings (ink) having different colors respectively, which are applied on the surface of the LED mounting substrate <b>2</b> of the illumination device. When the LEDs <b>1</b> of a single illumination device have different color temperatures respectively (i.e., A, B and C depicted in the figure have different color temperatures), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the adjustment of a coloration of the coatings (ink) <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c </i>to be applied on the substrate surface of the mounting substrate <b>2</b> of the LEDs <b>1</b> can suppress the variation of the color temperatures inside of the illumination device. Specifically, the portion of the substrate upon which the LED with a low color temperature is mounted and the periphery thereof are colored not to absorb blue light (for example, white), and the portion of the substrate upon which the LED with a high color temperature is mounted and the periphery thereof are colored to absorb the blue light (for example, yellow). Thereby, the variation of the color temperatures can be suppressed inside of the illumination device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the translucent filling material <b>4</b> of the LED assembly comprises a material <b>9</b> (e.g., a pigment) that absorbs blue light and that is added in the resin <b>4</b>. This allows the blue light to be absorbed by the material <b>9</b> contained in the resin <b>4</b>, thereby enabling the reduction of the shift of the color temperature to a higher color temperature. Furthermore, adjustment of a compounding ratio of the material <b>9</b> that absorbs the blue light enables the color temperature to be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the translucent filling material <b>4</b> of the LED assembly further comprises a phosphor <b>10</b> that converts blue light (light with wavelength of approximately 380 to 480 nm) to light with a wavelength region of approximately 480 to 780 nm. This structure allows the blue light to be converted to the light with the wavelength region of approximately 480 to 780 nm by exciting the phosphor <b>10</b> contained in the resin <b>4</b>. This can reduce the shift of the color temperature to a higher color temperature. In addition, converting the blue light to the light with the wavelength of approximately 480 to 780 nm can increase an optical output in comparison to some alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The translucent filling material <b>4</b> may in certain embodiments comprise both of the phosphor <b>10</b> and the pigment <b>9</b> in conjunction with each other. An adjustment of the mixing ratio between the phosphor <b>10</b> and the pigment <b>9</b> within the translucent filling material <b>4</b> or resin <b>4</b> further enables the color temperature to be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment of the LED assembly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the substrate <b>2</b> on which a plurality of LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>are mounted includes a base material <b>7</b> and yellow coatings (ink) <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c </i>applied on the base material <b>7</b>, and is disposed at an opening of the transparent case <b>3</b>. The LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>as the light emitting devices are provided with blue LED chips that emit the light with wavelength of approximately 380 to 480 nm, and the blue LED chips are sealed with a resin (for example, silicon) containing a phosphor. In this case, the LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>emit the light varied from one another, and the relationship thereof shall be (a color temperature of the light emitted from the LED <b>1</b><i>a</i>)&#x3e;(a color temperature of the light emitted from the LED <b>1</b><i>b</i>)&#x3e;(a color temperature of the light emitted from the LED <b>1</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inner space of the case <b>3</b> is filled with the translucent filling resins (for example, silicon) <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>c </i>within the respective portions where a plurality of LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>are mounted. The presetting is now made so as to be (a refractive index of the resin <b>4</b><i>a</i>)&#x3e;(a refractive index of the resin <b>4</b><i>b</i>)&#x3e;(a refractive index of the resin <b>4</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the filling is performed onto the LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>with the translucent filling resins <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>c</i>, the emission colors thereof shift to blue. The shift to blue, however, can be reduced by means of the yellow coatings (ink) <b>8</b><i>a, </i><b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The presetting is now made so as to be (a color temperature of the yellow coating <b>8</b><i>a</i>)&#x3c;(a color temperature of the yellow coating <b>8</b><i>b</i>)&#x3c;(a color temperature of the yellow coating <b>8</b><i>c</i>). The higher the color temperatures of the yellow coatings (ink) <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c </i>become, the more the substrate <b>2</b> absorbs the blue light, thereby reducing the shift to blue. Also, the lower the refractive indices of the translucent filling resins <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>c </i>become (the nearer the refractive index of the air become), the more the shift to blue is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, as shown in the present embodiment, even if the LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>emit light having varying color temperatures from one another, the variation of the color temperatures in the illumination device can be suppressed by adjusting the color temperatures of the yellow coatings (ink) <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c </i>applied on the base material <b>7</b>, as well as the refractive indices of the translucent filling resins <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, adjustment of the coloration of the coatings applied on the LED mounting substrate and the refractive indices of the filling resins can suppress the variation of the color temperatures in the illumination device with greater reliability and less cost than alternative methods.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a structure of another embodiment of the LED assembly. The substrate <b>2</b> on which a plurality of LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>are mounted includes the base material <b>7</b> and the coatings (ink) <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c </i>applied on the base material <b>7</b>, and is disposed at an opening of the transparent case <b>3</b>. The LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>as the light emitting devices are provided with blue LED chips that emit the light with wavelength of approximately 380 to 480 nm, and the blue LED chips are sealed with a resin (for example, silicon) containing a phosphor. In this case, the LEDs <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>emit the light varied from one another, and the relationship thereof shall be (a color temperature of the light emitted from the LED <b>1</b><i>a</i>)=(a color temperature of the light emitted from the LED <b>1</b><i>c</i>)&#x3e;&#x3e;(a color temperature of the light emitted from the LED <b>1</b><i>b</i>); the LED <b>1</b><i>a </i>and LED <b>1</b><i>c </i>at both ends of the substrate have desired color temperatures, and the LED <b>1</b><i>b </i>in the middle of the substrate has an extremely low color temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, the coatings (ink) <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>c </i>on the periphery of the LEDs <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>at both ends of the substrate are the ones having lower reflectance factors to the blue light, such as yellow. In contrast, the coating (ink) <b>8</b><i>b </i>on the periphery of the LED <b>1</b><i>b </i>in the middle of the substrate is the one having a higher reflectance factor to the blue light, such as white or blue. This structure also includes a coating material <b>4</b><i>b </i>(such as silicon) being applied on the substrate surface (the coating <b>8</b><i>b</i>) on the periphery of the LED <b>1</b><i>b </i>in the middle of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Here, when the filling is performed onto the LED <b>1</b><i>b </i>with a translucent filling material <b>4</b><i>b </i>or translucent coating material <b>4</b><i>b </i>such as a translucent resin <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the emission color thereof shifts to blue. Furthermore, since the coating (ink) <b>8</b><i>b </i>with a higher reflectance factor to the blue light increases the reflection of the blue light, the light coming from the coating material <b>4</b><i>b </i>can be shifted to blue. This enables the color temperature thereof to shift to the higher temperature, thereby making it possible to be brought closer to the color temperatures of the LEDs <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>on both ends of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Changing the coloration of the coatings on the mounting substrate for the LEDs and coating a part of LEDs with the filling resin can suppress the variation of the color temperatures in the illumination device, even if employing the LEDs with the color temperatures different from one another in the illumination device that requires no filling resin.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the present embodiment permits selection of a color temperature of the LED <b>1</b> that is lower than that required for use in the illumination device as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other words, in consideration of the shift of the color temperature after the filling with the resin <b>4</b> in order to be waterproof, the color temperature is previously shifted. Specifically, the adjustment is performed for the compounding ratio of the phosphor that is a constituent of the LED <b>1</b>, and the color temperature is set to be lower.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an operation of another embodiment of the LED assembly. In the figure, (a) is a spectrum required as the illumination device, (b) is a spectrum of the light emitting device (the LED <b>1</b>), and (c) is a spectrum after the light emitting device (the LED <b>1</b>) is filled with the resin <b>4</b> to be waterproof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) is an explanatory diagram of the operation of a comparative example, in which the spectrum required as the illumination device and the spectrum of the light emitting device (the LED <b>1</b>) correspond to each other. Thus, the filling of the light emitting device (the LED <b>1</b>) with the resin <b>4</b> to be waterproof makes the color temperature shift due to the filling, thereby rendering the color temperature different from the one required as the illumination device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) is an explanatory diagram of the operation of the present embodiment, in which spectrum required as the illumination device and spectrum after the light emitting device (the LED <b>1</b>) is filled with the resin <b>4</b> to be waterproof correspond to each other. Although the spectrum required as the illumination device differs from the spectrum of the light emitting device (the LED <b>1</b>), the filling the light emitting device (the LED <b>1</b>) with the resin <b>4</b> to be waterproof makes the color temperature shift due to the filling, thereby achieving the color temperature required as the illumination device.</p>

Nonetheless it is possible to provide the illumination device with the color temperature of 5000K (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the case of the bulb-colored LED, when the color temperature of 2800K is required for the illumination device and the color temperature of an output flux of the LED <b>1</b> is 2800K, employing the waterproof structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> results in the shift of the color temperature to 3100K. Then, the color temperature of the LED <b>1</b> is previously selected at a lower color temperature of the order of, for example, 2500K. The filling of the resin to be waterproof makes the color temperature shift to higher temperature. Nonetheless it is possible to provide the illumination device with the color temperature of 2800K (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By use of embodiments described above, the color temperature can be corrected as desired and necessary for the illumination device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thus, although there have been described particular embodiments of the present invention of a new and useful LED Assembly with Color Correcting Substrate it is not intended that such references be construed as limitations upon the scope of this invention except as set forth in the following claims.</p>
