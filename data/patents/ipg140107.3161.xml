However, in the current embodiment, carriers may be moved into the second wall layer W<b>2</b> more close to the first conductive type semiconductor layer <b>117</b> than the first well layer W<b>1</b> to improve injection efficiency of the carrier into the second well layer W<b>2</b> and recombination of the carrier.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Also, the first well layer W<b>1</b> may be disposed at a position more close to the second clad layer <b>121</b> than the second well layer W<b>2</b> and disposed between the first and second barrier layers B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> adjacent to the second clad layer <b>121</b>. The carriers injected from the second clad layer <b>121</b> i.e., holes may be further induced into the second well layer W<b>2</b> adjacent to the first well layer W<b>1</b>. The first well layer W<b>1</b> may be defined as a hole guide well layer. Also, the second clad layer <b>121</b> is formed at a relatively low temperature when compared to that of the active layer <b>119</b>. Thus, the crystalline of the first well layer W<b>1</b> may be deteriorated by a change of the temperature.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first well layer W<b>1</b> may have a thickness T<b>1</b> thinner than that T<b>1</b> of the second well layer W<b>2</b>.

As a result, the height of the second barrier layer B<b>2</b> may be decreased to reduce the restriction of the carrier into the first well layer W<b>1</b>. Thus, the hole injection efficiency may be increased in the second well layer W<b>2</b> to improve the hole recombination. Therefore, light having a short wavelength is not nearly emitted from the first well layer W<b>1</b> to prevent a width of a spectrum from being increased. In the current embodiment, a more amount of light may be emitted from the second well layer W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first well layer W<b>1</b> may have a thickness T<b>3</b> thinner than that T<b>1</b> of each of other well layers W<b>2</b> and <b>131</b>.

A thickness difference between the second well layer W<b>2</b> and the second barrier layer B<b>2</b> may be below about 5 nm, for example, ranges from about 2 nm to about 3 nm. The holes injected into the first well layer W<b>1</b> may easily escape and be easily injected into the second well layer W<b>2</b> due to the thickness T<b>3</b> of the first well layer W<b>1</b>. Thus, the thickness T<b>3</b> of the first well layer W<b>1</b> may be a critical value for improving the intensity of light emitted from the second well layer W<b>2</b>.

Similarly, when the thickness T<b>3</b> of the first well layer W<b>1</b> is increased (T<b>3</b>&#x3c;T<b>1</b>), the minimum value of the recombination energy level may be increased to an H<b>3</b>. Since the minimum value of the recombination energy level may be increased by adjusting the thickness T<b>3</b> and the band gap G<b>3</b> of the first well layer W<b>1</b>, the holes injected into the first well layer W<b>1</b> may escape by geometric progression and be moved into the second well layer W<b>2</b>, thereby allow the holes and electrons to be recombined with each other.

Here, the thickness T<b>5</b> of the second barrier layer B<b>22</b> may be a critical value at which tunneling does not occur. Thus, the holes escaping from the first well layer W<b>21</b> may reduce losses by heat or non-light emitting combination while passing through the second barrier layer B<b>22</b> to improve optical output by the second well layer W<b>22</b>. Also, since the second barrier layer B<b>22</b> has the thin thickness T<b>5</b>, a resistance of the second barrier layer B<b>22</b> may be reduced when compared to that of the first barrier layer B<b>21</b>.</p>

The first well layer W<b>31</b> may have the same bang gap as that of the other well layer <b>131</b>. Thus, a minimum value of a recombination energy level of the first well layer W<b>31</b> may be an H<b>7</b> and less than an H<b>2</b> that is a reference value.
