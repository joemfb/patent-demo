<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of an expansion card mounting apparatus for mounting an expansion card <b>80</b> includes an enclosure <b>10</b>, a securing member <b>20</b>, a pressing member <b>50</b>, and a mounting plate <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The expansion card <b>80</b> includes a card body <b>81</b>. The card body <b>81</b> includes a first side <b>811</b> and a second side <b>812</b> adjacent to the first side <b>811</b>.

In one embodiment, the expansion card <b>80</b> is graphic card.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The enclosure <b>10</b> includes a bottom panel <b>11</b> and a rear panel <b>13</b> extending perpendicularly from the bottom panel <b>11</b>. A printed circuit board <b>113</b> is mounted on the bottom panel <b>11</b>. The printed circuit board <b>113</b> includes an inserting slot <b>1131</b> corresponding to the inserting terminal <b>813</b>. The rear panel <b>13</b> includes a rear panel body <b>131</b> and a flange <b>133</b> extending from the rear panel body <b>131</b>. The rear panel <b>13</b> further includes a mounting portion <b>15</b> extending from the rear panel body <b>131</b>. The mounting portion <b>15</b> defines a plurality of slots <b>151</b>. The mounting portion <b>15</b> includes a support plate <b>153</b> extending perpendicularly from the rear panel body <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The securing member <b>20</b> includes a securing element <b>30</b> and two positioning elements <b>40</b>. The securing element <b>30</b> is rotatably mounted to the mounting portion <b>15</b>. Each of the two positioning elements <b>40</b> is rotatably mounted to the mounting portion <b>15</b>. The securing element <b>30</b> defines a securing opening <b>311</b>. The securing element <b>30</b> is configured to press the bent portion <b>853</b> of the mounting plate <b>85</b> on the support plate <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pressing member <b>50</b> includes a resilient arm <b>51</b> and a securing portion <b>52</b> extending from the resilient arm <b>51</b>. The resilient arm <b>51</b> is arc-shaped. The resilient arm <b>51</b> includes a first end <b>511</b> and a second end <b>55</b>. The second end <b>55</b> is configured to engage with the securing opening <b>311</b> of the securing element <b>30</b>. The pressing member <b>50</b> further includes a handling portion <b>53</b> extending from the second end <b>55</b>. The handling portion <b>53</b> includes a connecting arm <b>531</b> extending from the second end <b>55</b> and a first pressing tab <b>533</b> extending from the connecting arm <b>531</b>. The securing portion <b>52</b> includes an extending arm <b>521</b>, a second pressing tab <b>523</b> extending from the extending arm <b>521</b>, and a securing protrusion <b>525</b> extending from the extending arm <b>521</b>. The securing protrusion <b>525</b> is L-shaped. The securing protrusion <b>525</b> is configured to engage with the flange <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, in assembly, the expansion card <b>80</b> is moved towards the enclosure <b>10</b>. The inserting terminal <b>813</b> of the expansion card <b>80</b> is inserted into the inserting slot <b>1131</b> of the printed circuit board <b>113</b>. The mounting plate body <b>851</b> of the mounting plate <b>85</b> covers corresponding plurality of slots <b>151</b> of the rear panel <b>13</b>. The bent portion <b>853</b> of the mounting plate <b>85</b> is located on the support plate <b>153</b> of the rear panel <b>13</b>. The securing element <b>30</b> is rotatably mounted to the mounting portion <b>15</b> of the rear panel <b>13</b>. The securing element <b>30</b> is located on the bent portion <b>853</b>. Each of the two positioning elements <b>40</b> is rotatably mounted to the mounting portion <b>15</b> and resists the securing element <b>30</b> to prevent the securing element <b>30</b> from rotating to move away from the bent portion <b>853</b>. The first end <b>511</b> of the resilient arm <b>51</b> of the pressing member <b>50</b> is located on the card body <b>81</b> of the expansion card <b>80</b> and the second end <b>55</b> of the resilient arm <b>51</b> engages with the securing opening <b>311</b> of the securing element <b>30</b>. The extending arm <b>521</b> of the securing portion <b>52</b> of the pressing member <b>50</b> is pressed down to enable the securing protrusion <b>525</b> to engage with the flange <b>133</b> of the rear panel <b>13</b>. Thus, the pressing member <b>50</b> is sandwiched between the flange <b>133</b> and the support plate <b>153</b>. At this time, the first end <b>511</b> resists on the card body <b>81</b> to prevent the card body <b>81</b> from moving along a direction perpendicular to the bottom panel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In disassembly, the first pressing tab <b>533</b> and the second pressing tab <b>523</b> are pressed to move close to each other. The second end <b>55</b> is driven to disengage from the securing opening <b>311</b>. The first end <b>511</b> is pulled up to move away from the card body <b>81</b>. The pressing member <b>50</b> is pulled to move away from the rear panel to enable the securing protrusion <b>525</b> to disengage from the flange <b>133</b>. Thereby, the pressing member <b>50</b> can be easily removed from the enclosure <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the embodiments have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and functions of the embodiments, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
