<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter disclosed herein relates to a neutral point clamped (NPC) power converter, and more specifically to a fault protection system for a NPC power converter.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Power converters are employed in many different power conversion applications such as, for example, variable speed drives, wind and solar converters, power supplies, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), and static synchronous compensators (STATCOM). The power converter is connected to a power grid through a line inductor, a circuit breaker, and a step-up transformer. In one type of power converter, a three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) topology is used. An NPC converter typically includes three phase legs and two series connected DC bus capacitors. Each phase leg includes four series connected switches, where each switch has a parallel freewheeling diode. Two additional diodes, which are referred to as NPC diodes, are connected between the leg and a DC bus mid-point.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the event one of the NPC diodes is inoperable, a short circuit condition may be created. The charging current, which is also referred to as the fault current, flows through one of the DC bus capacitors as well as through a number of the freewheeling diodes. The charging current will charge the capacitor and increase the voltage to a level that is significantly above the nominal conditions of the parallel freewheeling diodes and the DC bus capacitor. For example, the DC bus capacitor may have a nominal voltage of 1150 Volts, however the charging current may reach levels as high as about 1900 Volts. This may cause the power converter to become non-operational.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one approach, a crowbar circuit may be employed to protect the power converter in the event one of the NPC diodes is inoperable. The crowbar generally prevents current from flowing to a DC bus of the converter in the event a fault is detected. However, a crowbar circuit adds cost and complexity to the existing power converter as well.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the invention, a neutral point clamped (NPC) power converter fault protection system is provided, and include a DC bus, a switching network, and a control module.

Each of the at least two switches has an open position. The two NPC diodes are connected between a corresponding one of the at least two leg circuits and the DC bus. The control module is in communication with the switching network. The control module includes control logic for monitoring the switching network to detect a fault condition. The fault condition indicates that one of the two NPC diodes of the one of the at least two leg circuits is non-operational. The control module includes control logic for switching the at least two switches of each of the at least two circuit legs to the open position. The control module includes control logic for determining a position of a non-operational NPC diode if the fault condition is detected.

<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect of the invention, a method of controlling a neutral point clamped (NPC) power converter fault protection system is provided. The method includes providing a switching network connected to the DC bus. The switching network includes at least two leg circuits.

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;control module&#x201d; refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality. As used herein, the term &#x201c;freewheeling diode&#x201d; refers to a diode that is connected in parallel with a switch to provide a free path for an inductor current As used herein, the term &#x201c;NPC converter&#x201d; refers to a neutral point clamped power converter including at least two phase leg circuits and at least two series connected DC bus capacitors. Each leg circuit includes a plurality of series connected switches, where each switch has a corresponding parallel freewheeling diode. Two additional diodes, which are herein referred to as &#x201c;NPC diodes&#x201d;, are connected between each of the phase legs and a DC bus mid-point.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a portion of an exemplary NPC power converter fault protection system <b>10</b> including a NPC power converter <b>12</b> for supplying AC power to a power grid <b>20</b>. The NPC power converter <b>12</b> may be employed in a variety of power conversion applications such as, for example, variable speed drives, wind and solar converters, power supplies, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), and static synchronous compensators (STATCOM). The NPC power converter <b>12</b> is connected to the power grid <b>20</b> through line inductors <b>22</b>, a circuit breaker <b>24</b>, and a step-up transformer <b>26</b>. The circuit breaker <b>24</b> selectively connects the NPC power converter <b>12</b> to the power grid <b>20</b>. The NPC power converter <b>12</b> includes a switching network <b>30</b> that is connected to the circuit breaker <b>24</b> and a DC bus <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The switching network <b>30</b> may include at least two leg circuits, however in the exemplary embodiment as shown, the switching network <b>30</b> includes three leg circuits labeled as &#x2018;A&#x2019;, &#x2018;B&#x2019; and &#x2018;C&#x2019;. Each of the three leg circuits A, B and C include at least two switches connected together in series, however in the embodiment as illustrated each of the three leg circuits A, B and C include four switches that are connected in series and labeled S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>4C</sub>. Specifically, each of the switches S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>C4 </sub>in the leg circuit A are labeled as S<sub>1A</sub>, S<sub>2A</sub>, S<sub>3A</sub>, and S<sub>4A</sub>, the switches in leg circuit B as labeled as S<sub>1B</sub>, S<sub>2B</sub>, S<sub>3B</sub>, and S<sub>4B</sub>, and the switches in leg circuit C as labeled as S<sub>1C</sub>, S<sub>2C</sub>, S<sub>3C</sub>, and S<sub>4C</sub>. In the embodiment as illustrated, the switches S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>4C </sub>are single-pole single throw switches, however it is to be understood that other switching elements may be used as well, such as for example, transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each of the switching elements S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>4C </sub>includes a corresponding freewheeling diode that is connected in parallel with the switching element. Specifically, in the exemplary embodiment as illustrated, the freewheeling diodes D<sub>1A</sub>-D<sub>4C </sub>correspond to the switches S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>4C</sub>. For example, the freewheeling diode labeled D<sub>1A </sub>corresponds to switch S<sub>1A</sub>. Each of the leg circuits A, B and C also include two NPC diodes which are connected to a corresponding one of the leg circuits A, B, and C and the DC bus <b>32</b>. Specifically, leg circuit A includes NPC diodes D<sub>5A </sub>and D<sub>6A</sub>, leg circuit B includes NPC diodes D<sub>5B </sub>and D<sub>6B</sub>, and leg circuit C includes NPC diodes D<sub>5C </sub>and D<sub>6C</sub>. The NPC power converter <b>12</b> further includes two series connected capacitors C<sub>B1 </sub>and C<sub>B2 </sub>that are connected between a neutral point <b>40</b> and the DC bus <b>32</b>. In the exemplary embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the NPC power converter <b>12</b> is a three-level NPC type power converter having a total of twelve switches, eighteen diodes, and two capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A control module <b>42</b> is in communication with the NPC power converter <b>12</b> and the circuit breaker <b>24</b>. The control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for providing pulse width modulation (PWM) control to the NPC power converter <b>12</b>. In one example, space vector modulation may be used to control the switches S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>4C </sub>of the switching network <b>30</b>. The control module <b>42</b> also includes control logic for selectively connecting and disconnecting the circuit breaker <b>24</b> from the power grid <b>20</b>. The control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for monitoring the switching network <b>30</b> to detect a fault condition with one of the NPC diodes D<sub>5A</sub>-D<sub>6C</sub>. That is, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for determining a fault in any of the NPC diodes D<sub>5A</sub>-D<sub>6C </sub>located in any of the three leg circuits A, B, or C. For example, in one embodiment, a fault condition may be determined if only one of the NPC diodes D<sub>5A</sub>-D<sub>6C </sub>is desaturated, and a desaturation signal is received by the control module <b>42</b>. The fault condition indicates that one of the NPC diodes D<sub>5A</sub>-D<sub>6C </sub>are non-operational and act as a short circuit in the switching network <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the event a fault condition is detected, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for switching each of the switches S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>4C </sub>to an open position, where current is interrupted. The control module <b>42</b> also includes control logic for sending a disconnection signal to the circuit breaker <b>24</b> to disconnect the circuit breaker <b>24</b> from the power grid <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The control module <b>42</b> also includes control logic for determining a position of the non-operational NPC diode if the fault condition exists. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, NPC diode D<sub>5A </sub>is non-operational, and acts as a short circuit. The control module <b>42</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) includes control logic for determining that it is NPC diode D<sub>5A</sub>, which is located in leg circuit A, that is non-operational. Specifically, in the example as described, the switch S<sub>1A </sub>would send a desaturation signal to the control module <b>42</b>, which indicates the short circuit condition in NPC diode D<sub>5A</sub>. The control module <b>42</b> then sends a holding signal to the switch that corresponds to the non-operational diode. The holding signal maintains the switch corresponding to the non-operational diode in the open position. For example, in the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, because NPC diode D<sub>5A </sub>is non-operational, the switch S<sub>1A </sub>would be held in the open position. In the event NPC diode D<sub>6A </sub>is non-operational, then the switch S<sub>4A </sub>would be held or maintained in the open position. It should be noted that while NPC diode D<sub>5A </sub>is shown as the non-operational NPC diode, it is understood that NPC diodes D<sub>5B</sub>-D<sub>6C </sub>may also be the non-operational NPC diode as well.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for selecting a modulation or switching scheme based on the position of the non-operational NPC diode. A variety of different switching schemes are available. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is one embodiment of a switching scheme that is used if the fault condition exists. In the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, NPC diode D<sub>5A </sub>is non-operational. The switching scheme as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> diverts a line current i<sub>A </sub>from the neutral point <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the exemplary embodiment as shown, two of the switches in each of the leg circuits A, B and C that are positioned closest to the line inductors <b>22</b> are switched to the closed position to allow the flow of current. Specifically, in the embodiment as illustrated, switches S<sub>3A</sub>, S<sub>4A</sub>, S<sub>3B</sub>, S<sub>4B</sub>, S<sub>3C </sub>and S<sub>4C </sub>are all in the closed position. The remaining switches (which are illustrated in phantom line) are in the open position. The line current flowing through the switches S<sub>3A</sub>, S<sub>4A</sub>, S<sub>3B</sub>, S<sub>4B</sub>, S<sub>3C </sub>and S<sub>4C </sub>is about the same as the fault current. The fault current is determined by the inductance of the line inductors <b>22</b> (which may include a transformer leakage inductance), as well as the voltage of the corresponding capacitor C<sub>B1</sub>, which is voltage V<sub>CB1</sub>. If NPC diode D<sub>5A </sub>was the non-operational diode, then the voltage V<sub>CB1 </sub>of capacitor C<sub>B1 </sub>would be used instead. In one embodiment, the fault current may range from about five to about ten times the nominal current, however the switching scheme as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> substantially presents the capacitors C<sub>B1 </sub>and C<sub>B2 </sub>from reaching a voltage value that may create damage or cause the capacitors C<sub>B1 </sub>and C<sub>B2 </sub>to become non-operational. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a space vector diagram illustrating the grid voltage <b>50</b> and the power converter voltage <b>52</b> when the switching scheme shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is employed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the power converter voltage is about zero volts. Once the switching scheme has been executed, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for disconnecting the circuit breaker <b>24</b>, and the NPC power converter <b>12</b> is now in safe mode.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another switching scheme, assuming NPC diode D<sub>5A </sub>is non-operational, the switching scheme has switch S<sub>1A </sub>in the open position and switches S<sub>3A </sub>and S<sub>4A </sub>in the closed position. The remaining switches S<sub>1B</sub>-S<sub>4C </sub>in leg circuits B and C may be switched using an approach as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which is another space vector diagram. That is, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, leg circuit A, which is positioned closest to the two capacitors C<sub>B1 </sub>and C<sub>B2 </sub>and closest to the corresponding line inductor <b>22</b> of leg circuit A, has switches S<sub>3A </sub>and S<sub>4A</sub>.

The term &#x201c;ON&#x201d; means that a switch is closed or conducting, and the term &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; means that a switch is open or not conducting. For example, with reference to Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, in the event the switching state &#x201c;&#x2212;11&#x2212;1&#x201d; is selected (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), this means that in leg circuit A, switches S<sub>3A </sub>and S<sub>4A </sub>are ON or closed, in leg circuit B switches S<sub>1B </sub>and S<sub>2B </sub>are ON or closed, and in leg circuit C switches S<sub>3C </sub>and S<sub>4C </sub>are ON or closed.
</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is yet another embodiment of a switching scheme illustrated as a space vector diagram. In this approach, the switch S<sub>1A </sub>must not be in the ON or closed position. However, the other three switches in the leg circuit A, S<sub>2A</sub>, S<sub>3A </sub>and S<sub>4A</sub>, may be in either the open or the closed position. The switches in the other leg circuits B and C may also be in either the open or closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a process flow diagram of an exemplary method of operating the NPC power converter fault protection system <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>). An exemplary process of operating the NPC power converter fault protection system <b>10</b> is generally indicated by reference number <b>100</b>. Process <b>100</b> begins at <b>102</b>, where the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for detecting a fault condition. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> and <b>6</b>, the fault condition indicates that one of the two NPC diodes of one of the three leg circuits A, B, or C, is non-operational. Process <b>100</b> may then proceed to <b>104</b>. In <b>104</b>, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for switching each of the switches S<sub>1A</sub>-S<sub>4C </sub>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to the open position. Process <b>100</b> may then proceed to <b>106</b>. In <b>106</b>, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for determining a position of a non-operational NPC diode if the fault condition is detected. Process <b>100</b> may then proceed to <b>108</b>. In <b>108</b>, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for sending a holding signal to the switch that corresponds to the non-operational NPC diode. The holding signal maintains the switch that corresponds to the non-operational NPC diode in the open position. Process <b>100</b> may then proceed to step <b>110</b>. In step <b>110</b>, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for selecting a modulation or switching scheme based on the position of the non-operational NPC diode. A variety of different switching schemes are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>. Process <b>100</b> may then proceed to step <b>112</b>. In step <b>112</b>, the control module <b>42</b> includes control logic for disconnecting the circuit breaker <b>24</b> from the power grid <b>20</b>. Process <b>100</b> may then terminate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The above described system and method of operating the NPC power converter fault protection system <b>10</b> provides reduced voltage to capacitors C<sub>B1 </sub>and C<sub>B2 </sub>(in the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>) or a reduced fault current (in the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-5</figref>). The NPC power converter fault protection system <b>10</b> provides reduced cost when compared to some of the power converter protection systems that are currently available, such as a crowbar circuit. Also, the total cost of the NPC power converter <b>12</b> may be reduced because the switches and line inductors <b>22</b> may have a reduced current rating as well.</p>
