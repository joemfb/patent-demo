<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional U.S. patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0101127, filed on Oct. 15, 2008, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The general inventive concept relates to display apparatuses and methods of driving the same. At least some example embodiments relate to electronic paper display apparatuses and methods of driving the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid crystal display (LCD) devices, plasma display panels (PDPs), and organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) are examples of related art display apparatuses. These related art display apparatuses use an additional light source (e.g., in the case of LCDs) or emit light themselves (e.g., in the case of PDPs and OLEDs) to display images. As a result, driving related art display apparatuses, such as LCDs, PDPs, or OLEDs, results in relatively high power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electronic paper (e-paper) display apparatuses have been suggested as an alternative to the above-described related art display apparatuses. An electronic paper display apparatus is a reflective-type display apparatus that need not include an additional light source, and thus, has relatively low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Electronic paper display apparatuses generally include two types of fine particles charged to opposite electrical polarities arranged between two electrodes. For example, an electronic paper display apparatus may include black particles and white particles. The black particles may be charged to have a negative polarity and the white particles may be charged to have a positive polarity. In this example, when a positive voltage is applied to the electrode located on a display surface, the black particles are drawn to the display surface, whereas the white particles are forced away from the display surface. As a result, black color is displayed on a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an electronic paper display apparatus, a previous state may be maintained by an internal balance between the positively charged particles the negatively charged particles. Accordingly, an electronic paper display apparatus may maintain a previous image even when a voltage is not applied.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more example embodiments provide display apparatuses having improved response speeds, and methods of driving the same.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At least one example embodiment provides a display apparatus. The display apparatus may include a plurality of pixels. Each of the plurality of pixels may include a cell having particles charged to have different polarities from each other. Each of the plurality of pixels may further include a first transistor and a second transistor. The first transistor may be configured to adjust a magnitude of a voltage applied to the cell. The second transistor may be configured to adjust a period during which the voltage is applied to the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to at least some example embodiments, when the first transistor is turned on, a potential difference between both ends of the cell is generated so that the charged particles move in the cell. When the second transistor is turned on, the electric potential at each end of the cell is equalized or substantially equalized so that the charged particles stop moving in the cell. The voltage applied to the cell and a difference between the switching times of the first and second transistors may be determined according to a gray level to be represented by the corresponding pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to at least some example embodiments, each of the plurality of pixels may further include a capacitor. The capacitor may be charged when the first transistor is turned on, but discharged when the second transistor is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At least one other example embodiment provides a display apparatus. The display apparatus may include a first electrode, a second electrode, and a cell disposed between the first and second electrodes. The cell may include particles charged to have different polarities from each other. The display apparatus may further include a first transistor, a second transistor, and a capacitor, each of which may be electrically connected to the second electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to at least some example embodiments, drains of the first and second transistors may be electrically connected to the second electrode. An end (or terminal) of the capacitor may be electrically connected to the second electrode, and another end (or terminal) of the capacitor may be electrically connected to ground. The capacitor may be charged when the first transistor is turned on, and discharged when the second transistor is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to at least some example embodiments, the display apparatus may further include a source driving unit connected to a source of the first transistor and a first gate driving unit connected to a gate of the first transistor. A second gate driving unit may be connected to a gate of the second transistor. A control unit may be configured to control operations of the source driving unit, the first gate driving unit, and/or the second gate driving unit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to at least some example embodiments, the first gate driving unit may switch the first transistor according to control of the control unit, and the second gate driving unit may switch the second transistor according to the control of the control unit. The source driving unit may generate a driving voltage according to the control of the control unit and apply the generated driving voltage to the source of the first transistor. A magnitude of the driving voltage generated by the source driving unit and a difference between the switching times of the first and second transistors may be determined by the control unit according to a gray level that is to be represented. The control unit may refer to a correlation between the gray level that is to be represented when determining the driving voltage and the switching times.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating general principles for operating an electronic paper display apparatus according to an example embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref> illustrate a portion of a pixel of a display apparatus according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref>, a pixel <b>10</b> may include: a common electrode <b>15</b>; a pixel electrode <b>14</b>; and a cell of transparent fluid <b>11</b> arranged between the common electrode <b>15</b> and the pixel electrode <b>14</b>. The cell of transparent fluid <b>11</b> may include two kinds or types of fine particles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>. The two types of fine particles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> may move in the cell of transparent fluid <b>11</b>. The fine particles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> may be charged to have opposite (positive and negative) polarities. For example, negatively charged first fine particles <b>12</b> may be black, whereas positively charged second fine particles <b>13</b> may be white. Hereinafter, example embodiments will be described assuming that the negatively charged particles are black and the positively charged particles are white. However, example embodiments are not limited thereto. Rather, the above setting may be changed according to selection by a designer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the common electrode <b>15</b> arranged toward an observer may be a transparent electrode that transmits light. The pixel electrode <b>14</b> may be arranged opposite to the common electrode <b>15</b>. The pixel electrode <b>14</b> may include a first pixel electrode <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a ,second pixel electrode <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The pixel electrode <b>14</b> need not be transparent. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, an associated circuit may be further arranged under the pixel electrode <b>14</b> to selectively apply voltages (or voltage pulses) to the pixel electrode <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, when a positive voltage is applied to both the first and second pixel electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the negatively charged first particles <b>12</b> gather around (or near) the pixel electrode <b>14</b>, whereas the positively charged second particles <b>13</b> gather around (or near) the common electrode <b>15</b>. As a result, the pixel <b>10</b> displays (and the observer, e.g., a user) sees white reflective light through the common electrode <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, when a positive voltage is applied to the first pixel electrode <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a negative voltage is applied to the second pixel electrode <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the first and second particles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> may gather evenly (or substantially evenly) around (or near) the pixel electrode <b>14</b> and the common electrode <b>15</b>. As a result, the pixel <b>10</b> displays a gray color. Only one gray color is discussed with regard to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. However, a plurality of gray levels may be realized by controlling the driving voltage applied to the electrodes <b>14</b> and/or <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, when a negative voltage is applied to the first and second pixel electrodes <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the negatively charged first particles <b>12</b> gather around (or near) the common electrode <b>15</b>, whereas the positively charged second particles <b>13</b> gather around (or near) the pixel electrode <b>14</b>. As a result, the pixel <b>10</b> displays black color.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> illustrate a portion of a representative pixel of an electronic paper display apparatus. An electronic paper display apparatus according to example embodiments may include plurality of pixels arranged in an array. Each of the plurality of pixels may include a cell and associated electrodes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In electronic paper display apparatuses according to example embodiments, the gray level of the pixels may be adjusted in at least two ways including, for example, pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and pulse width modulation (PWM). When using PAM, a magnitude of the driving voltage (e.g., driving voltage pulses) is adjusted appropriately according to the desired gray level, while a pulse width of the driving voltage remains constant or substantially constant. When using PWM, the period (or pulse width) of the applied driving voltage is adjusted according to the desired gray level, while the magnitude of the driving voltage remains constant or substantially constant.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An electronic paper display apparatus driven using the PWM method will now be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An image of a frame includes a plurality of fields. The number of fields may be equal to the number of gray levels (or colors) required for the image of the frame. In one example, the plurality of fields are displayed sequentially to display the image of a frame on the electronic paper display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates an order of processes for driving an electronic paper display apparatus using PWM according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the image display begins, the screen is reset to black or white. If the entire screen is reset to black in the reset process, bright colors may be displayed by applying voltages to each pixel while passing through N fields, where N corresponds to the number of colors or gray levels in an image of a frame. For example, the voltage representing white color may be applied to a pixel for all of the N fields to generate a white color in the pixel. For each pixel, the greater number of fields during which a voltage representing white color is applied, the lighter the gray color displayed by the pixel. After completely configuring the image of a frame, a given, desired or predetermined vibration pulse is applied to the pixel to remove the remaining voltage in the pixel (Bias Free). In one example, when there are four gray levels (e.g., black, dark gray, light gray, and white), the image of the frame includes four fields in the PWM method.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to at least one example embodiment, the PWM method and the PAM method may be utilized together (e.g., concurrently) to drive an electronic paper display apparatus. In doing so, an electronic display apparatus may display a frame of an image using only a single field, regardless or independent of the number of gray levels required to display the image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically shows a pixel <b>100</b> of an electronic paper display apparatus configured to be driven using both PWM and PAM according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a pixel <b>100</b> includes a cell <b>20</b>; a common electrode <b>32</b>; a pixel electrode <b>31</b>; and an associated circuit. The cell <b>20</b> is arranged between the common electrode <b>32</b> and the pixel electrode <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> may be arranged at opposite sides (or ends) of the cell <b>20</b>. For example, pixel electrode <b>31</b> may be arranged at a lower surface or portion of the cell <b>20</b>, whereas common electrode <b>32</b> may be disposed at an upper surface or portion (e.g., toward an observer) of the cell <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cell <b>20</b> includes transparent fluid <b>211</b> and two kinds or types of fine particles <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>. The fine particles <b>212</b> may be charged to have a different polarity from the fine particles <b>213</b>, and may move within the cell <b>20</b>. The fine particles <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> may be different colors as described above. For example, the first fine particles <b>212</b> may be white and the second fine particles <b>213</b> may be black. However, the second fine particles <b>213</b> may be red, green, blue, a combination thereof, or any other color or combination of colors other than black. Moreover, according to this example embodiment, the fine particles <b>212</b> are positively charged, whereas the second fine particles <b>213</b> are negatively charged. However, example embodiments are not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pixel electrode <b>31</b> includes a first pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a second pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>b</i>. However, example embodiments are not limited thereto. The number of pixel electrodes <b>31</b> corresponding to the cell <b>20</b> may be selected optionally. The common electrode <b>32</b> may be a transparent electrode, but the pixel electrode <b>31</b> need not be transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pixel <b>100</b> further includes a circuit connected to the pixel electrode <b>31</b>. The circuit controls the voltage applied to the pixel electrode <b>31</b>. The circuit may include at least two transistors (e.g., thin film transistors (TFTs) or other switching devices) and a capacitor electrically connected to the first pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>. Each of the at least two transistors, the capacitor and the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a </i>may be connected (e.g., directly connected) to one another at a common node. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, the circuit includes a first thin film transistor (TFT) <b>33</b>, a second TFT <b>34</b>, and a capacitor <b>35</b> electrically connected to the first pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first electrode (or terminal) of the capacitor <b>35</b> is connected to the first pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>, whereas the other electrode (or terminal) of the capacitor <b>35</b> is connected to ground. The drain D of the first TFT <b>33</b> is connected to the first pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>. The source S of the first TFT <b>33</b> is connected to a corresponding electric power source configured to generate a voltage V<b>3</b>. The gate G of the first TFT <b>33</b> is connected to an electric power source configured to generate a switching voltage V<b>1</b>. The drain D of the second TFT <b>34</b> is also connected to the first pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>, and the source S of the second TFT <b>34</b> is connected to a corresponding electric power source configured to generate a voltage V<b>4</b>. The gate G of the second TFT <b>34</b> is connected to an electric power source configured to generate a switching voltage V<b>2</b>. The common electrode <b>32</b> is connected to an electric power source configured to supply a voltage V<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the electric power sources configured to generate voltages V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> may be gate driving units, and the electric power source configured to generate voltage V<b>3</b> may be a source driving unit. Moreover, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (but shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the second pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>b </i>may be connected to a circuit that is similar to or the same as the circuit connected to the first pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this circuit is omitted for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the electric power source configured to generate switching voltage V<b>1</b> generates switching voltage V<b>1</b> for switching the first TFT <b>33</b> ON and OFF. The electric power source configured to generate switching voltage V<b>2</b> generates switching voltage V<b>2</b> for switching the second TFT <b>34</b> ON and OFF. The electric power source configured to generate voltage V<b>3</b> generates a voltage V<b>3</b>, which is applied to the pixel <b>100</b> to drive the pixel (and electronic paper display apparatus) in accordance with the PAM method. The electric power source configured to generate voltage V<b>4</b> generates a reference voltage V<b>4</b> to equalize or substantially equalize the potential difference between the electrodes <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b> when voltage V<b>5</b> is applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating a method of driving the pixel <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The upper graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an application order of the voltages V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, and V<b>3</b>, and the lower graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the voltage applied to the pixel <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is assumed that the reference voltage V<b>4</b> and the voltage V<b>5</b> applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> are about 0V or ground. However, in at least some example embodiments, the source S of the second TFT <b>34</b> and the common electrode <b>32</b> may be connected to respective electric power sources. In this example, the reference voltage V<b>4</b> and the voltage V<b>5</b> applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> may be greater than about 0V and may be equal or substantially equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, when the switching voltage V<b>1</b> is applied to the gate G of the first TFT <b>33</b>, the first TFT <b>33</b> turns on. The pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a </i>then charges to voltage V<b>3</b>, and voltage V<b>3</b> is induced in the capacitor <b>35</b>. When the capacitor <b>35</b> is fully charged, the application of the switching voltage V<b>1</b> is stopped, thereby turning the first TFT <b>33</b> off. As a result, the voltage V<b>3</b> is no longer induced in the capacitor <b>35</b>. However, because the capacitor <b>35</b> is fully charged, the voltage V<b>3</b> is continually applied (maintained) at the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>. Thus, according to at least this example embodiment, the voltage V<b>3</b> is applied to the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a </i>even after the TFT <b>33</b> is turned off. Because the common electrode <b>32</b> on the upper portion of the cell <b>20</b> is connected to ground and the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a </i>is at voltage V<b>3</b>, a potential difference is created (generated) between the electrodes <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b>. The potential difference may be as much as, for example, the magnitude of voltage V<b>3</b>. As a result of the potential difference, the charged particles <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> in the cell <b>20</b> move thereby changing the gray level of the pixel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The above discussion focuses on voltages applied to the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>. However, voltages may be applied to the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>b </i>in a similar or substantially similar manner simultaneously or concurrently with the voltages applied to the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a </i>to obtain a desired gray level. For the sake of brevity, however, a detailed discussion will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, when the pixel <b>100</b> reaches the desired gray level, the second TFT <b>34</b> is turned on by applying switching voltage V<b>2</b> to the gate G of the second TFT <b>34</b>. Because the source S of the second TFT <b>34</b> is connected to ground in this example, the capacitor <b>35</b> begins to discharge thereby decreasing the voltage at pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>. After the capacitor <b>35</b> is completely discharged, the application of the switching voltage V<b>2</b> is stopped to turn the second TFT <b>34</b> off. The voltage of 0V is maintained in the capacitor <b>35</b> that is completely discharged and also the pixel electrode <b>31</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, there is little or no potential difference between the electrodes <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b>, and the movement of the charged particles <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> in the cell <b>20</b> slows and/or stops. According to at least this example embodiment, the capacitor <b>35</b> is charged and discharged via different circuit paths.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another example embodiment, voltage V<b>5</b> rather than ground (or 0V) may be applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>. In this case, a potential difference equal or substantially equal to a difference between the voltages V<b>3</b> and V<b>5</b> may be generated between the electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> of the pixel <b>100</b>. When the pixel <b>100</b> reaches the desired gray level, the switching voltage V<b>2</b> is applied to the gate G of the second TFT <b>34</b> as discussed above. But, in this example embodiment voltage V<b>4</b> rather than ground (or 0V) is applied to the source S of the second TFT <b>34</b> to charge (or discharge) the capacitor <b>35</b> to voltage V<b>4</b>. If the reference voltage V<b>4</b> applied to the source S of the second TFT <b>34</b> is equal or substantially equal to the voltage V<b>5</b> applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>, little or no potential difference exists between electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. As a result, movement of the charged particles <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> slows and/or stops.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the above example embodiment, the magnitude of the voltage applied to the pixel <b>100</b> may be adjusted according to the magnitude of the voltage V<b>3</b>. And, the period during which the voltage is applied to the pixel <b>100</b> may be adjusted according to the difference between the time at which switching voltage V<b>1</b> is applied and the time at which switching voltage V<b>2</b> is applied. Therefore, electronic paper display apparatuses according to example embodiments may be driven using both the PAM method and the PWM method. In this example, the magnitude of voltage V<b>3</b> and/or the difference between the time at which switching voltages V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> are applied may vary depending on the desired gray level.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, when the pixel <b>100</b> displays black color at an initial stage, the magnitude of voltage V<b>3</b> may be set higher when a brighter level of gray color is desired. To display white color, for example, the voltage V<b>3</b> may be set to a maximum. The time when the switching voltage V<b>2</b> is applied may be adjusted to maintain voltage V<b>3</b> for a longer or shorter period such that the desired gray level is displayed more accurately. For example, in a state where the voltage V<b>3</b> is applied to the pixel <b>100</b>, switching voltage V<b>2</b> is applied to the second TFT <b>34</b> to discharge the capacitor <b>35</b> and stop the voltage from being applied to the pixel <b>100</b> when the pixel <b>100</b> reaches the desired gray level. By utilizing PAM and PWM, the pixel <b>100</b> may display a more accurate gray color level.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this example, although the magnitude of the voltage V<b>3</b> (e.g., the pulse amplitude) and the voltage application period (e.g., the pulse width) change according to the desired gray level, the relationship between the gray level, the magnitude and the pulse width of voltage V<b>3</b> may not be linear. The relationship may differ according to characteristics (e.g., mobility and/or hysteresis properties) of the pixel <b>100</b>. Therefore, the magnitude and the pulse width of voltage V<b>3</b> may be determined according to (or based on) the desired gray level and the characteristics (e.g., mobility and/or hysteresis properties) of the material used in the pixel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, electronic paper display apparatuses according to example embodiments may use both a PAM method (in which the pulse amplitude changes according to the desired gray level) and a PWM method (in which the pulse width changes according to the desired gray level). When the electronic paper display apparatus is driven in the PWM method only, the number of required fields is equal to the number of gray levels used to configure the image of a frame. However, according to at least one example embodiment, the image of one frame may be realized using one field because the PAM method is also utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Electronic paper display apparatuses according to example embodiments may be driven to obtain desired gray levels by modulating both amplitude and width of pulse voltages applied to pixels of the display apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates an order of driving an electronic paper display apparatus according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the image display starts, the entire screen of the electronic paper display apparatus may be reset to black or white. Subsequently, different voltages may be applied to each of the pixels (e.g., pixel <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the electronic paper display apparatus in accordance with the PAM method. The periods during which the voltages are applied to the pixels may also be adjusted according to the PWM method. The desired gray level of each pixel may be displayed using only a single field. After forming the image of a frame using a single field, a given, desired or predetermined vibration pulse may be applied to the pixels to remove the remaining voltage in the pixels such that little or no potential difference exists between the electrodes at each end of each of the pixels (bias free).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, pixels may be initialized before displaying the image of a frame (e.g., before resetting the entire screen to black or white) such that the charged fine particles in the pixels move more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, during the above-described initialization process, each instance of the first TFT <b>33</b> may be turned off and each instance of the second TFT <b>34</b> corresponding to each pixel of the electronic paper display apparatus may be turned on. The common electrode <b>32</b> of each pixel <b>100</b> may be connected to the voltage V<b>5</b> and the pixel electrode <b>31</b> of each pixel <b>100</b> may be connected to the voltage V<b>4</b>. In this state, the voltages V<b>5</b> and V<b>4</b> may be adjusted to apply an alternating current (AC) voltage to the pixel <b>100</b>. For example, voltage V<b>5</b> may be about 10V and voltage V<b>4</b> may be about 0V at one point, and voltage V<b>5</b> may be about 0V and voltage V<b>4</b> may be about 10V at a subsequent point. When the AC voltage is applied to the pixel <b>100</b>, the charged fine particles <b>212</b> and <b>213</b> in the cells <b>20</b> may move more easily. According to at least this example embodiment, all of the pixels <b>100</b> in the electronic paper display apparatus may be initialized concurrently or simultaneously in the manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Because the image of a frame may be displayed using only a single field according to at least some example embodiments, display and/or image conversion speeds may be improved as compared with related art electronic paper display apparatuses in which a plurality of fields are needed to form the image of one frame.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An electronic paper display apparatus driven using both the PAM method and the PWM method according to example embodiments may be suitable for displaying moving pictures. In the case of moving pictures, a difference between the gray levels of two continuous frames is relatively small. In the PWM method, even when the difference between the gray levels of the two continuous frames is relatively small, all fields from black color to white color are performed sequentially. Therefore, in the PWM method, the time for forming the image of a frame may be constant or substantially constant regardless of the difference between the gray levels of subsequent frames. However, in an electronic paper display apparatus using both the PAM and PWM, when the gray level is changed from the bright gray to the dark gray, for example, the image may be converted faster than a case where the gray level is changed from the black to white.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, according to the PWM method, the number of fields used to configure a frame image is proportional to the number of gray levels. Thus, the time required to configure images increases as resolution increases. However, when the PWM method and the PAM method are used together to drive the electronic paper display apparatus, a frame image may be configured with a field regardless or independent of the increase in the number of gray levels. Therefore, the time required to configure relatively high resolution images (e.g., images representing a relatively large number of gray levels) may not increase, and the time for configuring the image may be maintained constant or substantially constant regardless or independent of the number of gray levels.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, when only the PWM method is used to drive an electronic paper display apparatus, a memory for storing each of the fields is required to configure an image of a frame. However, an electronic paper display apparatus operating according to both the PWM method and the PAM method does not require the memory because a frame may include only one field.</p>
