<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Various embodiments utilize page scripting and parsing to identify the target destination of a hyperlink and provide a visual indication of the destination to the user without causing redirection to the target destination. In some embodiments, hyperlink color, highlighting, or icons are used to indicate the destination. Particular colors and/or icons selected to indicate the destination can, in some embodiments, be selected based on the domain hosting the target destination. In at least some embodiments, the destination of a link is determined by the page script run by a web browser on a user's device, while in other embodiments, information is transmitted to a web request handler on the server hosting the web site to determine the destination.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various embodiments utilize page scripting and parsing to identify the target destination of a hyperlink and provide a visual indication of the destination to the user without causing redirection to the target destination. In some embodiments, hyperlink color, highlighting, or icons are used to indicate the destination. Particular colors and/or icons selected to indicate the destination can, in some embodiments, be selected based on the domain hosting the target destination. In at least some embodiments, the destination of a link is determined by the page script run by a web browser on a user's device, while in other embodiments, information is transmitted to a web request handler on the server hosting the web site to determine the destination.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the discussion that follows, a section entitled &#x201c;Example Operating Environment&#x201d; describes an operating environment in accordance with one or more embodiments. Next, a section entitled &#x201c;Example Embodiment&#x201d; describes various embodiments of hyperlink destination visibility. In particular, the section describes processes for determining the destination of a hyperlink and indicating to a user the destination. Finally, a section entitled &#x201c;Example System&#x201d; is provided and describes an example system that can be used to implement one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Consider, now, an example operating environment in accordance with one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Example Operating Environment</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of an example environment <b>100</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments. Environment <b>100</b> includes a user device <b>102</b> including one or more processors <b>104</b> and computer-readable storage media <b>106</b>. User device <b>102</b> can be embodied as any suitable computing device such as, by way of example and not limitation, a desktop computer, a portable computer, a netbook, a handheld computer such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), cell phone, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Computer-readable storage media <b>106</b> includes one or more applications, which can include at least a software executable module in the form of a web browser <b>108</b>. Web browser <b>108</b> can receive content from and send content to other servers, such as web site host server <b>110</b>, via network <b>112</b>, such as the Internet. Such content can include any suitable type of content that can be received from and sent to web sites hosted by the servers. In various embodiments, web browser <b>108</b> is configured to cause a webpage to be displayed to a user according to styles defined by information associated with the webpage. Styles can be specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language or in other suitable ways. The information associated with the webpage can be included in page script, which includes instructions to the browser about how to cause the webpage to be displayed. For example, information associated with a certain webpage can define a style such that a hyperlink anchor (e.g., the location within a page from which the hyperlink can be followed) is underlined and displayed in blue while other text on the page is displayed in black. In various embodiments, the style can depend on information associated with the target of a hyperlink (e.g., the location to which the hyperlink leads).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In various embodiments, web site host server <b>110</b> hosts a plurality of webpages <b>114</b>. Web site host server <b>110</b> also includes one or more processors <b>116</b> and computer-readable storage media <b>118</b> on which the webpages <b>114</b> reside. In some embodiments, a web request handler <b>120</b> also resides on computer-readable storage media <b>118</b>. Web request handler <b>120</b> can be configured to determine the target of dynamic hyperlinks included in one or more webpages <b>114</b> and transmit information associated with the target to the browser <b>108</b> via network <b>112</b>. The web request handler is described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The computer-readable storage media included in each device or server can include, by way of example and not limitation, all forms of volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage media that are typically associated with a computing device. Such media can include ROM, RAM, flash memory, hard disk, removable media and the like. One specific example of a computing device is shown and described below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), or a combination of these implementations. The terms &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;functionality,&#x201d; and &#x201c;logic&#x201d; as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation, the module, functionality, or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs). The program code can be stored in one or more computer-readable memory devices. The features of the user interface techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Having described an example operating environment, consider now a discussion of various embodiments employing techniques to visually indicate the destination of a hyperlink to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Example Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The discussion that follows starts first with a description of an example web browser and its associated user interface. Following this, a discussion of various embodiments of visually indicating the destination of a hyperlink is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example web browser <b>200</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments. In this particular example, web browser <b>200</b> includes a web browser user interface <b>202</b> which includes a content rendering area <b>204</b> above a status indication bar <b>206</b>. The web browser user interface <b>202</b> also includes an address bar <b>208</b>, one or more tabs <b>210</b>, and a new tab button <b>212</b> for opening additional tabs. Other controls can be provided depending on the specific embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Status indication bar <b>206</b> is configured to display messages and icons to provide information to the user regarding what the browser is doing. For example, a message can indicate that the browser is looking for a web site, contacting a web site it found, waiting for the web site to send data, receiving data from the web site, or downloading parts of a webpage, to name just a few. In some embodiments, the status indication bar <b>206</b> can display icons regarding a security or privacy level. Additionally, the status indication bar can provide information regarding the destination of a hyperlink. Specifically, when an input is received relative to a hyperlink that is of the type that is typically used to attempt to navigate to or initiate a navigation to an associated destination, the target destination can be displayed in the status indication bar. For example, when a mouse indicator <b>214</b> hovers over a hyperlink <b>216</b> in the content rendering area <b>204</b>, the status indication bar <b>206</b> can display the target address for the hyperlink <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, the destination of the hyperlink <b>216</b> can be indicated by one or more changes or additions to the mouse indicator <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, a rendering is provided adjacent to the mouse indicator to visually convey an affordance that is associated with the target destination. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when mouse indicator <b>214</b> hovers over the words &#x201c;web site&#x201d; which anchor hyperlink <b>216</b>, a small butterfly logo is rendered adjacent to the mouse indicator to indicate that the target of the hyperlink <b>216</b> is a webpage hosted by MSN&#xae; (MSN and the MSN logo are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation). Other logos or icons can be employed, and can be added to mouse indicator <b>214</b> or can replace the mouse indicator <b>214</b>. For example, a magnifying glass can be added to or can replace mouse indicator <b>214</b> when the target of a hyperlink is a search results page, or the mouse indicator <b>214</b> can be replaced with the MSN logo when the target of a hyperlink is a webpage hosted by MSN&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally or alternatively, the destination of the hyperlink <b>216</b> can be indicated by a change in the color of the hyperlink anchor. For example, the words &#x201c;web site&#x201d; which anchor hyperlink <b>216</b> can be displayed in light blue to indicate that the target of hyperlink <b>216</b> is a webpage hosted by MSN&#xae; while the word &#x201c;address&#x201d; which anchors hyperlink <b>216</b><i>a </i>can be displayed in orange to indicate that the target of hyperlink <b>216</b><i>a </i>is a webpage hosted by Bing&#xae; Maps (Bing is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation). The use of colors can be used to indicate the destination of the hyperlink in embodiments that do not include mouse indicators, such as in browsers on a mobile phone. The colors chosen to indicate destinations can vary, as will be appreciated by the skilled artisan. For example, a particular destination may have a prominent color with which it is associated or which is used to brand the destination. In this case, the prominent color may be used as a way to visually convey an association between the domain hosting the target destination of the hyperlink and the anchor displayed to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various embodiments, multiple hyperlinks associated with different target webpages (e.g., hyperlinks <b>216</b> and <b>216</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can be identified. When multiple hyperlinks are identified, the system can utilize information associated with different respective target webpages to determine multiple respective styles to be applied to the webpage and visually apply different respective styles to indicate each target webpage.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a visually applied style is selected based on information regarding a domain hosting the target webpage. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, anchors leading to target webpages hosted on a domain such as MSN&#xae; can be displayed in light blue, while anchors leading to target webpages hosted on a domain such as Bing&#xae; can be displayed in orange. In such embodiments, the same style can be visually applied to multiple hyperlinks leading to different webpages hosted on the same domain.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Having described an example web browser employing hyperlink destination visibility, consider now various processes indicating a target destination of a hyperlink to a user without causing navigation of a browser to the target destination.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating steps in a process <b>300</b> for indicating the destination of a hyperlink to a user. The process <b>300</b> can be implemented in connection with any suitable hardware, software, firmware, or combination thereof. In at least some embodiments, the method can be implemented by a client device, such as a personal computer or mobile phone, examples of which are provided above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Block <b>302</b> ascertains occurrence of a user action. Any suitable type of user action can be ascertained. In the illustrated and described embodiments, user actions can include those that typically precede or initiate a navigation to a destination associated with a hyperlink. By way of example and not limitation, such actions can include a user hovering a mouse indicator over a hyperlink included on a webpage displayed by a browser. Block <b>304</b> executes at least a portion of a page script associated with a webpage. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, in various embodiments, the hovering of a mouse over the hyperlink triggers the execution of one or more portions of JavaScript&#xae; code that encodes the webpage (JavaScript is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation). The page script provides the browser with instructions regarding how to process the hyperlink.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Block <b>306</b> determines the target destination by processing the hyperlink. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, various parsing techniques can be employed to extract the target destination from information associated with the hyperlink included in the page script. In various embodiments, additional processing by a web request handler can be employed to determine the target destination, such as when the hyperlink is a dynamic link with a variable target destination. Additional processing by the web request handler is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Block <b>308</b> visually applies one or more styles based on the target destination. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, in at least some embodiments, the page script can include a look up table (LUT) that defines one or more styles according to the target destination of a hyperlink. Alternately or additionally, the style can be inline coded within the page script. Styles defined according to target destination can include, by way of example and not limitation, text color, background color, mouse icon, mouse color, text styles (including bold, underline, or italics), and the like. Examples of how styles can be applied are provided above.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram that describes steps in a process <b>400</b> of processing a hyperlink to determine a target destination in accordance with one or more embodiments. The method can be performed in connection with any suitable hardware, software, firmware, or combination thereof. In at least some embodiments, the method can be performed by a suitably-configured web browser, such as the one described above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Block <b>402</b> identifies one or more hyperlinks to be processed. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, in various embodiments, the hovering of a mouse over the hyperlink triggers the execution of one or more portions of page script that encodes the webpage and indicates that a hyperlink is present.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, block <b>404</b> generates tokens. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, in one or more embodiments, a parser processes the page script and splits characters in the code into meaningful symbols according to known expressions. Each group of characters can include one or more characters, and is referred to as a token. For example, in the text &#x201c;[Tour rookie] [Keegan Bradley], playing in his first [major championship], proved all of those statements wrong here [Sunday] when he won the [PGA Championship],&#x201d; the brackets illustrate tokens, or words and phrases that have contextual meaning even when considered on their own.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Block <b>406</b> confirms that the tokens form an allowable expression. For example, the parser ensures that the tokens define components that make up an expression and that each word/phrase exists in a lookup table. For example, the parser can confirm that each token (e.g., Tour rookie, Keegan Bradley, major championship, Sunday, and PGA Championship from the example above) exists in a Wikipedia&#xae; entry lookup table (Wikipedia&#xae; is a registered trademark of Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.) or other database. If the parser has parsed the characters incorrectly, one or more of these tokens may not appear in the lookup table, and the parser can generate a new set of tokens.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, block <b>408</b> ascertains a target destination of the hyperlink. This can be done in any suitable way. For example, the parser selects the token including a URL destination of the hyperlink and ascertains the target destination of the hyperlink from the token. Usually, the target domain of the URL can be sufficient to indicate the target destination (e.g., the target network &#x201c;msn.com&#x201d; within the URL http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblog.aspx?feat=d363e301-a203-4080-a52d-39eb03946032).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Block <b>410</b> visually applies one or more styles based on the target destination without causing navigation of the browser to the target destination. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, a look-up table (LUT) can define one or more styles according to the target destination of a hyperlink, or the style can be defined by the code in the page script. Styles defined according to target destination can include, by way of example and not limitation, text color, background color, mouse icon, mouse color, text styles (including bold, underline, or italics), and the like. For example, the LUT can define a style corresponding to the target network &#x201c;msn.com&#x201d;, and the defined style can be applied to the hyperlinks with URLs including that target network (e.g., http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblog.aspx?feat=d363e301-a203-4080-a52d-39eb03946032). The browser then causes the webpage to be displayed accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Process <b>400</b> can employed in embodiments in which the target destination of the hyperlink can be determined by processing information associated with the webpage, and more particularly, by parsing the information associated with the hyperlinks included in the webpage. However, in some embodiments, such as embodiments where one or more hyperlinks are dynamic hyperlinks, additional processing can be used to determine the target destination.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram that describes steps in a method <b>500</b> of processing a hyperlink to determine the target destination in accordance with one or more embodiments. The method can be performed in connection with any suitable hardware, software, firmware, or combination thereof. In the illustrated example, some steps of the method are illustrated as being performed by a &#x201c;Browser,&#x201d; while other steps of the method are illustrated as being performed by a &#x201c;Server.&#x201d; In at least some embodiments, the method can be performed by a suitably-configured web browser, such as the one described above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Block <b>502</b> identifies a hyperlink to be processed. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, in various embodiments, the hovering of a mouse over the hyperlink triggers the execution of one or more portions of a page script that encodes the webpage and indicates that a hyperlink is present.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, block <b>504</b> generates tokens. This can be done in any suitable way. For example, a parser processes the page script and splits the characters in the code into meaningful symbols according to known expressions. Each group of characters can include one or more characters, and is referred to as a token. Example tokens are &#x201c;Seattle,&#x201d; &#x201c;Forrest Gump,&#x201d; &#x201c;Bill Clinton&#x201d; or &#x201c;Committee to Investigate the Condition of the Potomac River Front at Washington.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Block <b>506</b> confirms that the tokens generated at block <b>504</b> form an allowable expression. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, the parser can ensure that the tokens define components that make up an expression and that each word/phrase in the expression exists in a Wikipedia&#xae; entry lookup table.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, block <b>508</b> attempts to ascertain a target destination of the hyperlink. This can be performed in any suitable way, examples of which are provided above. Block <b>510</b> determines whether a target destination of the hyperlink was ascertained at block <b>508</b>. If the target destination of the hyperlink was ascertained, block <b>524</b> visually applies one or more styles according to the target destination. However, if block <b>510</b> determines that no target destination was ascertained, the process proceeds to block <b>512</b>. Attempts to ascertain a target destination of the hyperlink can fail (e.g., a &#x201c;no&#x201d; at block <b>510</b>), for example, when the parser is unable to determine the target destination of the hyperlink based on the tokens. For example, the parser determines that the token including the URL destination of the hyperlink is missing or is indicative of a variable destination.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Block <b>512</b> transmits information associated with the hyperlink to the server. The server can be, for example, the web site host server on which the webpage resides. Information transmitted to the server can include information determined by the parser as well as additional information about the user or environment for use in determining the destination of the hyperlink. For example, the target destination of the hyperlink can vary depending on the date, time, user location, or other factors. In addition to transmitting information associated with the hyperlink and user information, the browser can transmit a cookie corresponding to the webpage to the server.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Block <b>514</b> receives the information associated with the hyperlink. Block <b>516</b> ascertains a target destination of the hyperlink. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, a web request handler can determine the target destination of the hyperlink based on the information received from the browser.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the process continues to optional block <b>518</b>. Block <b>518</b> determines styles to be applied. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, the web request handler can determine styles to be applied based on the target destination of the hyperlink utilizing a LUT to determine one or more styles to be altered according to the target destination. Styles defined according to target destination can include, by way of example and not limitation, text color, background color, mouse icon, mouse color, text styles (including bold, underline, or italics), and the like. Then, block <b>520</b> transmits information to the browser. In embodiments including block <b>518</b>, the server can transmit the style information, the target destination, and other information to the browser. Block <b>522</b> receives the information from the server, and block <b>524</b> visually applies one or more styles according to the target destination of the hyperlink without causing navigation to the target destination.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In alternate embodiments, computational demands on the server can be reduced by shifting the style determination to the browser. In such embodiments, after block <b>516</b> ascertains the target destination of the hyperlink, the process continues to block <b>520</b>. Block <b>520</b> transmits information to the browser. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, the server can transmit the target destination of the hyperlink along with other information to the browser to enable the browser to determine one or more styles according to the target destination. For example, other information transmitted can include information regarding a domain hosting the target webpage. Block <b>522</b> receives the information from the server, and block <b>524</b> visually applies one or more styles according to the target destination. This can be performed in any suitable way. For example, the browser can utilize a LUT or one or more style sheets embedded in the page script to determine one or more styles to be altered depending on the target destination. Styles defined according to target destination can include, by way of example and not limitation, text color, background color, mouse icon, mouse color, text styles (including bold, underline, or italics), and the like.</p>
