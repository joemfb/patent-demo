<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">A. Overview.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 9</figref> illustrate an inverted suspension poultry roasting rack <b>10</b>, which comprises a base unit <b>20</b>, a first member <b>30</b> extending upwardly from the base unit <b>20</b> at a first angle with respect to the base unit <b>20</b>, a second member <b>40</b> extending upwardly from the first member <b>30</b>, a third member <b>50</b> extending downwardly from the second member <b>40</b> at a second angle with respect to the base unit <b>20</b>, and a hook <b>60</b> extending from the distal portion of the third member <b>50</b>. A poultry <b>12</b> is positioned upon the third member <b>50</b> and retained in an inverted position for cooking.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">B. Poultry.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention is designed to receive and support various types of poultry <b>12</b> (e.g. chicken, duck, game hens, goose, etc.). The poultry <b>12</b> has a neck opening <b>14</b> and a rear opening <b>16</b> with an interior body cavity as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The present invention is designed to support the poultry <b>12</b> so that the breast portion of the poultry <b>12</b> is the lowest portion of the poultry <b>12</b> with the legs supported higher to allow for the poultry <b>12</b> to cook more evenly since the legs take longer to cook.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">C. Pan.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention may be supported within a convention oven rack or preferably upon a pan <b>18</b> to catch any drippings. The pan <b>18</b> may be comprised of any type of flat cooking item such as but not limited to a sheet pan <b>18</b> or roasting pan <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">D. Base Unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The base unit <b>20</b> is removably positionable upon the pan <b>18</b> and has a flat lower portion. The base unit <b>20</b> is preferably comprised of a broad structure to provide adequate support to the structure when supporting the poultry <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the base unit <b>20</b> is preferably comprised of a triangular shape, with the first member <b>30</b> extending from one of the pointed ends and the first member <b>30</b> extending over the base unit <b>20</b> in a central manner as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings. In particular, the base unit <b>20</b> is preferably comprised of a first base member <b>22</b> connected to the second member <b>40</b>, a second base member <b>24</b> extending at an acute angle from the first base member <b>22</b>, and a third base member <b>26</b> extending at an acute angle from the second base member <b>24</b>. The third base member <b>26</b> does not need to be connected to the first base member <b>22</b>, however the third base member <b>26</b> may be attached.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">E. First Member.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first member <b>30</b> extends upwardly from a central end location of the base unit <b>20</b> at a first angle with respect to the base unit <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> of the drawings. The first member <b>30</b> extends above the base unit <b>20</b> and past the opposite side of the base unit <b>20</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings. The first member <b>30</b> is preferably centrally positioned with respect to the base unit <b>20</b>. The first member <b>30</b> is preferably comprised of a substantially straight structure.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">F. Second Member.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second member <b>40</b> extends upwardly from the distal portion of the first member <b>30</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings. The second member <b>40</b> is preferably substantially vertical and straight as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings. The second member <b>40</b> provides adequate spacing between the first member <b>30</b> and the third member <b>50</b> to receive the poultry <b>12</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">G. Third Member.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The third member <b>50</b> extends downwardly from the second member <b>40</b> at a second angle with respect to the base unit <b>20</b>. The third member <b>50</b> is preferably substantially straight as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings. The first angle and the second angle are preferably substantially the same. The first angle and the second angle are preferably approximately 10-25 degrees with respect to the base unit <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The third member <b>50</b> is adapted to extend through the rear opening <b>16</b> and the neck opening <b>14</b> of the poultry <b>12</b> to support the poultry <b>12</b> in an inverted position for cooking as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the drawings. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> of the drawings, the inverted position for the poultry <b>12</b> is comprised of a breast portion of the poultry <b>12</b> being the lowest portion of the poultry <b>12</b> when positioned upon the third member <b>50</b>. With the breast portion lower than the legs, the legs and breast portion are allowed to cook evenly within the oven. In addition, since the third member <b>50</b> extends through the interior of the poultry <b>12</b>, there is little, if any, physical contact with the exterior surface of the poultry <b>12</b> allowing the exterior surface to cook evenly and in a crispy manner.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> of the drawings, the third member <b>50</b> is preferably positioned above the first member <b>30</b>. The third member <b>50</b> also preferably extends past the base unit <b>20</b> a finite distance as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first member <b>30</b> and the third member <b>50</b> are substantially parallel with respect to one another and spaced apart sufficiently to allow for the receipt of the poultry <b>12</b> to be supported upon the third member <b>50</b> without the first member <b>30</b> touching the poultry <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The base unit <b>20</b>, the first member <b>30</b>, the second member <b>40</b> and the third member <b>50</b> are preferably comprised of a single elongated metal rod which is easy to manufacture and easy to clean. It is preferable that the single elongated metal rod is comprised of &#xbc; inch metal rod with an overall length of approximately 50 inches.

The hook <b>60</b> includes an upper end <b>62</b> and is adapted to prevent the poultry <b>12</b> from sliding off the third member <b>50</b>. The hook <b>60</b> preferably extends upwardly to engage an upper edge of the neck opening <b>14</b> when the poultry <b>12</b> is positioned upon the third member <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">I. Foldable Alternative Embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment wherein the first member <b>30</b> is comprised of a tubular structure having an open end that is slidable over an extended portion of the first base member <b>22</b>. The extended portion from the first base member <b>22</b> extends concentrically at an angle similar to the angle of the first member <b>30</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> of the drawings. The extended portion from the first base member <b>22</b> has an exterior diameter smaller than the interior lumen of the first member <b>30</b>. A ridge <b>28</b> extends outwardly from the extended portion of the first base member <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> of the drawings. The first member <b>30</b> includes at least one slot <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> that catchably receives the ridge <b>28</b> when the first member <b>30</b> is positioned upon the extended portion of the first base member <b>22</b> to prevent rotation of the first member <b>30</b> upon the extended portion of the first base member <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> of the drawings. There is preferably a first slot <b>32</b> and a second slot <b>34</b> within the distal portion of the first base member, wherein the first slot <b>32</b> is approximately 90 degrees from the second slot <b>34</b>. The first slot <b>32</b> is utilized to secure the first member <b>30</b> in a rotated storage position to make the present invention flatter for storage as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> of the drawings. The second slot <b>34</b> is utilized to support the first member <b>30</b> in the upright position to support the poultry <b>12</b> positioned thereupon. It can also be appreciated that removal of the first member <b>30</b> from the extended portion of the first base member <b>22</b> allows for cleaning of the present invention and storage in separate locations.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">J. Operation of Preferred Embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In use, the user extends the third member <b>50</b> through the rear opening <b>16</b> of the poultry <b>12</b> and out through the neck opening <b>14</b> of the poultry <b>12</b>. The user then positions the poultry <b>12</b> so that the breast portion hangs downwardly in the lowest position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> of the drawings. The user may position the base unit <b>20</b> upon a pan <b>18</b> or other drip collection item prior to placing in an oven. During cooking, the leg meat is cooked evenly with the breast meat because the leg meat is higher in the oven than the breast. In addition, because of the downward angle of the third member <b>50</b> supporting the poultry <b>12</b> in a similar downward angle, the juices released from the poultry <b>12</b> during cooking are collected in the interior breast portion of the poultry <b>12</b> thereby enhancing the flavor of the breast meat. Furthermore, because no contact is made with the exterior of the poultry <b>12</b>, the poultry <b>12</b> cooks more evenly as the hot air contacts every exterior surface of the poultry <b>12</b> during cooking resulting in an evenly crispy skin. After the poultry <b>12</b> is fully cooked, the user removes the cooked poultry <b>12</b> from the third member <b>50</b> by raising it upwardly over the hook <b>60</b> and then the poultry <b>12</b> may be served.</p>
