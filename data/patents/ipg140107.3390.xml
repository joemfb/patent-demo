<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings. Note that, in this specification and the appended drawings, structural elements that have substantially the same function and structure are denoted with the same reference numerals, and repeated explanation of these structural elements is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Firstly, before describing one embodiment of the present invention, problems and the like of a motor with an encoder and an encoder for a motor considered by the inventors of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As described above, the encoder is mainly divided into a magnetic type encoder and an optical type encoder. The magnetic type encoder includes for example a permanent magnet fixed to a motor output shaft, and a magnetic field detection element for detecting a magnetic field from this permanent magnet of a circular plate shape, so as to detect the magnetic field from the permanent magnet and detect a relative position and an absolute position of the output shaft. Therefore, there is a concern that a magnetic flux on the side of the motor is leaked out to the side of the encoder via the output shaft, a hub fixed to an anti-load side end of this output shaft, and the like, and interferes with a magnetic field of the magnetic type encoder. Although such interference due to the magnetic field is not as remarkable as the magnetic type encoder, there is a concern that the interference also influences an electronic circuit and the like in the optical type encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Such leakage of the magnetic flux from the side of the motor is readily generated particularly in a case where the motor has a brake. This is because, due to the structure that the brake is disposed on the anti-load side of a motor electromagnetic part, that is, adjacent to the encoder, and a braking member for performing braking of a brake disc is moved in the shaft direction by excitation of a coil, the coil of the brake generates the magnetic flux in the shaft direction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a case of a structure that a convex part is provided in an end of the output shaft of the motor, and this is inserted into a concave part provided in the hub of the encoder so that the output shaft and the hub are fixed as in the above conventional technique, a convexo-concave structure corresponds to the direction of the leaked magnetic flux. Thus, the magnetic flux is readily leaked out from the side of the output shaft to the side of the hub. For example, in a case of the magnetic type encoder, there is a concern that such a leaked magnetic flux interferes with the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet, and a detection result by the encoder is influenced. For example, in a case of the optical type encoder, there is also a concern that the detection result by the encoder is influenced although the influence is less than the magnetic type encoder. For example, induced electromotive force is generated in the electronic circuit so that detection precision is lowered. In order to suppress such leakage of the magnetic flux, it is thought that a pressure welding shaft formed by a magnetic body and a non-magnetic body is used as the output shaft of the motor. However, use of such a pressure welding shaft or a non-magnetic body such as stainless leads to a cost increase in the encoder (motor).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inventors of the present invention considered these points and the like for further improvement of reliability of the encoder regarding the motor with the encoder and the encoder for the motor, and as a result of further dedicated research, attained the present invention. It should be noted that the points and the like described here are only one example of the problems to be solved by the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to this example. Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An operation of the brake part <b>100</b>B with the above configuration will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">That is, in a state that the power is not distributed in the excitation coil <b>23</b> (=a non-excitation state), the braking is performed by the brake part <b>100</b>B.

Thereby, the armature <b>29</b> and the brake disc <b>33</b> are moved toward the other side in the shaft direction while acting against the bias force of the springs <b>25</b> for pressing the armature <b>29</b>. As a result, the brake disc <b>33</b> is brought away from the side plate <b>31</b>, the brake disc <b>33</b> is released from the braking, and the motor shaft <b>3</b> is made to be capable of rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be noted that since the present embodiment is particularly effective in a case of the motor <b>100</b> having the electromagnetic type brake part <b>100</b>B as exemplified above, the configuration and the operation of the brake part <b>100</b>B are described in detail above. However, the configuration of the brake part <b>100</b>B is not limited to this example, and with any electromagnetic brake part, the present embodiment can obtain effects described later. Further, even in a case where the brake part is disposed not on the anti-load side but on the load side, the present embodiment can obtain the same effects. Since an influence of a leaked magnetic flux of the motor electromagnetic part <b>100</b>A can be reduced even with the motor <b>100</b> having no brake part, the present embodiment can obtain the same effects.

In consideration with the influence of the magnetic flux of the motor <b>100</b> and the like, it is thought that an expensive pressure welding shaft formed by a non-magnetic body and a magnetic body is used as the motor shaft.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the encoder <b>8</b> includes a hub <b>10</b>, a glass rotating disc <b>13</b> fixed to an anti-load side (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) end of this hub <b>10</b>, a substrate <b>14</b> disposed on the anti-load side of this rotating disc <b>13</b> and made of a resin for example, a disc magnet <b>16</b> fixed to an anti-load side surface of the rotating disc <b>13</b>, and a magnetic field detection element <b>17</b> and an optical module <b>15</b> fixed to a load side (right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) surface of the substrate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The hub <b>10</b> is made of a non-magnetic material such as a resin, aluminum, and an austenite stainless steel.

These two protruding parts <b>7</b>Aa and the two protruding parts <b>10</b>Ba of the circular plate part <b>10</b>B of the hub <b>10</b> are provided so as to face each other, so that the circular plate part <b>10</b>B and the bearing cover <b>7</b>A form a meandering shape gap <b>11</b>, that is, the gap of a labyrinth structure between the outer surfaces facing each other.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, the motor <b>1</b> with the encoder of the present embodiment has the motor <b>100</b> including the motor electromagnetic part <b>100</b>A and the brake part <b>100</b>B, and the encoder <b>8</b>. The motor electromagnetic part <b>100</b>A, the brake part <b>100</b>B, and the encoder <b>8</b> are disposed in series in this order in the shaft direction of the motor shaft <b>3</b> from the load side (right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to the anti-load side (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In general, the magnetic and optical type encoders are mainly used as the encoder. In comparison to the optical type encoder, the magnetic type encoder is simpler in a structure, smaller in the number of parts, and more resistant to vibration and impact. Thus, in many cases, the magnetic type encoder is adopted alone or adopted together with the optical type encoder. In order to detect a rotation angle of a rotating body such as the motor shaft, the magnetic type encoder includes the disc magnet fixed to the rotating body, and the magnetic field detection element fixed to a fixed body such as the substrate, so as to detect an absolute position of the rotating body. Therefore, there is a concern that the magnetic flux on the side of the motor is leaked out to the side of the encoder via the motor shaft and the hub fixed to the anti-load side end of this motor shaft, and interferes with the magnetic field of the magnetic type encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the motor with the encoder with the configuration that the motor electromagnetic part, the brake part, and the encoder are disposed in series in this order in the shaft direction of the motor shaft from the load side to the anti-load side as described above, it is thought that the leaked magnetic flux from the motor electromagnetic part and the brake part, particularly the magnetic flux from the brake part disposed adjacent to the encoder is leaked out to the side of the encoder via the motor shaft and the hub fixed to the anti-load side end of this motor shaft. Particularly, in a case of the structure that a convex part is provided in the end of the motor shaft, and this is inserted into a concave part or a hole part provided in the hub so that the motor shaft and the hub are fixed, the motor shaft comes deep inside the side of the encoder, and a front end of the motor shaft becomes thinner. Thus, the highly densified magnetic flux is eradiated in the vicinity of the encoder so that a magnetic path through which the consequently-leaked magnetic flux passes inside the encoder is formed. There is a concern that such a leaked magnetic flux interferes with the magnetic flux of the disc magnet of the magnetic type encoder, and a detection result by the encoder is influenced. It should be noted that although such interference due to the magnetic field is not as remarkable as the magnetic type encoder, there is a concern that the interference also influences an electronic circuit and the like in the optical type encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the motor <b>1</b> with the encoder of the present embodiment, as described above, the convex part <b>10</b>A is formed in the load side (right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) end of the hub <b>10</b> of the encoder <b>8</b>, and the convex part <b>3</b>A is formed in the anti-load side (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) end of the motor shaft <b>3</b>. The convex part <b>10</b>A of the hub <b>10</b> is fitted to the concave part <b>3</b>A of the motor shaft <b>3</b> so that the hub <b>10</b> is fixed to the motor shaft <b>3</b>. Thereby, the motor shaft <b>3</b> can be isolated from the encoder <b>8</b>, and the front end of the motor shaft can be thicker. Thus, the magnetic flux is not readily leaked out from the side of the motor shaft <b>3</b> to the side of the hub <b>10</b>. As a result, the influence of the magnetic flux is reduced, so that further reliability of the encoder can be improved. Since the leakage of the magnetic flux can be suppressed, there is no need for using a non-magnetic material or a pressure welding shaft as the motor shaft <b>3</b>. Thus, the manufacturing cost and the labors at the time of manufacturing can be reduced. The convexo-concave structure as in the present embodiment is particularly effective in a case where the motor <b>100</b> has the brake part <b>100</b>B as in the present embodiment. This is because, due to the structure that the brake part <b>100</b>B is disposed on the anti-load side of the motor electromagnetic part <b>100</b>A, that is, adjacent to the encoder <b>8</b>, and the armature <b>29</b> for performing the braking of the brake disc <b>33</b> is moved in the shaft direction by excitation of the excitation coil <b>23</b>, the excitation coil <b>23</b> of the brake part <b>100</b>B generates the magnetic flux in the shaft direction, so that the leakage of the magnetic flux from the side of the motor <b>100</b> as described above is readily generated. In a case where the hub <b>10</b> has the circular plate part <b>10</b>B as in the present embodiment, the magnetic flux passing through between the circular plate part <b>10</b>B and the anti-load side bracket <b>7</b> can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present embodiment, the following effects can be obtained. That is, in general, when the temperature of the motor with the encoder is increased due to the rotation of the motor shaft, the grease of the anti-load side bearing is atomized and scattered. A major part of the atomized grease is attached to the oil reservoir provided in the bearing cover of the anti-load side bracket. However, there is a fear that part of the grease is leaked out from a gap between the bearing cover and the hub to the side of the encoder. In this case, in a case where the optical type encoder is used, there is a concern that the grease is attached to optical parts such as the light emitter and the light receiver thereof and the rotating disc, and a light amount reaching from the light emitter to the light receiver is decreased, so that the detection result by the encoder is influenced. Therefore, in the present embodiment, as described above, the circular plate part <b>10</b>B disposed so as to face the anti-load side of the bearing cover <b>7</b>A provided in the anti-load side bracket <b>7</b> is provided in the hub <b>10</b>, the protruding parts <b>10</b>Ba are provided in this circular plate part <b>10</b>B, and the protruding parts <b>7</b>Aa are provided in the bearing cover <b>7</b>A. The circular plate part <b>10</b>B and the bearing cover <b>7</b>A form the gap <b>11</b> of the labyrinth structure between the outer surfaces facing each other by the protruding parts <b>10</b>Ba and the protruding parts <b>7</b>Aa. Thereby, the atomized grease of the anti-load side bearing <b>6</b><i>b </i>can be suppressed from entering the encoder <b>8</b>. As a result, further reliability of the encoder can be improved. With such a labyrinth structure, the circular plate part <b>10</b>B of the hub <b>10</b> can exert both a magnetic flux shielding effect and a grease shielding effect. Thus, the number of parts can be reduced, the manufacturing cost can be suppressed, and the encoder <b>8</b> can be thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present embodiment, particularly, the motor <b>100</b> is formed so that the positions in the shaft direction of the anti-load side end of the motor shaft <b>3</b> and the anti-load side end of the anti-load side bearing <b>6</b><i>b </i>are substantially matched with each other. Thereby, in comparison to a structure that the anti-load side end of the motor shaft protrudes from the anti-load side end of the anti-load side bearing, a structure that the bearing cover <b>7</b>A extends to the side of the end of the motor shaft <b>3</b> so as to cover not only the anti-load side end of the anti-load side bearing <b>6</b><i>b </i>but also the anti-load side end of the motor shaft <b>3</b> can be obtained. As a result, the more gap <b>11</b> of the labyrinth structure can be formed between the outer surfaces of the circular plate part <b>10</b>B and the bearing cover <b>7</b>A, so that an effect of suppressing the grease from entering the encoder <b>8</b> can be more enhanced. The oil reservoir <b>12</b> is formed in the part of the bearing cover <b>7</b>A covering the end of the motor shaft <b>3</b>, so that the major part of the atomized grease can be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present embodiment, the following effects can be obtained. That is, in general, the motor has a structure that the motor electromagnetic part includes both the load side bearing and the anti-load side bearing rotatably supporting the motor shaft. Therefore, in a case where the motor electromagnetic part, the brake part, and the encoder are disposed in series in this order in the shaft direction of the motor shaft from the load side to the anti-load side, the motor shaft supported by the load side bearing and the anti-load side bearing in the motor electromagnetic part protrudes in a cantilever shape on the anti-load side, and the brake part and the encoder are provided in a protruding part thereof. In a case of such a structure, there is a concern that rotation instability is generated in the anti-load side end of the motor shaft, and the detection result by the encoder is influenced. Therefore, in the present embodiment, as described above, the anti-load side bearing <b>6</b><i>b </i>is disposed between the brake part <b>100</b>B and the encoder <b>8</b>. In such a way, since the anti-load side bearing <b>6</b><i>b </i>is disposed between the brake part <b>100</b>B and the encoder <b>8</b>, an inter-bearing distance between the load side bearing <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the anti-load side bearing <b>6</b><i>b </i>can be elongated. Thus, the rotation instability in the anti-load side end of the motor shaft <b>3</b> can be suppressed. Thereby, further reliability of the encoder can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present embodiment, particularly, the hub <b>10</b> of the encoder <b>8</b> is made of a non-magnetic material. Since the hub <b>10</b> is made of a non-magnetic material, the leaked magnetic flux from the motor electromagnetic part <b>100</b>A and the brake part <b>100</b>B of the motor <b>100</b> can be shielded or reduced by the hub <b>10</b>. Thus, the influence of the magnetic flux can be further reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an encoder <b>8</b>&#x2032; in the present modification includes a hub <b>10</b>&#x2032;, the rotating disc <b>13</b> fixed to an anti-load side (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) end of this hub <b>10</b>&#x2032; and made of glass, a resin, a metal, or the like for example, a substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; disposed on the load side of this rotating disc <b>13</b> (on the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and provided at an intermediate position in a shaft part of the hub <b>10</b>&#x2032;, the disc magnet <b>16</b> fixed to a load side surface of the anti-load side end of the hub <b>10</b>&#x2032;, and the magnetic field detection element <b>17</b> and the optical module <b>15</b> fixed to an anti-load side surface of the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The hub <b>10</b>&#x2032; is made of a non-magnetic material as well as the hub <b>10</b> in the above embodiment, and the convex part <b>10</b>A is formed in a load side end thereof. This convex part <b>10</b>A is fitted to the concave part <b>3</b>A formed in the motor shaft <b>3</b> described above so that the hub <b>10</b>&#x2032; is fixed to the motor shaft <b>3</b>. Thereby, the hub <b>10</b>&#x2032; is fixed coaxially with the anti-load side end of the motor shaft <b>3</b>. As well as the hub <b>10</b> in the above embodiment, the hub <b>10</b>&#x2032; includes the circular plate part <b>10</b>B disposed so as to face the anti-load side of the bearing cover <b>7</b>A of the anti-load side bracket <b>7</b> described above, the circular plate part including the two protruding parts <b>10</b>Ba.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that in the present modification, the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; is particularly preferably made of a resin which is a non-conducting body (insulating body). By making the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; of a resin which is a non-conducting body, generation of electromagnetic noise can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Functions and configurations of the disc magnet <b>16</b>, the magnetic field detection element <b>17</b>, and the optical module <b>15</b> are substantially the same as the above embodiment. Therefore, as well as the encoder <b>8</b> in the above embodiment, the encoder <b>8</b>&#x2032; in the present modification functions as a hybrid type encoder using both the magnetic and optical type encoders, and the optical type encoder functions as a reflection type encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since parts other than the above parts are substantially the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> described above, explanation thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, in the present modification, the encoder <b>8</b>&#x2032; includes the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; in which the optical module <b>15</b> including the light emitter and the light receiver is provided, and the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; is disposed on the load side (on the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the rotating disc <b>13</b>. That is, the rotating disc <b>13</b> is disposed on the anti-load side of the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; (on the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the encoder <b>8</b>&#x2032;. At the time of assembling the encoder <b>8</b>&#x2032; with such a configuration to the motor <b>100</b>, firstly, the hub <b>10</b>&#x2032; is fixed to the anti-load side end of the motor shaft <b>3</b>, the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; is provided in the middle of the shaft part of this hub <b>10</b>&#x2032;, and finally, the rotating disc <b>13</b> is fixed to the anti-load side end of the hub <b>10</b>&#x2032;. With such an assembling order, at the time of assembling, position matching of a slit on the rotating disc <b>13</b> and the optical module <b>15</b> on the substrate <b>14</b>&#x2032; can be easily performed while seeing through the glass rotating disc <b>13</b> from the anti-load side, so that assembling workability can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">(2) Others</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although a case where the reflection type encoder is used as the optical type encoder regarding the encoder <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>&#x2032; serving as the hybrid type encoder using both the magnetic and optical type encoders is described above as an example, the present invention is not limited to this. That is, a so-called &#x201c;transmission type&#x201d; encoder in which the light emitter and the light receiver are disposed so as to face each other with respect to the rotating disc, and the light receiver receives the light emitted from the light emitter and transmitted through the slit serving as a transmission part formed in the rotating disc, so that the relative position from the original position and the absolute position of the motor shaft <b>3</b> are detected may be used as the optical type encoder. In a case where such a transmission type encoder is used, the same effects as the above embodiment and the modification (1) are also obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Apart from the methods already described above, the methods of the above embodiment and the modification may be appropriately combined and utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, although not described one by one, the present invention can be variously modified and practiced within a range not departing from the gist thereof.</p>
