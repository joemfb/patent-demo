<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electromagnetically-countered display system includes at least one wave source and at least one counter unit. The wave source irradiates harmful electromagnetic waves and the counter unit emits counter electromagnetic waves for countering the harmful waves therewith. Examples of the various counter units for the electromagnetically-countered display system and various mechanisms to counter the harmful waves with the counter units include by matching configurations of the counter units with those of the wave sources, and by matching wavefronts of the harmful waves with those the counter waves. Various methods of countering the harmful waves with such counter waves include by source and/or wave matching. Various methods of providing the counter units for emitting the counter waves defining desired wave characteristics. Various electric and magnetic shields can be employed either alone or in conjunction with the counter units for minimizing irradiation of the harmful waves from the display system.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electromagnetically-countered display system including at least one wave source and at least one counter unit, where such a wave source irradiates harmful electromagnetic waves and the counter unit emits counter electromagnetic waves for countering the harmful waves therewith. More particularly, the present invention relates to various counter units for the electromagnetically-countered display system and to various mechanisms to counter the harmful waves with the counter units, e.g., by matching configurations of the counter units with those of the wave sources, by matching wavefronts of the harmful waves with those the counter waves, and so on. The present invention also relates to various methods of countering the harmful waves with such counter waves by source and/or wave matchings, various methods of providing the counter units for emitting the counter waves defining desired wave characteristics, and the like. The present invention further relates to various processes for providing the electromagnetically-countered display systems and their counter units. The present invention further relates to various electric and magnetic shields employed either alone or in conjunction with the counter units for minimizing irradiation of the harmful waves from the display system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is now well established in the scientific community that electromagnetic waves with varying frequencies irradiated by various devices may be hazardous to human health. In some cases, such electromagnetic waves in mega- and giga-hertz range may be the main culprit, whereas the 60-hertz electromagnetic waves may be the main health concern in other cases. It cannot be too emphasized that it is very difficult to shield against magnetic waves of the 60-hertz electromagnetic waves which have wavelengths amounting to thousands of kilometers and that such 60-hertz magnetic waves are omnipresent in any corner of the current civilization.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, intensity of such electromagnetic waves typically decreases inversely proportional to a square of a distance from a source of such waves to a target. Accordingly, potentially adverse effects from such electromagnetic waves may be minimized by maintaining a safe distance from such a source. Some electrical devices, however, are intended to be used in a close proximity to an user, where examples of the conventional electrical devices include various display devices from which an user are to acquire visual images. In general, the user may be able to more easily obtain such images from the display devices with larger screens at a greater distances than those with smaller screens, while misleading the user that the greater distance from the screens may protect him or her from such waves. Those devices with larger screens irradiate more stronger harmful electromagnetic waves than those with the smaller screens and, accordingly, the greater distance attainable with such larger screens are offset by the greater amplitudes of such harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is an urgent need for various counter units capable of being incorporated into various prior art display devices in order to convert such devices to an electromagnetically-countered display systems and to minimize irradiation of such harmful electromagnetic waves therefrom. There is a need to provide a feasible solution for countering the harmful waves irradiated by various waves sources of the display devices of different shapes, sizes, and/or light-emitting mechanisms. There is a need to provide a feasible solution for countering such harmful waves which are irradiated by such wave sources as well while defining wavefronts of various characteristics.</p>

In the alternative, the counter unit may be shaped, sized, and/or disposed in an arrangement which is defined along one or more wavefronts of such harmful waves, thereby emitting the counter waves automatically matching wave characteristics of such harmful waves. The present invention also relates to various counter units provided as analogs of at least one of the base units of the wave source, where the analog approximates (or simplifies) at least one of the base units which is more complex than the counter unit, where the three- or two-dimensional base unit is simplified (or approximated) as the two- or one-dimensional analog, and the like.

Another related objective of this invention is to form a single counter unit for globally countering a sum of such harmful waves irradiated by multiple base units with such counter waves. Another related objective of this invention is to form multiple counter units each globally countering the harmful waves irradiated by at least two base units with such counter waves emitted by each of multiple counter units. Another related objective of this invention is to form a single or multiple counter units defining a feature (or configuration) which is similar (or identical) to that of at least two or a greater number of base units for the global countering.

Therefore, a related objective of this invention is to dispose the counter unit on or over an exterior surface of at least one of such base units, to dispose the counter unit below or on an interior surface of at least one of such base units, to embed at least a portion of the counter unit into at least one of the base units, and the like. Another related objective of this invention is to dispose the counter unit on or over an exterior surface of a body of the system, to dispose the counter unit on or below an interior surface of the body, to embed at least a portion of the counter unit into the body, to dispose the counter unit between the body and at least one of the base units, and the like. Another related objective of this invention is to dispose the counter unit in a preset relation to the body by, e.g., exposing therethrough at least a portion of the counter unit, enclosing only a (or an entire) portion of the counter unit inside the body, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another objective of the present invention is to form an EMC display system including at least one counter unit emitting the counter waves propagating along preset directions. Therefore, a related objective of this invention is to arrange the counter unit to emit such counter waves always in a fixed direction with respect to at least one of the base units so that the counter waves also propagate in a direction defined in a preset relation with respect to a direction of propagation of the harmful waves, e.g., parallel, perpendicular, and/or at a preset angle to the harmful waves. Another related objective of this invention is to arrange the counter unit to emit the counter waves along variable directions with respect to a direction of propagation of the harmful waves, where the counter unit is arranged to vary its arrangement and/or orientation, to receive such electric current and/or voltage in variable directions for varying the direction of the counter waves, and the like. Another related objective of this invention is to arrange the counter unit to emit the counter waves in a direction which is adaptively determined by variable directions of propagation of such harmful waves, where the counter unit may change the direction of the counter waves as described hereinabove. Therefore, the counter unit may change an extent of countering based upon its arrangement and/or orientation. Another related objective of this invention is to synchronize the direction of propagation of the counter waves with that of the harmful waves based on the preset relation disclosed hereinabove. Another related objective of this invention is to arrange the counter unit to control the amplitudes of such counter waves in various mechanisms similar to those for manipulating the directions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another objective of the present invention is to form an EMC display system with at least one counter unit and to supply the electric energy thereto to counter such harmful waves with the counter waves emitted therefrom. Therefore, a related objective of this invention is to provide the counter unit with the electric current and/or voltage supplied to at least one of such base units. Another related objective of this invention is to provide the counter unit with at least a portion but not an entire portion of the electric current or voltage supplied to at least one of such base units. Another related objective of this invention is to provide the counter unit with only a portion of the current or voltage of which the amplitudes and/or direction may also be modified before being supplied thereto. In all of the examples, the current or voltage supplied to the counter unit may be automatically synchronized with the current or voltage supplied to at least one of such base units. Another related objective of this invention is to supply the counter unit with electric current or voltage which is not the current or voltage supplied to at least one of such base units but which is at least partially synchronized with the current or voltage supplied to such a base unit. Another related objective of this invention is to manipulate the amplitudes and/or directions of the current or voltage based on configurations and/or dispositions of the counter unit. Another related objective of this invention is to electrically couple the counter unit to at least one of the base units in a parallel, series or hybrid mode. Another related objective of this invention is to supply the electric current and/or voltage in various sequences such as, e.g., first to at least one of the base units and then to the counter unit, first to the counter unit then to at least one the base units, first to one of multiple counter units and then to the rest of the counter units or base unit, first to one of multiple base units and then to the rest of the base units or counter unit, simultaneously to the base and counter units, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is to be understood in all of such objectives that the counter units are preferably arranged to not adversely affect other intended operations of the systems. For example, the counter units of the EMC display systems may effectively counter the harmful waves which are irradiated by their wave irradiating base units but may not adversely affect their image generating functions. It is appreciated in all of the objectives that the counter units may be arranged to emit the counter waves defining the phase angles at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves for the countering in its normal dispositions but that the counter units may emit the counter waves defining the phase angles at least partially similar to those of such harmful waves when disposed on an opposite side of at least one of the base unit with respect to the target space or when the system includes multiple counter units and when it is desirable to modify the radii of curvature of the wavefronts of the counter waves. It is also appreciated that various electric and/or magnetic shields disclosed in the co-pending applications may be incorporated into any of such EMC display systems either alone or in combination with the counter units to maximally counter the harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The basic principle of the counter units of the EMC display systems of the present invention is to emit the counter waves defining the wavefronts similar (or identical) to those of the harmful waves but defining the phase angles at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves. Therefore, by propagating the counter waves toward the target space, the counter waves may effectively counter the harmful waves in the target space by, e.g., canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves with the counter waves therein, suppressing the harmful waves with the counter waves from propagating theretoward, and the like. To this end, such counter units preferably emit the counter waves defining the wavefronts matching those of the harmful waves by various mechanisms. In one example, such counter units are shaped similar (or identical) to at least one of the base units of the waves sources, or arranged similar (or identical) to the base unit and, accordingly, emit the counter waves capable of countering the harmful waves in the target space. In another example, the counter units are disposed along or across a single or multiple wavefronts of the harmful waves, emit the counter waves similar (or identical) to the harmful waves and, therefore, counter the harmful waves in the target space. In these examples, the counter units emit the counter waves forming the wavefronts similar (or identical) to the shapes of the counter units themselves, and those counter waves define the phase angles at least partially opposite to the phase angles of the harmful waves. In another example, such counter units are shaped differently from at least one of the base units, but rather disposed in an arrangement in which the counter waves emitted thereby match the harmful waves in the target space. In another example, the counter units are disposed across different wavefronts of such harmful waves but emit the counter waves similar (or identical) to the harmful waves, thereby, countering the harmful waves in the target space. In these last two examples, the counter units may be arranged to emit the counter waves defining such wavefronts which may or may not be similar (or identical) to the shapes of the counter units themselves, while the counter waves have the phase angles which are at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The basic principle of various generic counter units of the EMC display system of the present invention may be implemented to various conventional devices for minimizing irradiation of the harmful waves therefrom. For example, the counter units may be implemented to any base units of electrically conductive wires, coils, and/or sheets of the EMC display system or, alternatively, to any electrically semiconductive and/or insulative wires, coils, and/or sheets of the EMC display system for minimizing the irradiation of the harmful waves by countering the harmful waves by the counter waves, e.g., by canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves in the target space and/or suppressing such harmful waves from propagating to the target space, where the counter units may be made of and/or include at least one electrically conductive, insulative or semiconductive material. Such counter units may be implemented to any of the base units of the shapes which may be formed by including one or multiple wires, coils, and/or sheets, by modifying such shapes of one or multiple wires, coils, and/or sheets, where a few examples of the modified shapes may include a solenoid and toroid each of which may be formed by modifying the shape of the coil. Therefore, such counter units may be implemented into various display units of the EMC systems such as cathode ray tube display units, liquid crystal display units, organic and/or inorganic light emitting display units, plasma display units, and other display units which include multiple pixels and is also capable of emitting visible light rays when supplied with the source electrical energy.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">As used herein, the term &#x201c;units&#x201d; collectively refers to both of a &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; and a &#x201c;counter unit&#x201d; of an electromagnetically-countered display system of the present invention, where such a system is to be abbreviated as the &#x201c;EMC display system,&#x201d; the &#x201c;EMC system,&#x201d; or simply the &#x201c;system&#x201d; hereinafter. Such a classification between the &#x201c;units&#x201d; is primarily based upon their intended functions. That is, the &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; represents various parts of such an &#x201c;EMC display system&#x201d; for performing various intended functions of the system such as, e.g., displaying the visual image on its screen using its pixels, and so on. It is appreciated that all &#x201c;base units&#x201d; irradiate such harmful waves while performing the intended functions and that such &#x201c;base units&#x201d; are always incorporated in the above EMC system and in various prior art devices for similar purposes. In contrary, the &#x201c;counter unit&#x201d; refers to those parts of the EMC system which are to accomplish countering functions such as, e.g., canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves in the target space and/or suppressing and/or preventing such a portion of the harmful waves from propagating toward the target space. When desirable, such a &#x201c;counter unit&#x201d; may also be arranged to perform various functions intended for the &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; and, accordingly, serve as an extra &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; which not only serves as one of the electrodes (or a part thereof) or one of the pixels but also performs the countering function. Within the scope of this invention, however, such an unit is to be deemed as the &#x201c;counter unit&#x201d; throughout this description unless otherwise specified. Based upon this context, the &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; is omnipresent in any prior art display panels and/or devices, whereas the &#x201c;counter unit&#x201d; is neither physically not functionally present in these prior art devices.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; is to be distinguished from a &#x201c;wave source&#x201d; within the scope of this invention. More particularly, the &#x201c;wave source&#x201d; collectively refers to portions of the EMC system irradiating such harmful waves, whereas the &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; specifically refers only to the portions of the &#x201c;wave source&#x201d; which are directly responsible for irradiating the harmful waves and/or affecting propagation paths of the harmful waves. For example, the anode and cathode of the EMC display system correspond to its &#x201c;wave sources,&#x201d; while the &#x201c;base units&#x201d; of the EMC system generally include, e.g., those wires and/or strips of conductive materials. In addition, the pixels of the EMC display system may correspond to the &#x201c;wave source,&#x201d; while portions of the pixels in which the source electric current flows and/or across which the source electric voltage is applied correspond to its &#x201c;base units.&#x201d; Furthermore, other electric and/or electronic parts of the EMC display system may correspond to such &#x201c;wave sources,&#x201d; whereas various electric and/or electronic components of such parts may serve as their &#x201c;base units.&#x201d; A body, a case, and a coupler of the EMC system, however, may qualify as portions of such &#x201c;wave sources&#x201d; but may not qualify as the &#x201c;base units,&#x201d; for these parts neither irradiate the harmful waves nor affect the propagation paths of such harmful waves. Therefore, a shape of the &#x201c;wave source&#x201d; is different from that of the &#x201c;base unit,&#x201d; where the &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; may define the shape simpler or more complex than that of the &#x201c;wave source.&#x201d; However, the &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; is generally deemed as a subset of the &#x201c;wave source&#x201d; and, therefore, the &#x201c;base unit&#x201d; almost always defines a size which is smaller than or at most equal to that of its &#x201c;wave source.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">It is appreciated that various counter units of this invention may be included in various display panels and/or various display deices with such panels.

For the EMC display systems, however, their intended functions include not only generating such visual images on their screens but also generating audio signals accompanying such images. Accordingly, the wave sources of these EMC systems may include various speakers in addition to those of the EMC display panels, where not only the details of the speakers and their waves sources but also various counter units therefor have been disclosed in the above co-pending applications. Unless otherwise specified, the EMC display system includes therein its EMC display panel within the scope of this invention.</p>

<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The present invention relates to an electromagnetically-countered display system with at least one wave source irradiating harmful electromagnetic waves and at least one counter unit for emitting counter electromagnetic waves and for countering the harmful waves by the counter waves, e.g., by canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves with the counter waves in a target space and/or by suppressing the harmful waves with such counter waves from propagating toward the target space. More particularly, the present invention relates to counter units for the electromagnetically-countered display systems and to various mechanisms for countering the harmful waves irradiated by various base units of the wave source with the counter units. Accordingly, the counter unit may be shaped, sized, and/or arranged for matching its configuration with that of at least one of the base units of the wave source, thereby emitting such counter waves which automatically match wave characteristics of the harmful waves. In the alternative, the counter unit may be shaped, sized, and/or disposed in an arrangement which is defined along one or more wavefronts of such harmful waves, thereby emitting the counter waves automatically matching wave characteristics of such harmful waves. The present invention also relates to various counter units provided as analogs of at least one of the base units of the wave source, where the analog approximates (or simplifies) at least one of the base units which is more complex than the counter unit, where the three- or two-dimensional base unit is simplified (or approximated) as the two- or one-dimensional analog, and the like. The present invention also relates to multiple counter units simpler than at least one of such base units but disposed in an arrangement approximating such a shape and/or arrangement of the base unit. The present invention also relates to the counter unit which may be shaped and/or sized according to the configuration of at least one of the base units and disposition thereof. In addition, the present invention relates to various countering modes where a single counter unit may counter a single base unit or all (or at least two but not all) of multiple base units, where multiple counter units may counter a single base unit, a greater number of the base units or a less number of multiple units, and the like. The present invention further relates to various electric and/or magnetic shields which may be used either alone or in conjunction with at least one of the counter units to minimize irradiation of the harmful waves by at least one of the base units.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The present invention relates to various methods of countering such harmful waves irradiated by various base units of multiple wave sources of the EMC display system by the counter waves by the source or wave matchings. More particularly, the present invention relates to various methods of forming the counter unit as an analog of at least one of the base units and emitting the counter waves matching such harmful waves, various methods of approximating at least one of the base units by the simpler counter unit for the countering, and various methods of approximating at least one of the base units by multiple simpler counter units. The present invention relates to various methods of disposing the counter unit along the wavefronts of the harmful waves and emitting the counter waves matching the wavefronts of the harmful waves, and various methods of disposing multiple counter units along the wavefronts of the harmful waves and emitting the counter waves with the counter units matching the wavefronts. The present invention also relates to various methods of adjusting the wavefronts of the counter waves by disposing the counter unit closer to and/or farther away from the target space with respect to at least one of the base units, various methods of controlling radii of curvature of such wavefronts of the counter waves by incorporating one or multiple counter units emitting such waves with the same or opposite phase angles, and various methods of manipulating such wavefronts of the counter waves by disposing one or multiple counter units of the shape similar to or different from that of at least one of the base units. The present invention also relates to various methods of countering the harmful waves irradiated from a single or multiple base units with the counter waves emitted by a single or multiple counter units. Accordingly, the present invention also relates to various methods of emitting the counter waves by a single counter unit to counter the harmful waves irradiated by one or more base units and various methods of emitting the counter waves emitted from two or more counter units for countering such harmful waves irradiated from a single or multiple base units. In addition, the present invention also relates to various methods of minimizing irradiation of such harmful waves by incorporating the electric shields, by incorporating the magnetic shields, by incorporating one or both of such shields in conjunction with the above counter units, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The present invention further relates to various processes for providing various counter units for such EMC display systems and various EMC systems incorporating therein one or multiple counter units. More particularly, the present invention relates to various processes for providing such counter units capable of emitting the counter waves defining such wavefronts similar to (or different from) the shapes of the counter units, various processes for forming the counter units as the above analogs of at least one of such base units, various processes for providing the counter units emitting the counter waves having the similar or opposite phase angles, various processes for providing the counter units defining the wavefronts shaped similar to such harmful waves, and various processes for disposing the counter units in a preset arrangement and emitting thereby the counter waves of the wavefronts similar to such an arrangement. The present invention also relates to various processes for assigning a single counter unit in order to counter the harmful waves irradiated by a single base unit for the local countering or to counter the harmful waves irradiated by multiple base units for the global countering, various processes for assigning multiple counter units to counter the harmful waves irradiated from a single base unit for the global countering, and to counter the harmful waves irradiated by multiple base units for the local and/or global countering depending on numbers of the counter and base units. The present invention also relates to various processes for including such electric and/or magnetic shields for minimizing the irradiation of the harmful waves and various processes for minimizing the irradiation of such harmful waves by employing such shields and/or the above counter units.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The basic principle of the counter units of the EMC display systems of the present invention is to emit the counter waves defining the wavefronts similar (or identical) to those of the harmful waves but defining the phase angles at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves. Therefore, by propagating the counter waves toward the target space, the counter waves may effectively counter the harmful waves in the target space by, e.g., canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves with the counter waves therein, suppressing the harmful waves with the counter waves from propagating theretoward, and the like. To this end, such counter units preferably emit the counter waves defining the wavefronts matching those of the harmful waves by various mechanisms. In one example, such counter units are shaped similar (or identical) to at least one of the base units of the waves sources, or arranged similar (or identical) to the base unit and, accordingly, emit the counter waves capable of countering the harmful waves in the target space. In another example, the counter units are disposed along or across a single or multiple wavefronts of the harmful waves, emit the counter waves similar (or identical) to the harmful waves and, therefore, counter the harmful waves in the target space. In these examples, the counter units emit the counter waves forming the wavefronts similar (or identical) to the shapes of the counter units themselves, and those counter waves define the phase angles at least partially opposite to the phase angles of the harmful waves. In another example, such counter units are shaped differently from at least one of the base units, but rather disposed in an arrangement in which the counter waves emitted thereby match the harmful waves in the target space. In another example, the counter units are disposed across different wavefronts of such harmful waves but emit the counter waves similar (or identical) to the harmful waves, thereby, countering the harmful waves in the target space. In these last two examples, the counter units may be arranged to emit the counter waves defining such wavefronts which may or may not be similar (or identical) to the shapes of the counter units themselves, while the counter waves have the phase angles which are at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The basic principle of various generic counter units of the EMC display system of the present invention may be implemented to various conventional devices for minimizing irradiation of the harmful waves therefrom. For example, the counter units may be implemented to any base units of electrically conductive wires, coils, and/or sheets of the EMC display system or, alternatively, to any electrically semiconductive and/or insulative wires, coils, and/or sheets of the EMC display system for minimizing the irradiation of the harmful waves by countering the harmful waves by the counter waves, e.g., by canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves in the target space and/or suppressing such harmful waves from propagating to the target space, where the counter units may be made of and/or include at least one electrically conductive, insulative or semiconductive material. Such counter units may be implemented to any of the base units of the shapes which may be formed by including one or multiple wires, coils, and/or sheets, by modifying such shapes of one or multiple wires, coils, and/or sheets, where a few examples of the modified shapes may include a solenoid and toroid each of which may be formed by modifying the shape of the coil. Therefore, such counter units may be implemented into various display units of the EMC systems such as cathode ray tube display units, liquid crystal display units, organic and/or inorganic light emitting display units, plasma display units, and other display units which include multiple pixels and is also capable of emitting visible light rays when supplied with the source electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">It is appreciated that various counter units of such EMC display systems of this invention may be implemented to any display devices each including at least one of the base units and, accordingly, may irradiate such harmful waves including electric waves (to be abbreviated as &#x201c;EWs&#x201d; hereinafter) and magnetic waves (to be abbreviated as &#x201c;MWs&#x201d; hereinafter) of frequencies ranging about 50 to 60 Hz and/or other EWs and MWs of higher frequencies. It is appreciated that the EMC display systems of this invention may also be incorporated to any display devices and/or units of portable or stationary electric and/or electronic devices which include at least one base unit examples of which have been provided heretofore. It is further appreciated that the counter units may be provided in a micron-scale and included in semiconductor chips and circuits such as LSI and VLSI devices for such EMC display systems, that the counter units for the EMC display systems may also be formed in a nano-scale and incorporated to various nano devices including at least one base unit which may be a single molecule or a compound, or may be a cluster of multiple molecules or compounds, and so on.</p>

<p id="p-0189" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref> show top views of various prior art display units each including multiple pixels and electrodes supplying electrical energy thereto, where each display unit is arranged to emit visual light rays upwardly from the sheet. Based on this definition, the pixels of the display units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref> receive the electrical energy in a direction at least partially perpendicular to the sheet (i.e., along a direction coinciding with or opposite to a direction of the visible light rays), whereas the pixels of the display unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> receives the electrical energy in a direction at least partially parallel to the sheet (i.e., in a direction transverse to the direction of visible light rays). Accordingly, examples of the prior art display units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref> may include the conventional organic or inorganic light emitting diode units, plasma display units, and other display units where light emitting or transmitting elements of the pixels receive the energy along the direction parallel or opposite the direction of such light rays, while examples of the prior art display unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> may include the prior art liquid crystal display units and other display units where light emitting or transmitting elements of the pixels receive the energy along the direction transverse to the direction of the light rays. It is appreciated that various display units of the following figures may include other parts not included therein, where examples of such parts may include, but not be limited to, substrates on which such pixels are provided, external circuits or drivers manipulating routes and directions of the electrical energy supplied to those pixels, energy sources supplying such electrical energy, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a conventional display unit <b>9</b> includes multiple pixels <b>9</b>X arranged in an array with multiple rows and columns. The display unit <b>9</b> also includes at least one first electrode and a second electrode, where the former serves as one of an anode and a cathode, while the latter serves as the other of the anode and cathode. The first electrode also includes multiple first electric conductive paths <b>9</b>G which vertically extend parallel to each other and electrically couple with bottom portions of the pixels <b>9</b>X, whereas the second electrode includes multiple second electric conductive paths <b>9</b>T horizontally extending parallel to each other and electrically coupling with top portions of the pixels <b>9</b>X. The display unit <b>9</b> includes at least one external circuitry or a circuit driver (not included in the figure) which operatively couples with each of the first and second conductive paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T and directs the electrical energy to one or more selected pixels <b>9</b>X by delivering the energy (e.g., electric current and/or voltage) to those first and second paths <b>9</b>F, <b>9</b>T coupling with such pixels <b>9</b>X. It is to be understood that the display unit <b>9</b> in this arrangement is generally termed as a &#x201c;passive-matrix&#x201d; display unit <b>9</b> in that the pixels <b>9</b>X are selected sequentially by the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In operation, the driver selects one or more pixels <b>9</b>X to be turned on. Based upon locations of the pixels <b>9</b>X, the driver delivers the electrical energy to the corresponding first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T so that the electric energy is applied vertically to the pixels <b>9</b>X. In one example, such a display unit <b>9</b> corresponds to a conventional organic light emitting diode unit (to be abbreviated as the &#x201c;OLED&#x201d; unit hereinafter), where the second electrode and its second conductive paths <b>9</b>T serve as the cathode, while the first electrode and its first conductive paths <b>9</b>G serve as the anode. Each pixel <b>9</b>X includes two or more layers each including specific organic molecules, where one of such layers serves as a conductive layer, while another of such layers serves as an emissive layer. When the energy source applies the electrical energy between such cathode and anode and applies the electric voltage across the pixel <b>9</b>X, the electrical current begins to flow from the cathode to the anode through such organic layers. The cathode gives electrons to the emissive organic layer, while the anode removes electrons from the conductive layer of organic molecules or gives electron holes to the conductive layer. At a boundary between the emissive and conductive organic layers, such electrons find the electron holes and fill the holes by falling into lower energy levels and giving up the energy in the form of photons of light lays through a process called &#x201c;electrophosphorescence&#x201d;. Accordingly, such an OLED unit <b>9</b> may emit the visible light rays through the transparent cathode (i.e., a top emitting OLED) or through both of the transparent cathode and anode (i.e., a transparent OLED). In general, a color of such visible light rays depends on the type of organic molecules in the emissive layer, where an intensity or brightness of the light depends on an amount of the electric current applied. Further details of such OLED display units <b>9</b> are well documented in various references and well known to those skilled in the relevant art. In another example, the display unit <b>9</b> may correspond to a prior art inorganic (or small molecule) light emitting diode unit which is generally similar to the OLED unit but includes inorganic small molecules in the conductive and/or emissive layers. Other configurational and/or operational characteristics of the inorganic light emitting diode unit are similar or identical to those of the OLED unit. In another example, the display unit <b>9</b> corresponds to a conventional plasma display panel (to be abbreviated as the &#x201c;PDP&#x201d; unit hereinafter), where the second electrode and its second conductive paths <b>9</b>T serve as a display electrode, where the first electrode and its first conductive paths <b>9</b>G serve as an address electrode, and where the electrodes and paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T serve as the cathode and anode. Each pixel <b>9</b>X forms a cavity defined between a rib of the unit <b>9</b> and open through its top, includes ionizing gases such as neon, xenon, and/or their mixture, is coated with phosphor materials, and is also covered by additional layers such as, e.g., a conductive layer, a dielectric layer, a protective layer, and the like. To charge a specific pixel <b>9</b>X, the driver delivers the electrical energy from the energy source through the selected address and display electrodes. As the intersecting electrodes are charged with the voltage gradient therebetween, the electric current flows through the ionizing gases which are trapped inside the pixel <b>9</b>X. The ionizing gases stimulated by the current create a rapid flow of charged particles and release ultraviolet photons which interact with the phosphor material coated over an inner wall of the pixel <b>9</b>X. As the ultraviolet photon hits the phosphor atom in the pixel <b>9</b>X, one of the phosphor's electrons jumps to a higher energy level as the phosphor atom is heated up. When the electron falls back to its normal level, however, it releases energy in the form of a visible light photon. Therefore, the PDP unit <b>9</b> emits the visible light rays from its millions of pixels <b>9</b>X and then transmits such rays through the transparent display electrode. In general, a color of the visible light rays depends on the type of the ionizing gases trapped in each pixel <b>9</b>X, where an intensity or brightness of such light rays depends on an amount of the electric current applied. Further details of the prior art PDP units <b>9</b> are well documented in various references and well known to those skilled in the relevant art. In another example, such a display unit <b>9</b> corresponds to a prior art liquid crystal display unit (to be abbreviated as the &#x201c;LCD&#x201d; unit hereinafter), where each pixel <b>9</b>X includes at least two transparent filter layers of polarizing materials sandwiching therein a pair of transparent planar cathode and anode which in turn interpose therebetween a layer of liquid crystals. In this LCD unit, it is important to align axes of polarity of a pair of polarizing filters to be normal to each other, to form parallel microscopic grooves on the electrodes, i.e., the cathode and anode, and to align the grooves of the electrodes to be perpendicular to each other. Before the driver delivers the electrical energy thereto, the liquid crystals are generally in their relaxed state. The liquid crystal molecules begin to align themselves with the grooves provided on both electrodes in a helical structure or, in other words, twist the crystals. Light emitted from a light source and passing through one polarizing filter is then rotated as it passes through the liquid crystals, allowing it to pass through the second polarizing filter. One half of the light is absorbed by the first polarizing filter, but otherwise the entire LCD unit <b>9</b> is maintained transparent. When the driver supplies the electrical energy through the electrodes, the liquid crystal molecules are pulled parallel to the electric fields generated between the electrodes, thus reducing a rotation of the entering light. When the liquid crystals are completely untwisted, the light passing through the liquid crystals will be polarized perpendicular to the second polarizing filter. Therefore, such a pixel <b>9</b>X is completely blocked and appears unlit. By controlling the twist of the liquid crystal molecules in each pixel <b>9</b>X, light may be allowed to pass through the LCD unit <b>9</b> in varying amounts, correspondingly illuminating the pixel <b>9</b>X. It is normal to align the polarizing filters so that pixels are transparent when relaxed and become opaque in the presence of the electric fields, however the opposite is sometimes done for special effect. Further details of the prior art LCD units <b>9</b> are well documented in various references and well known to those skilled in the relevant art.</p>

In contrary to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, each second path <b>9</b>T is arranged to sit over multiple rows of pixels <b>9</b>X so that the external circuit may supply the electrical energy to multiple pixels <b>9</b>X intersected by such first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T.

It is to be understood that such first and second electrodes are interchanged in a manner that the display unit <b>9</b> include the first electrode <b>9</b>F with multiple first paths horizontally or vertically coupling with such controllers for multiple pixel sets <b>9</b>E and includes the second planar electrode, that the first electrode may be replaced by the first electrode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or by the second electrode of FIG. <b>1</b>B, and the like.

<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In another example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, a conventional display unit <b>9</b> similarly includes multiple pixels <b>9</b>X which are arranged in an array of multiple rows and columns, at least one first electrode, and at least one second electrode. Contrary to such electrodes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref>, the first and second electrodes includes multiple first and second electric conductive paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T, respectively, both of which extend laterally and parallel to each other. In addition, the first paths <b>9</b>G electrically couple with side portions of the pixels <b>9</b>X, while the second paths <b>9</b>T electrically couple with opposite side portions of the pixels <b>9</b>X. The display unit <b>9</b> includes the external circuitry or circuit driver operatively coupling with each of the first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T and directing the electrical energy to one or more selected pixels <b>9</b>X by delivering the energy (e.g., electric current and/or voltage) along those first and second paths <b>9</b>F, <b>9</b>T coupling with such pixels <b>9</b>X. It is to be understood that the display unit <b>9</b> is another passive-matrix display unit <b>9</b> in that the pixels <b>9</b>X are selected sequentially by the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In operation, the driver selects one or more pixels <b>9</b>X to be turned on.

In general, the display unit <b>9</b> may be any of the conventional OLED units, IOLED units, PDP units, LCD units, and so on, where the above first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T of the cathodes and anodes couple with the pixels <b>9</b>X on their sides. It is to be understood that all of the above display units require the electrical energy to be applied across the height of their pixels <b>9</b>X.

<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The prior art display units may include variations and/or modifications of those described in the above figures. In one example, the display unit may include any desirable number of any of the above pixels arranged in any number of rows and/or columns, where exact numbers may be determined by various factors such as, e.g., a desirable size of the display unit, a size of each pixel, a size of a gap to be provided between the adjoining pixels, and the like. Therefore, such pixels may be arranged to define the display unit of a preset aspect ration which may be, e.g., 4:3, 5:3, 5:4, 7:5, 7:3, 9:4, 9:5, 9:7, 16:9, 25:9, 25:16, and the like, where the pixels may define any of the above OLED, IOLED, PDP, LCD, DLP, and/or SED display units. In another example, such pixels of any of such display units may also be grouped into any desirable number of pixels sets each of which may include any desirable number of pixels therein, where sizes of the pixel sets and/or the number of pixels in such sets of pixels may be identical to each other or, in the alternative, may be different from each other. In another example, the pixels of any of the above display units may be arranged in a regular rectangular or square matrix or in a staggered matrix in which pixels of a given row (or column) may be located between the pixels of the adjacent row (or column). In another example, the drivers of such display units may drive their pixels in various modes such as, e.g., a non-progressive mode where only a limited number of pixels are turned on at any given moment, a progressive mode where all or at least a substantial number of pixels are turned on, an ALIS mode (representing &#x201c;alternate lighting of surfaces&#x201d;) where only one half of the pixels are turned on, and the like. In another example, the pixels may be formed as the cavities or cells each of which is individually defined on the screen of the display unit. Alternatively, the pixels may be formed as elongated troughs along each of which multiple pixels are defined by the electrodes extending thereover or therebelow. In another example, the pixels may also include multiple subpixels so that each pixel described in such figures may in fact consist of multiple subpixels. One example of this arrangement may be used to emit and/or transmit the visible color rays, where each pixel includes a red subpixel, a green subpixel, and a blue subpixel and where each of these subpixels may also be driven by separate paths which operate similar to the conductive paths.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">As described hereinabove, the prior art display units may include various wave sources such as, e.g., the first and second electrodes (also referred to as top and bottom electrodes or display and address electrodes), pixels of various passive and/or active-matrix OLED units, pixels of the passive and/or active-matrix inorganic light emitting diode units which will be abbreviated as the &#x201c;IOLED&#x201d; units hereinafter, pixels of the passive and/or active-matrix PDP units, pixels of the passive and/or active-matrix LCD units, and phosphor pixels of the CRT units. Although not exemplified in the above figures, the wave sources may further include the electrodes and pixels of other prior art display units which may include, but not limited to, digital light processing units which will be referred to as the &#x201c;DLP&#x201d; units hereinafter, surface-conduction electron-emitting devices which will be referred to as the &#x201c;SED&#x201d; units hereinafter, and other display units including multiple pixels capable of emitting and/or transmitting the visible light rays therethrough in response to the electrical energy (i.e., electric current and/or voltage) applied thereto either vertically or transversely. In addition, such wave sources may include the beam generators and steering coils of the CRT units. Moreover, the wave sources of the display units may also include various electric and/or electronic parts thereof. As described hereinabove, each of such wave sources includes various base units such as, e.g., a single or multiple conductive paths of each of the first and second electrodes, pixels of the above display units, various electric and/or electronic components of various parts of such units, and the like. Although not exemplified in the figures, such display units may also include the prior art cathode ray tube units (to be referred to as the &#x201c;CRT&#x201d; units hereinafter), and the wave sources of the CRT units may include their electron beam generators and steering units.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The base units of these wave sources almost always irradiate such extremely low-frequency harmful electromagnetic waves in the frequency ranges of, e.g., less than about 100 kHz, 50 kHz, 10 kHz, 5 kHz, 1 kHz or less. It is to be understood that the frequencies of these harmful waves may be dependent not only on the frequency of the electrical energy provided from the energy source to the display unit but also on the frequency of the electrical energy supplied to those pixels by the driver or external circuit, where the latter may constitute the &#x201c;primary&#x201d; base units in many circumstances. More particularly, various electrodes and their conductive paths which may be shaped into (extremely) thin wires and/or strips may constitute the primary base units of a prior art display unit of a particular type, for such electrodes and/or path must cover an entire area of a screen of the display unit both on and below such a screen. It is true that the pixels emitting or transmitting the visible light rays therethrough also have to cover the entire or at least a substantial area of the screen. As described hereinabove, however, the pixels of most conventional display units (probably except those of the CRT units) are designed to receive the electric current and/or voltage perpendicular to the screen (or to the sheet of FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>F<b>0</b> while irradiating such harmful waves propagating primarily along directions parallel to the screen (or sheet). In contrary, the electrodes and their conductive paths generally extend parallel to the screen (or sheet), and receive the electric current and/or voltage therealong, thereby irradiating such harmful waves primarily propagating along directions perpendicular to the screen (or sheet). In this context, such electrodes and their conductive paths generally qualify as the primary base units of various display units, whereas the pixels may serve as the secondary base units of the display units. It is also probable that the pixels may irradiate the harmful waves while emitting the visible light rays, in which the pixels may have to be regarded as the primary base units as well. In the CRT display units, however, various components of the beam generators as well as various coils of the steering units may serve as the primary base units, where the phosphor materials coated on its screen may also be considered as the primary base units when such materials irradiate the harmful waves while emitting the visible light rays. In addition, other conductive, semiconductive, and/or insulative parts of various display units may also serve as the primary or secondary units based on the intensity of the harmful waves irradiated therefrom. In any rate, it is to be reminded that various counter units of the present invention are designed to counter both of such primary and secondary base units. Therefore, when the counter unit is arranged to simplify (or approximate) only one of the above primary (or secondary) base units, the counter unit may be shaped and/or sized as one or more of various analogs simplifying (or approximating) one of the base units for countering the harmful waves irradiated from only one of such base units. When desirable, two or more of such analogs may be disposed in various locations around at least one of such primary (or secondary) base units or, in the alternative, may mechanically and/or electrically couple with each other, supplied with the electric energy in a preset pattern, and/or disposed in a preset location for countering the harmful waves irradiated by two or more of the base units. The counter units may also be provided as an unitary article which approximates two or more of such primary base units.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In order to counter such harmful waves irradiated from various base units of the conventional display units, various counter units are implemented for emitting counter electromagnetic waves (to be abbreviated as the &#x201c;counter waves&#x201d; hereinafter) and to counter the harmful waves therewith, e.g., by suppressing the harmful waves with such counter waves from propagating toward the target space, canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves with such counter waves in a target space, and the like. Thereby, the conventional display units incorporated with one or more of such counter units may be converted into the EMC display systems (or simply EMC systems) of the present invention. Various counter units and their countering mechanisms will now be enumerated. It is appreciated, however, that following counter units and countering mechanisms therefor of this invention may be embodied in many other different forms as well and, accordingly, should not be limited only to the following counter units and/or countering mechanisms thereof to be set forth herein. Rather, various exemplary counter units and various countering mechanisms described hereinafter are provided so that this disclosure is thorough and complete, and fully conveys the scope of this invention to one of ordinary skill in the art. It is further appreciated that various counter units and their countering mechanisms which have been described hereinabove and which are to be disclosed hereinafter may also apply to any conventional display units exemplified in the above figures, to other prior art display devices which have not been exemplified in such figures but have been disclosed in conjunction therewith as their modifications or variations, to other prior art display units including electrodes and/or pixels both of which may also be provided from those of the aforementioned prior art display units, and the like. Therefore, any of such conventional display units may be converted into such EMC systems of this invention by incorporating thereinto one or more of the counter units operating in one or more of the countering mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">As described above, various counter units of the present invention may be incorporated to the above prior art display devices and/or their display units in order to convert such into the EMC display systems and EMC display units, respectively. Alternatively, various counter units may be incorporated into at least one set of pixels of the prior art display units such that such a pixel set may be converted into the EMC pixel set and, therefore, the display unit incorporating such a pixel set may be converted into the EMC display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In a generic aspect of the present invention, an EMC display system generally includes therein multiple wave sources and at least one counter unit, and counters harmful electromagnetic waves (to be abbreviated as the &#x201c;harmful waves&#x201d; hereinafter) which are irradiated from the wave sources with counter electromagnetic waves (to be abbreviated as the &#x201c;counter waves&#x201d; hereinafter) emitted by the counter unit. Each of such wave sources includes at least one base unit which is the real source of the harmful waves, i.e., irradiating the harmful waves, affecting paths of propagation of such harmful waves while maintaining or altering their amplitudes and/or phase angles, and so on, where examples of such base units may include, but not be limited to, a conductive or semiconductive article such as a wire, a strip, a plate, a sheet, a ring thereof, a coil thereof, a spiral thereof, a mesh thereof, and so on, all of which emit the harmful waves when electric current flows therein, an insulative article such as a wire, a strip, a plate, a sheet, a ring thereof, a coil thereof, a spiral thereof, and a mesh thereof all of which may not carry the electric current but emit the harmful waves when electric voltage is applied thereacross, a permanent magnet which affects the direction, paths, and/or amplitudes of the harmful waves, and so on. Each wave source may include at least one optional part mechanically supporting or retaining its base units but neither irradiating nor affecting the paths of propagation of such harmful waves, where examples of the optional parts may include, but not be limited to, a case enclosing one or more of its base units, a protective cover, a coupler, any parts thereof in which the electric current does not flow, any parts thereof across which the voltage is not applied, and so on. The counter unit is arranged to emit the counter waves capable of countering such counter waves, e.g., by canceling the harmful waves and/or by suppressing the harmful waves from propagating in a specific direction. The counter unit may be arranged to counter the harmful waves in every direction from at least one of the base units of the wave source, e.g., above, below and around at least one of the base units. This embodiment, however, may be costly, may not be feasible, and/or may not be necessary, particularly when the EMC display system is to be disposed in a specific orientation by an user to be protected from the harmful waves. In such a case, the counter is arranged to counter the harmful waves only in or around a specific target space (or area) which is generally defined between at least one of the base units and the user (or a specific body part thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In order for the counter waves to counter (i.e., cancel and/or suppress) such harmful waves, there are a few prerequisite which the counter waves must satisfy. The first is the phase angles of the counter waves. In general, the counter waves preferably define the phase angles which are at least partially or substantially opposite to those of the harmful waves so that the counter waves may cancel and/or suppress the harmful waves when propagated to the target space from the same side as at least one of the base units. In the alternative, the counter waves may define the phase angles at least partially similar (or identical) to those of the harmful waves so that the counter waves cancel and/or suppress the harmful waves when propagated to the target space from an opposite side of at least one of the base units. When such an EMC display system includes multiple counter units, each of the counter units may emit the counter waves defining the same, similar or different phase angles. The next is the amplitudes of the counter waves. In contrary to their phase angles which must satisfy the preset relation to those of the harmful waves, the counter waves may have any amplitudes which effectively counter the harmful waves in the target space. When disposed closer to the target space than at least one of the base units, e.g., the counter unit has only to emit such counter waves with the amplitudes less than those of the harmful waves. Conversely, the counter unit disposed farther from at least one of the base units has to emit such counter waves of the amplitudes greater than those of the harmful waves, whereas the counter unit disposed flush with at least one of the base units with respect to the target space has to emit the counter waves with the similar or same amplitudes as the harmful waves. When the EMC display includes multiple counter units, all of its counter units may be disposed in similar distances from at least one of the base units and/or target space or, alternatively, at least two of the counter units may be disposed in different distances from at least one of the base units and/or target space. In addition to the distances and/or dispositions thereof, the counter waves may have various intensities depending upon whether the counter waves counter the harmful waves throughout an entire portion of the target space or only in preset positions inside such a target space. For example, the counter unit preferably emits such counter waves capable of countering the harmful waves throughout the target space as the user may be situated anywhere therein. When the user is to be situated only in preset positions of the target space, however, the counter may then be shaped, sized, arranged, and disposed to emit the counter waves which best counter the harmful waves only in such positions but not with such an efficiency in other positions of the target space.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Once the counter unit is arranged to emit the counter waves defining proper phase angles and amplitudes, such a counter unit may be shaped, sized, arranged, and disposed in order to counter the harmful waves depending on detailed countering mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In one example, the counter unit may be shaped, sized, and/or arranged similar (or identical) to at least one of such base units, where such a mechanism is to be referred to as a &#x201c;source matching&#x201d; hereinafter. The basic concept of the &#x201c;source matching&#x201d; is that the counter unit may emit the counter waves defining wavefronts similar to its configuration (i.e., its shape, size, and/or arrangement), that wavefronts of such counter waves may automatically match wavefronts of the harmful waves, and that the counter waves counter the harmful waves due to the similarity between the configurations of the counter unit and at least one of such base units. When the system includes multiple base units, a single counter unit may then be arranged to emit the counter waves capable of countering the harmful waves irradiated by one of the base units or, alternatively, capable of countering a sum of the harmful waves irradiated by all (or at least two but all) of such base units. When the system includes multiple counter units, the counter units may emit the counter waves capable of countering the harmful waves irradiated by a single base unit or multiple base units. When the system includes multiple counter units and multiple base units, the counter waves emitted by each counter unit may also counter the harmful waves irradiated by each base unit, a sum of the counter waves emitted by at least two counter units may counter the harmful waves irradiated by one of the base units, the counter waves emitted by a single counter unit may counter a sum the harmful waves irradiated by at least two base units, a sum of the counter waves from all of the counter units may counter a sum of the harmful waves irradiated by all (or at least two but not all) of the base units, and so on. It is preferred in this &#x201c;source matching&#x201d; that the counter unit emit the counter waves defining the wavefronts with a configuration (or pattern) similar to the configuration (or pattern) of itself. However, it is also possible that the counter unit emits the counter waves defining the wavefronts with a configuration (or pattern) different from that of the counter unit, that the wavefronts of a sum of the counter waves emitted by multiple counter units may form the configuration different from that of each counter unit and/or define the arrangement different from that of multiple counter units, as long as the counter waves may effectively counter the harmful waves in the target space.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In another example, the counter unit may be disposed (i.e., oriented, aligned, and/or positioned) in a manner that at least one wavefront of such counter waves may match at least one wavefront of the harmful waves, where this mechanism is to be referred to as a &#x201c;wave matching&#x201d; hereinafter. The basic concept of the &#x201c;wave matching&#x201d; lies in the fact that the counter waves may counter the harmful waves when the counter unit is incorporated in a disposition to match the wavefronts of the counter waves with the wavefronts of the harmful waves as far as the configuration of the counter unit may be properly manipulated in order to operate on such &#x201c;wave matching.&#x201d; When the EMC display system includes multiple base units, a single counter unit may be arranged to emit the counter waves which are capable of matching and countering the harmful waves irradiated by only one of the base units or, alternatively, matching and countering a sum of the harmful waves irradiated by all (or at least two but not all) of the base units. When the system includes multiple counter units, the counter units may emit the counter waves capable of countering the harmful waves irradiated by a single base unit or all (or at least two but not all) of the base units. When the system includes multiple counter units and multiple base units, the counter waves emitted by each counter unit may counter the harmful waves irradiated by each base unit, a sum of the counter waves emitted by at least two counter units may counter the harmful waves irradiated by one of the base units, the counter waves from a single counter unit may counter a sum the harmful waves irradiated by at least two base units, a sum of the counter waves emitted by all of the counter units may then counter a sum of the harmful waves irradiated by all of the base units, and the like, as long as at least a portion of at least one of such wavefronts of the counter waves may match and then counter at least a portion of at least one of the wavefronts of the harmful waves in the target space.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Various counter units constructed based on the source matching and/or wave matching are to be disclosed hereinafter. It is appreciated in the source matching that there does not exist any one-to-one correlations between the configuration of such a counter unit and the configuration of the counter waves emitted thereby. That is, the counter waves of certain configuration (or wave characteristics) may be obtained by a single counter unit which defines a certain shape and size and is provided in a certain arrangement, by another counter unit which defines a similar shape and size but is provided in another arrangement, by another counter unit which has a different shape and size but is provided in a similar arrangement, by at least two counter units defining preset shapes and sizes and provided in a preset arrangement, by the same number of counter units defining different shapes and/or sizes or in a different arrangement, by a different number of counter units defining similar shapes and/or sizes or in a similar arrangement. It is similarly appreciated in the above wave matching that there does not exist an one-to-one correlation between the disposition of the counter unit and the wavefronts of the counter waves emitted by the counter unit. In other words, the wavefronts with certain shapes may be obtained by a single counter unit which defines a certain configuration and is disposed in a certain position with respect to at least one of such base units and/or target space, by another single counter unit defining another configuration and also disposed in another position, by at least two counter units defining preset configurations and disposed in preset positions, by the same number of counter units defining different configurations and disposed in different positions, by a different number of counter units defining different configurations and disposed in different positions, and the like. Therefore, It is appreciated that such counter units may be embodied in many other different forms and should not be limited to following aspects and/or their embodiments which are to be set forth herein. Rather, various exemplary aspects and/or embodiments described herein are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and fully convey the scope of the present invention to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In another aspect of the present invention, a single generic counter unit may be provided for a single generic base unit to counter the harmful waves from the base unit by the counter waves from the counter unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref> show top schematic views of exemplary electromagnetic countering mechanisms in each of which a single counter unit emits the counter waves capable of countering the harmful waves which are irradiated from a single base unit of a single wave source according to the present invention, where the base unit is a point source in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> and <b>2</b>F, while the base unit is an elongated source in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref>. It is appreciated that these figures, however, may also be interpreted in different perspectives. For example, such figures may be interpreted as the top cross-sectional views, where the base units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> and <b>2</b>F are wires extending perpendicular to the sheet, and the base units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref> are strips or rectangular rods also extending normal to the sheet. In another example, the figures may be interpreted as sectional views of more complex articles, where the base units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> and <b>2</b>F may correspond to sections of coils, spirals, meshes, and the like, while the base units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref> may similarly correspond to sections of curvilinear rods or strips. It is also appreciated in these figures that such base units are enclosed in the wave sources which may be cases or other parts of such a system which do not irradiate such harmful waves. It is further appreciated in all of these figures that the EMC systems are disposed in such a way that the target space is formed to the right side of the counter and base units.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In one exemplary embodiment of such an aspect of the invention and as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes a single rectangular wave source <b>10</b> and a single counter unit <b>40</b>, where the source <b>10</b> includes therein a single base unit <b>10</b>B defining a shape of a point source. The counter unit <b>40</b> is similarly shaped as another point source and disposed to the right side of the base unit <b>10</b>B. In this arrangement, the counter unit <b>40</b> emits the counter waves of which wavefronts are identical to those of the harmful waves irradiated by the base unit <b>10</b>B. Because the counter unit <b>40</b> is disposed closer to a hypothetical target space on the right side of the figure, such counter wavefronts always define radii of curvature smaller than those of the harmful wavefronts. Accordingly, the counter unit <b>40</b> may counter (i.e., cancel or suppress) the harmful waves only along a line connecting the counter and base units <b>40</b>, <b>10</b>B or in its vicinity. It is appreciated that such an embodiment corresponds to the source matching which turns out to be ineffective due to a discrepancy in the radii of curvature of the wavefronts of the counter and harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes a single counter unit <b>40</b> and a single rectangular wave source <b>10</b> with a single base unit <b>10</b>B disposed therein. The base unit <b>10</b>B is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, however, the counter unit <b>40</b> is elongated, oriented vertically along its length, and disposed on the right side of the base unit <b>10</b>B. Due to its elongated shape, the counter unit <b>40</b> emits the counter waves whose wavefronts are also elongated vertically and, therefore, define the radii of curvature which are greater than those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and which match those of the harmful waves. Accordingly, such a counter unit <b>40</b> defines a target space <b>50</b> across which the counter waves counter the harmful waves to a preset extent.

Because of its arcuate shape, such a counter unit <b>40</b> emits the counter waves of which wavefronts are also arcuate and, therefore, define the radii of curvature which are similar or identical to those of the harmful waves. Therefore, the counter unit <b>40</b> defines a target space <b>50</b> across which the counter waves counter the harmful waves to a preset extent. It is appreciated that such an embodiment corresponds to another wave matching mechanism and that the counter waves emitted form this arcuate counter unit <b>40</b> better match such harmful wavefronts and define the target space <b>50</b> which expands over a wider angle around the base unit <b>10</b>B than those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes a single counter unit <b>40</b> and a single rectangular wave source <b>10</b> with a single base unit <b>10</b>B. Contrary to those of the above, this base unit <b>10</b>B is rectangular and oriented vertically along its length or its long axis, and irradiates the harmful waves of which wavefronts define vertical and relatively straight portions which are attributed to the length or long axis of the base unit <b>10</b>B. The counter unit <b>40</b> is shaped and sized similar or identical to the base unit <b>10</b>B, and disposed in the same orientation as the base unit <b>10</b>B. This orientation may be viewed to dispose the counter unit <b>40</b> along the vertical straight portions of the wavefronts of the harmful waves. The counter unit <b>40</b> also emits the counter waves whose wavefronts define vertical and relatively straight portions, similarly due to the length or long axis thereof. Because such portions of the counter wavefronts match those of the harmful wavefronts, the counter unit <b>40</b> forms the target space <b>40</b> to the right side. This embodiment corresponds to the source matching, wave matching or their combination. It is to be understood that the counter unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is shaped and sized as the base unit but ineffective due to a discrepancy in the radii of curvature between the wavefronts of the counter and source waves. The counter unit <b>40</b> of this embodiment is similarly shaped and sized as the base unit <b>10</b>B but efficiently counter such harmful waves in the target space <b>50</b>. The primary reason of this countering lies in the fact that both of the harmful and counter waves define along their wavefronts the vertical straight portions which generally do not depend upon the radii of curvature thereof. Otherwise, configuring the counter unit <b>40</b> similar to the base unit <b>10</b>B and then disposing such a counter unit <b>10</b> between the base unit <b>10</b>B and target space generally do not provide an efficient countering, where further details of this front arrangement are to be provided below. It is appreciated that such an embodiment corresponds to the source matching in which the counter unit <b>40</b> is shaped, sized, and/or arranged similar (or identical) to the base unit <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes a single counter unit <b>40</b> and a single rectangular wave source <b>10</b> with a single base unit <b>10</b>B which is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. The counter unit <b>40</b>, however, is shaped and sized to conform to one wavefront of such harmful waves. Similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the counter unit <b>40</b> is shaped as an arc and disposed in an orientation concave to the right side of the figure or target space <b>50</b>. Because of its arcuate shape, such a counter unit <b>40</b> emits such counter waves of which wavefronts are also arcuate and, therefore, define the radii of curvature which are similar or identical to those of the harmful waves, not only along their vertical straight portions but also along their curved portions, mainly due to the arcuate shape of the counter unit <b>40</b>. Accordingly, such a counter unit <b>40</b> defines a target space <b>50</b> which also expands over a wide angle therearound and across which the counter waves effectively counter such harmful waves. It is to be understood that this embodiment corresponds to another wave matching mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes a single counter unit <b>40</b> and a single rectangular wave source <b>10</b> which has a single base unit <b>10</b>B therein. Both of the counter and base units <b>40</b>, <b>10</b>B are identical to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. However, the counter unit <b>40</b> is disposed on an opposite side of a target space <b>50</b> with respect to the base unit <b>10</b>B and aligned with the base unit <b>10</b>B as are the cases with the preceding figures. In this arrangement, the counter unit <b>40</b> emits the counter waves of which wavefronts are identical to those of the harmful waves irradiated by the base unit <b>10</b>B. Because the counter unit <b>40</b> is disposed farther away from the target space <b>50</b>, such counter wavefronts define the radii of curvature which approach and then match those of the harmful wavefronts when disposed at a proper distance from the base unit <b>10</b>B. Accordingly, the counter unit <b>40</b> disposed in this rear arrangement may effectively counter the harmful waves and defines the target space <b>50</b> expanding over a wide angle around the base unit <b>10</b>B. It is appreciated that the sole difference between the counter units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2F</figref> is their dispositions, i.e., one disposed in the &#x201c;front arrangement&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and another disposed in the &#x201c;rear arrangement&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>. It is also appreciated that the rear arrangement is not necessarily superior to the front arrangement and that further details of selecting the proper arrangement are to be provided below. It is further appreciated that this embodiment corresponds to the wave matching in which the counter unit <b>40</b> is disposed at the position for matching the harmful wavefronts with the counter wavefronts.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Although not included in the figures, a single counter unit may be disposed in an arrangement flush with the base unit with respect to the target space, flush with a direction of propagation of the harmful waves, flush with another direction along which electric current flows in the base or counter unit, flush with another direction in which electric voltage is applied across the base or counter units, and so on. In this &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; arrangement, the radii of curvature of the counter wavefronts automatically match those of the harmful wavefronts and, therefore, the counter waves effectively match and then counter the harmful waves in the target space. For this arrangement, however, the wave source has to provide a space in which the counter unit may be incorporated. Therefore, the counter unit may be implemented inside the wave source and close to the base unit thereof when applicable. Otherwise, the counter unit may instead be disposed over, below or beside the wave source and as close to the base unit as possible. It is appreciated, however, that the counter unit disposed next to the base unit may propagate the counter waves onto the base unit and obstruct normal operation of the base unit. Accordingly, the lateral arrangement is preferably selected only when such an arrangement may not obstruct the normal operation of the base unit, wave source including such or EMC system including such. When the lateral arrangement does not affect the operation of the base unit but the counter unit may not be disposed close to the base unit due to space limitations, two or more counter units may be disposed on opposing sides (e.g., left and right, top and bottom, front and rear, and the like) of such a base unit and as close to the base unit as possible. Such counter units may also be arranged to emit the counter waves a sum of which may be symmetric or skewed toward a preset direction based on the wave characteristics of the harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">In another aspect of the present invention, multiple generic counter unit may be provided for a single generic base unit for countering the harmful waves irradiated by the base unit with the counter waves emitted by all of such counter units or emitted by at least two but not all of such counter units. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G to 2L</figref> are top schematic views of exemplary electromagnetic countering mechanisms in each of which multiple counter units emit counter waves to counter harmful waves irradiated from a single base unit of a single wave source according to the present invention, where the base unit is a point source in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G to 2K</figref>, while the base unit is an elongated source in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref>. It is appreciated that these figures, however, may also be interpreted in different perspectives. For example, such figures may be viewed as the top cross-sectional views, where the base units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G to 2K</figref> are wires extending perpendicular to the sheet, and the base unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref> is a strip or a rectangular rod also extending normal to the sheet. In another example, the figures may be interpreted as sectional views of more complex articles, where the base units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G to 2K</figref> may correspond to sections of coils, spirals, meshes, and the like, whereas the base unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref> may similarly correspond to sections of curvilinear rods or strips. It is also appreciated in these figures that such base units are enclosed in the wave sources which may be cases or other parts of such a system which do not irradiate such harmful waves. It is further appreciated in all of these figures that the EMC systems are disposed in such a way that the target space is formed to the right side of the counter and base units.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In one exemplary embodiment of such an aspect of the invention and as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes two counter units <b>40</b> and a single wave source <b>10</b> including a single base unit <b>10</b>B. The base unit <b>10</b>B is similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>, while a pair of counter units <b>40</b> are disposed between the base Ni <b>10</b>B and a target space <b>50</b>. Such counter units <b>40</b> are also disposed symmetric to the base unit <b>10</b>B and flush with each other with respect thereto, i.e., the counter units <b>40</b> are disposed at an equal distance from the base unit <b>10</b>B and/or target space <b>50</b>. Such counter units <b>40</b> are arranged to emit the counter waves of the same phase angles so that the wavefronts of the counter waves from each counter unit <b>40</b> are superposed onto each other while increasing their amplitudes. As the counter waves propagate, their wavefronts which correspond to a sum of each set of wavefronts from each counter unit <b>40</b> increase their radii of curvature as if they are emitted by the elongated counter units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B to 2E</figref>. Therefore, the counter wavefronts match the harmful wavefronts, and the pair of counter units <b>40</b> match and counter the base unit <b>10</b>B while defining the target space <b>50</b> expanding over a limited angle therearound. It is to be understood that disposing two or more counter units <b>40</b> result in flattening the wavefronts of the counter waves and increasing the radii of curvature of the superposed portions of the counter wavefronts. It is further appreciated that this arrangement corresponds to the wave matching in which multiple counter units <b>40</b> are disposed along one wavefront of the harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes three counter units <b>40</b> and a single wave source <b>10</b> enclosing therein a single base unit <b>10</b>B. The base unit <b>10</b>B is similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>, while the counter units <b>40</b> are similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> such that all counter units <b>40</b> are disposed between the base unit <b>10</b>B and target space <b>50</b> and flush with the base unit <b>10</b>B. However, the system <b>5</b> includes one more counter unit <b>40</b> so that an array of three counter units <b>40</b> approximate the wavefronts of such harmful waves better than those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>. Accordingly, the counter units <b>40</b> emit the counter waves which better counter the base unit <b>10</b>B and define the target space <b>50</b> expanding over a wider angle therearound than those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>. It is appreciated that disposing three counter units <b>40</b> result in further flattening the superposed wavefronts of the counter waves and also result in increasing the radii of curvature of such portions of the wavefronts of the counter waves. It is also appreciated that this arrangement is another wave matching where all three counter units <b>40</b> are disposed along one wavefront of the harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes two counter units <b>40</b> and a single wave source <b>10</b> including a single base unit <b>10</b>B which is similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. Two counter units <b>40</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the base unit <b>10</b>B at an equal distance therefrom and also flush with the base unit <b>10</b>B with respect to a target space <b>50</b>. Similar to those of all of the preceding embodiments, such counter units <b>40</b> emit the counter waves defining the similar or identical phase angles so that the counter waves emitted by each of such counter units <b>40</b> superpose onto each other for not only increasing their amplitudes but also flattening the superposed portions of their wavefronts while increasing the radii of curvature of such wavefronts. Accordingly, the counter units <b>40</b> counter the harmful waves and define the target space <b>50</b> spanning around a rather limited angle therearound. It is appreciated that this arrangement is rather the source matching than the wave matching in that the counter units <b>40</b> are disposed in the symmetric arrangement and effect the elongated counter unit arranged flush with the base unit <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes three counter units <b>40</b> and a single wave source <b>10</b> enclosing therein a single base unit <b>10</b>B which is similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref>. Contrary to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, three counter units <b>40</b> are disposed on an opposite side of a target space <b>50</b> with respect to the base unit <b>10</b>B. The counter units <b>40</b> are arranged flush with each other relative to the base unit <b>10</b>B and target space <b>50</b> and also spaced away from each other at an equal distance. Similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G to 2I</figref>, both of outer counter units <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>C are arranged to emit the counter waves defining the phase angles at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves so that superposed portions of the wavefronts of the counter waves are flattened while increasing their radii of curvature. Contrary to those of the preceding figures, a middle counter unit <b>40</b>B is arranged to emit the counter waves defining the phase angles which are at least partially similar to those of such harmful waves and opposite to those of the counter waves emitted by the outer counter units <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>C. Therefore, a net effect of incorporating the middle counter unit <b>40</b>B is to sharpen the curvature of the superposed portions of the wavefronts of a sum of the counter waves and to define the target space <b>50</b> expanding around a narrower angle around the base unit <b>10</b>B, as manifest in a comparison between the target spaces <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2F and 2J</figref>. That is, by incorporating multiple counter units <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>C emitting the counter waves of the phase angles opposite to each other, it is feasible to precisely manipulate the wavefronts of the sum of such counter waves and their radii of curvature for better matching the wavefronts of the harmful waves. It is appreciated that such an embodiment may corresponds to the source matching, wave matching or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The counter units <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>C of this embodiment may be incorporated in different arrangements. For example, only two counter units may be included to emit the counter waves with opposite phase angles, where resulting wavefronts of the sum of the counter waves are not symmetric but skewed to one or an opposite side. In addition, the distances between the counter units may be manipulated to adjust the wavefronts of a sum of the counter waves regardless of the number of the counter units. Moreover, the counter units emitting the counter waves defining the phase angles similar to those of the harmful waves may be employed as the outer units to further sharpen the superposed portions of the counter waves.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes three counter units <b>40</b> and a single wave source <b>10</b> enclosing therein a single base unit <b>10</b>B which is similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. The counter units <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>C are also similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> so that all of such counter units <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>C are disposed between the base unit <b>10</b>B and target space <b>50</b> and similar to each other, that the counter units <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>C emit the counter waves of the same or similar phase angles, and so on. However, each counter unit <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>C is arranged to form an arcuate article shaped and sized to match a portion of a wavefront of the counter waves. In addition, both of upper and lower counter units <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>C are spaced away from each other and also disposed along one wavefront of the harmful waves, whereas a middle counter unit <b>40</b>B is disposed between the upper and lower counter units <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>C and along an adjacent wavefront of the harmful waves in such a manner that superposed portions of the wavefronts of a sum of the counter waves are flattened while defining larger radii of curvature and match the wavefronts of the harmful waves, thereby forming a target space <b>50</b> which expands over a wide angle around the base unit <b>10</b>B.

<p id="p-0224" num="0223">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref>, an EMC system <b>5</b> includes three counter units <b>40</b> and a single wave source <b>10</b> enclosing therein a single base unit <b>10</b>B. While the base unit <b>10</b>B is similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref>, the counter units <b>40</b> are similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> and emit the counter waves which are flattened and define vertical straight portions therealong. Therefore, the counter waves match the vertical straight portions of the harmful waves and define a target space <b>50</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. It is appreciated that this embodiment is another source matching in which three counter units <b>40</b> approximate the elongated base unit <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">In another aspect of the present invention, a single generic counter unit may also be provided for multiple generic base units for countering the harmful waves from such base units by the counter waves from the counter unit. In one example, such a counter unit may be arranged to counter a sum of the harmful waves irradiated by each base units, where detailed disposition of the counter unit may depend upon configurations and/or dispositions of the base units, amplitudes and/or directions of the harmful waves irradiated by such base units, and the like. Based thereupon, the counter unit may be disposed symmetrically to all or at least some of the base units, may be incorporated in the front, rear or lateral arrangement, and the like, where such arrangements are generally referred to an &#x201c;global or overall countering&#x201d; hereinafter. In another example, the counter unit is rather arranged to counter the harmful waves irradiated by only one of multiple base units, where such an arrangement is generally referred to as &#x201c;local or individual countering&#x201d; hereinafter. This local countering may only be effective when other uncountered base units irradiate negligible amounts of such harmful waves, when other uncountered base units irradiate non-negligible amounts of the harmful waves to other directions than the target space, and the like. Otherwise, it is preferred to manipulate the counter unit to counter the harmful waves of the uncountered base units, to include additional counter units for countering those harmful waves, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">It is appreciated that various countering mechanisms described hereinabove for a single base unit may equally be applied to the system with multiple base units in the global countering mechanism. That is, the above countering mechanisms may be applied not to such harmful waves irradiated by the single base unit but to a sum of the harmful waves irradiated by multiple base units. When the system is to operate in the local countering mechanism, the aforementioned mechanisms may also be applied to each of multiple base units regardless of an exact number of such base units.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">In another aspect of the present invention, multiple counter units may be provided for multiple base units for countering the harmful waves irradiated from such base units with the counter waves emitted by the counter units. In one example, multiple counter units are provided in the same number as the base units and each counter unit is arranged to counter only one of such base units in the local countering mechanism. Alternatively, at least one of such counter units may counter only one of such base units in the local countering mechanism, whereas at least one another of such counter units may counter at least two of the base units in the global countering mechanism. In another example, a less number of counter units are provided so that each counter unit is arranged to counter at least two of the base units in the global countering mechanism, that at least one of the counter units counters one of such base units in the local countering mechanism while at least one another of such counter units counters at least two of such base units in the global countering mechanism, and the like. In another example, a greater number of counter units are provided so that each base unit may be countered by at least two of the counter units, that at least one of the counter units counters one of the base units in the local countering mechanism while at least one another of the counter units may counter at least two of such base units in the global countering mechanism, and so on. In all of these examples, any of the above front, rear, and lateral countering mechanisms may be used by the counter units, where such countering mechanisms may be same or different for each counter unit.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Configurational and/or operational variations of such EMC systems and their counter units as well as configurational and/or operational modifications of such EMC systems and their counter units as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2L</figref> and/or as disclosed hereinabove without any accompanying figures also fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">As described above, a typical EMC system includes at least one wave source and at least one counter unit, where the wave source includes or encloses therein at least one of the base units and where the counter unit may include at least one optional electric connector such as a lead wire and at least one optional coupler for coupling the counter unit to other parts of the system. The EMC system may include at least one body which encloses at least a portion of the base units, at least a portion of the counter unit, and the like. Alternatively, an entire portion of the counter and/or at least one of such base units may be exposed with or without such a body.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">More specifically, the counter unit consists of various parts such as at least one body, at least one optional support, and at least one insert. The body of the counter unit qualitatively corresponds to the base unit of the wave source in that such a body is the sole component of the counter unit which emits the counter waves when the electric current flows therein, when the electric voltage is applied thereacross, and the like. Therefore, such a body may preferably be made of and/or include at least one electric conductor when the electric current is to flow therein, may be made of and/or include any electrically conductive, semiconductive or insulative material when the electric voltage is to be applied thereacross, and the like. The support serves to mechanically support the above body and/or retain such a body therein for mechanical protection and/or electrical isolation. The insert is typically used to augment amplitudes of the counter waves, particularly when the counter unit includes at least one coil of conductive wire into which such an insert is disposed. The insert may be made of and/or include various magnetic materials such as, e.g., ferromagnetic materials, paramagnetic materials, diamagnetic materials, and ferrimagnetic materials, where the ferromagnetic materials are the preferred ones. It is appreciated that the counter unit is generally arranged to maintain its configuration while emitting such counter waves, where this fixed configuration may be embodied by defining the body of the counter unit of rigid materials, by fixedly coupling the body of the counter unit to the support, and so on. In the alternative, the counter unit may be arranged to change its shape while emitting such counter waves, where this variable configuration may be embodied by defining the body of the counter unit of elastic or deformable materials, by movably coupling the body of the counter unit to the support, and the like. It is appreciated that the counter unit emitting such counter waves is to be opposed by at least one of the base units irradiating the harmful waves of an opposite magnetic polarity. Therefore, the counter unit tends to move while emitting the counter waves, where a special provision may also have to be implemented when it is desirable to fix the counter unit during its wave-emitting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The counter may be provided in various configurations which typically refer to shapes, sizes, arrangements, and the like. In general, the configuration of the counter unit depends upon the above countering modes (such as, e.g., the source or wave matching) and/or countering mechanisms (such as, e.g., the front, rear or lateral arrangement, local or global matching, and the like), which generally depend on the configurational characteristics of at least one of such base units, wave characteristics of the harmful waves, and the like. In addition, the configuration of the counter unit depends upon the shapes, sizes, orientation, and/or dispositions of the target space which are to be formed on one side of and/or around the counter unit.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The shape of the counter unit may also be arranged to be identical (or similar) to the shape of at least one of the base units, where the counter unit is to be constructed to emit the counter waves which match the harmful waves automatically. The shape of the counter unit may be arranged to be different from the shape of at least one of the base units as well, where such a counter unit may be provided in other shapes, may be wound around at least one of the base units, may enclose therein at least a portion of at least one of such base units, may be enclosed by at least a portion of at least one of the base units, and the like. The counter unit may define a shape of a wire, a strip, a sheet, a tube, a coil thereof, a spiral thereof, and/or a mesh thereof, may form a combination of two or more of such shapes without defining any holes or openings therethrough, may define an array of two of more of such shapes while defining multiple holes and/or openings therethrough, and the like, where examples of the combinations and/or arrays may include, but not be limited to, a bundle including multiple identical or different shapes bundling each other, a braid of multiple identical or different shapes braided along each other, and the like. The counter unit may also be made of a mixture which includes at least two materials and which are also provided in any of the above shapes, combinations, and/or arrays. It is appreciated that the coil (including a solenoid or a toroid), the spiral, the mesh, and the arrays thereof may be particularly useful in the wave matching as will be described below. It is also appreciated that all of multiple counter units may define the same shape or that at least two but not all of such counter units may define the same shape. In the alternative, each counter unit may define a different shape.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The counter unit may further be shaped to conform to at least one of the base units so that the counter waves emitted from the counter unit better match the harmful waves, where the counter unit may conform to the at least one of the base units while approximating such or providing further details thereto. Alternatively, the counter unit may be shaped to not conform to at least one of the base units while manipulating such counter waves to match the harmful waves. This arrangement may be used when a single counter unit counters multiple base units or when multiple counter units counter a single base unit. It is appreciated in this arrangement that the counter unit(s) may receive desirable electrical energy (e.g., current and/or voltage) to emit such counter waves capable of matching and countering the harmful waves in the target space. It is also appreciated that all of the counter units may conform to a single base unit, to at least two but not all of multiple base units, or to each (or all) of multiple base units, that at least two but not all of the counter units may conform to a single base unit, to at least two but not all of multiple base units, or to each (or all) of multiple base units, and so on. In the alternative, all of the counter units may not conform to any of the base units.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">When at least one counter unit is shaped similar (or identical) to at least one base unit, such a counter unit is preferably arranged to approximate a single base unit, at least two but not all of multiple base units or all of the base units. When the base unit forms a three-dimensional (or 3-D) shape, the counter unit may be provided as a three-dimensional analog of a similar and/or simpler shape, a two-dimensional (or 2-D) analog or an one-dimensional (or 1-D) analog. When the base unit defines a 2-D shape, the counter unit may be formed as a 2-D analog of a similar or simpler shape or an 1-D analog. When the base unit forms an 1-D shape, the counter unit may be provided as another 1-D analog of a similar or simpler shape. When a single counter unit is to counter multiple base units, the counter unit may approximate only one major base unit as one of the analogs, may approximate at least two of the base units into one of such analogs, and the like. When multiple counter units are to counter a single base unit, each counter unit may approximate only a portion of the base unit or may redundantly form the analog of such a base unit. When multiple counter units are to counter multiple counter units, such counter units may also approximate the base units into the analogs of the same dimension or different dimensions. It is appreciated that those analogs conform to the base units and, accordingly, that such analogs may define rather straight or curved shapes depending upon the shapes of the base units. It is also appreciated that such analogs preferably maintain similarity with at least one of the base units, where the similarity is maintained in terms of lengths of the counter and/or base units, widths thereof, heights thereof, thicknesses thereof, diameters or radii thereof, radii of curvature thereof, numbers of revolutions or turns thereof, ratios of such lengths, ratios of such widths, ratios of such thicknesses or heights, ratios of such diameters or radii, ratios of such numbers, and the like. When a single base unit is countered by a single counter unit, such configurational parameters are defined in each of the base and counter units. When a single counter unit counters multiple base units, such configurational parameters are defined in the counter unit, in an array of all of such base units, in an array of at least two but not all of such base units, and the like. When multiple counter units counter a single base unit, such configurational parameters are defined in the base unit, in an array of all of the counter units, in an array of at least two but not all of the counter units, and the like. When multiple counter units are to counter the same or different number of base units, such configurational parameters are also defined individually or in arrays as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">When a single counter unit or multiple counter units are shaped similar (or identical) to a single base unit or multiple base units, the counter units may be arranged to provide details to at least one of the base units, not in the sense of adding structures not present in the base units but in the context of streamlining or smoothening the wavefronts of the counter waves to better match the wavefronts of such counter waves with those of the harmful waves. For example, a single or multiple small counter units may be disposed around (or inside) one or multiple major counter units for streamlining outer (or inner) edges of the wavefronts of a sum of the counter waves emitted by the major counter units. In another example, a single or multiple small counter units may be disposed closer to (or farther away from) one or multiple major counter units to manipulate radii of curvature of the wavefronts of a sum of the counter waves emitted by the major counter units. These small or minor counter units may be disposed in various relations to one or more major counter units for other purposes as well, as far as incorporation of the minor counter units may improve such matching between the counter and harmful waves in the target space. Therefore, when the system includes multiple counter units, at least one (or all, at least two but not all) of the counter units may be arranged to approximate at least one (or all, at least two but not all) of such base units, at least one (or all, at least two but not all) of the counter units may also be arranged to provide details to at least one (or all, at least two but not all) of the base units, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The counter unit may be arranged to form various cross-sections along a longitudinal (or long) axis thereof, its short axis which may be perpendicular or otherwise transverse to the long axis, and the like. In one example, the counter unit is arranged to define an uniform cross-section along at least one of such axes so that the counter waves emitted thereby also define the wavefronts defining the same shapes along one of such axes. In another example, the counter unit may be provided to vary its cross-section along at least one of such axes so that the counter waves emitted therefrom define the wavefronts varying their shapes along at least one of such axes. When the system has multiple counter units, all of such units may define the same shape or at least two of such counter units may define different shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The counter unit may be arranged to define various sizes while emitting the counter waves of proper amplitudes capable of effectively countering the harmful waves. For example, the counter unit disposed in the front arrangement may define a size smaller than that of at least one of the base units due to its closer disposition to the target space. In contrary, another counter unit disposed in the rear arrangement may instead have a size larger than that of at least one of the base units due to a greater distance to the target space. However, the size of the counter unit may be decided by other factors such as, e.g., the shape of the counter unit, amplitudes of electric energy (i.e., current and/or voltage) supplied thereto, and the like. Accordingly, the counter unit in the front arrangement may define a size larger than that of at least one of such base units while emitting a less amount of the counter waves per its unit area, while the counter unit in the rear arrangement may have a size smaller than that of at least one of the base units while emitting a greater amount of the counter waves per its unit area, and the like. That is, the size of the counter unit may be deemed as a secondary parameter which may be decided by other factors such as, e.g., the shape of the counter unit, amplitudes of the electric energy supplied thereto, distances to at least one of the base units and/or target space, arrangement of such counter unit(s), orientation thereof, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The counter unit may also be arranged to have various sizes along its longitudinal and/or short axes. In one example, the counter unit is arranged to form an uniform size along the long and/or axes such that the counter waves emitted thereby form the wavefronts of the same shapes along the long and/or short axes when the same amount of the energy is supplied thereto. In another example, such a counter unit may be provided to vary its size along the long and/or short axes such that the counter waves emitted thereby form the wavefronts varying their shapes along one of such axes. In addition, the counter unit may maintain the same size along the long and/or short axes while varying its shape therealong. When the system includes multiple counter units, such counter units may define the same size or at least two of such units may define different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Multiple counter units may be incorporated in various arrangements, where such counter units are arranged to emit the counter waves capable of automatically matching the harmful waves due to such an arrangement. In one example, the counter units may be in an arrangement conforming to the shape of a single base unit or conforming to an arrangement of multiple base units so that the counter waves match the harmful waves in the target space. In another example, the counter units may be in an arrangement which may not conform to the shape of the single base unit or to the arrangement of multiple base units. These arrangements may be embodied when multiple counter units are to counter a single base unit or when multiple counter units counter a different number of multiple base units. It is to be understood in these arrangements that the counter units may receive the electrical energy (e.g., current and/or voltage) to emit the counter waves which are capable of matching and countering the harmful waves in the target space. The counter units may be in an arrangement symmetric to at least one of the base units and/or target space so that the counter waves emitted therefrom may match the symmetric harmful waves. Conversely, the counter units may be disposed in an arrangement which is asymmetric to at least one of the base units and/or target space such that the asymmetric counter waves emitted therefrom may match and counter the asymmetric harmful waves in the target space. The single counter unit or multiple counter units may be in an arrangement enclosing therein at least a portion of one or multiple base units. Conversely, the single counter unit or multiple counter units may be in an arrangement in which at least a portion of the counter unit may be enclosed by one or multiple base units. It is appreciated that these arrangements generally connote a pattern of multiple counter units but that these arrangements may mean an orientation and/or alignment of a single counter unit.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The counter may also be provided in various dispositions which generally refer to orientations, alignments, distances, mobilities, and the like. The disposition of the counter unit generally depends on the countering modes (such as the source or wave matching), countering mechanisms (such as the front, rear or lateral arrangement, local or global countering, and so on), configurations of the counter unit, and the like, each of which generally depend on the configurational characteristics of at least one of the base units, wave characteristics of the harmful waves, and so on. In addition, the dispositions of the counter unit also depend upon the shapes, sizes, orientation, and/or dispositions of the target space defined on one side of and/or around the counter unit. Although not always correct, it is to be understood as heuristic rules that at least one counter unit is disposed closer to at least one base unit in the local countering mechanism and that at least one counter unit is disposed farther away from at least one base unit in the global countering mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The counter unit may be incorporated in various orientations for orienting such counter waves to the harmful waves. In one example, the counter unit may be disposed in an orientation defined with respect to a propagation direction of such harmful waves, e.g., by orienting its long and/or short axes normal to the direction of the propagation. In another example, the counter unit may be disposed in an orientation defined with respect to a direction of the electric energy (i.e., current and/or voltage), e.g., by orienting its long and/or short axes parallel to, normal to or in a preset angle relative to the direction of the electric energy. In another example, the counter unit may be disposed in an orientation defined with respect to the long and/or short axes of at least one of the base units. It is appreciated that such orientations of the counter unit may also depend upon other configurations of at least one of the base units, particularly when such a base unit irradiates the harmful waves along a direction different from at least one of its axes, different from a winding direction of its coil or other parts, and the like. When the system includes multiple counter units, all of such counter units may also be disposed in the same orientation, each counter unit may be disposed in a different orientation, at least two but not all of the counter units may be disposed in the same orientation, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The counter unit may be incorporated in various alignments for aligning such counter waves to the harmful waves. In one example, the counter unit may be aligned in one or more of the above axes and/or directions, may be wound in the same direction as at least one of such base units, and the like. In another example, such a counter unit may be misaligned with at least one of the above axes and/or directions, may be wound in a direction different from that of at least one of the base units, and so on. When the system includes multiple counter units, all of such counter units may be aligned in the same direction and/or axis, each counter unit may be aligned in a different direction and/or axis, at least two but not all of the counter units may be aligned in the same direction and/or axis, and the like. When the system includes multiple counter units, all of the counter units may be disposed in the same alignment, each counter unit may be disposed in a different alignment, at least two but not all of the counter units may be aligned in the same alignment, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The counter unit may also be disposed in a lateral, axial or a concentric alignment. In the lateral alignment, one or multiple counter units may be disposed laterally and also side by side with respect to at least one of the base units or, in the alternative, may be disposed between at least two of the base units and along the long and/or short axes of at least one of the base units. In the axial alignment, one or multiple counter units may instead be disposed along a direction of such long and/or short axes and in a preset distance from at least one of such base units. In the concentric alignment, one or multiple counter units may be disposed inside a single base unit, may be surrounded by all (or at least two but not all) of multiple base units, may enclose the single or multiple base units, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">A single counter unit or multiple counter units may also be disposed in various distances from at least one of the base units and/or target space. In one example, such a counter unit may be fixedly incorporated in such an EMC display system in a preset distance from at least one of the base units in order to emit such counter waves of the wavefronts matching those of such harmful waves. When desirable, the counter unit may be arranged to receive variable electrical energy (i.e., current and/or voltage) so that the amplitudes of such counter waves may vary for countering the harmful waves of varying amplitudes, to define different target spaces, and the like. In another example, the counter unit may be movably coupled to the EMC display system and to translate and/or to rotate between at least two positions for emitting the counter waves and then propagating their wavefronts toward different portions of the wavefronts of the harmful waves with or without varying the amplitudes or directions of the counter waves. Accordingly, the counter waves may vary characteristics of their wavefronts based on the position of the counter unit with respect to at least one of such base units and/or target space. In another example, the EMC system may include multiple counter units and control the wave emitting operation of each of the counter units. By properly recruiting some or all of the counter units with or without manipulating the amplitudes and/or directions of the counter waves, the system may counter the harmful waves while defining the target space in various locations with respect to at least one of the base units. When the system includes multiple counter units, all of such counter units may be fixedly incorporated thereinto, all of such counter units may be movably incorporated therein, or at least two but not all of such counter units may be movable incorporated therein.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The disposition of the counter unit may be assessed in terms of the distances measured along the longitudinal axis of at least one of the base units, along the short axis thereof, around at least one of the axes, and so on. The counter unit may be disposed closer to the target space than at least one of the base units as in the front arrangement, farther away from the target space than at least one of the base units as in the rear arrangement or flush with the target space as in the lateral arrangement. When the system includes multiple counter units, all of the counter units may be disposed in the same arrangement or at least two of such units may be disposed in different arrangements. In addition, all of the counter units may be disposed in an equal distance from the base units or, alternatively, at least two of such counter units may be disposed in different distances therefrom. It is appreciated that the counter unit is preferably disposed on the same side of at least one of the base units with respect to the target space. Even when the counter unit is disposed on an opposite side of at least one of such base units with respect to the target space, the counter unit may still be able to counter such harmful waves, although such a disposition may not be the preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The counter unit may be incorporated into various parts of the system and disposed in various exposures as well. When the system includes the body, the counter unit may be disposed on or over an exterior surface of the body, on or below an interior surface of the body, inside the body, and/or embedded into the body. The counter unit may instead be disposed on or over an exterior surface of the wave source, on or below an interior surface of such a wave source, embedded between such surfaces of the wave source, inside the wave source, and so on. The counter unit may be disposed on or over an exterior surface of at least one of such base units, on or below an interior surface of at least one of the base units, embedded between such surfaces of at least one of the base unit, inside at least one of the base units, and the like. In addition, the counter unit may be disposed and enclosed by at least a portion of at least one of the base units. Similarly, at least a portion or an entire portion of the counter unit may also be exposed through the system, through its body, through its wave source, through at least one of the base units, and the like. Moreover, the counter unit may fixedly or movably couple with one or more existing parts of the system, wave source, and/or base unit or, alternatively, may couple therewith by a coupler. Similarly, the counter unit may be spaced away from the system, its wave source, and/or at least one of its base units or may form an unitary article therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The counter unit may be made of and/or include various materials in order to emit the counter waves having proper amplitudes in response to the electric energy supplied thereto and matching the harmful waves. In one example, the counter and base units may be made of and/or include the same materials so that such units may emit the same amount of the counter and harmful waves per an unit amount of such electric energy. In another example, the counter and base units may include at least one common material and at least one different material so that such units may emit the similar but not identical amount of the counter and harmful waves per the unit amount of the electric energy. In yet another example, the counter and base units may be made of and/or include different materials so that the counter and base units emit different amounts of waves per the unit amount of the electric energy. In general, various characteristics of the counter and base units determined by their compositions may be electric resistance or conductivity, magnetic permittivity, resonance frequency, and the like. Thus, the counter unit may be arranged to define the same, similar or different conductivity, permittivity, and resonance frequency based on its composition. An entire portion of the counter unit may be arranged to have an identical composition or, alternatively, various portions of the counter unit may be arranged to have different compositions which may vary along the long or short axis thereof. When the system includes multiple counter units, all of such counter units may have the same composition, at least two but not all of the counter units may have the same composition, or all of such counter units may have different compositions, thereby also maintaining or varying the above properties therealong.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">As described hereinabove, precisely matching the phase angles (either opposite or similar) of such counter and harmful waves is a prerequisite for countering the harmful waves irradiated by at least one of the base units with the counter waves emitted by the counter unit. This phase matching may be attained by supplying proper electric energy (i.e., electric current or voltage) to the base and counter units and also optionally electrically coupling the counter and base units with each other. For illustration purposes, the electric energy supplied to such base units is to be referred to as a &#x201c;source energy&#x201d; hereinafter, and the electric current and voltage of the &#x201c;source energy&#x201d; are to be referred to as &#x201c;source current&#x201d; and &#x201c;source voltage&#x201d; hereinafter, respectively. In one example, identical source current or voltage may be supplied to the base and counter units either sequentially or simultaneously so that the phase angles of such harmful and counter waves are properly synchronized. In another example, the counter unit is supplied with only a portion of the source current or voltage sequentially or simultaneously, where the phase angles of such harmful and counter waves are still synchronized as well. In another example, the base units are first supplied with the source current or voltage, while the system thereafter modifies the amplitudes and/or directions of such source current or voltage and then supplies the modified current or voltage to the counter unit. As long as the phase angles of such source energy is maintained during modification, such counter and harmful waves are properly phase synchronized. In another example, the base units are first supplied with the source energy, and the system provides an analog of such source energy and supplies the analog energy to the counter unit with or without modifying the amplitudes and/or directions thereof, where such a system may employ various electronic components, circuits, and/or controllers to provide such an analog. As long as the phase angles of the electric energy is kept in the analog energy, such counter and harmful waves are phase synchronized as well. In another example, the counter unit is electrically coupled to such base units in a series mode, in a parallel mode or in a hybrid mode, where the counter unit is supplied with such source energy, modified source energy or analog energy as described hereinabove and where the counter unit may be supplied with such energy sequentially or simultaneously with the base units. When the system has multiple counter units, all of such counter units may be supplied with the same energy, at least two but not all of such units may be supplied with the same energy, each unit may be supplied with different energy, and the like. When the system includes multiple base units which are supplied with different source energies, the single counter unit may be supplied with only one of such energies, with a combination of at least two of such energies, and the like. When the system includes multiple counter units, such counter units may couple with the single or multiple base units in the same mode or different modes, the counter units may instead be supplied with the same energy or different energies sequentially or simultaneously, and the like. It is appreciated in all of the above examples that the phase matching also depends upon other configurations and/or dispositions of the counter unit so that a direction of winding of the counter unit, orientation of the counter unit, and/or alignment thereof may have to be considered to accomplish the proper phase matching.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Further details of the source and wave matching are to be provided hereinafter. As described above, it is appreciated in such source matching that there does not exist any one-to-one correlations between the configuration of the counter unit and the configuration (or wave characteristics) of such counter waves. That is, the counter waves defining a certain configuration (or wave characteristics) may be obtained by a single counter unit which defines a certain shape and size and is provided in a certain arrangement, by another counter unit which defines a similar shape and size but is provided in another arrangement, by another counter unit which has a different shape and size but is provided in a similar arrangement, by at least two counter units defining preset shapes and sizes and provided in a preset arrangement, by the same number of counter units defining different shapes and/or sizes or in a different arrangement, by a different number of counter units defining similar shapes and/or sizes or in a similar arrangement, and the like. It is appreciated in such wave matching that there does not exist any one-to-one correlation between the disposition of the counter unit and the wavefronts of the counter waves emitted by the counter unit. In other words, the wavefronts with certain shapes may be obtained by a single counter unit which defines a certain configuration and is disposed in a certain position with respect to at least one of such base units and/or target space, by another single counter unit which defines another configuration and is disposed in another position, by at least two counter units which define preset configurations and are disposed in preset positions, by the same number of counter units having different configurations and disposed in different positions, by a different number of counter units defining different configurations and disposed in different positions, and so on. There are, however, a few heuristic rules which may apply not only to such source matching but also to the wave matching. The first rule is that the counter unit incorporated in the front arrangement preferably has a characteristic dimension which is greater than that of at least one of the base units, when other things being equal, to increase the radii of curvature of the wavefronts of the counter waves and to attain better matching between the counter and harmful waves. The second rule is the reverse of the first rule and dictates that the counter unit which is disposed in the rear arrangement preferably has a characteristic dimension less than that of at least one of the base units so as to decrease the radii of curvature of the wavefronts of the counter waves and to attain better matching between the counter and harmful waves. In order to match the amplitudes of such counter and harmful waves, however, the longer or wider counter unit in the front arrangement is arranged to emit the counter waves of the amplitudes less than those of the harmful waves. Similarly, the shorter or narrower counter unit in the rear arrangement is arranged to emit such counter waves of the amplitudes greater than those of the harmful waves. The third rule says that disposing multiple counter units emitting the counter waves of the same or similar phase angles tends to flatten the wavefronts of a sum of the counter waves and to increase the radii of curvature of the wavefronts of the counter waves. The fourth rule is then the reverse of the third rule and says that disposing a less number of counter units tends to sharpen the wavefronts of the sum of the counter waves and to further decrease the radii of curvature of the wavefronts of the counter waves. The fifth rule says that the wavefronts of the sum of the counter waves may be sharpened and the radii of curvature of such wavefronts may be decreased when at least one but not all of multiple counter units may emit the counter waves of the phase angles opposite to those of other counter units. It is appreciated that these rules do not generally apply to the counter units emitting the counter waves with the wavefronts defining the shapes different from the shape of the counter unit, and that those rules do not generally apply to the counter units with the non-uniform emitting power either which will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">A main purpose of the source matching is to manipulate the configuration of the counter unit to match that of at least one of the base units such that the counter waves emitted from the counter unit better match the harmful waves irradiated from the base unit. When a system preferentially depends upon the source matching to counter the harmful waves, its counter unit may preferably be disposed in a preset or reasonable distance from at least one of the base units, for any advantages which may be obtainable by the similarly configured counter unit may be lost otherwise. It is appreciated that the source matching is most useful when at least one of the base units defines a simple and/or symmetric configuration or when it is reasonably feasible to provide a replica of at least one of the complex base units. When the system has a single wave source with multiple base units or multiple waves sources each including at least one base unit, a single counter unit may be arranged to accomplish the source matching with respect to multiple base units or, alternatively, multiple counter units may be arranged to accomplish the source matching with respect to multiple base units. The source matching may include a shape matching, size matching, arrangement matching, disposition matching, intensity matching, and other configurational matching.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Some details of the shape matching have been disclosed heretofore. For example, the counter unit may be provided as a 3-D or bulk analog which corresponds to a replica or an approximation of a single or multiple 3-D base units, may be provided as a 2-D or planar analog which is an approximation of a single or multiple 3-D or 2-D base units or which is a replica of a single or multiple 2-D base units, may be formed as an 1-D or linear analog which is an approximation of a single or multiple 3-D, 2-D or 1-D base units or which is a replica of a single or multiple 1-D base units, and so on. Similarly, multiple counter units may be constructed as 3-D analogs which are the replica or approximation of a single or multiple 3-D base units, may be fabricated as the 2-D analogs which are the approximation of a single or multiple 3-D or 2-D base units or which are the replica of a single or multiple 2-D base units, may be fabricated as the 1-D analogs which are the approximation of a single or multiple 3-D, 2-D or 1-D base units or which are the replica of one or multiple 1-D base units, and the like. Such analogs may define continuous shapes or may have shapes defining multiple holes or openings, may form solid shapes or deformable shapes, may define symmetric or asymmetric shapes, and the like. The shapes of any of such analogs may be determined based upon the above countering mechanisms or, conversely, such shapes may dictate other configurations of such analogs, may decide proper countering mechanisms adopted thereby, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The size matching may be embodied by defining the counter unit to be larger than, similar to or smaller than at least one of the base units whether or not the counter unit may maintain such similarity between the configurations of the counter and base units. Whether or not the counter unit may emit the counter waves defining the wavefronts with the shapes similar to the counter unit itself, the size of the counter unit determines an extent of dispersion and/or flattening of such counter waves, edge characteristics of such wavefronts, and the like. As described above, the size of the counter unit is also determined by various countering mechanisms adopted thereby, disposition thereof, amplitudes of the electrical energy supplied thereto, and the like. Conversely, the size of such a counter unit may dictate the selection of other configurations thereof, proper countering mechanisms, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The disposition matching may be embodied by manipulating the orientation of the counter unit, alignment thereof, distance to at least one of the base units and/or target space therefrom, its mobility, and the like. As described herein, the counter unit may be oriented in the preset relations with respect to such axes and/or various directions, may be disposed in the front, rear or lateral arrangement, may be aligned or misaligned with such directions and/or axes, may be aligned or misaligned with at least one of the base units axially, radially, angularly, concentrically, laterally, and the like. The disposition of the counter unit may also be dictated by various countering mechanisms adopted thereby, shapes and sizes thereof, amplitudes of the electrical energy supplied thereto, and the like. Conversely, the disposition of the counter unit may dictate other configurations of the counter unit, proper countering mechanisms employed thereby, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The intensity matching may be embodied by manipulating the amplitudes of the counter waves emitted by the counter unit. For example, the counter waves may define the amplitudes greater than, similar to or less than those of the harmful waves when measured in a certain distance from at least one of the base units, when measured across the target space or in a preset position inside the target space, and the like. The amplitudes of the counter waves are further dictated by various countering mechanisms employed thereby, shapes and/or sizes thereof, disposition thereof, amplitudes of such electrical energy supplied thereto, and the like. Conversely, the amplitudes of the counter waves may determine other configurations of the counter unit, proper countering mechanisms, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">A main purpose of the wave matching is to dispose the counter unit along at least one of such wavefronts of the harmful waves and to emit the counter waves defining the wavefronts capable of matching and countering those of the harmful waves. When a system preferentially depends on the wave matching to counter such harmful waves, its counter unit may be disposed anywhere around at least one of the base units in any distance as long as the counter wavefronts may match the harmful wavefronts. It is appreciated that the wave matching is most powerful when at least one of the base units defines a rather complex or asymmetric configuration or when it is impossible to form a replica or approximation of such a complex base unit. When the system has a single wave source with multiple base units or includes multiple wave sources each including at least one base unit, a single counter unit may be arranged to attain the wave matching with multiple base units or multiple counter units may instead be arranged to perform the wave matching with multiple base units. The only disadvantage or complication as to the wave matching is that detailed shapes and distribution of the wavefronts of the harmful waves have to be assessed a priori quantitatively or at least qualitatively.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">In one type of the wave matching, the counter waves are emitted by at least one counter unit defining an uniform emitting capacity in which amplitudes per an unit configuration of the counter unit such as its length, width, radius or diameter, area, and/or weight is maintained uniform. Accordingly, the counter unit emits the counter waves defining the wavefronts shaped similarly to the counter unit itself and, when disposed along the wavefronts of the harmful waves, counters such harmful waves in the target space. In another type of the wave matching, the counter waves are also emitted by the counter unit with a non-uniform emitting capacity in which amplitudes per the unit configuration of the counter unit vary thereacross. In this arrangement, the counter unit emits the counter waves defining the wavefronts which are not similar to the shape of the counter unit. Therefore, the counter unit of this non-uniform capacity are disposed not along a single wavefront of the harmful waves but across at least two of such wavefronts in order to emit the counter waves capable of matching the harmful waves in the target space.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">It is appreciated that the counter units with the uniform emitting capacity may also be disposed along at least two wavefronts of the harmful waves as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>. When multiple counter units are disposed in different wavefronts of the harmful waves, such units may also be arranged to emit the counter waves of different amplitudes in order to compensate discrepancies in the distances to at least one of the base unit therefrom. This compensation may be attained by various means, e.g., by adjusting the shapes and sizes of the counter units, by adjusting the amount of the electric energy supplied thereto, by controlling the orientations and/or alignments of the counter units, and the like. As far as a sum of the counter waves defines the wavefronts which match those of the harmful waves in the target space, such counter units may be disposed along adjacent or space-apart wavefronts of such harmful waves in various configurations and/or dispositions.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Similar to their counterparts in the case of the source matching, the counter unit for the wave matching may similarly have a shape of a wire, a strip, a sheet, a tube, a coil thereof, a spiral thereof, and/or a mesh thereof, may define a combination of two or more of such shapes without forming any holes and/or openings therethrough, may form an array of two of more of such shapes while defining multiple holes and/or openings therethrough, and the like, where examples of the combinations and/or arrays may also include, but not be limited to, a bundle of multiple identical or different shapes bundling each other, a braid of multiple identical or different shapes braided along each other, and the like. The counter unit may then be disposed along the single or multiple wavefronts of the harmful waves.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Such EMC display systems of the present invention may generally be designed for countering the harmful waves in a carrier frequency range or an extremely low frequency range from about 50 Hz to about 60 Hz or another frequency range of less than about 300 Hz. Therefore, in the preferred embodiment of this invention, various counter units of the EMC display systems are also arranged to emit the counter waves in such carrier frequency range or extremely low frequency range of from about 50 Hz to about 60 Hz or the frequency range of less than about 300 Hz, thereby countering the harmful waves in those frequency ranges. Considering various medical findings and/or presumptions that a main culprit of the harmful waves are those in these frequency ranges, these counter units are believed to effectively eliminate those harmful frequency components of the harmful waves irradiated by the base units of the EMC systems.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Various counter units of the EMC display systems of the present invention may be arranged to emit the counter waves in an ultra low frequency range of less than about 2 kHz or about 3 kHz, in a very low frequency range of less than about 30 kHz, and in a low frequency range of less than about 300 kHz to counter the harmful waves in the similar frequency ranges. The counter units may also be arranged emit the counter waves in other frequency ranges such as the radio waves of frequencies ranging from about 5&#xd7;10<sup>2 </sup>Hz to about 10<sup>8 </sup>Hz, microwaves of frequencies ranging from about 10<sup>8 </sup>Hz to about 10<sup>12 </sup>Hz, and the like, in order to counter the harmful waves of similar frequency ranges. When desirable, such counter units may be arranged to emit the counter waves defining higher frequencies such as, e.g., ultraviolet rays of frequencies ranging from about 7.5&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>Hz to about 10<sup>17 </sup>Hz, X-rays of frequencies ranging from about 7&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>Hz to about 10<sup>19 </sup>Hz, gamma rays in a frequency range over and beyond 5&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>Hz, and the like, for countering the harmful waves of similar frequency ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Such counter units may further be arranged to selectively counter specific components of the harmful waves or, alternatively, to specifically preserve specific components of such harmful waves while countering (i.e., canceling and/or suppressing) the rest of the harmful waves. For example and particularly when the harmful waves include higher frequency components, the counter units may be specifically arranged to preserve beneficial waves such as, e.g., infrared rays including far infrared rays in a frequency range from about 300 gHz to about 10 tHz, medium infrared rays in a frequency range from about 10 tHz to about 100 tHz, near infrared rays in a frequency range from about 100 tHz to about 700 tHz, and the like, while countering the rest of the harmful waves including those of the carrier frequency range and extremely low frequency ranges. Conversely, the counter units may be arranged to emit the infrared rays including such far-, medium-, and/or near-infrared rays as well.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">In another aspect of the present invention, various counter units may also be implemented into various prior art display devices and convert such to the EMC display systems in which such harmful waves irradiated by their base units may be countered by the counter waves.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">In one exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the counter units may be implemented into any base units shaped as electrically conductive wires, strips, sheets, tubes, coils, spirals, and/or meshes or, in the alternative, to any electrically semiconductive and/or insulative wires, strips, sheets, tubes, coils, spirals, and/or meshes for minimizing the irradiation of the harmful waves by countering such harmful waves by the counter waves, e.g., by canceling at least a portion of the harmful waves in the target space and/or suppressing the harmful waves from propagating to such a target space. Such counter units may be made of and/or include at least one material which may then be electrically conductive, insulative or semiconductive. The counter units may be implemented to any of the base units which have the shapes formed by one or multiple wires, strips, sheets, tubes, coils, spirals, and/or meshes, by modifying the shapes of one or multiple wires, strips, sheets, tubes, coils, spirals, and/or meshes, where a few examples of the modified shapes may be a solenoid and a toroid each formed by modifying the shape of the coil. In general, the counter units of this embodiment may be disposed in any of the foregoing arrangements and may counter the harmful waves by any of the foregoing mechanisms. Accordingly, a similarly or identically shaped and/or sized counter unit may be disposed lateral or side by side to one or more base units, may be axially, radially or angularly aligned with one or more base units, may enclose therein one or more base units, may be enclosed by one or more base units, may wind around one or more base units, may be wound by one or more base units, and the like, based on the source matching. In the alternative, a similarly or differently shaped and/or sized counter unit may be disposed along one or more wavefronts of the harmful waves irradiated by one or more base units for the wave matching. In addition, such counter units may be employed in a proper number and/or arrangement to counter the harmful waves according to the local countering or global countering.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the counter units may also be implemented into any conventional electric and/or electronic elements such as, e.g., resistors, inductors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, amplifiers, fuses, triacs, and other signal processors and/or regulators in order to counter the harmful waves irradiated by the elements, where the electric and/or electronic elements function to manipulate at least one input signal supplied thereto and to produce at least one output signal at least partially different from the input signal. All of the above electric and/or electronic elements may qualify as the base units within the scope of the present invention when the unsteady current flows therein or when the unsteady voltage is applied thereacross. In addition, the above elements may also qualify as the base units within the scope of this invention when any of the elements produces the unsteady output signal (i.e., the electric current or voltage) in response to the input signal which may be steady or unsteady. Therefore, any of the above prior art elements and/or display devices including such elements may be converted to the EMC elements and/or EMC display systems by incorporating various counter units which define any of the above configurations in any of the above dispositions and/or arrangements, thereby countering such harmful waves in any of the above mechanisms. It is appreciated that such counter units may be provided in any dimension such that the EMC elements may be provided in a range of microns or nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention, various counter units may be incorporated into or around various electrodes and/or pixels of such display units of the EMC display system for countering the harmful waves irradiated by various base units thereof, where examples of such display units may include, but not be limited to, the OLED units, IOLED units, PDP units, LCD units, CRT units, DLP units, SED units, and the like. Therefore, any conventional display units including such EMC display units therein may then be converted into the EMC display systems such as, e.g., the EMC OLED systems, EMC IOLED systems, EMC PDP systems, EMC LCD systems, EMC CRT systems, EMC DLP systems, EMC SED systems, and the like. In addition, other conventional display units which emit and/or transmit the visible light rays through their pixels may similarly be converted to the EMC display systems by incorporating therein one or more of such counter units. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3O</figref> show schematic perspective views of various counter units each of which approximates a single or multiple base units of the display units and provided in various configurations in the source or wave matching according to the present invention. It is appreciated in all of these figures that only the electrodes and pixels are selected as the primary base units of such EMC display system. It is appreciated, therefore, that other conductive, semiconductive, and/or insulative parts of any EMC display systems irradiating the harmful waves are omitted from all of the figures and that, when necessary, such parts may also be properly countered by resorting to any of such counter units as described above. It is also appreciated for the simplicity of illustration that each figure depicts only a portion of the EMC display system by including a pair of pixels of the above display units and that neighboring regions of the EMC system not shown in each figure may include the base units and counter units similar or identical to those shown in such a figure. It is further appreciated that various EMC display systems are arranged in such an orientation that the pixels emit and/or transmit the visible light rays upwardly, as manifest by arrows and that the EMC display systems may then include the pixels of the OLED, IOLED, PDP, LCD, DLP, and SEP display systems which have been exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref> or which have not been included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref> but described in conjunction therewith. It is to be reminded that various counter units and their counters described in the following figures are to be interpreted to extend laterally, either from left to right (or from right to left) of the sheet or vertically into (or out of) the sheet. In this context, a counter unit depicted as a strip in the figure may in fact correspond to a strip elongated in either of the above directions.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">In the first set of examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3I</figref>, various counter units may be provided separately from the base units of various display units and counter the harmful waves irradiated from such base units in the local countering mechanism. It is appreciated that these counter units may be incorporated into any of the above display units which are arranged to receive the electrical energy in a direction which may be identical to or opposite from a direction of the visible light rays which is denoted by an arrow in each figure.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an EMC display system <b>5</b> includes a pair of pixels <b>9</b>X defined over a substrate (not included in the figure), at least one first electrode <b>9</b>F which includes multiple first paths laterally extending parallel to each other (e.g., from left to right of the sheet) and electrically coupled to bottom portions of such pixels <b>9</b>X, and at least one second electrode which includes multiple second electrode <b>9</b>S laterally extending parallel to each other (e.g., into or out from the sheet) and electrically coupled to top portions of the pixels <b>9</b>X. These pixels <b>9</b>X are also spaced apart from each other by a gap <b>9</b>A which may be left empty or filled up by suitable insulating materials. On top of such pixels <b>9</b>X are deposited a counter unit which consists of at least one first counter <b>40</b>F and at least one second counter <b>40</b>S, where the first counter <b>40</b>S is shaped and sized similar or identical to the first electrode <b>9</b>F, while the second counter <b>40</b>S is shaped and sized similar or identical to the second electrode <b>9</b>S. To prevent direct electric contact between the first and second counters <b>40</b>F, <b>40</b>S, insulation layers are incorporated therebetween, which are represented by thin blank layers in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">In operation, the driver (not included in this figure) selects to charge the left pixel <b>9</b>X by flowing the electrical energy in the first electrode <b>9</b>F and the left conductive path of the second electrode <b>9</b>S. Depending upon the configuration, the electric current flows downwardly (or upwardly), and the light emitting element of the left pixel <b>9</b>X is charged and then emits the visible light rays through the second electrode <b>9</b>S. At the same time, such first and second electrodes <b>9</b>F, <b>9</b>S irradiate the harmful waves which propagate along the same direction as the visible light rays to an user. To counter the harmful waves, a counter electrical energy is supplied to the first counter <b>40</b>F and to the left second counter <b>40</b>S so that the counter waves emitted by the first counter <b>40</b>F counter the harmful waves irradiated by the first electrode <b>9</b>F and that the counter waves emitted from the second counter <b>40</b> counter the harmful waves irradiated by the second electrode <b>9</b>S. More particularly, the counter energy may flow in the counters <b>40</b>F, <b>40</b>S in directions which are opposite to those along the electrodes <b>9</b>F, <b>9</b>S so that the counter waves define the phase angles at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves. In addition, such counters <b>40</b>F, <b>40</b>S receive the counter electrical energy of which amplitudes may be manipulated to render the counter waves define the amplitudes at least partially similar to those of the harmful waves. Accordingly, the counter unit <b>40</b> may counter the harmful waves by canceling such harmful waves in a target space defined around the user due to the amplitudes and/or phase angles of the counter waves, by suppressing the harmful waves from propagating toward the target space due to the amplitudes and/or phase angles of such counter waves, and the like. In this context, each of the counters unit <b>40</b> is deemed to define the shape (and/or size) analog of each of the base units of the electrodes <b>9</b>F, <b>9</b>S and to operate in the local countering mechanism. It is appreciated that such pixels <b>9</b>X themselves may serve as the base units by irradiating the harmful waves while emitting the visible light rays. As described hereinabove, however, these harmful waves preferentially propagate in lateral directions and, accordingly, may not harm the user. When the pixels <b>9</b>X irradiate the harmful waves propagating along with the visible light rays along the same direction and the amplitudes of the harmful waves are not negligible, these upwardly propagating harmful waves may be countered with other mechanisms. In one example, the first and second counter <b>40</b>F, <b>40</b>S may be arranged to form an electric contact therebetween and induce a flow of electric current therethrough, thereby emitting the counter waves propagating along the same direction as the upwardly propagating harmful waves while countering such harmful waves. In another example, the first counter <b>40</b>F may be arranged to form an electric contact therebetween and induce the flow of electric current therethrough, thereby emitting the similar counter waves. It is appreciated in these examples that amplitudes of such electric contacts may be manipulated only to match a strength of such harmful waves upwardly propagating across the pixel. Therefore, the insulation layers may include semiconductive materials or may form one or more regions of conductive materials through which the electric current may flow.</p>

The first and second counters may have the same, similar or different chemical compositions with respect to each other. As briefly described hereinabove and as will be described below, the counter unit and various counters may receive the counter electrical energy in various modes as well. In one example, the counter electrical energy may be similar or identical to the source electrical energy supplied to the base unit. In another example, the counter energy may be only a portion of the source energy.

Similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3I</figref>, a counter unit is fabricated to define a shape (and/or size) analog of the electrodes <b>9</b>F, <b>9</b>S and disposed on top of the pixels or, in the alternative, over the top of both of the pixels <b>9</b>X at a preset distance. Other than these, further configurational and/or operational characteristics of the counter unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref> are similar or identical to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A to 3I</figref>. In a related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>, an EMC display system <b>5</b> includes a pair of pixels <b>9</b>X, at least one first electrode <b>9</b>F, and at least one second electrode <b>9</b>S, each of which is similar or identical to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>. Such an EMC system <b>5</b> also includes the counter unit which is also similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref> but is rather disposed under or below bottoms of each of such pixels <b>9</b>X. In another related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L</figref>, an EMC display system <b>5</b> includes a pair of pixels <b>9</b>X, at least one first electrode <b>9</b>F, and at least one second electrode <b>9</b>S, each similar or identical to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>. The EMC system <b>5</b> also includes the counter unit which includes multiple rows of conductive paths and multiple columns of conductive paths which are spaced away from each other without mechanically and electrically coupling to each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3J to 3L</figref>, the driver supplies the counter electrical energy of desirable amplitudes along the directions which simulate those along or across the pixels <b>9</b>X, thereby emitting the counter waves by the counter unit <b>40</b> and countering the harmful waves therewith as disclosed hereinabove. Other configurational and/or operational characteristics of the counter units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3J to 3L</figref> may be similar or identical to those of the counter units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">It is appreciated that the pixels <b>9</b>X may irradiate the harmful waves propagating upwardly and defining non-negligible amplitudes. Such harmful waves may be irradiated by the light emitting and/or transmitting element and/or by internal conductive paths which may define vertical components along a height of the pixels <b>9</b>X. The counter units may then be arranged to emit the counter waves so as to counter the vertically propagating harmful waves. In one example, the counter unit may be arranged to define a slanted configuration, more particularly, along a portion defined above or below the pixels <b>9</b>X in order to emit the vertically propagating counter waves. In another example, at least a portion of the counter unit may also electrically couple with the top and/or bottom portions of such pixels <b>9</b>X and define vertical conductive paths therealong, thereby emitting the vertically propagating counter waves and countering the harmful waves therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">In the third set of examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3M to 3O</figref>, various counter units are provided separately from the base units of various display units and counter the harmful waves irradiated from such base units in the local countering mechanism. It is appreciated that these counter units may be incorporated into any of the above display units receiving the electrical energy in a form of electron or photon rays and converting the energy of such rays into the visible light rays by phosphor materials.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">In one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M</figref>, an EMC display system <b>5</b> includes therein a substrate <b>9</b>B which is coated with at least one phosphor material <b>9</b>P, at least one electron beam generator (not shown in the figure), and at least one steering unit. The beam generator is arranged to emit a ray of electrons and impinge the electrons onto the phosphors <b>9</b>P of the substrate <b>9</b>B disposed in a desirable location. In response to the impinging electrons, the phosphors <b>9</b>P absorb the energy of the electrons and then emit the visible light rays to the user through the transparent substrate <b>9</b>B. The steering unit includes multiple sets of electromagnets, and manipulates such electromagnets to steer the electron rays along a desirable direction. The EMC system <b>5</b> includes at least one counter unit <b>40</b> which defines a planar configuration and includes a top conductive layer and a bottom conductive layer. In addition, such top and bottom layers of the counter unit <b>40</b> are arranged to electrically couple with each other by multiple vertical conductive paths defined therebetween. The counter unit <b>40</b> is also arranged to receive the counter electrical energy along the top (or bottom) layer, delivers such energy vertically downwardly (or upwardly) through the vertical paths, and then returns the energy along the bottom (or top) layer. It is appreciated that the top and bottom layers of the counter unit are arranged to flow the energy in opposite directions so that the counter waves emitted by the layers cancel each other. Accordingly, the counter unit emits the counter waves which preferentially propagate along lateral directions. This embodiment is useful when the harmful waves irradiated by the base units preferentially propagate in the lateral directions. Alternatively, the top and bottom layers may be arranged to receive the counter energy along the same direction, while the vertical paths define relatively short heights such that the counter waves emitted by this counter unit preferentially propagate along vertical directions. Such an embodiment is useful when the harmful waves irradiated by the base units preferentially propagate in the vertical directions as well. The direction of the counter electrical energy is also manipulated such that the counter waves may define the phase angles at least partially opposite to those of the harmful waves and counter the harmful waves. In a related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N</figref>, another EMC display system <b>5</b> also includes the substrate <b>9</b>B coated with the phosphors <b>9</b>P, beam generator, and one steering unit each of which is similar or identical to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M</figref>. The EMC system <b>5</b> further includes the counter unit <b>40</b> which is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M</figref> but embedded inside the substrate <b>9</b>B. Other configurational and/or operational characteristics of the counter unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N</figref> may be similar or identical to those of the counter unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M</figref>. In another related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3O</figref>, the EMC display system <b>5</b> includes the substrate <b>9</b>B coated with the phosphors <b>9</b>P, beam generator, and one steering unit each of which is similar or identical to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M</figref>. The EMC system <b>5</b> also includes the counter unit <b>40</b> similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M</figref> but embedded inside the substrate <b>9</b>B and electrically coupling with at least a portion of the phosphors <b>9</b>P. Such a counter unit <b>40</b> offers the benefit of collecting the stray electrons from the phosphors <b>9</b>P and flowing the electrons therealong in a direction of emitting the counter waves which counter the harmful waves. Further configurational and/or operational characteristics of the counter unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3O</figref> may be similar or identical to those of the counter units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3M and 3N</figref>. It is also to be understood that the counter units <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3M to 3O</figref> may be used to counter the harmful waves irradiated by the electromagnets of the steering units and/or other parts of the system <b>5</b> and that such counter units are suited for the prior art CRT display units in order to convert such units into the EMC CRT display system.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">In another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention, various counter units may be incorporated into or around various electrodes and/or pixels of such display units of the EMC display system for countering the harmful waves irradiated by various base units thereof, where examples of such display units are identical to those of the previous embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref> show schematic top views of various counter units each of which approximates multiple base units of the display units and provided in various configurations in the source and/or wave matching according to the present invention.

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">In another example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, another EMC display system <b>5</b> includes multiple sets <b>9</b>E of pixels arranged in multiple rows and columns, the planar first electrode <b>9</b>F, and the second electrode which consists of multiple second conductive paths <b>9</b>T, each similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. The EMC system <b>5</b> also includes a single counter unit <b>40</b> which is shaped as a mesh consisting of multiple horizontal and vertical conductive paths mechanically and/or electrically coupling with each other. The counter unit <b>40</b> is disposed over (and/or below) the system <b>5</b> and receives the counter electrical energy in preset directions in order to emit the counter waves of the amplitudes at least partially similar to those of the harmful waves irradiated by the base units to be countered thereby and of the phase angles at least partially opposite to those of such harmful waves. Accordingly, the counter unit <b>40</b> may counter the harmful waves in the target space defined around the user. In a related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, an EMC display system <b>5</b> includes multiple sets <b>9</b>E of pixels, planar first electrode <b>9</b>F, and second electrode with multiple second conductive paths <b>9</b>T, each similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. The EMC display system <b>5</b> also includes a counter unit <b>40</b> which is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> but disposed transverse to a long (or short) axis of the pixel sets <b>9</b>E and electrodes <b>9</b>F, <b>9</b>T. In another related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, an EMC display system <b>5</b> includes multiple sets <b>9</b>E of pixels, planar first electrode <b>9</b>F, and second electrode with multiple second conductive paths <b>9</b>T, each similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>.

In addition, such counter units <b>40</b> are disposed to define multiple rows and columns. Various counter units exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D to 4F</figref> may define different configurations and/or may be provided in different arrangements. For example, the conductive paths of such counter units <b>40</b> may be disposed in an uniform spacing or in different spacings such that the horizontal paths may be spaced farther apart from (or closer to) each other than the horizontal paths. At least two of the same or different paths may have the same or different configurations and/or may define the same or different compositions. Such counter units <b>40</b> countering in the global countering mechanism may have other configurations which have been disclosed in the co-pending applications. Such conductive paths of the counter unit <b>40</b> may be mechanically and/or electrically coupled to each other or may be spaced apart from each other. When desirable, only some but not all of such paths may be mechanically and/or electrically coupled to each other. The counter units <b>40</b> may be disposed on only one side of the system <b>5</b> or, alternatively, identical or different counter units <b>40</b> may instead be disposed on opposing sides of the system <b>5</b>. However, the counter units <b>40</b> may well be disposed on one side of the system <b>5</b>, for the target space is generally defined on such a single side thereof. It is appreciated that an efficiency in countering the harmful waves is heavily dependent on the patterns of the energy supply to the counter units <b>40</b>. Therefore, the counter electrical energy may be applied from one end of the counter unit <b>40</b> to another end thereof, from one corner of the counter unit <b>40</b> to another corner thereof, from a center (or another interior location) of the counter unit <b>40</b> to an edge(s) thereof, and the like. As long as the counter units <b>40</b> may emit the counter waves capable of properly countering the harmful waves, the counter energy may be supplied thereto in various modes.

<p id="p-0283" num="0282">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref>, the EMC display system may include a single unit which may counter all or at least a substantial number of base units in the global countering mechanism or, in the alternative, may instead have multiple counter units each countering the same or different number of the base units in the same countering mechanism. In the latter case, at least one of the counter units may be arranged to counter multiple base units of the same type, i.e., only countering the electrodes or only countering the pixels or, in the alternative, may counter multiple base units of the different types, e.g., countering some electrodes and pixels at the same time. At least one of counter unit may enclose entire portions of a preset number of base units therein or expose at least a portion of such base units. When such an EMC display system includes multiple counter units operating in the global countering mechanism, at least two of such counter units may define identical, similar or different configurations, compositions, and the like. The counter units may be disposed on only one side of the system. In the alternative, the same or different number of counter units may be disposed on both sides of the system. At least two counter units may be disposed symmetrically (or asymmetrically) with respect to each other or, in the alternative, with respect to the base units. At least two counter units may mechanically or electrically couple with each other or with at least one of the electrodes or their paths. Each counter unit may be arranged to receive the counter electrical energy as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3O</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">In another aspect of the present invention, an EMC display system may include light emitting or transmitting elements each of which may operate as the base unit irradiating the harmful waves while simultaneously functioning as the counter unit such that the harmful waves irradiated thereby function as the counter waves with respect to such harmful waves from other elements, where examples of such display units may include, but not be limited to, the OLED units, IOLED units, PDP units, LCD units, CRT units, DLP units, SED units, and the like. Therefore, any conventional display units including such EMC display units therein may then be converted into the EMC display systems such as, e.g., the EMC OLED systems, EMC IOLED systems, EMC PDP systems, EMC LCD systems, EMC CRT systems, EMC DLP systems, EMC SED systems, and the like. In addition, other conventional display units which emit and/or transmit the visible light rays through their pixels may similarly be converted to the EMC display systems by incorporating therein one or more of such counter units. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref> show schematic top views of exemplary counter units incorporated into pixels of various EMC display systems while also functioning as such pixels according to the present invention. It is to be understood in all of such figures that only the electrodes and pixels are selected as the primary base units of such EMC display system. It is appreciated, therefore, that other conductive, semiconductive, and/or insulative parts of any EMC display systems irradiating the harmful waves are omitted therefrom and, when necessary, such parts may be properly countered by resorting to any of such counter units as described above. It is also appreciated for the simplicity of illustration that each figure depicts only a portion of the EMC display system by including a pair of pixels of the above display units and that neighboring regions of the EMC system not included in each figure may include the electrodes and pixels similar or identical to those included in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">In one exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention, an EMC display system includes multiple (sets of) pixels, at least one first electrode, and at least one second electrode, where at least one of the electrodes may be arranged to define a configuration capable of countering each other. In one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a first (or second) electrode consists of multiple electrically conductive paths each of which extends horizontally and electrically couples with each row of pixels or with each set of pixels (both not included in the figure). In this regard, such paths may look similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>. However, these conductive paths are coupled to each other in an alternating mode that all odd-numbered horizontal paths are coupled to a vertical path provided on their left, whereas all even-numbered horizontal paths are coupled to another vertical path provided on their right. Assuming that the left vertical path flows the electric current from bottom to top and that the right vertical path flows the current in an opposite direction, the electric current flows through the adjacent horizontal paths in opposite directions. Therefore, the harmful waves irradiated by, e.g., the second horizontal path may be countered by the counter waves emitted by, e.g., the first or third horizontal path or vice versa. In this respect, any horizontal and/or vertical paths may be not only the base units themselves but also the counter units with respect to other paths adjacent thereto. In a related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a first (or second) conductive path is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. However, the horizontal paths thereof couple with each other in another alternating mode that each pair of such paths are alternatingly coupling to the left or right vertical path. Accordingly, the harmful waves irradiated by an upper member of, e.g., the second pair of horizontal paths are countered by the counter waves emitted from a lower member of the first pair of paths, while the harmful waves irradiated from a lower member of the second pair are countered by the counter waves emitted by an upper member of the third pair of paths. It is again appreciated that the harmful waves irradiated by one of the paths may function as the counter waves for the harmful waves irradiated by another path adjacent thereto and, accordingly, that any of these paths may be viewed as the base units in themselves as well as the counter units with respect to the other base units. In another related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, an EMC display system also includes multiple counter units <b>40</b> each of which is similar or identical to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> but provided in a smaller scale. Accordingly, the horizontal paths included in each counter unit <b>40</b> counter each other and, in addition, neighboring vertical paths of the adjacent counter units <b>40</b> may also counter each other. A pinnacle feature of such embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> is that neighboring electrodes are arranged to counter each other due to their configurations and dispositions as long as the source (and counter) electrical energy is supplied thereto in proper directions. In this context, these electrodes and their paths will now be referred to as the &#x201c;self-countering electrodes,&#x201d; as the &#x201c;self-countering conductive paths&#x201d; or as the &#x201c;self-countering base units&#x201d; hereinafter. In these embodiments, such base units correspond to the counter units (and vice versa), and the source electrical energy becomes identical to the counter electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">It is appreciated that the self-countering electrodes and paths shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> are arranged to supply the source electrical energy in the direction vertical to the sheet. Accordingly and in another exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention, such self-countering arrangements may also be applied to such electrodes and paths which are arranged to supply the source electrical energy along lateral directions through opposite sides of various light emitting elements. In one example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, an EMC display system <b>5</b> includes multiple pixels <b>9</b>X each electrically coupling with the first path <b>9</b>G on its top and the second path <b>9</b>T on its bottom. The first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T are also arranged so that the source electrical energy is supplied thereto and then flows out thereof in opposite directions. Therefore, the second path <b>9</b>T for a given row of such pixels <b>9</b>X and the first path <b>9</b>G of an adjacent row thereof irradiate the harmful waves which counter each other. A manifest advantage of such an arrangement is that these self-countering electrodes and paths may be fabricated in a single layer. In a related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, the first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T are typically similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, except that the paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T are provided one over another. Other than that such paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T have to be provided in a multilayer configuration, other configurational and/or operational characteristics of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> are similar or identical to those of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. In another related example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, the first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T may be viewed as a hybrid of those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5E</figref>. More particularly, the pixels <b>9</b>X of a given row are provided with the source energy in alternating directions, and the first and second paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T are fabricated in order to support such directions. An additional advantage of this arrangement over the arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5E</figref> is that not only the conductive paths <b>9</b>G, <b>9</b>T but also such pixels <b>9</b>X are arranged to counter each other, thereby maximizing a countering efficiency. Its only drawback, however, may be that this embodiment needs more conductive paths than those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5E</figref>. Other configurational and/or operational characteristics of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> may be similar or identical to those of the arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5E</figref>. When desirable and feasible, the arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D to 5F</figref> may be applied to those EMC display systems which have been disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3O</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> and which have not been included in those figured but described in conjunction therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Configurational and/or operational variations of various EMC display systems and their counter units and configurational and/or operational modifications of such EMC systems and their counter units as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2L</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3O</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref> and as disclosed hereinabove without any accompanying figures also fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">As described above, such counter units may be provided in various shapes and/or sizes and operate in the local or global countering mechanism. For example, a single counter unit for the entire system may be viewed as the globally countering counter unit, whereas the counter units provided in the same or similar number of the base units may be viewed as the locally countering counter units. In general, the EMC display system includes numerous base units which may be parts of the electrodes, pixels, and other electric and/or electronic components thereof. Therefore, such counter units, unless provided as a single unit, may be viewed to operate in both of the countering mechanisms. In another example, various counter units of this invention may be provided as unitary articles with various base units to be countered thereby. Considering that most of such pixels and their electrodes are currently manufactured through the conventional semiconductor fabrication process and that these electrodes and pixels have dimensions ranging from microns down to even nanometers, it is generally preferable to incorporate any of these counter units during manufacturing the above display units including such base units. However, this does not exclude any possibility of providing the counter units independent of the display units and then retrofitting the counter units into and/or around the prior art display units. For example, the counter units operating in the global countering mechanisms such as, e.g., those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref>, may be disposed over the screen of such display units. In another example, the self-countering arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref> may be incorporated into any prior art display units such as, e.g., the OLED units, IOLED units, LCD units, PDP units, DLP units, SED units, and so on. Since this generally requires nothing but slightly longer conductive paths, the self-countering arrangements may be readily incorporated into various manufacturing processes and provide the EMC OLED units, EMC IOLED units, EMC LCD units, EMC PDP units, EMC DLP units, EMC SED units, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">It is appreciated that any of the counter units described hereinabove may not be supplied with the electric energy and, therefore, may not actively emit the counter waves in response to the energy. Rather, the counter units may define the above configurations and may be in the above disposition so that the harmful waves irradiated by various base units may be absorbed into such counter units and converted to the electric voltage and/or current, thereby reducing the amount of such harmful waves propagating to the target space. Therefore, the EMC system may include one or multiple counter units all of which may serve as the passive counter units (i.e., those not receiving the electric energy), may include at least one passive counter unit and at least one active counter unit (i.e., one receiving such electric energy) or may include one or multiple counter units all of which serve as the active counter units. When desirable, at least one counter unit may also be arranged to serve as both of the active and passive counter units from time to time.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">In another aspect of the present invention, any of the above EMC systems may include at least one electric shield and/or magnetic shield. In one example, the electric and/or magnetic shields (will be referred to as the &#x201c;ES&#x201d; and &#x201c;MS&#x201d; hereinafter, respectively) may be implemented into, on, over or below various portions of the EMC system. In another example, such ES and/or MS may also be implemented as above and also used in conjunction with any of the above counter units. In general, the ES may be made of and/or include at least one electrically conductive material such that the electric waves of the harmful waves may be absorbed thereinto and rerouted therealong. When desirable, the ES may also be grounded so that the absorbed and rerouted electric waves may be eliminated therefrom. The MS may be made of and/or include at least one magnetically permeable path member which may be able to absorb the magnetic waves of the harmful waves thereinto and then to reroute such magnetic waves therealong. When desirable, the MS may have a magnet member which may be magnetically coupled to the path member and terminate the absorbed and rerouted magnetic waves in at least one magnetic pole of the magnet member. The MS may include at least one optional shunt member which may also be magnetically permeable and shield its magnet member, thereby confining magnetic fields from such a magnet member closer thereto. Other details of such ES and MS have already been provided in the above co-pending applications such as, e.g., &#x201c;Shunted Magnet Systems and Methods&#x201d; which bears a Ser. No. 11/213,703, &#x201c;Magnet-Shunted Systems and Methods&#x201d; which also bears a Ser. No. 11/213,686, and &#x201c;Electromagnetic Shield Systems and Methods&#x201d; which bears a U.S. Ser. No. 60/723,274. It is appreciated that the details of these co-pending applications may be modified so that the heating elements of such co-pending applications may be replaced by various counter units of the present invention and that the ES and/or MS may be incorporated to the counter units of this invention as such ES and/or MS have been incorporated into various heating elements of the above co-pending applications. It is appreciated that the ES and/or MS may also be incorporated into various portions of the EMC systems of this invention as the counter units are incorporated into such portions of the EMC systems of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The ES and/or MS may be provided to define the configuration which is identical to or similar to those of various counter units of this invention. The ES and/or MS may also be disposed in, on, over, around, and/or through the base and/or counter units. The ES and/or MS may have the configuration at least partially conforming to that of such base and/or counter units or, in the alternative, may define the configuration at least partially different from those of the ES and/or MS.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The path member of the MS may define the relative magnetic permeability greater than 1,000 or 10,000, 100,000 or 1,000,000. The shunt member may be arranged to directly or indirectly contact the magnet member and to define a relative magnetic permeability greater than 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 or 1,000,000. The ES and/or MS described hereinabove or disclosed in the co-pending applications may further be incorporated into any of the prior art devices with or without any of the above counter units and define such EMC systems of this invention. The ES and/or MS may define the configuration which may be maintained to be uniform along the longitudinal or short axis of the base and/or counter units or which may vary therealong. Such configurations of the ES and/or MS may be identical to, similar to or different from those of the base and/or counters. The EMC display system may have therein multiple ES and/or MS, where at least two of the MS and/or ES may shield against the magnetic waves and/or electric waves defining the same or different frequencies in same or different extents. The ES and/or MS may be disposed over at least a portion (or entire portion) of the base and/or counter units. The EMC system may also include one or more of any of such counter units and ES and/or MS, where the base and/or counter units may operate on AC or DC.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">As described above, the EMC systems of this invention may be provided with multiple defense mechanisms against the harmful waves which are irradiated by various base units of such a system. In one example, the counter unit may be incorporated into various portions of such an EMC system as described above. Accordingly, a single or multiple counter units may be provided in any of the above configurations and incorporated in any of the above dispositions. In another example, such ES and/or MS may be incorporated into various portions of the EMC system and shield against the electric and/or magnetic waves of such harmful waves, respectively, where dispositions of the ES and/or MS have been described in the above co-pending applications. In another example, not only the counter units but also at least one of the ES and/or MS may be implemented into the EMC system so that the counter unit may counter at least a portion of such harmful waves and that the ES and/or MS may absorb and reroute the rest thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">It is appreciated that any of the above counter units are provided while using the least amount of such electrically conductive, semiconductive, and/or insulative materials, while minimizing a volume, a size, and/or a mass of such counter units. Accordingly, such counter units may be fabricated with less materials at lower costs and may be easily implemented into various locations of the EMC display system. It is further appreciated that any of the counter units are provided to emit the counter waves while using the least amount of the electrical energy, e.g., by drawing the least amount of the electric current or voltage. Therefore, such counter units are not only energy-efficient but also least affecting force-generating and/or movement-generating operation of other parts of such EMC display systems. In addition, such requirements of this paragraph may minimize electric resistances of the counter units and, therefore, minimize voltage drop across the counter units.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Unless otherwise specified, various features of one embodiment of one aspect of the present invention may apply interchangeably to other embodiments of the same aspect of this invention and/or embodiments of one or more of other aspects of this invention. Therefore, any of the counter units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2L</figref> may be implemented to the EMC display systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3O</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref>, and other systems which have not been exemplified in conjunction with the figures but have been disclosed in conjunction therewith. Moreover, any of such counter units which operate on the source matching may be converted to operate based on the wave matching or vice versa, where the source-matched counter units may be disposed along (or across) one or more wavefronts of the harmful waves irradiated by at least one of the base units or where the wave-matched counter units may similarly be disposed in the preset relation to at least one of the base units or may be disposed in the arrangement similar to that of at least one of the base units. In addition, any of such counter units which are to counter a preset number (including 1) of pixels may be provided in a greater or smaller dimension in order to counter a greater or less number of pixels. Moreover, any of the electric and/or magnetic shields which have been disclosed hereinabove and also described in the above co-pending Applications may be incorporated into any of the above base units and/or counter units.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The EMC display systems of this invention may be powered by the AC electrical energy while countering the harmful EM waves with their counter units. When desirable, the EMC display systems may also be powered by the DC electrical energy while similarly countering such harmful waves with the counter units. It is appreciated that the EMC systems may use any conventional modalities capable of shielding and/or canceling the harmful waves. Therefore, it is prefer to braid, bundle, wind, and/or otherwise pair any extra wires, strips, plates, sheets, and other parts of the EMC display systems for minimizing irradiation of the harmful waves therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Although the above figures and descriptions have been centered around various counter units and various electric and/or magnetic shields to be incorporated to various EMC display systems, such counter units may be incorporated into other light emitting display devices which include similar waves sources and/or base units such as, e.g., the electron beam generator and the matching screen coated with the phosphor materials, arrays of the liquid crystal pixels, arrays of the organic and/or inorganic light emitting diodes, arrays of the phosphor pixels filled with ionizing gases releasing photons and/or electrons, and the like. Accordingly, such devices may be converted into the EMC display systems by incorporating thereto one or more of the above counter units.</p>
