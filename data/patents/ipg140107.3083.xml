<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This presently claimed invention generally pertains to illuminated button assemblies that comprise a housing having at least one securing member, a switch, and an illumination member for providing a user with an illuminated means of control. The illuminated buttons, advantageously exhibiting a minimum number of components, can be flexibly secured at the housing by multiple securing options, while having the capability to have the illumination member engage directly with the housing without requiring an intermediary illumination member holder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Illuminated buttons have desired features such as illumination of a switch element with flexible assembly options as low manufacturing cost. While illuminated buttons are attractive, there are many aspects in which improvement is sought. For example, there is a desire to secure the illuminated button to a surface such as a panel or a circuit board, typically by using a securing member in some markets, such as Europe, and by using snap features in other markets, such as the United States. There is also a desire to eliminate a separate illumination member holder so that the illumination member is directly engaged with the switch, which is directly engaged with the housing. There is a further desire to provide a conductive connection between the illuminated button and the mounting surface to dissipate static electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior art approaches include U.S. Pat. No. 7,507,924. This patent pertains to a lighted module with a pushbutton-type switch assembly. The assembly has a threaded housing which is secured to a mounting surface by a fastening element such as a nut. International Publication No. WO 2010/058207 pertains to a pushbutton assembly having a housing with flexible locking or snap tabs which snap out after passing through an opening in the mounting surface such as a panel in order to secure the pushbutton to the panel. Thus, multiple types of housings are required to provide the same illuminated button to markets with different securing requirements. One solution to overcome this deficiency is to provide a separate spacer that acts as a barrier around the snap features when the securing method requires a securing member to secure the illuminated button housing. This solution requires the manufacture of extra parts which can easily become lost, thus increasing the cost of the illuminated button assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another prior art approach EP Patent Application No. 1143468 describes an illuminated pushbutton switch assembly having a separate lamp holder that is locked into the housing and engageably receives a lamp and a switch. The lamp holder must have one means for being secured to the housing, another means for securing the switch, and yet another means for securing the lamp. Therefore, extra parts must be manufactured, stored and distributed, thereby increasing the cost of the illuminated button assembly. Further, the lamp holder requires space for locking to the housing, thereby reducing the space available to stabilize the button. In addition, the lamp holder is a complex part that is difficult to change because the tooling is not flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the present approach, it has been determined that various characteristics of prior art may have shortcomings such as these, and undesirable attributes, results or effects. The present approach recognizes and addresses matters such as these to provide enhancements not heretofore available. Overall, the present approach more fully meets the need to provide a single illuminated button housing that can be secured in a variety of ways as required, that can accommodate a variety of button types, and that can accommodate a variety of illumination members without requiring a separate lamp holder.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect or embodiment of the invention pertains to an improved illuminated button assembly that comprises an assembly housing having threaded portions for receiving a securing member and further having locking members. The securing member is sized and shaped to be secured to the threaded portions of the assembly housing without damaging the locking tabs in order to facilitate using the same assembly housing in multiple types of mounting designs. For example, the assembly housing may be secured to a panel by pushing the assembly housing through a properly sized and shaped aperture in the panel until the locking tabs snap into place, thereby eliminating the need for a securing member. Alternatively, the assembly housing may be secured to a panel by threading a securing member onto the assembly housing that extends through a panel until the securing member is tightened against the panel. The tightened securing member covers or encloses the locking tabs without damaging them, whether or not the locking tabs are utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another aspect or embodiment, an illumination unit is directly engaged by the assembly housing, thereby eliminating the need for a separate lamp holder. The illumination unit can be inserted into a cavity in the assembly housing from the top, for example. This allows for a variety of lighting options using the same size and shape of illumination member housing, such as a simple white LED or a more complex RGB illuminating member, for example. Insertion of the illumination unit from the top also allows for more space to place the illumination members to optimize the lighting. For example, the outer edges of very large buttons can now be optimally illuminated by placing illumination members wider apart. In addition, the elimination of the lamp holder creates more space within the assembly housing, thereby allowing for improved button stability. For example, there can be three latches on the bottom of the activating member properly position the activating member in the assembly housing and ensuring that the switch is activated when the button is pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect or embodiment, the switch is also directly engaged by the assembly housing, eliminating the need for the switch to be held in place by a lamp holder. The switch can be connected to the assembly housing by any industry standard method of attachment, such as latches, snap tabs or a friction fit, for example. Therefore, the switch becomes an integral component of the assembly housing, yet can be easily removed and replaced by a new switch as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is the intention of at least one embodiment of the invention to provide an illuminated button assembly including: an assembly housing having a threaded portion and a locking member, a switch, a moveable button assembly, and an illumination assembly. In an aspect of the invention, the illuminated button assembly further includes a securing member for securing the assembly housing to a mounting surface. In another aspect of the invention, the securing member has a mating portion for engaging the threaded portion of the assembly housing and a flanged portion extending radially beyond the locking member, such that the flanged portion encloses the locking member when the securing member is secured against the mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect of the invention, the flanged portion is sized and shaped such that there is no contact between the flanged portion and the locking member. In another aspect of the invention, the flanged portion is sized and shaped such that the flanged portion contacts but does not compress the locking member. In still another aspect of the invention, the flanged portion is sized and shaped such that the flanged portion compresses the locking member without releasing the locking member from the mounting surface. In another aspect of the invention, the assembly housing has multiple threaded portions with non-threaded portions therebetween. In yet another aspect of the invention, the locking member is positioned in a non-threaded portion. In another aspect of the invention, the assembly housing has multiple locking members.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is the intention of another embodiment of the invention to provide an illuminated button assembly including: an assembly housing, a switch directly connected to the assembly housing, a moveable button assembly, and an illumination assembly. In an aspect of the invention, the illumination member is a Light Emitting Diode (LED). In another aspect of the invention, the illumination assembly is directly connected to the assembly housing. In yet another aspect of the invention, the moveable button assembly comprises a plunger and wherein the plunger has at least three orientation members for positioning the plunger within the assembly housing. In another aspect of the invention, the illumination assembly overlaps with the plunger within the assembly housing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is the intention of yet another embodiment of the invention to provide a method of assembling an illuminated button assembly including the steps of: connecting a switch to an assembly housing, the assembly housing having a threaded portion and a locking member, connecting an illumination assembly to the assembly housing, and connecting a moveable button assembly to the assembly housing. In an aspect of the invention, the method includes the additional steps of placing a portion of the assembly housing through a mounting surface and securing the assembly housing against the mounting surface using at least one of the locking member and a securing member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect of the invention, using a securing member includes advancing the securing member onto the threaded portion until the securing member is secured against the mounting surface, wherein the securing member includes a mating portion for engaging the threaded portion of the assembly housing, and a flanged portion extending radially beyond the locking member, such that the flanged portion at least partially encloses the locking member when the securing member is secured against the mounting surface. In yet another aspect of the invention, the switch and the illumination assembly are directly connected to the assembly housing without using a lamp holder. In still another aspect of the invention, the assembly housing is sized and shaped to accommodate one of a single white light emitting diode (LED) illumination assembly and a multiple LED red, green, blue (RGB) illumination assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> represent an embodiment of an illuminated button assembly, generally designated as <b>10</b>. Illustrated illuminated button assembly <b>10</b> comprises an assembly housing <b>20</b>, a switch <b>30</b>, a button assembly <b>40</b>, and an illumination assembly <b>50</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, assembly housing <b>20</b> has at least one threaded portion <b>22</b> and at least one locking member <b>24</b>. Assembly housing <b>20</b> may be formed of any industry standard material such as metal, plastic or a composite, for example. Threaded portion <b>22</b> allows for a securing member <b>60</b>, such as a nut or a wing nut for example, to be threadably mated with threaded portion <b>22</b> in order to secure the illuminated button assembly <b>10</b> to a mounting surface <b>70</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The mounting surface <b>70</b> may be any industry standard surface such as a panel, a bezel or a washer, for example. The mounting surface <b>70</b> may be formed of any industry standard material such as metal, plastic or a composite, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Illuminated button assembly <b>10</b> may alternatively be secured to mounting surface <b>70</b> by locking member <b>24</b> without the use of securing member <b>60</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. For example, locking member <b>24</b> may be a snap tab that flexes inward as the assembly housing <b>20</b> is passed through an aperture <b>72</b> in mounting surface <b>70</b> and that snaps back after clearing the mounting surface <b>70</b>, such that it prevents assembly housing <b>20</b> from being retracted back through aperture <b>72</b> in mounting surface <b>70</b>. Alternatively, locking member <b>24</b> may be any other industry standard restraining member such as a latch or a hook, for example. Locking member <b>24</b> may be formed of any industry standard material such as metal, plastic or a composite, for example. Assembly housing <b>20</b> may have any number of locking members <b>24</b> as desired. The illustrated assembly housing <b>20</b> has four locking members, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Illuminated button assembly <b>10</b> may be secured to mounting surface <b>70</b> by both locking member <b>24</b> and securing device <b>60</b>. As before, assembly housing <b>20</b> is inserted through aperture <b>72</b> until locking member <b>24</b> flexes back into locking position, thereby securing assembly housing <b>20</b> to mounting surface <b>70</b>. A mating portion <b>66</b> of securing member <b>60</b> is then threadably mated with threaded portion <b>22</b> until an engaging portion <b>62</b> of securing member <b>60</b> is secured against a surface of the mounting surface <b>70</b>, securing illuminated button assembly <b>70</b>. An extended portion <b>64</b> of securing member <b>60</b> extends radially outward from mating portion <b>66</b> such that securing member <b>60</b> can fit over locking member <b>24</b>. Extended portion <b>64</b> may be sized and shaped such that securing member <b>60</b> does not contact locking member <b>24</b> when securing member <b>60</b> is secured against mounting surface <b>70</b>, for example. Alternatively, extended portion <b>64</b> may be sized and shaped such that locking member <b>24</b> is contacted but not compressed, slightly compressed or fully compressed when securing member <b>60</b> is secured against mounting surface <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, switch <b>30</b> is directly connected to assembly housing <b>20</b>, thereby eliminating the need for a lamp holder as an intermediary connection between the switch <b>30</b> and the assembly housing <b>20</b>. Switch <b>30</b> may be attached by the use of any industry standard attachment method, such as latches, snap tabs or a friction fit, for example. Switch <b>30</b> may be any industry standard or custom switch that may include a switch housing <b>32</b>, switch contacts <b>34</b> and an activation member <b>36</b> for engaging and disengaging with the contacts, for example. The engaging and disengaging of the switch contacts allows the illumination assembly to be turned on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An illustrated embodiment of button assembly <b>40</b> is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 17</figref>. Illustrated button assembly <b>40</b> comprises a plunger <b>42</b>, a spring <b>44</b>, a button bezel <b>46</b>, a legend plate <b>48</b>, and a lens cap <b>49</b>, for example. Plunger <b>42</b> is sized and shaped to slidably move within a shaft <b>26</b> of assembly housing <b>20</b>. Plunger <b>42</b> may have any desired number and type of orientation members <b>43</b> to enable plunger <b>42</b> to properly be positioned within shaft <b>26</b>. For example, the illustrated plunger <b>42</b> has three hooks <b>43</b> on the bottom of the plunger as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, thereby ensuring improved button stability. Button stability is important to ensure that switch <b>30</b> is consistently activated when the button is pressed by a user. Alternatively, orientation member <b>43</b> can be a guiding ring, a bump, or a guiding slot, for example. Illustrated orientation member <b>43</b> contacts activation member <b>36</b> of switch <b>30</b> when button assembly <b>40</b> is pushed down by the user, thereby turning the illumination assembly <b>50</b> on or off. Button assembly <b>40</b> can be sized and shaped as desired. For example, button assembly <b>40</b> can be round, square or rectangular, and can be small or large, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, illumination assembly <b>50</b> comprises a terminal housing <b>52</b>, terminals <b>54</b>, a substrate <b>56</b>, and an illumination member <b>58</b>. Terminal housing <b>52</b> is sized and shaped to be attached to assembly housing <b>20</b> by any industry standard method such as latches, tabs, tongue and groove, or friction fit, for example. Illustrated terminal housing <b>52</b> is sized and shaped to provide a variety of illumination options without having to change the dimensions of terminal housing <b>52</b>. For example, the same size and shape terminal housing <b>52</b> can be used for an illumination assembly having two terminals <b>54</b> with a single illumination member <b>58</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, or having four terminals <b>54</b> with four illumination members as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Illumination member <b>58</b> can be any industry standard illumination device such as an incandescent light bulb or a light emitting diode (LED), for example. Illustrated illumination member <b>58</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a simple white LED while illustrated illumination members <b>58</b> if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are multiple LEDs forming a more complex RGB version.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Illumination assembly <b>50</b> is inserted into assembly housing <b>20</b> from the top of button assembly <b>40</b> when legend plate <b>48</b> and lens cap <b>49</b> are removed. Therefore, illumination assembly <b>50</b> can overlap with plunger <b>42</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. This allows illumination members <b>58</b> to be placed further apart upon substrate <b>56</b>, thereby illuminating the edges of lens cap <b>49</b> more effectively and minimizing having a bright spot in the middle of lens cap <b>49</b>, particularly for large button assemblies <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Illuminated button assembly <b>10</b> may also include a terminal connector <b>80</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Terminal connector <b>80</b> is sized and shaped to receive switch contacts <b>34</b> of switch <b>30</b> and terminals <b>54</b> of illumination assembly <b>50</b>, thereby providing electrical connections to switch <b>30</b> and illumination assembly <b>50</b>. Alternatively, illuminated button assembly <b>10</b> may have separate terminal connectors <b>80</b> for connecting to switch <b>30</b> and illumination assembly <b>50</b> respectively. Terminal connector <b>80</b> may be connected to a controller, a printed circuit board, or a power supply, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be understood that there are numerous modifications of the illustrated embodiments described above which will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, such as variations and modifications of the illuminated button assembly and/or its components including combinations of features disclosed herein that are individually disclosed or claimed herein, explicitly including additional combinations of such features, or alternatively other types of illuminated button assemblies.
