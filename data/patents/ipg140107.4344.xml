<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In one exemplary aspect of this invention a method includes buffering data in a user equipment and, in response to an amount of buffered data exceeding a threshold value, triggering the generation of a buffer status report and the sending of the buffer status report to a network access node, where the threshold value is a function of the capacity of a currently allocated uplink data transmission resource and some certain amount of time. In another exemplary embodiment the triggering of the generation of the buffer status report and the sending of the buffer status report to a network access node occurs when an amount of buffered data in a buffer of a particular logical channel group exceeds a maximum value associated with one of a plurality of buffer status report tables that is currently in use.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0056">Also of interest herein are the further releases of 3GPP LTE (e.g., LTE Rel-10) targeted towards future IMTA systems, referred to herein for convenience simply as LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). Reference in this regard may be made to 3GPP TR 36.913, V9.1.0 (2009-12), 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Requirements for Further Advancements for EUTRA (LTE-Advanced) (Release 9), incorporated by reference herein. A goal of LTE-A is to provide significantly enhanced services by means of higher data rates and lower latency with reduced cost. LTE-A is directed toward extending and optimizing the 3GPP L Rel-8 radio access technologies to provide higher data rates at lower cost. LTE-A will be a more optimized radio system fulfilling the ITU-R requirements for IMT-Advanced while keeping backwards compatibility with LTE Rel-8.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0057">As is specified in 3GPP TR 36.913, LTE-A should operate in spectrum allocations of different sizes, including wider spectrum allocations than those of LTE Rel-8 (e.g., up to 100 MHz) to achieve the peak data rate of 100 Mbit/s for high mobility and 1 Gbit/s for low mobility. It has been agreed that carrier aggregation is to be considered for LTE-A in order to support bandwidths larger than 20 MHz. Carrier aggregation, where two or more component carriers (CCs) are aggregated, is considered for LTE-A in order to support transmission bandwidths larger than 20 MHz. The carrier aggregation could be contiguous or non-contiguous. This technique, as a bandwidth extension, can provide significant gains in terms of peak data rate and cell throughput as compared to non-aggregated operation as in LTE Rel-8.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0058">A terminal may simultaneously receive one or multiple component carriers depending on its capabilities. A LTE-A terminal with reception capability beyond 20 MHz can simultaneously receive transmissions on multiple component carriers. A LTE Rel-8 terminal can receive transmissions on a single component carrier only, provided that the structure of the component carrier follows the Rel-8 specifications. Moreover, it is required that LTE-A should be backwards compatible with Rel-8 LTE in the sense that a Rel-8 LTE terminal should be operable in the LTE-A system, and that a LTE-A terminal should be operable in a Rel-8 LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows an example of CA, where M Rel-8 component carriers are combined together to form M&#xd7;Rel-8 BW (e.g. 5&#xd7;20 MHz=100 MHz given M=5). Rel-8 terminals receive/transmit on one CC, whereas LTE-A terminals may receive/transmit on multiple CCs simultaneously to achieve higher (wider) bandwidths.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0060">Basically, in CA it is possible to configure a UE to aggregate a different number of CCs originating from the same eNB, of possibly different BWs, in the UL and the DL. Rel-8 UEs are assumed to be served by a single stand-alone CC, while Release 10 (LTE-A) terminals can be configured to receive or transmit simultaneously on multiple aggregated CCs in the same TTI.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0061">As is currently specified for LTE, one subframe is equal to one millisecond, and comprises two 0.5 millisecond slots.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0062">In addition, configured CCs can be de-activated in order to reduce the UE power consumption. In this case the UE monitoring activity of a de-activated carrier is reduced (e.g., no PDCCH monitoring and CQI measurements are needed). This mechanism can be referred to as carrier activation/de-activation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0063">Furthermore, to assist the eNB scheduler functionality the eNB can configure UEs to send BSRs and PHRs in the UL. Reference in this regard can be made to 3GPP TS 36.321 V9.1.0 (2009-12) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol specification (Release 9), such as in Section 5.4.5 &#x201c;Buffer Status Reporting&#x201d; and Section 5.4.6 &#x201c;Power Headroom Reporting&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0064">The BSR indicates the amount of data the UE has available for transmission, while the PHR provides the eNB with information about the difference between the nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH transmission. BSRs are typically used by the eNB to select an appropriate transport block size, while PHRs are typically used to select an appropriate MCS.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0065">BSRs are sent by the UE in the UL in the form of Buffer Status Report MAC Control Elements (see 3GPP TS 36.321, Section 6.1.3.1, &#x201c;Buffer Status Report MAC Control Elements&#x201d;) in which the Buffer Size (BS) field identifies the total amount of data available for transmission. The length of this field is specified as 6 bits and contains exponentially distributed buffer size levels based on a minimum buffer size level (B<sub>min</sub>), a maximum buffer size level (B<sub>max</sub>) and a number of reported buffer size levels (N).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0066">Reference can be made, for example, to R2-083101, &#x201c;Buffer Size Levels for BSR in E-UTRA Uplink&#x201d;, 3GPP TSG-RAN WG2 Meeting #62bis, Warsaw, Poland, 30 Jun.-4 Jul. 2008, Source: Ericsson, Nokia Corporation, Nokia Siemens Networks, Samsung.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0068">As is stated in 3GPP TS 36.321, Section 6.1.3.1, Buffer Status Report (BSR) MAC control elements consist of either the Short BSR and Truncated BSR format, with one LCG ID field and one corresponding buffer Size field (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> herein) or the Long BSR format having four buffer size fields, corresponding to LCG IDs #<b>0</b> through #<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> herein). In a conventional sense the LCG is understood to be a group of UL logical channels for which a single joint buffer fill level is reported by the UE in a BSR. The mapping of logical channels to LCGs is defined by the eNodeB. The BSR formats are identified by MAC PDU subheaders with LCIDs as specified in table 6.2.1-2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> herein). The fields LCG ID and Buffer Size are defined as follows. LCG ID: The Logical Channel Group ID field identifies the group of logical channel(s) for which buffer status is being reported. The length of the field is 2 bits. Buffer Size: The Buffer Size field identifies the total amount of data available across all logical channels of a logical channel group after the MAC PDU has been built. The amount of data is indicated as the number of bytes. It includes all data that is available for transmission in the RLC layer and in the PDCP layer. The size of the RLC and MAC headers are not considered in the buffer size computation. The length of this field is 6 bits. The values taken by the Buffer Size field are shown in Table 6.1.3.1-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> herein).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0069">However, the BS field as specified for LTE Rel-8 and Rel-9 is based on the assumption that only one CC is used in the UL and, as a result, is not adequate for use with the higher data rates made possible by the use of CA in Rel-10 and beyond.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0083">The exemplary embodiments of this invention relate generally to mobile wireless communication, such as 3GPP LTE-A. The exemplary embodiments of this invention relate more specifically to the UL buffer size and the reporting of same. As was noted above, the BSR as defined in Rel-8 and Rel-9 supports a maximum buffer size of 150,000 bytes (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). The exemplary embodiments of this invention address and solve this problem for the case of CA where significantly higher UL data rates can be supported.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0084">Before describing in further detail the exemplary embodiments of this invention, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for illustrating a simplified block diagram of various electronic devices and apparatus that are suitable for use in practicing the exemplary embodiments of this invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a wireless network <b>1</b> is adapted for communication over a wireless link <b>11</b> with an apparatus, such as a mobile communication device which may be referred to as a UE <b>10</b>, via a network access node, such as a Node B (base station), and more specifically an eNB <b>12</b>. The network <b>1</b> may include a network control element (NCE) <b>14</b> that may include the MME/SGW functionality shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and which provides connectivity with a further network, such as a telephone network and/or a data communications network (e.g., the internet). The UE <b>10</b> includes a controller, such as at least one computer or a data processor (DP) <b>10</b>A, a non-transitory computer-readable memory medium embodied as a memory (MEM) <b>10</b>B that stores a program of computer instructions (PROG) <b>10</b>C, and a suitable radio frequency (RF) transceiver <b>10</b>D for bidirectional wireless communications with the eNB <b>12</b> via one or more antennas. The eNB <b>12</b> also includes a controller, such as at least one computer or a data processor (DP) <b>12</b>A, a computer-readable memory medium embodied as a memory (MEM) <b>12</b>B that stores a program of computer instructions (PROG) <b>12</b>C, and a suitable RF transceiver <b>12</b>D for communication with the UE <b>10</b> via one or more antennas (typically several when MIMO operation is in use). The eNB <b>12</b> is coupled via a data/control path <b>13</b> to the NCE <b>14</b>. The path <b>13</b> may be implemented as the S1 interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The eNB <b>12</b> may also be coupled to another eNB via data/control path <b>15</b>, which may be implemented as the X2 interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0085">For the purposes of describing the exemplary embodiments of this invention the UE <b>10</b> can be assumed to also include a MAC function or module <b>10</b>E, and the memory <b>10</b>B can be assumed to include one or more data buffers <b>10</b>F. The memory <b>10</b>B can also store one or more buffer size tables. The eNB <b>12</b> can be assumed to include a corresponding MAC function or module <b>12</b>E. In one exemplary embodiment the MAC modules <b>10</b>E, <b>12</b>E can be compatible with, and configured to operate using, the MAC procedures defined in 3GPP TS 36.321, as extended and enhanced in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0086">The PROGs <b>10</b>C and <b>12</b>C are assumed to include program instructions that, when executed by the associated DP, enable the device to operate in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as will be discussed below in greater detail. That is, the exemplary embodiments of this invention may be implemented at least in part by computer software executable by the DP <b>10</b>A of the UE <b>10</b> and/or by the DP <b>12</b>A of the eNB <b>12</b>, or by hardware, or by a combination of software and hardware (and firmware).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0087">In general, the various embodiments of the UE <b>10</b> can include, but are not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) having wireless communication capabilities, portable computers having wireless communication capabilities, image capture devices such as digital cameras having wireless communication capabilities, gaming devices having wireless communication capabilities, music storage and playback appliances having wireless communication capabilities, Internet appliances permitting wireless Internet access and browsing, as well as portable units or terminals that incorporate combinations of such functions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0088">The computer-readable MEMs <b>10</b>B and <b>12</b>B may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may be implemented using any suitable data storage technology, such as semiconductor based memory devices, flash memory, magnetic memory devices and systems, optical memory devices and systems, fixed memory and removable memory. The DPs <b>10</b>A and <b>12</b>A may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment, and may include one or more of general purpose computers, special purpose computers, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs) and processors based on multi-core processor architectures, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0089">Described now in further detail are several aspects of the exemplary embodiments of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0090">In a first aspect of the exemplary embodiments there are introduced a plurality of buffer size level tables tailored for different maximum uplink data rates. For example one buffer size table can be provided with a maximum of 150,000 bytes, thus corresponding to the same UL data rate as in Rel-8 and Rel-9. This first table may be identical to the table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A second table with a maximum of 300,000 bytes, corresponding to twice the UL data rate of Rel-8 and Rel-9, can also be provided to cover the case of, for example, the aggregation of two CCs in the UL. In a similar manner a third buffer size table with a maximum of 450,000 bytes, corresponding to three times the UL data rate of Rel-8 and Rel-9, can also be provided to cover the case of, for example, the aggregation of three CCs in the UL.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0091">In a second aspect of the exemplary embodiments, and when building/composing an UL BSR MAC Control Element, the MAC function <b>10</b>E of the UE <b>10</b> dynamically selects the buffer size level table to be used based on the amount of data buffered. The UE <b>10</b> selects one of the tables according to the amount of data it has buffered, e.g., the UE <b>10</b> selects the table with a minimum B<sub>max </sub>that does not exceed its current buffer status (i.e., the table with the finest granularity). The UE <b>10</b> can then indicate to the eNB <b>12</b> which table is used via, for example, two R (reserved) bits in the MAC header for BSR (see the R/R/E/LCID sub-header shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). All LCGs use the same BSR table in the Long BSR which is selected according to the LCG with the most data buffered (or alternatively according to the LCG that has triggered the BSR).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0092">In a third aspect of the exemplary embodiments of this invention there is introduced a threshold-based BSR trigger, with the threshold being implicitly deduced by the buffer exceeding what can be supported by currently configured or allocated resource(s) within some certain time. The time can be configurable or it can be fixed so as to be the same as the response time (e.g., 16 TTIs used for calculating the maximum level for the BSR table). The threshold may be per LCG, e.g., the BSR is triggered when the buffer of a LCG exceeds the threshold such that another BSR table is to be used (i.e., the buffer exceeds the value of B<sub>max </sub>of the BSR table currently in use). Alternatively, the threshold value can be directly configurable by the eNB <b>12</b> in DL signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0093">In accordance with the exemplary embodiments the buffer size tables can be generated with different B<sub>max </sub>values and exponentially distributed buffer size levels. B<sub>max </sub>is determined by the number of configured/activated UL CCs and/or whether UL MIMO is configured for each CC. For example, B<sub>max </sub>for two UL CCs can be twice as large as for a single UL CC. The buffer size levels can be calculated in the same manner as in Rel-8: i.e., B<sub>k</sub>=&#x250c;B<sub>min</sub>&#xb7;(1+p)<sup>k</sup>&#x2510;, where p=(B<sub>max</sub>/B<sub>min</sub>)<sup>1/(N-1)</sup>&#x2212;1, k is the index, N is maximum index (62 in this example with 6 bits for BS and one value reserved for an empty buffer), B<sub>min</sub>=10 bytes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0094">With, for example, the two R bits in the MAC BSR header (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), up to four pre-defined tables can be supported and identified to the eNB <b>12</b>, where each BRS table has a different B<sub>max </sub>value. The B<sub>max </sub>values can be determined by the data rate supported with different numbers of UL CC and/or with UL MIMO, and B<sub>k </sub>calculated the same way as in the first aspect discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0095">For an implicit threshold, and by example, when one CC is configured for the UE <b>10</b> the BSR is triggered when the buffer status exceeds 150 Kbytes, which is the maximum value can be supported with one CC within a 16 TTI response time. Alternatively, when the allocated resource is 100 Kbyte for a certain TTI, BSR is triggered if the buffer exceeds 100 Kbytes times some certain time (e.g., 16 TTI or some configurable time), which means BSR is triggered when the buffer cannot be emptied with the currently allocated UL resource within the specified time (e.g., with 16 TTI).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0096">For the per LCG threshold, and by example assuming the BSR table used in previous BSRs is B<sub>max</sub>=150 Kbytes, then BSR is triggered when the data buffer of a LCG exceeds 150 kbytes, and another BSR table is to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0097">It should be appreciated that the exemplary embodiments of this invention can be implemented in a variety of different forms. For example, it is also within the scope of the exemplary embodiments to take the operation of UL MIMO into account. As such, the BSR tables are not necessarily linked only to the number of CCs in use. As one non-limiting example, the UE <b>10</b> may store two BSR tables, with one table identical to (or substantially identical to) the table used for Rel-8 (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), and a second table composed so as to cover the use case of five UL CCs plus UL MIMO.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0098">As can be appreciated, a number of technical effects are realized by the use of the exemplary embodiments. For example, more accurate UL buffer information is provided for the eNB <b>12</b> to enable more efficient scheduling and a better determination as to whether more UL CC(s) need to be configured/activated, or whether some existing UL CC should be de-configured/deactivated. The BSR format need not change from what is already specified for Rel-8 and Rel-9, and thus the impact on the MAC protocol is minimized, i.e., 6 bits are still used for the BS for a LCG with a MAC header to indicate that it is a BSR MAC control element (CE).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0099">Based on the foregoing it should be apparent that the exemplary embodiments of this invention provide a method, apparatus and computer program(s) to enhance the reporting of the amount of buffered data in the UE <b>10</b> to the eNB <b>12</b>.</p>
