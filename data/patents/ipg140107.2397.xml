<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0013389, filed on Feb. 12, 2010, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An aspect of the present invention relates to a rechargeable battery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unlike non-rechargeable, primary batteries, rechargeable batteries can be repeatedly charged and discharged. Lower capacity rechargeable batteries that use single battery cells may be used as power sources for various portable electronic devices such as cellular phones or camcorders. Higher capacity rechargeable batteries that use tens of battery cells connected to each other in a battery pack may be used as power sources for driving motors such as in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Rechargeable batteries are manufactured in various shapes, and representative shapes thereof may include a cylindrical shape and a prismatic shape. Rechargeable batteries are generally configured such that an electrode assembly which is formed by interposing a separator serving as an insulator between positive and negative electrodes, and an electrolyte solution are housed in a case, and a cap plate is installed in the case. Electrode terminals are connected to the electrode assembly and then exposed to the outside through the cap plate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some cases, a gap is formed between the electrode terminal and the cap plate, and the electrolyte solution may infiltrate through the gap. As described above, the infiltration of the electrolyte solution through the gap between the electrode terminal and the cap plate may cause an electrical short between the electrode terminal and the cap plate, resulting in deterioration of the battery and reducing the battery capacity. The electrolyte solution may also leak outside through the gap between the electrode terminal and the cap plate, causing corrosions to various elements installed outside the battery. In addition, external moisture may flow into the case through the gap.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the present invention provide a rechargeable battery which can prevent an electrolyte solution from infiltrating through a gap between an electrode terminal and a cap plate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of the present invention also provide a rechargeable battery which can improve sealing performance of an electrode terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a rechargeable battery is provided including a case containing an electrode assembly and an electrolyte solution; a cap plate sealing the case; an electrode terminal electrically coupled to the electrode assembly and extending through the cap plate; and a seal gasket positioned between the electrode terminal and the cap plate, wherein the seal gasket has a beveled edge extending around a circumference of the seal gasket.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the seal gasket includes a body positioned between the electrode terminal and the cap plate; and a flange extending away from the body and contacting the cap plate, wherein the beveled edge is located on the flange. At least one protrusion or at least one groove contacting the cap plate may be located on the flange and/or on the cap plate. The electrode terminal may include a terminal body penetrating the body of the seal gasket; and a terminal extension extending from the terminal body and contacting the flange of the seal gasket. In one embodiment, the beveled edge is shaped such that a diameter of the seal gasket increases gradually in a direction away from the electrode assembly and the beveled edge may include at least one protrusion or groove.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the beveled edge may contact a first insulator and wherein the first insulator contacts the cap plate. In one embodiment, the first insulator has a beveled edge generally corresponding to the beveled edge of the seal gasket and the first insulator has a groove coupled to the electrode terminal. Additionally, in one embodiment, the first insulator has at least one protrusion or at least one groove adhered to the beveled edge of the seal gasket and the cap plate has a groove coupled to the first insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the electrode terminal has a first insulator and a second insulator coupled thereto, both the first insulator and the second insulator contacting the cap plate and the cap plate has a groove coupled to the second insulator. Additionally, the electrode terminal may have a terminal plate coupled thereto, the terminal plate contacting the second insulator and 16 and the second insulator may have a groove coupled to the terminal plate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to embodiments of the present invention, since at least one protrusion (or groove) is formed in the seal gasket, or at least one groove (or protrusion) corresponding thereto is formed in the cap plate or the lower insulator, infiltration of the electrolyte solution can be more effectively suppressed. In addition, the sealing performance of the electrode terminal can be further improved.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C are a perspective view, a longitudinal sectional view, and an enlarged partial sectional view of a rechargeable battery according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref>, the rechargeable battery <b>100</b> includes an electrode assembly <b>10</b>, a first electrode terminal <b>20</b>, a second electrode terminal <b>30</b>, a case <b>40</b>, and a cap assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The electrode assembly <b>10</b> is formed by winding or laminating a stacked structure of a first electrode plate <b>11</b>, a separator <b>13</b>, and a second electrode plate <b>12</b>. Here, the first electrode plate <b>11</b> may function as a cathode and the second electrode plate <b>12</b> may function as an anode.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first electrode plate <b>11</b> is formed by coating a first electrode active material formed of a metal foil made of aluminum on a first electrode collector, and includes a first electrode non-coated portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>that is not coated with a first electrode active material. The first electrode non-coated portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>forms a path of current flow between the first electrode plate <b>11</b> and the first electrode terminal <b>20</b>. Meanwhile, the present invention is not limited to the materials for the first electrode plate <b>11</b> listed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The second electrode plate <b>12</b> is formed by coating a second electrode active material formed of a metal foil made of nickel or copper on a second electrode collector, and includes a second electrode non-coated portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>that is not coated with a second electrode active material. The second electrode non-coated portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>forms a path of current flow between the second electrode plate <b>12</b> and the second electrode terminal <b>30</b>. Meanwhile, the present invention is not limited to the materials for the second electrode plate <b>12</b> listed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first electrode plate <b>11</b> and the second electrode plate <b>12</b> may be arranged to have different polarities.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The separator <b>13</b> is positioned between the first electrode plate <b>11</b> and the second electrode plate <b>12</b> and serves to allow movement of lithium ions while preventing electrical shorts. The separator <b>13</b> may be made of polyethylene, polypropylene, or a combination of polyethylene and polypropylene. However, the present invention is not limited to the materials for the separator <b>13</b> listed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A first electrode terminal <b>20</b> and a second electrode terminal <b>30</b> are coupled to respective ends of the aforementioned electrode assembly <b>10</b> to be electrically connected to the first electrode plate <b>11</b> and the second electrode plate <b>12</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The electrode assembly <b>10</b> is housed in the case with an electrolyte solution. The electrolyte solution may include an organic solvent such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and the like, and a lithium salt such as LiPF<sub>6 </sub>or LiBF<sub>4</sub>. The electrolyte solution is a liquid, a solid or a gel phase.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If the electrolyte solution infiltrates into a gap between the first electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap assembly <b>50</b>, or a gap between the second electrode terminal <b>30</b> and the cap assembly <b>50</b>, the infiltration of the electrolyte solution may reduce a breakdown voltage, causing an electrical short between the first electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap assembly <b>50</b>, or between the second electrode terminal <b>30</b> and the cap assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first electrode terminal <b>20</b> may be made of a conductive material such as aluminum, and may be welded to the first electrode non-coated portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>protruding to one end of the electrode assembly <b>10</b> to be electrically connected to the first electrode plate <b>11</b>. The first electrode terminal <b>20</b> includes a first terminal body <b>21</b>, a first terminal extending part <b>22</b>, and a first terminal welding part <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first terminal body <b>21</b> penetrates through the cap assembly <b>50</b> and has its top end riveted to be fixed to the cap assembly <b>50</b>. The first terminal extending part <b>22</b> horizontally extends from the first terminal body <b>21</b> to be closely adhered to a bottom surface of the cap assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first terminal welding part <b>23</b> vertically extends from the first terminal extending part <b>22</b> to be closely adhered to the first electrode non-coated portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the electrode assembly <b>10</b>. In other words, the first terminal welding part <b>23</b> is welded to the first electrode non-coated portion <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second electrode terminal <b>30</b> may be made of a conductive material such as nickel, and is brought into contact with the second electrode non-coated portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>protruding to the other end of the electrode assembly <b>10</b> to be electrically connected to the second electrode plate <b>12</b>. The second electrode terminal <b>30</b> includes a second terminal body <b>31</b>, a second terminal extending part <b>32</b>, and a second terminal welding part <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the second electrode terminal <b>30</b>, the second terminal body <b>31</b>, the second terminal extending part <b>32</b> and the second terminal welding part <b>33</b> have substantially the same shape and use as the first terminal body <b>21</b>, the first terminal extending part <b>22</b> and the first terminal welding part <b>23</b> in the first electrode terminal <b>20</b>, and repetitive descriptions thereof will not be given.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The case <b>40</b> may be made of a conductive metal such as aluminum, aluminum alloy or nickel plated steel, and may take an approximately hexagonal shape that defines an inner space for receiving the electrode assembly <b>10</b>, the first electrode terminal <b>20</b>, the second electrode terminal <b>30</b> and the electrolyte solution electrode assembly <b>14</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrating a state in which the case <b>40</b> and the cap assembly <b>50</b> are assembled, although an opening is not shown, the opening corresponding to a circumference of the cap assembly <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, the internal surface of the case <b>40</b> is insulated to be electrically insulated from the electrode assembly <b>10</b>, the first electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the second electrode terminal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cap assembly <b>50</b> is coupled to the case <b>40</b>. The cap assembly <b>50</b> includes a cap plate <b>51</b>. The cap plate <b>51</b> seals an opening of the case <b>40</b>, and may be made of the same material as the case <b>40</b>. In addition, the cap plate <b>51</b> includes a plug <b>53</b> closing an electrolyte solution injection hole <b>52</b>, and a safety vent <b>54</b> that is a relatively thin portion.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cap assembly <b>50</b> may also include a first sealing part <b>60</b> and a second sealing part <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first sealing part <b>60</b> includes a first seal gasket <b>61</b> through which the first terminal body <b>21</b> of the first electrode terminal <b>20</b> penetrates, a first lower insulator <b>62</b>, a first upper insulator <b>63</b>, and a first terminal plate <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The second sealing part <b>70</b> includes a second seal gasket <b>71</b> through which the second terminal body <b>31</b> of the second electrode terminal <b>30</b> penetrates, a second lower insulator <b>72</b>, a second upper insulator <b>73</b>, and a second terminal plate <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since the first sealing part <b>60</b> and the second sealing part <b>70</b> have substantially the same configuration, embodiments of the invention will be described with regard to a configuration of the first sealing part <b>60</b>. In addition, in the following description, the first electrode terminal <b>20</b> will be referred to as an electrode terminal <b>20</b>, the first terminal body <b>21</b> as a terminal body <b>21</b>, the first terminal extending part <b>22</b> as a terminal extending part <b>22</b>, the first seal gasket <b>61</b> as a seal gasket <b>61</b>, the first lower insulator <b>62</b> as a lower insulator <b>62</b>, the first upper insulator <b>63</b> as an upper insulator <b>63</b>, and the first terminal plate <b>64</b> as a terminal plate <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, since the seal gasket <b>61</b> is located between the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b>, a breakdown voltage between the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b> is maintained at a relatively high level, thereby preventing an electrical short therebetween. To this end, the seal gasket <b>61</b> is formed using an insulating material. In addition, since the seal gasket <b>61</b> prevents the electrolyte solution from infiltrating into a gap between the cap plate <b>51</b> and the electrode terminal <b>20</b>, the breakdown between the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b> is increased, thereby preventing an unnecessary electrical short. In greater detail, the seal gasket <b>61</b> prevents the electrolyte solution from infiltrating a gap between the cap plate <b>51</b> and the terminal body <b>21</b>, and a gap between the cap plate <b>51</b> and the terminal extending part <b>22</b>, thereby preventing an unnecessary electrical short between the cap plate <b>51</b> and the electrode terminal <b>20</b>. Further, the seal gasket <b>61</b> may prevent external moisture from entering the case <b>40</b> through the gap between the cap plate <b>51</b> and the electrode terminal <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The seal gasket <b>61</b> includes a body <b>61</b><i>a </i>and a flange <b>61</b><i>b</i>. The body <b>61</b><i>a </i>wraps around the terminal body <b>21</b> in an approximately tubular shape, thereby preventing an electrical short between the terminal body <b>21</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b>. The flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>is bent from the body <b>61</b><i>a </i>and extends horizontally and outwardly away from the body <b>61</b><i>a </i>to be closely adhered to the bottom surface of the cap plate <b>51</b>. In other words, the flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>is positioned between the bottom surface of the cap plate <b>51</b> and the terminal extending part <b>22</b>. A slope or beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c </i>is formed at an end of the flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>such that a diameter of the seal gasket <b>61</b> gradually increases from a lower portion to an upper portion. In other words, the beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c </i>is formed at the end of the flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>such that the diameter of the seal gasket <b>61</b> gradually increases in a direction away from the electrode assembly such that the beveled edge is slanted generally toward the electrode assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lower insulator <b>62</b> is positioned at the exterior side of the flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>and is closely adhered to the bottom surface of the cap plate <b>51</b>. In addition, a portion of the lower insulator <b>62</b> is closely adhered to a region between the terminal extending part <b>22</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b>. Further, the lower insulator <b>62</b> has a sloping surface <b>62</b><i>c </i>to be closely adhered to the beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since the beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c </i>of the seal gasket <b>61</b> and the sloping surface <b>62</b><i>c </i>of the lower insulator <b>62</b> are closely adhered to each other, the electrolyte solution is not able to easily infiltrate the cap plate <b>51</b> through a gap created between the beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c </i>of the seal gasket <b>61</b> and the sloping surface <b>62</b><i>c </i>of the lower insulator <b>62</b>. In addition, since the seal gasket <b>61</b> and the lower insulator <b>62</b> are securely adhered to the cap plate <b>51</b> by the electrode terminal <b>20</b>, the sealing performance of the battery, specifically, the electrode terminal <b>20</b>, is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, a groove <b>62</b><i>a </i>may be formed on the bottom surface of the lower insulator <b>62</b>. The groove <b>62</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the terminal extending part <b>22</b> of the electrode terminal <b>20</b> to prevent the electrode terminal <b>20</b> from rotating. In addition, a groove <b>55</b> may be formed on the bottom surface of the cap plate <b>51</b>. The groove <b>55</b> is coupled to the lower insulator <b>62</b> to prevent the lower insulator <b>62</b> from rotating. For the purpose of preventing rotation, a protrusion <b>62</b><i>b </i>may be formed on the top surface of the lower insulator <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The upper insulator <b>63</b> is coupled to the terminal body <b>21</b> of the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and is closely adhered to the top surface of the cap plate <b>51</b>. Here, a groove <b>56</b> may be formed on the top surface of the cap plate <b>51</b>. The groove <b>56</b> is coupled to the upper insulator <b>63</b> to prevent the upper insulator <b>63</b> from rotating. In one embodiment, for the purpose of preventing rotation, a protrusion <b>63</b><i>b </i>may be formed on the bottom surface of the upper insulator <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The terminal plate <b>64</b> is coupled to the terminal body <b>21</b> of the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and is closely adhered to the top surface of the upper insulator <b>63</b>. Here, a groove <b>63</b><i>a </i>may be formed on the top surface of the upper insulator <b>63</b>. The groove <b>63</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the terminal plate <b>64</b> to prevent the terminal plate <b>64</b> from rotating. Of course, for the purpose of preventing rotation, a protrusion <b>64</b><i>b </i>may be formed on the bottom surface of the terminal plate <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Meanwhile, the terminal body <b>21</b> of the electrode terminal <b>20</b> is riveted at its top end, thereby being firmly fixed to the terminal plate <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, according to an embodiment the present invention, since the seal gasket <b>61</b> is located between the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b>, an electrolyte solution is unlikely to infiltrate a gap between the cap plate <b>51</b> and the electrode terminal <b>20</b>. Accordingly, an unnecessary electrical short between the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b> can be prevented. In addition, since the beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c </i>is formed on the seal gasket <b>61</b> and the corresponding sloping surface <b>62</b><i>c </i>is formed on the lower insulator <b>62</b>, it is difficult for the electrolyte solution to reach the cap plate <b>51</b> through an interface between the beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c </i>of the seal gasket <b>61</b> and the sloping surface <b>62</b><i>c </i>of the lower insulator <b>62</b>. An electrical short, which can be caused by a reduced breakdown voltage between the electrode terminal <b>20</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b> as the electrolyte solution infiltrates, may be more effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view of a rechargeable battery according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>may further be formed on a top surface, i.e., a surface facing generally away from the electrode assembly <b>10</b>, of a flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>of a seal gasket <b>61</b>. The protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>further improves sealing capacity between the flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>of the seal gasket <b>61</b> and the cap plate <b>51</b>. Although only one protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of protrusions may be formed. In addition, although the protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a semi-circular shape, it may have a triangular shape, a rectangular shape, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, a groove <b>57</b> may be formed at a region of the cap plate <b>51</b> generally corresponding to the protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>formed on the flange <b>61</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>of the flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to the groove <b>57</b> of the cap plate <b>51</b>. Alternatively, the groove <b>57</b> may be omitted from the cap plate <b>51</b> even when the seal gasket <b>61</b> with a protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>is used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, according to an embodiment of the present invention, since the protrusion <b>61</b><i>d </i>is formed in the seal gasket <b>61</b>, the sealing performance of the battery can be further improved.</p>

The protrusion <b>61</b><i>e </i>further improves sealing capacity between the beveled edge <b>61</b><i>c </i>of the flange <b>61</b><i>b </i>of the seal gasket <b>61</b> and the sloping surface <b>62</b><i>c </i>of the lower insulator <b>62</b>.
