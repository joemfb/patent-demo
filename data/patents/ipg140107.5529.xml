<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There has been a long-felt need to develop financial products with which to hedge price risk for goods and services, and many have appreciated the problem of often volatile changes in prices for goods and services. To date, the search for a solution to this need has been largely fruitless except for products that generally fall within traditional notions of the definition of &#x201c;fungible&#x201d;. The creation of hedge products for services has lagged far behind product development for raw commodity products and certain financial instruments, and remains nascent at best. The quest to engineer financial hedge products for non-traditional product classes is well exemplified in the search for electronic component hedges, which search can be seen as an archetype for many diverse products and services in a plurality of industries.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Twin Cities Board of Trade, and The Pacific Stock Exchange have been among the exchanges to try to develop futures and option products for such goods as electronic components. In each instance they have tried and failed, or have abandoned the efforts without launch.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Similarly, Enron tried to launch DRAM futures but failed, as predicted by Needham &#x26; Co. analyst Dan Scovel. &#x201c;The problem is that DRAMs are an unstable commodity that undergoes a wide variety of fundamental product changes over time,&#x201d; Scovel said. &#x201c;We believe the inherent instability of the offering renders forward contracts impractical.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the most part, forward pricing that does exist consists of commitments between manufacturers and users to buy according to build schedules, a traditional method and relationship that are far from what most financial engineers think of when they discuss forward markets. Reports in the electronics industry press that cite a forward pricing market are often misleading in that what is most often being referred to as a forward price is simply a broker's &#x201c;best guess&#x201d; as to where components prices will be in some number of days, weeks, or months in the future. Thus, rather than a forward or future price as meant by the financial community, what is usually being spoken of as a forward pricing market is actually a type of price forecasting or speculation that is little different from when stock analysts prognosticate on the likely price of IBM in six months time. Initiatives by certain chip manufacturers to sell production capacity &#x201c;forward&#x201d; have met with limited success. A market of very limited scope for options on some individual products exists, but the market is largely unreliable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recent efforts by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to launch futures on DRAM, even with their use of industry experts and consultations with major manufacturers in the work on the contract development, have met with many complaints. At least for the setting of a contract specification, several DRAM manufacturers have qualified for delivery on a proposed specification but industry responses to the product remain mixed, with some believing the market acceptance will be too thin, that the delivery set is too narrow, and that there is still a lack of fungibility. The contract launch has been repeatedly postponed and is still yet to be launched. Many in the industry continue to predict the SGX and other contracts will fail. A similar effort by the Semiconductor Futures Exchange to launch futures on the DRAM, which was chosen by the Semiconductor Futures Exchange because DRAM is &#x201c;well specified by part number and type&#x201d;, is also being greeted by skepticism.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The historical reasons for expecting failure in DRAM futures contract trading, and by extension failure in other similar derivative contracts remain in place. Liquidity in cash products can be spotty. Variations in pin counts, packaging and product performance specifications (and how they are obtained) can give the impression of lack of fungibility and, in the absence of a repurchase and reverse repurchase market, the liquidity patterns in the futures contracts (and other derivatives) will be unreliable due to incompleteness in hedging opportunity. While both the Singapore Exchange and Semiconductor Futures Exchange claim to have solved fungibility problems with DRAM, arguably amongst the most highly fungible semiconductor products, for other electronics components the contract design problems for hedge products remain seemingly intractable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0055886 for System And Method For Maintaining And Utilizing Component Cross Reference Data In An Exchange System discloses a method for normalization of computer part and numbers, and &#x201c;Part Number Normalization,&#x201d; a White Paper by River One, explores this idea from a slightly different approach.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The '886 patent application and the White Paper provide ideas for relating electronics components by part numbers, as they are defined internally by equipment manufacturers and by the component manufacturers themselves, in an internally consistent hierarchy of logical equivalency. The method differs from high level generic fungibility because equipment manufacturers define the parts of different manufacturers as fungible to their own particular needs, (often to the level of a specific build in a product class), and assign a system of internal part numbers which are associated with specific manufacturer part numbers. In the '886 application, the internal part numbers of one component user are related to the part numbers of individual component manufactures and to the internal part numbers of other component users to create lists of possibly interchangeable parts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While a certain amount of the above can be inferred by examining and comparing printed specifications, a major effort by manufacturers goes toward defining fungibility according to uses of the parts and is the result of the impetus for rigorous suitability-to-purpose testing by engineers. This kind of a suitability certification is designed to provide for alternative parts where they exist (e.g., to preclude production line shut downs that can and do occur as a result of shortages in a particular part, whether due to manufacturer failures to deliver or an absence of supply in the spot market). It is an unpleasant reality for computer manufacturers, for example, that the lack of a single $0.05 capacitor could close down an entire production facility. These substitution designations are essential to maintaining operating production lines, the loss of which is of such criticality to company health as to justify the high expense of testing and certification for suitable substitutes whenever they exist. In fact, this expensive effort can be viewed as a form of &#x201c;build insurance.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Prior to these and similar comparison regimes, a search for alternatives using specification lists might show no suitable substitution candidates or require extensive research. But under this methodology, a part that might seem non-fungible from a specification sheet could be revealed to be fungible in a particular situation. For example, in a product requiring a component with a response time of 30 microseconds and an operating voltage range of 10 to 25 millivolts, a fungible component might be a similar device with a response time of less than 20 microseconds with an operating voltage of 15 to 20 millivolts, while a component operating at 30 microseconds or less in a voltage range of 5 to 10 millivolts would not be fungible because the operating voltage of the main product has a ten millivolt lower bound.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Similarly, once a substitute has been identified on the basis of response time and voltage boundaries, vibration tolerances might enter the substitution sort. Thus, a product requiring a high vibration tolerance would have a different set of suitable components than a low vibration tolerance product. Further, there can be additional individual specifications such as date codes, shock, and temperature tolerance to define fungibility by use. Standard data sheets, and databases comparing standard data sheets, likely will not produce the desired results. Similarly, many of the web sites that specialize in electronic component tracking and comparisons are limited by the fact that they are only making substitutability suggestions, not certifications. A prototypical method for automating the search for components is described in &#x201c;Component Advisor: A Tool for Automatically Extracting Electronic Component Data from Web Datasheets&#x201d;, published by Hewlett-Packard Laboratories.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The capacity of a computer-based database system and computerized methods to establish functional equivalence between seemingly unrelated parts, and thereby define degrees of fungibility in terms of their application, opens to development the possibility for active and liquid trading in financial products of all types for the electronics industry, as well as for other goods and services where substitutability or interchangeability either exists, or is developing but is not necessarily apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, the creation of financial products enhance the liquidity of trade in the cash market by allowing for easy borrowing and lending (under repurchase and reverse repurchase methods) from a defined subset or entire set of fungible parts to underpin short selling. Such short selling is requisite to efficient hedging of financial products by dealers and traders, and the development of short selling itself is dependant on the ability to borrow inventory which is sold so delivery can be made even when the subject inventory is not yet owned. This borrowing function is typically supported by the financial mechanism of &#x201c;repurchase&#x201d; and &#x201c;reverse repurchase&#x201d;. Repurchase and reverse repurchase can be defined as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Repurchase&#x2014;A customer sells an asset and receives cash with the intent and obligation of buying the asset back, usually at the same price with an interest rate based cost attached to the transaction (hence the term &#x201c;repurchase agreement&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reverse Repurchase&#x2014;A customer buys an asset and releases cash with the intent and obligation of returning the asset for the cash, at an arranged price with an interest rate based profit attached to the transaction (hence the term &#x201c;reverse repurchase agreement&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Repurchase agreements are typically referred to as &#x201c;repo&#x201d; and Reverse repurchase is typically referred to as &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; or &#x201c;reverse repo&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">There are many repo structures that are variations on a theme, but typical to most of them is that the sale/buy back is collateralized by liquid assets, making repurchase an efficient and low cost method of financing holdings and providing inventory for short sellers to deliver against their sales. It is the method of repo that drives much liquidity in the US Treasury debt and stock markets, for example, and repo and reverse are businesses in their own right earning significant sums of money for banks and securities houses.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In contrast to the below approach of the present invention, consider the very different methods of identifying securities by using a Committee on Uniform Securities Identification number (CUSIP). Under the CUSIP system, each individual security has an individual CUSIP number associated with that security and that security only, much as manufacturers assign part numbers to production. Under the methods of the above mentioned '866 application, each manufacturer part number is related to a user's internal part number and the internal part numbers of multiple users are compared and related to suggest interchangeability. Under this methodology, multiple seemingly non-equivalent parts can be assigned a universal part number, but that &#x201c;universal&#x201d; part number identifies only a possible match and a given related part may not work in a specific application. Further, among the differences that separate a part equivalency numbering system from a CUSIP system is that the definitions of equivalency are subject to change according to testing, use, and preference criteria. In fact, under a part equivalency numbering system, an end user can simply refuse to recognize a given part as interchangeable with an originally specified part. CUSIP identifications are not negotiable or flexible, market participants can not refuse to recognize the designated security they define and they do not represent sets of fungible products in the manner contemplated by the subject invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The subject invention is directed to a system and method for the creation of financial products and inventory optimization. Among the financial products are repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, warehouse receipts, futures, forwards, options, structured notes, indices, securities, options, and swaps, particularly mesoeconomic and macroeconomic swaps. Preferably, the system and method of the subject invention may be computer aided.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To facilitate discussion of the concepts in the subject invention from this point forward in the application, the following terms, subject to later additional specific definition, are introduced and used:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Quasi-Fungible: The degree to which an alternative item is interchangeable with a Reference item (or a user-conditioned version of a Reference item) given a particular use, specification or set of specifications for the Reference item, such that the element of quasi-fungibility is defined in terms of a measure of inter-changeability for a good/service/event/outcome or combination thereof on a scale of 0 to 1.00 where 0 means non-fungible and 1.00 means totally fungible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Quasi-Anti-Fungible: The degree to which an item is &#x201c;anti-&#x201d; in concept to a Reference item (or a user conditioned version of a Reference item) given a particular use, specification or set of specifications, such that the element of quasi-anti-fungibility is defined in terms of a measure of the degree to which an alternative to a Reference contains antidotes, antithetical affects, reciprocals, mirrors, counter-agents, neutralizers or nullifiers of at least one specification/use of that Reference. The measure of quasi-anti-fungibility of an alternative item with respect to a Reference item (or user-conditioned version of a Reference item), given a particular use, specification or set of specifications, is defined on a scale of &#x2212;1.00 to 0, where &#x2212;1.00 means totally anti-fungible and 0 means non-anti-fungible.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, in the interest of enhancing readability, the term quasi-fungible shall incorporate the term quasi-anti-fungible except where use of the term quasi-fungible explicitly excludes it and in cases where the language refers specifically to quasi-anti-fungibility and the quasi-anti-fungibility Reference Conditioning Operator {circumflex over (M)}.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The subject invention also includes a method for using a computer to make a financial product, the method including the steps of: inputting data specifying respective uses of respective goods, services, events or outcomes; determining, from said data, whether some of said products are quasi-fungible goods, services, events or outcomes; forming a set of some of said products, the set including at least one member identified by said determining step; and creating a financial product from at least some of the set. The method can be carried out by further including the steps of: forming a second set of some of said products, the second set including at least one member identified by said determining step; and wherein the step of creating a financial product includes: creating a financial product from a union of the first set and the second set. The method can further include the steps of: forming a third set of some of said products, the third set including at least one member identified by said determining step; and wherein the step of creating a financial product can include: creating a financial product from a union of the third set with said union of the first set and the second set. The operations that are to be performed for relating the sets and subsets thereof are not limited to unions, but also include intersections, products, compliments and all other allowable operations including Boolean and other mathematical manipulations and operations.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The step of creating a financial product can include the steps of: forming a macro or meso financial product from the union of all three sets; and forming a financial product from the union of the first set and the second set. Any of the foregoing can be carried out with capital goods, goods, and/or services as the products. Also in any of the foregoing, the step of forming a financial product can include forming a repurchase agreement, a reverse repurchase agreement or any of a plurality of financial products and derivatives. The subject invention also encompasses trading and systems therefore, pertaining to said financial products, as well as forming and maintaining a hedging index.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">From another perspective, the subject invention can be characterized as a method for using a computer to make a financial product, the method including the steps of: inputting data specifying respective uses of respective products; determining, from said data, whether some of said products are quasi-fungible products; forming a set of some of said products, the set including at least one member identified by said determining step; and creating a financial product from at least some of the set. Such a method can be carried out by further including the steps of: forming a second set of some of said products, the second set including at least one member identified by said determining step; and wherein the step of creating a financial product includes: creating a financial product from a union of the first set and the second set. Any of the foregoing can be carried out by further including the steps of: forming a third set of some of said products, the third set including at least one member identified by said determining step; and wherein the step of creating a financial product includes: creating a financial product from a union of the third set with said union of the first set and the second set. Any of the foregoing can be carried out such that the step of creating a financial product includes the steps of: forming a financial product from the union of all three sets; and forming a financial product from the union of the first set and the second set. As mentioned above, the foregoing can be carried out with capital and other goods and/or services as the products.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The subject invention includes a system and method for using a computer and database to relate seemingly disparate items such as electronic components, industrial components, sub assemblies, assemblies and finished products; medical equipment and its associated services, define their quasi-fungibility and interchangeability for purposes of creating, trading and managing or hedging repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements (repo and reverse) and other collateralized and non-collateralized financial products; constructing, trading and managing or hedging indices based on such products; and pricing, originating, hedging, and trading derivative and other financial products based thereon. The subject invention includes a system and method for defining quasi-fungible and quasi-anti-fungible for diverse products and services using a computer, input and output device and a database. The subject invention includes relating components, components of sub assemblies, assemblies and finished products as well as the sub-assemblies, assemblies and finished products themselves, as well as services, events and outcomes to each other across diverse product lines. The subject invention contemplates relating such products, services, events and outcomes so that their independent quasi-fungible elements can be identified and defined in terms of sets of components, assemblies, sub-assemblies and finished products and/or services, events and outcomes, alone or in combination, that are interchangeable within a specific industry and across diverse industries and individual product lines and services within an industry. By using a database to assign degrees of quasi-fungibility to multiple goods, products and services (&#x201c;products&#x201d;), the subject invention encompasses a taxonomy for coding the products and or services, events and outcomes according to quasi-fungibility.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, the subject invention includes relating components of assemblies, sub assemblies and finished products as well as services to each other across diverse industries as defined by a database such as or similar to the National Initiative for Supply Chain Integration (NISCI) industrial classification index, insurance industry classification criteria and similar compilations of goods and services according to standard and non-standard criteria. The subject invention spans calculating the value of related components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and finished products and services such that their value including incidental costs is determined, as well as tying quasi-fungible services to quasi-fungible goods such that the bundle of such services is recognized by the appropriate industry as quasi-fungible. Further, such bundles may also be quasi-anti-fungible.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Related computing is also encompassed, including a warehouse system for storing physical items identified as quasi-fungible and for issuing receipts thereon and promoting the trading thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The system and method of the subject invention can use at least one of a plurality of databases for defining related services, events, outcomes, components of assemblies, sub-assemblies and finished products (as well as the assemblies, sub-assemblies and finished products themselves) to each other across diverse product lines and industries such that their quasi-fungible elements can be defined to create sets of such goods and services that are interchangeable to a use. Each of these sets and subsets can be potentially used as an underlying or deliverable set of a financial instrument to support financial product development. The databases in conjunction with the subject invention can also be used to relate specific products and sub-products that are quasi-fungible and their associated quasi-fungible services, events and outcomes such that they can be interrelated further to hedge total (or close to total) product margins, enterprise values and the components thereof to structure mesoeconomic and macroeconomic swaps. The databases can also be used to relate specific products and sub-products that are quasi-fungible and their associated quasi-fungible services, such that they can be used in collateralized structures such as repo either singly or as bundles. Utilizing the databases, the sets and subsets defined above can be related such that the pricing of a product build can be related to the individual components, assemblies and subassemblies to define and hedge a profit margin for an entire product, especially when combined with service hedges and hedges for interest rates, currencies and other similar traditional hedge products. Thus, the subject invention permits defining elastic and rigid delivery sets for underlying derivative structures such that the components therein replicate the returns of other futures and options (or not) to maximize or minimize tracking. The structuring of sets described above can be carried out such that they can be used as the basis for securities, funds, trusts, and similar products as well as in insurance. Specifically contemplated by the subject invention is the creation of null sets which can be used to create financial products such as, but not limited to, derivatives, insurance and contingent payoff products based on the non-occurrence or non-existence of any reference or alternative good, service, event or outcome, on either standalone or combination bases.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Regarding the financial products created according to the subject invention, the analysis of, and transactions involving, these financial products is also within the scope of the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Per the foregoing and in accordance with the broad implications of the subject invention, it is now possible to relate seemingly disparate items such as electronic or industrial components, sub assemblies, assemblies and finished products, as well as services such as radiology, define their quasi-fungibility and interchangeability for purposes of creating, trading and managing or hedging repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements (repo and reverse) and other collateralized and non-collateralized financing contracts; construct, trade and manage or hedge indices based on such products; and price, originate, hedge, and trade primary, derivative and other financial products based thereon. The terms &#x201c;product&#x201d; or &#x201c;products&#x201d; shall include &#x201c;good&#x201d; or &#x201c;goods&#x201d;, &#x201c;service&#x201d; or &#x201c;services&#x201d;. Further, the invention shall be construed to apply to tangible and intangible items.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When creating financial products tied to a base of quasi-fungible underlying instruments with the subject invention, unlike with wheat, corn or sugars, the definition of fungibility is tied not just to substitution specifications but to specific use, specifications as they relate to the specific use, and on-going programs of certification. Thus, the commoditization process that is the holy grail of financial engineers is divorced from seeking homogeneity within the product class (a uniform type of DRAM or a single type of capacitor, for example) and is instead shifted to all of the different types of DRAM or other applicable components that will work within a specific application. The above eliminates or reduces the often cited reason for not developing financial products in many sectors: too much apparent variation and too much change.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Under the subject invention, financial product design for a futures contract, pricing or activity index, option, forward or swap would thus be constructed based on DRAM (or other products or services) as it applies to specific builds. This will allow for financial product development that is wide enough in certain applications, say personal computer and mobile phone production, to meet the minimum liquidity criteria to provide reliable hedging. Other users could still hedge in this circumstance, but the hedge would be more subject to tracking error.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The practical reality of service substitution is clear. Migration of industrial production services to competing countries is well described, such as in the case of textiles, cars, and other products. Even when there is to be extensive capital investment, such services can be highly mobile and subject to competitive bidding based on a range of advantages, including law, location, taxes, and currency controls. In fact standardization of these specifications has been a major drive of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Similar harmonization efforts are occurring throughout Europe. Given levels of standardization to norms within a particular industry, such services can serve as sets for financial product development to hedge the risk components of the manufacturing and service base regardless of where they are located.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">One embodiment of the subject invention for a set of services can be illustrated by the cost driven migration of &#x201c;basic&#x201d; legal services, first from high cost cities such as New York to lower cost cities such as Houston and Minneapolis, and even from the United States entirely to other English speaking countries, such as Australia which has a similar juris prudence. The contracting for such services requires the &#x201c;oversight&#x201d; by a U.S. based attorney, a concept not entirely different from engineer certification of substitutable parts. The emerging set of suitable firms would comprise a set of legal services from which sets could be created depending on a specialty or a specific need such as multilingual warranty documents. Index development from these types of sets, as well as derivative products based on them, are within the scope of the subject invention regarding financial product development.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Similarly, migrations of data processing for the insurance industry to data centers in Ghana, and of software development&#x2014;at first to India and now to other countries such as Vietnam&#x2014;are additional examples of service substitution. Native language would play a role in the development of certain sets, but not in others, ranging from high (legal) to middling (software) and low (typesetting) importance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Envision a circumstance where an x-ray taken in New York City is read by board certified radiologist in another location&#x2014;even outside the United States&#x2014;as a means of providing cost sensitive standardized services. In fact, x-rays are often sent to remote locations in telemedicine programs as a matter of increasing routine. Complex surgical procedures, while not common, have been successfully performed with robotics from remote locations. One can thus contemplate the folding of dispersed medical services into US insurance company Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) programs for reimbursement, not just by local community standards, but by performance certification in relation to place as well. DRG protocols, which homogenize payment and medical services, provide standardization protocols for payments but do not define the basic elements for the creation of useful hedge products for inpatient medical services. Ambulatory Visit Group (AVG) protocols provide similar price and service standardization for medical care applied to out patients with similar result. Similarly, standardization protocols for Durable Medical Equipment (DME), produces a similar result in an infrastructure aspect of medical care. Under the current invention, elements of these classification systems for payment can be combined in aggregates to define sectors and components of medical care which can be hedged and traded. Under the invention herein, financial products for bulk buyers and sellers of medical services become a reality, with substitution sets defined by locale, level of certification and supply. A company health insurance plan can consult the database to hedge selected service needs above actuarial minimum amounts by forward contracting or using options to buy required medical services as they are defined in terms of interchangeability. This also allows for the creation of broad indices and sector subsets of at least some important sectors of medical care (starting with less geographically sensitive ones, such as radiology). Practical indices will allow for the creation of additional hedge products and this in turn will allow insurance companies to create additional insurance and re-insurance products. But in the absence of tradable hedges, this leaves the un-hedged loss potential as effectively unlimited, a major deterrent to many participants. Insurance derivatives as proposed under the current invention will have associated with them certain underlying tradable instruments, alleviating at least part of the aforementioned impediments.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Given a definition for the interchangeability of services and the capacity to create databases of such quasi-fungible services, sophisticated financial product development using the methods of the present invention are also contemplated herein. Thus, a hedge for the build of electronic durable medical equipment (DME) can be combined with hedges for reimbursement of the usage of the DME as well as the services tied to it (radiologist interpretation, for example). Such increasingly complete hedge capability is a requirement for the construction of meso- and macro-economic swaps as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In yet another embodiment of the subject invention, a computer manufacturer could approach a dealer in computer parts for assistance in pricing and hedging a build of any Tier 1 brand of personal computer. The dealer would look at a list of parts by category and number, consult the databases, and determine sets of candidate alternative parts. The designated parts would be processed through the subject invention to yield a set or sets of candidate alternative parts. From this list of sets of parts derived from the quasi-fungibility sets (which can also be called a quasi-fungible basket), a forward hedge, whether discrete or amortizing to a production drawdown of inventory, would be priced based on the specific parts and their quasi-fungible alternatives in the quasi-fungible basket. The dealer could then offer to the manufacturer a price hedge for an entire computer build or simply sub-segments thereof (such as Form A mother boards) as the dealer and manufacturer agree. The dealer can hedge his forward commitments with offsetting positions in the cash market, with other forward dealers, and parts manufacturers to name just a few possibilities using repo mechanisms possible under the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, in another embodiment of the subject invention, shared inventory information and drawdown algorithms allow dealers and manufacturers to borrow specific parts or groups of parts for financing under &#x201c;repo&#x201d; and &#x201c;reverse repo&#x201d; regimes according to quasi-fungibility. Such &#x201c;repo&#x201d; and &#x201c;reverse repo&#x201d; borrowing and lending would, under this embodiment, allow for the establishment of true short positions by market participants.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The establishment of such short positions will add a liquidity dimension to the market place that is currently lacking. Under this embodiment, a dealer wishing to guarantee a manufacturer a price on excess part inventory liquidation at the end of a build (or against specification revisions) can sell equivalent parts in the cash market against the forward commitment to buy the excess inventory. Such a dealer commitment could alternatively take the form of an option to purchase or sell inventory in the future which the dealer would be able to hedge in the cash market with a short or long position in any interchangeable cash component in the agreed hedge set using standard methodologies developed for trading options on securities and other more standard financial products.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An &#x201c;option&#x201d; is defined as the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified item or set of items under specified terms at some future date. In the instant invention, the flexibility offered by general option structures will allow users of the invention to provide high economic value to hedgers at reduced risk, if properly implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The size of the envisioned hedge sets of fungible products and services (and their assemblies and sub-assemblies) vary in the subject invention by the type of goods and/or services, events and outcomes, but allow for creation of subsets of products applicable to other uses. The sets for mobile phones will also include subsets with some overlap for avionics applications, for example. Variations in set size and application overlap enable complex arbitrage between the various sets and differences in composition between them. Further, combinations of the sets contemplated in the present invention with more traditional hedge products such as interest rate, currency and metal financial products should allow for hedging of much, even if not all, of the risk inherent in the production of a computer or other device. Thus, sets for motherboards (e.g., Form A), hard drives (with subsets for the individual components thereof), DRAM, cables, connectors, capacitors, diodes and circuit boards, can be combined with a set, or group of sets, for intangibles such as the sets for quasi-fungible labor and quasi-fungible legal expenses, and then further combined with capital cost hedges (such as interest rate and currency products), insurance hedges, and catastrophe hedges (such as earthquake and fire insurance) to create hedges of important risk components contained in production runs for many product categories.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, in another embodiment of the subject invention, a futures exchange seeking to provide a hedge product can consult the database to determine sets of quasi-fungible parts (or services, events and outcomes) that can either individually or collectively constitute an economically important set, whether based on dollar volume of trade, labor and even political impact. For example, a set of capacitors, to name one part class, can be identified as quasi-fungible for products ranging from mobile phones, computers, radar, and navigational equipment. The economic base of this set, which could include tantalum and ceramic capacitors, would likely be of greater economic significance for hedging purposes (and thus likely more successful) than alternative single-type capacitor financial product structures. Further, such a deliverable set (or pricing set) enables smaller hedge contracts (e.g., specific to mobile phones). Pricing variations and independent movement of individual components of each set and subset of the hedge product allow for elaborate arbitrage, further increasing overall market liquidity.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In financial products related to items such as bonds, the set of deliverable instruments underpinning a futures contract, for example, contains multiple deliverable issues. The rational for such a deliverable set was to prevent price manipulation of the derivative through control (or other shortage) of a single (or limited) cash instrument. This set usually contains one cheapest-to-deliver item. Outside of US Treasury instruments, the cheapest-to-deliver is often the least desirable component of the deliverable set, often as a result of credit in the case where there are multiple credits contained in the set. The capacity to deliver undesirable instruments has made difficult some derivative contracts, notably Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) bond contracts and municipal bonds. In the case of deliverable sets for many of the product classes in the subject invention, consumption of a certified good (and or service, as well as termination of an event or resolution of an outcome) will reduce or eliminate dumping aspects that can mar other financial products that have deliverable sets. The possibilities for dumping with services are more complex and credit will be important.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Various &#x201c;total product&#x201d; hedges (such as computers, mobile phones, and radar) made by a single manufacturer enable hedges approaching enterprise hedges. Under the subject invention, returns implied in hedges for various component products and service products, alone or in tandem with finished goods hedges, can be linked to industry, economy sub-sector, or economy-wide production indices to produce practical methods for isolating or assuming risk and the associated returns in sector hedges and swaps.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sum of product hedges in an industry built from the individual hedges on tangible and intangible goods and services allows for the creation of mesoeconomic hedges, which would hedge the sector between microeconomic hedges and macroeconomic hedges. Mesoeconomic hedges, when combined with more traditional micro-hedges, such as those for interest rates, raw and refined materials, equities and equity indices, and currencies, will foster the development of viable macroeconomic hedges.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, in another embodiment of the subject invention, a trader/hedger assumes a risk profile reflecting some proportion of production of a given product using the described set hedge method as part of the &#x201c;book&#x201d;. The trader can then swap or trade the return contained in the hedges with another market participant willing to assume the opposite position on the total return on industry production or a sector thereof including, or not, the service sectors applicable thereto. Thus, a dealer might have a short position in generic computer components and products which he/she hedges with an offsetting position in the stock of one or more Whitebox Manufacturers or an index of Whitebox manufacturers. Hedge portfolios (a.k.a. hedge books) such as the ones described herein will, when combined with swap books in other products, gradually move towards mirrors of Gross Domestic Product, (GDP) or similar indices and sub-indices thereof This migration will facilitate natural takers of both sides of the hedge, the current lack of which is a major impediment to development of hedge products based on such indices. Hedges of this nature will likely be of interest to managers of stock portfolios.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Such arbitrage is ideally suited to computer-based trading systems because the arbitrage is complex and requires moment-to-moment pricing calculations, which are based not just on the individual components, but on such issues as logistics as well.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">By discussing electronic components, subassemblies and assemblies, including intermediate and finished products, the idea of rationalizing parts by their application in building subassemblies, assemblies and finished goods is by no means to be construed as being limited to this area alone; entire manufacturing and processing industries that are currently without either a rationalization process for components and/or services or financial products for hedging price risk and financing inventory are hereby opened as well. The products and services mentioned herein are only for illustrating the system of the subject invention. Linking parts or other items by internal part numbers, manufacturers' part numbers, universal part numbers, SKU numbers or Boolean structured comparisons of performance and physical specifications are just illustrative of the taxonomic schema possible for creating the sets of quasi-fungible items contemplated in implementing the subject invention. Because vulnerability to production shut downs for lack of a single part or service can occur in almost any industry, but especially in a production line industry, the broad application of the subject invention is evident.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A non-limiting example of the hardware components in accordance with the system and method of the subject invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The subject invention is preferably implemented using a client-server architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where the clients communicate with the server and databases by means of either a secure private network or by means of VPN-secured Internet connectivity <b>110</b>. The clients are allocated to a user who is an originator of financial products based on quasi-fungible GSEO <b>130</b> and a plurality of subscribers <b>140</b> and <b>150</b>. In at least one embodiment, the subscribers may be, but are not limited to, corporate treasurers, purchasing agents and procurement managers and more than one subscriber-user within a subscription is implied and contemplated. The depicted network is preferably implemented using Pentium 4 class Intel central processor based PC and laptop computers having at least 512 MB of random access memory, a 20 GB hard drive and Internet/network connectivity known in the art as clients using the Microsoft Windows&#x2122; Operating System. Client software is preferably implemented using Microsoft Visual C++ .Net&#x2122;, preferably built using the Microsoft Visual Studio.Net&#x2122; Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The application servers are clusters of Sun Microsystems Sun Fire&#x2122; servers <b>102</b> using the Solaris&#x2122; Operating System. Application server software is preferably implemented using J2EE or C++ depending upon the preferences and skills available to a system operator. Because large portions of the application are vector and matrix multiplication intensive, hardware acceleration by means of an array processor would be part of a preferred implementation for large scale systems <b>103</b>. The plurality of databases referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as internal databases, which includes a database of inventory optimizations using quasi-fungibility based taxonomies <b>104</b>, a database of system libraries <b>106</b>, and a database of quasi-fungibility based financial products and elements thereof <b>108</b>, are collocated with the cluster of application servers. The database of inventory optimizations using quasi-fungibility based taxonomies <b>104</b> may either be centralized and collocated with the cluster of application servers and securely partitioned for each subscriber, or physically distributed to respective subscribers' data-centers if required by a subscriber's scale, MIS/IT policies, security needs, for example. Databases of goods, services, events and outcomes (GSEO) <b>120</b>, including the database servers <b>122</b> and data storage <b>124</b>, may be collocated with the application servers or located remotely, and use XML data formats.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the logic overview of the subject invention is shown and described. Originator of Financial Products Based on Quasi-Fungible Goods/Services/Outcomes/Events (GSEOs) <b>200</b> uses the Financial Instrument Machine (FIM) (Computer Assisted System and Method for Creating Financial Products and Inventory Optimizations Based on Quasi-Fungible GSEOs) <b>210</b> to create quasi-fungibility based financial products and inventory optimizations. Subscriber <b>200</b> to Financial Instrument Machine Services uses the Financial Instrument Machine (FIM) <b>200</b> to have symbiotic inter-relationship with FIM users and other subscribers to optimize inventory and benefit from primary and ancillary services related to financial product development, utilization and inventory optimizations. Market Dynamics <b>230</b> consists of market data flows containing prices, corporate actions, news and related information of interest to users and subscribers as part of their decision making and evaluation protocols. Such input is tied to the Financial Instrument Machine <b>200</b> and to the plurality of user and subscriber GSEO sites/datacenters <b>380</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>380</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>380</b>.M of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which shows a more detailed logic schema of the subject invention, are user and subscriber GSEO sites/datacenters <b>380</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>380</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>380</b>.M provide physical and virtual storage, documentation, manipulation and supply of goods/services/events/outcomes. Not all events and outcomes are under user or subscriber control or creative capability, though some clearly would be. Examples not meant to be limiting of events under a user control could be a strike, but an earthquake probably would not be user or subscriber controlled. The outcome of a strike and earthquake both might be a shortage of supply, so it follows that in the event of a strike at least one outcome is under partial user influence and control (but not totally since human hoarding behavior is difficult to predict) while the same outcome in the event of an earthquake is not under user or subscriber control. The nature of items in a site for physical and virtual storage will vary widely by user and subscriber type and a particular client workstation within an organization. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, among a non-limiting plurality of possible subscriber-users (hereafter &#x201c;subscribers&#x201d;) who gain access by subscription and similar &#x201c;term-and condition&#x201d; restrictions are Corporate Treasurers, Procurement Managers, Purchasing Agents, Inventory Control Specialists, Product Engineers and Developers, Union Organizers, Database Managers, Insurers, and Actuaries.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The computer-assisted system and method for the Financial Instrument Machine <b>210</b> starts at <b>300</b>, with a user inputting data <b>320</b>, that specifies a Reference Good/Service/Event/Outcome (GSEO) &#x3be;, along with a domain-of-interest identifier D, an initial constraint set &#x3a6;<sub>0</sub>, an initial minimum quasi-fungibility threshold &#x3c8;<sub>0</sub>, an initial emphasis scoring matrix E<sub>0</sub>, and (optionally) a Self-Adaptive Conditioning Operator A and Quasi-Anti-Fungibility Conditioning Operator {circumflex over (M)} at <b>310</b>. One possible Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate this selection process is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for phi and E as discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The Financial Instrument Machine <b>210</b> queries at <b>330</b> a database of goods, services, events and outcomes (GSEO) <b>370</b> through an intervening domain-of-interest filter <b>360</b> which focuses a search and a retrieval to a domain-of-interest D. In one preferred embodiment, a search and retrieval could be a domain-of-interest comprising all capacitors, or all tantalum capacitors, or all tantalum capacitors designed for application in mobile telephone handsets, or all tantalum capacitors designed for high altitude avionics. A database of GSEO(s) is also referred to in this document as a database of candidate alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The database <b>370</b> of candidate alternatives is connected to user and subscriber sites/datacenters of quasi-fungible GSEO(s) 380.1, 380.2, 380.M. In this manner, a plurality of databases of candidate alternatives can be kept current to reflect market usage, <b>230</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, financial product development <b>210</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and inventory optimizations using quasi-fungibility based taxonomies <b>550</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A user <b>350</b>, may direct a database query process by interactively adjusting at <b>340</b> a domain-of-interest identifier D, a constraint set &#x3a6;, minimum quasi-fungibility threshold &#x3c8;, Self-adaptability Reference Conditioning Operator A, Programmability Reference Conditioning Operator P and Quasi-anti-fungibility Reference Conditioning Operator {circumflex over (M)} so as to produce a manageable number of evaluated and qualified candidate alternative(s) &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>at an output of a quasi-fungibility evaluator <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">After a Reference &#x3be; is specified, a candidate alternative evaluation process begins by first checking satisfaction of constraint sets &#x3a6; and threshold &#x3c8; at <b>390</b> and then evaluating quasi-fungibility at <b>400</b> for each of initially unevaluated quasi-fungible candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>retrieved from a database at <b>330</b>. Blocks <b>390</b> and <b>400</b> together comprise the Primary Quasi-Fungibility Module <b>385</b> further discussed below. The Primary Quasi-Fungibility Module <b>385</b> may optionally access the Secondary Optimization Module <b>387</b>. This process either qualifies or disqualifies each retrieved quasi-fungible candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>for further processing. Each qualified candidate alternative, either alone or in or combinatory subsets with others, forms a building block for a financial product and/or an inventory optimization. (Reference &#x3be; and null subsets may be inserted as additional building blocks as needed, as is discussed in reference to user <b>450</b> below.) In at least one preferred embodiment of the subject invention a quasi-fungibility measurement function f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>) may take either of two general forms relating to use or application:</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, quasi-fungibility measurement functions used in a preferred embodiment are able to measure the fungibility between a user-conditioned or modified vector representation of the Reference and an unmodified vector representation of a j<sup>th </sup>candidate alternative good/service in the database, or even a modified vector representation of the potential candidates. Vector representations of a user-conditioned or modified Reference, with or without modifications to a vector representation of a j<sup>th </sup>candidate alternative good/service/event/outcome in the database, are used to direct system algorithms to produce financial products and inventory optimizations created around &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>that have special properties. These properties include, depending upon a user-conditioning of a Reference or modifications to both a Reference and candidate alternatives, the current (and possibly revised) emphasis on certain specifications/uses being scored by the user (see Glossary concerning f(E&#x3be;,E&#x3b6;<sub>i</sub>), a form of quasi-fungibility measurement function when an Emphasis Scoring Function E is used). These properties also include, depending upon a user-conditioning of a Reference, financial products and inventory optimizations in which the &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>are highly quasi-fungible with certain required specifications/uses where a Reference &#x3be; has been modified to reflect special circumstances (e.g. rain, floods, shortage).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further regarding Primary Quasi-Fungibility Optimization Module <b>385</b>, Check Constraint Set &#x3a6; and quasi-fungibility threshold &#x3c8; <b>390</b>, and Quasi-Fungibility Evaluator (QFE) <b>400</b>, after checking constraints per constraint set &#x3a6; and threshold levels via quasi-fungibility threshold &#x3c8;, for quasi-fungibility with respect to the Reference &#x3be;, quasi-fungibility is then evaluated for each of the potential candidates &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>retrieved from a database via a query at <b>330</b> on a first quasi-fungibility sort. Any quasi-fungible candidate alternatives which either do not meet said constraints or are insufficiently quasi-fungible (namely, have fungibility measures with absolute values less than &#x3c8;), are disqualified from further processing or candidacy for becoming the basis for a financial product and/or inventory optimization. Standard optimizations of candidate alternatives other than quasi-fungibility optimizations can be performed optionally at user direction in Secondary Optimization Module <b>387</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A decision is made at <b>410</b> as to whether any candidate alternative under consideration satisfies both Constraint Set &#x3a6; and Quasi-Fungibility Threshold &#x3c8;. If the decision is &#x201c;Yes&#x201d;, those candidate alternatives are defined as qualified and grouped as subset &#x3c7;<sub>q+1 </sub>at <b>430</b> and input into an Iterative Metric Subspace Generator <b>440</b>. If the decision is &#x201c;No&#x201d;, those candidate alternatives are defined as unqualified and &#x3c7;<sub>q+1 </sub>is set equal to a null subset at <b>420</b> and input into Iterative Metric Subspace Generator <b>440</b>. (Note: The set &#x3bd;<sub>0 </sub>where &#x3bd;<sub>0</sub>=&#xd8;, the null set, is typically entered into the iterative metric subspace generator as part of initializing the system. This is invariant as to whether or not in iterations greater than 0, the initialization, a return of sets from a search for candidate alternatives yields no qualified candidates and therefore produces a null set.) An iterative metric subspace generator typically contains all prior sets (&#x3bd;<sub>q</sub>, &#x3bd;<sub>q&#x2212;1</sub>, &#x3bd;<sub>q&#x2212;2</sub>, . . . &#x3bd;<sub>q&#x2212;n</sub>) and always receives set &#x3c7;<sub>q+1 </sub>as an input just before being invoked (entered). With a collection of all prior sets &#x3bd;<sub>q</sub>, and &#x3bd;<sub>q&#x2212;1 </sub>for l=1, 2, . . . , n and with user input <b>450</b> as to which set operations are to be performed, an iterative metric subspace generator produces and outputs set &#x3bd;<sub>q+1 </sub>of qualified &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>and combinatory subsets of &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>in a current set &#x3bd;<sub>q+1 </sub>of quasi-fungible candidate alternatives as candidates for creating financial products and inventory optimizations.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After producing and outputting set &#x3bd;<sub>q+1 </sub>the subject invention sets up an iterative subspace generator for a next iteration by performing a set union operation on the current &#x3bd;<sub>q+1 </sub>with all prior sets including the previous set &#x3bd;<sub>q</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a continuation of the logic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an iterative metric subspace generator functions to generate sets comprised of qualified quasi-fungible candidate alternatives and combinatory sub-sets of qualified quasi-fungible candidate alternatives to a Reference &#x3be; that serve as inputs to at least one Financial Product Machine (FPM) <b>470</b> and at least one of a plurality of Inventory Management Machines (IMM) <b>510</b> via a process that a user <b>460</b> can select to augment the current set &#x3bd;<sub>q+1</sub>, by inserting null subsets and Reference &#x3be; at block <b>455</b>. Tailoring of Financial Product creation with the FIM <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may require reprocessing through block <b>455</b> for augmentation as needed. At each iteration of an iterative metric subspace generator, a set of qualified quasi-fungible candidate alternatives and combinatory sub-sets thereof is designated as the current set &#x3bd;<sub>q+1 </sub>where q is always the iteration number minus 1. Therefore, after the first iteration, q+1=1 and after the second iteration q+1=2, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Under the direct control of the user <b>450</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and shaped by the user's personal judgments, the Iterative Metric Subspace Generator <b>440</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (IMSG) forms sets &#x3bd; of candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>(and combinatory subsets of candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>) to a Reference &#x3be;. These sets &#x3bd;, if accepted by the user, are used to form quasi-fungible financial products as described above and immediately below. In one preferred implementation, the operation and logic of the iterative metric subspace generator generates sets of quasi-fungible candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>, namely sets &#x3bd;<sub>q+1</sub>, &#x3bd;<sub>q+2</sub>, &#x3bd;<sub>q+3 . . . </sub>, from user defined combinations of standard logical operations (e.g. union, intersection and complement) on current candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>in combination with any (and potentially all) previous candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>contained in a set &#x3bd;<sub>p</sub>, where set &#x3bd;<sub>p </sub>is a logical union of all previous candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>input into an iterative metric subspace generator since the start of a current user session, and where all candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>in &#x3bd;<sub>p </sub>were sufficiently constrained with respect to the set of over-riding constraints &#x3a6;<sub>i </sub>and were sufficiently quasi-fungible with respect to Reference &#x3be;, meaning |f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>)|&#x2192;&#x3c8;<sub>i</sub>, according to the iteration i in which they were input to an iterative metric subspace generator. Because of the iterative nature of an iterative metric subspace generation process, after the current set of candidate alternatives &#x3bd;<sub>q+1 </sub>is generated and is sent on for further processing, a copy of it is included in the collection of all the previous sets of candidate alternatives, namely the set &#x3bd;<sub>p</sub>.

<p id="p-0103" num="0110">User interaction and control of respective one or more Inventory Management Machine(s) <b>510</b> which may have multiple view permissions within a single machine can vary widely from subscriber to subscriber and within a user organization. In one preferred embodiment to an Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b> subscriber-users are (1) members of a Treasury department <b>520</b> of a subscriber company using an Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b>, and (2) members of a Procurement Management department <b>530</b> of the same subscribing company using the same Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b> through another client workstation. It will be evident to one skilled in the art that, in addition to the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, IMM <b>510</b> to FIM <b>210</b> interactions and relationships in at least one preferred embodiment can also be across a completely distributed network involving a plurality of independent and competing users and subscribers operating informally in an over over-the-counter type of structure as well as in highly structured exchange environments. The two types of users of an Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b> described herein are not to be confused with a &#x201c;user&#x201d; (at <b>320</b>, <b>350</b>, <b>450</b>, <b>460</b>, <b>475</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> and <b>650</b>) who, in this description of a preferred embodiment, may be an originator of financial products such as a Financial Engineer or Dealer. There can be interchangeability of roles for users and subscribers depending upon the subscription type and a given subscriber's need to originate financial products and optimize inventory.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111">In certain circumstances, an originator of products will have need of the IMMs, <b>510</b> as is described in the examples, to design and hedge financial products. A Treasury department's <b>520</b> interactions with, and controls over, an Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b> in one preferred embodiment might consist of a treasurer seeking to maximize profit potential through contracting for, and constructing portfolios of, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, options, forwards and swaps, (among other financial products) based on quasi-fungible inventory, as is discussed in at least one example below. The Procurement Management department's <b>530</b> interactions with, and controls over, an Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b> in at least one preferred embodiment might consist of coordinating treasury operations and inventory management, optimizing purchases through possible negotiation between multiple suppliers of quasi-fungible inventory, reduction of shortage pressures through the identification of candidate alternatives and controlling inventory age with a quasi-fungible set and inventory swaps.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112">Outputs of one or more Inventory Management Machine(s) <b>510</b> can be optimizations of inventories using quasi-fungibility based taxonomies in which inventories of goods/services/events/outcomes are virtually or physically re-organized according to their quasi-fungibility from the perspective of the Financial Product Machine <b>470</b> and its user to support financial product development and hedging. In another preferred embodiment, outputs can also be optimizations for the Treasury <b>520</b> and Procurement <b>530</b> departments to facilitate company operations through receipt generation <b>560</b>, and decisions <b>570</b> relating to physical <b>590</b> and virtual <b>580</b> inventory operations.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113">Non-limiting among subscriber operations pertinent to one preferred embodiment are open market operations such as inventory liquidation and acquisition and protocols to organize available inventory for possible financial product participation (especially &#x201c;repo&#x201d; and &#x201c;reverse&#x201d;). Among possible inventory optimizations where efforts between a Treasurer <b>520</b> and a Procurement Manager <b>530</b> might be required is the issuance of inventory receipts <b>560</b>, whether actual <b>590</b> or virtual <b>580</b>, as part of a program of participating in repurchase agreements or other financial product development. In one preferred embodiment not meant to be limiting, an easily traded receipt for inventory could be preferable to actual movement of the items involved in a financial product transaction. In instances where ownership can be transferred without movement of the inventory, possible yields on financial products will rise as a result of lower costs. In instances where receipts are traded, participants may need to know whether receipts have expiration dates or are permanent and what rights are transferred therein since inventory provided by a receipt originator may be &#x201c;excess&#x201d; for only a relatively short period prior to being required for a production line. Many such concerns can be met by inventory fractional reserve analysis and protocols for production line consumption.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0141">Building Quasi-Fungibility Based Products Using Quasi-Fungible Methodologies</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0142">There are multiple approaches to building financial products using the subject invention. The term &#x201c;financial product&#x201d; includes without limitation all commercial transactions, such as the increased capacity to engage in trade, as well as vehicles that facilitate said commercial transactions, as well as insurance and wagering based on, enhanced and supported by, the subject invention. The following descriptions are meant to be examples, not limitations, on how the subject invention can be used to create financial products and inventory optimizations using services, inventory, events and outcomes either in a stand alone fashion or in combination. It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the examples that follow are templates that are extensible to industries, disciplines and circumstances other than those presented in the preferred embodiments herein.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0143">A generic repurchase agreement is a financial product based on well established methods in which a security is sold with an agreement to buy it back at a later time. The transaction is closed by reversing the process (reverse repo or reverse) and selling back the security to the original party for the cash plus an associated fee which is typically based on an interest rate and the value of the underlying security. The sale-buyback made against securities is generally unwound without an adjustment to the price of the purchase and sale, which feature keeps the transaction in the realm of basic financing. When the securities used in repo and reverse are highly liquid, the repo is treated like a money-market instrument. Many variations of this simple premise exist and will be known to one skilled in the art. In the context of a preferred embodiment of the subject invention, the capacity of a market place to engage in repo is enabled or broadened through use of the subject invention. One or more Reference &#x3be; and quasi-fungible alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>may serve in place of a &#x201c;security&#x201d; to support a repo transaction. Further, the subject invention supports repo transactions based solely upon GESO (goods/services/events/outcomes). The subject invention also supports expansion of basic commercial transactions in a way that facilitates broad repo. The illustrations that follow below begin with a basic purchase and sale of a service and build thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0144">1. Service Transactions</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0145">A simplified cash flow for a health care services provider for at least part of the radiology staffing and operating costs is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Patients <b>606</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> pay health insurance premiums to a Third Party Payment Protocol <b>600</b> which in turn pays the Health Care Services Provider <b>602</b> according to its payment protocol in response to reimbursement requests for services provided. The Health Care Services Provider (HCSP) <b>602</b> receives Co-payments and deductible amounts from the Patients <b>606</b> and in return provides services. HCSP <b>602</b> pays Radiology Services Department <b>606</b> operating costs, including radiologist salaries and honoraria and HCSP <b>602</b> receives radiological services.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0146">In this example of financial product development based on quasi-fungible goods, services, events, and outcomes (GSEO), Health Care Service Provider <b>602</b> desires to reduce overall costs and meet Radiology Services Department <b>606</b> radiologist staffing needs that are difficult to fill, especially on evenings, weekends and holidays. For assistance the HCSP contacts a Financial Products Dealer specializing in Health Care Services, hereafter called a Health Care Dealer <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to provide a solution.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0147">The financial engineers at Health Care Dealer <b>702</b> determine they can create financial products structured to reduce costs and increase HCSP operating margins relative to a known health care reimbursement provider under TTP Protocol <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A first step of financial product design is defining the underlying set of quasi-fungible radiology services that can be provided to the HCSP. HCSP <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> offers a full range of radiological services, but to test the program, it limits the task of Health Care Dealer <b>702</b> to providing competitive high quality radiology diagnostic services.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0148">The process begins with a search by Financial Engineers for qualified radiologists capable of providing HCSP specified services at <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and at <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with a definition of Domain-of-Interest D. From that point the detailed process continues per the earlier discussed Figures and descriptions above, which description is incorporated by reference and will not be restated for this example except as it clarifies the description below:</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0149">The Reference &#x3be; Domain of Interest is initially set as:</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0150">D=Health Care/Services/Radiology/Human/Diagnostic/Reading &#x26; Interpretation.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0151">The primary search constraints, &#x3a6;, are divided into categories.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0152">Defined as over-riding are legal requirements that each potential radiologist or radiology practice: 1) be licensed for professional practice in the originating HCSP jurisdiction, 2) be certified by a recognized Board of Radiology and, 3) be insured by a licensed insurance provider responsible to the originating HCSP geographical area. An initial search of the database must include these three over-riding constraints as Constraint set &#x3a6; since they are absolute qualifying specifications and &#x3a6; determines the absolute and binary requirements in qualifying candidate alternatives. An important analytical aspect in constructing a quasi-fungibility based financial product solution to the radiology staffing/services problem is that (for some services) radiologists can be located any distance from a given HCSP because digital images can be transmitted virtually anywhere for reading, diagnosis and reporting. Thus a range of geographical location is part of the initial search. Since the cost impact of the same service provided from different locations by different providers is significant, certain geographical areas are excluded from the search by setting &#x3c8; for location to a moderate level that is over-ridden by &#x3a6; with respect to certain locations to eliminate them.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0153">Thus, for this search for the example Reference &#x3be;:</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0154">D=Health Care Services/Radiology/Human/Diagnostic/Reading &#x26; Interpretation</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0155">&#x3a6;<sub>o</sub>=1) Licensed in HCSP location, 2) Radiology Board Certified, 3) insured by a licensed insurance provider responsible to the originating HCSP geographical area, 4) not in New York City, 5) not in Los Angeles, 6) MRI certified, 7) PET certified</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0156">&#x3c8;<sub>0</sub>=1) 100, 2) 100, 3) 100, 4) 75, 5) 50, 6) 60 7) 40</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0157">Additional quasi-fungibility conditions that filter the search form the entire constraint set &#x3a6; which may be quite large. Non-exhaustive examples of such constraints and use of Emphasis Scoring Function E are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0158">Part of the first search request specified &#x201c;Not New York City&#x201d; and &#x201c;Not Los Angeles&#x201d;, which nonetheless produced thousands of results in excess of user set search limits (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) being retrieved from the GSEO Sites and Datacenters <b>380</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>380</b>.<b>2</b> . . . <b>380</b>.M of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. To reduce the numbers of potential candidate alternatives to more manageable levels, in subsequent iterations of the search, quasi-fungibility measurement and subset generation processes controlled by &#x3a6; and &#x3c8; excluded all &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>in the Metropolitan New York and Metropolitan Los Angeles areas, and refined certain additional specifics of the service desired using the Circumstance-based Reference Conditioning Function C and the Emphasis Scoring Function E. The final iteration of the combined search, quasi-fungibility measurement and subset generation processes included a constraint that the estimated staffing needs be met for less than $100,000 per month, which produced the eight &#x3b6; replacement candidates {&#x3b6;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b6;<sub>2</sub>, &#x3b6;<sub>3</sub>, &#x3b6;<sub>4</sub>, &#x3b6;<sub>5</sub>, &#x3b6;<sub>6</sub>, &#x3b6;<sub>7 </sub>and &#x3b6;<sub>8</sub>}, for the Reference in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0159">Note that &#x3b6;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b6;<sub>8 </sub>(Shown as Cand. 1 and Cand. 8 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), contain event contingencies as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0160">Trade Bill S.2345 associated with &#x3b6;<sub>1 </sub>will restrict the ability to import medical services from India. A search of the event database produces no quasi-anti-fungible alternative event (or financial product responsive to such event) associated with radiological services that has an off-setting payoff profile. However, a limited indirect off-set can be found at several banks which have options with pari-mutuel payoffs to reduce immediate financial risk if S.2345 passes and radiologists in India are no longer permitted to offer services in the US.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0161">Trade Bill S. 5432 associated with &#x3b6;<sub>8 </sub>will yield significant tax advantages if it passes, increasing sharply the value of service. Uncertainty over the bill and a recent service scandal in Viet Nam make &#x3b6;<sub>8 </sub>less desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0162">Consultation with the client eliminates possible providers with trade bill associated political risk as being acceptable candidates, regardless of the presence or absence of products to off-set risk.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0163">In a subsequent iteration of the search mechanism, quasi-fungibility measurement and subset generation processes are directed by the Financial Engineers to exclude event sensitive &#x3b6;. All Trade Bill sensitive and outcome dependent candidate alternatives &#x3b6; are placed in a separate subset {C<sub>1,</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>8</sub>}which is marked and sent to an inventory management database for possible later evaluation and use.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0164">The remaining set containing elements {&#x3b6;<sub>2</sub>, &#x3b6;<sub>3</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>4</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>5</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>6 </sub>and &#x3b6;<sub>7</sub>} are sorted under one more constraint in one additional iteration of the subspace generator to eliminate services not $5,000 or more cheaper per month than Reference &#x3be;. Neither candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>4</sub>, nor &#x3b6;<sub>7 </sub>meet this criterion and therefore they are placed in a separate subset {&#x3b6;<sub>4</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>7</sub>} which is marked and sent to an inventory management database for possible later evaluation and use.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0165">Thus, the original set of eight &#x3b6; has produced three separate sets &#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>, &#x3bd;<sub>b</sub>,&#x3bd;<sub>c</sub>, all of which could satisfy the primary fungibility requirements of service type, licensure and Board certification. These three sets are:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>2</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>3</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>5</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>6</sub>}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3bd;<sub>b</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>1</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>8</sub>}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3bd;<sub>c</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>4</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>7</sub>}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0166">Nonetheless, each set &#x3bd; has different cash flow specifications (which could have been an additional constraint), risk profiles and profit profiles. In this example, the criteria that a user employed to separate the sets might also be relaxed according to need using the Emphasis Scoring Function E, thus expanding the contents of the sets or the number of sets in use. Alternatively, the Reference Conditioning Function C may be modified to re-state the reference specifications <u style="single">&#x3be;</u> for any which, in non-limiting examples, becomes unsuitable as a result of changing market circumstances such as labor strikes, or if a client changes any of the specifications for defining the quasi-fungibility of a service. This example of a preferred embodiment underscores how finely the individual and combined search, quasi-fungibility measurement and subset generation processes may be driven by a user, and how easily and precisely a user is able shape these processes by his/her own subjective judgments.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0167">An incentive of the dealer is to supply quasi-fungible services in the most efficient manner that meets the criteria of a Health Care Service Provider Procurement Manager's requirements. It will be evident to one skilled in the art that any &#x3b6; in &#x3bd;<sub>a </sub>can be mixed with any other available &#x3b6; in &#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>, by any of time zone, availability or subsequent price negotiation, to name a few non-limiting examples, to produce weighted average cash flows, as well as other structures. This will produce &#x201c;in use&#x201d; dynamic subsets of &#x3bd;<sub>a </sub>subject to criteria set in the Financial Product Machine.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0168">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, Third Party Payment Protocol <b>600</b> makes payments to HCSP <b>602</b> in response to payment/reimbursement requests. These payments are typically fixed rate amounts for a given service based on Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and, more generally the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) groupings, which reimburse for most radiological services under complicated health care formulas. HCSP <b>602</b> has contracted with the Health Care Dealer (HCD) <b>702</b> to receive services for $5,000 per month less than it was previously paying directly via staffing. HCSP <b>602</b> pays the TPP Protocol amount minus a margin to the HCD <b>702</b>, and HCD <b>702</b> bills the HCSP <b>602</b> a monthly fee plus a service fee. HCD <b>702</b> pays at least one radiology service firm <b>704</b> identified as a qualified alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>a monthly payment in response to services provided under a monthly agreement.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0169">HCD <b>702</b> offers qualified services from a plurality of radiology service providers to HCSP <b>602</b> since images to be interpreted are sent electronically to any of the qualified diagnosticians for interpretation and reporting. HCSP <b>602</b> will likely want to oversee certification compliance and service excellence, but otherwise can be relatively indifferent to which qualified firms in set &#x3bd;<sup>a </sup>are actually delivering the contracted for service. In practice, many service providing firms and individual practioners seek contracts for a term. But, just as with physicians in the US who &#x201c;moonlight&#x201d; in emergency rooms as needed on a free-agent basis, as competition increases, similar free-agent services via telemedicine are likely to increase in frequency with prices floating more freely than currently. This is especially true as localized shortages of certain skilled practitioners, radiology included, continue to increase in severity, in more than one country. Health care payments in Third Party Payer Protocols are complex and the payers may seek to reduce what they might see as &#x201c;excess&#x201d; margins on services contracted for through a given HCD on a quasi-fungibility basis. But, third party payers could just as easily try to force services into the quasi-fungibility based business flows described herein to reduce costs.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0170">Generally, payment rates under Third Party Payer Protocols are as fixed as they are complex. Part of the complexity lies in regionally different rates for the same services which are based upon extensive data on the presumed costs of providing the services to be reimbursed. Historically, however, it has been difficult for patients (and their insurers) to capture any benefits of pricing differentials because alternative service providers that might be preferred on the basis of price remained largely inaccessible. One of the main reasons this inaccessibility has persisted is because one of the patient or the service provider has to change location to receive or provide the service. This situation changes with telemedicine capabilities, especially in instances where logistics costs are negligible, as in the transmission of x-ray images. In this instance the service location is at least as important as qualification. On an expanding basis, this should drive those services, where it is possible to do so, from high cost areas to lower cost areas. Doing so, however, requires a method of measuring comparability, which method the subject invention provides.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0171">A second aspect to the provision of non-location specific service that is preferred is competition among the suppliers on price. Price competition in the medical field can be a challenging concept. It is challenging not just because of guild-like relationships among certain providers, but also because of Byzantine and rigid economic structures in third party payment systems that distort normal patterns of choice and price adjustment. Opportunity for product development as described herein exists because the third party system is under stress from rising costs, from pressures from providers to be paid outside of bureaucratic reimbursement schema that do not reflect the reality of service provision, and from technology to name a few system stress points. In this mix of price pressures is the pricing structure of health care insurance, which many commentators state is in an upward pricing spiral that denies basic coverage to millions. Cries for more government intervention in the &#x201c;crisis&#x201d; are predictable. Potential free market competitive solutions for at least some of the cost pressures are as evident as they are nascent.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0172">Competition implies a move from a fixed price structure to an open market structure, meaning prices will float in response to supply and demand, which creates additional opportunities. Returning to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the Third Party Payer Protocol is fixed, as is payment to (and charges from) any of a plurality of distant radiological service providers. This illustrating but non-limiting structure is a starting point to describe basic commercial transactions in quasi-fungible radiology services supported by the subject invention. But it will be evident that alternate commercial cash flows can be built from Third Party Payer payment structures that tie payment levels for the same services to regional criteria. This means that Third Party Payer Protocol cash flows can be based on at least one regional fixed price Radiology Payment (Reimbursement) Index against which at least one of a plurality of floating price Quasi-Fungible Telemedicine-Based Provider Indices of the non-limiting, exemplary radiological services could be reliably measured. Thus, a Quasi-Fungible Radiology Service Index based on service rates for Southern California can be priced against a Quasi-Fungible Radiology Service Index for Metropolitan New York or for Central Florida. From those comparison indices, the leap to indices based on quasi-fungible radiology services in New York City, Mumbai, Delhi, or any other city are apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0173">Non-limiting designs for pricing and cash flow relationships between the respective indices can be fixed or floating, have notional amounts of services that can be either fixed or amortizing, depending on the number of &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>, the structure of a given set and the funding and payment schedules of potential index users. A non-limiting list of potential users of indices and financial products for health care services derived from use of the subject invention are likely to include entities such as Hospital Corporation of America, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Medicare/Medicaid, and the national health systems of England, Canada and France. The foregoing description of the relationships between the indices, which is meant to be illustrative and not limiting, could then 1) reflect specific cash and service flow needs 2) reflect seasonal tendencies, including specific events such as disease outbreaks and their attendant outcomes such as increased service demand 3) be provided wherever there is shortage, whether structural or temporary and 4) be tied to equipment loans and leases in combination with other hedges, such as those for interest rates and quasi-fungible inventory hedges as discussed further below. Under this structure, under the subject invention, the cash and service flows for Radiological Services can be hedged and exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0174">For a large service provider base it is plausible that excess capacity of service within a set of service providers will exist on a local and rolling geographic basis just as there will exist shortages in smaller bases. While services cannot be warehoused or stored per se, they can be contracted for on a forward basis or optioned for forward delivery as well as bought, sold and borrowed in the spot market for immediate delivery. Thus, a dealer can hedge spot commitments against a forward delivery commitment or one forward delivery commitment against another for matched book structures, even if with some date mis-match risk.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0175">Further, given a definition of quasi-fungible services and an imbalance in supply and demand, there is opportunity to trade what in the current context are packets of time containing a quasi-fungible skilled service and an associated cash flow. For a given quasi-fungible service, there can be spot market trading similar to that for perishable goods. Or, more practically, there can be a definition of spot which would have a settlement today, tomorrow, tomorrow next (&#x2018;Tom Next&#x201d;), or some other number of days from the trade date to reflect the strictures of delivering the quasi-fungible service in question. The definition of a trade date and settlement date system for radiology services could be patterned on delays common to some financial products, (T+2) or longer as required to effect the settlement.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0176">An effect of long periods between trade and settlement dates gives an implied option both on the aggregate set of services within set &#x3bd;<sub>a </sub>as well as on any acceptable individual member of the set. These structures can also be viewed in terms of forward start contracts with attached options. To the degree there is a mechanism for ensuring performance to a contract, there is the possibility for packaging the service flow commitments and their cash flows into discrete tradable packets of time on a forward basis. A series of such forward contracts, especially when combined with fixed and floating indices of the payment flows, will provide a needed building block for creating Health Care Services Swaps. Additionally, contracts with reliable performance bonds could be defined by concerned parties as assets which could be used as collateral. This implies that packaged blocks of quasi-fungible radiology services can serve as the basis of repo transactions, among other financing structures. Such repo structures could include work week or weekend windows of spot<sub>t</sub>, spot<sub>t+1</sub>. . . . spot<sub>t+n </sub>from any qualified candidate alternative provider and functionally enable participants to sell services short While repurchase agreement structures as proposed could be effected in quasi-fungible services generally, clearly some will be more appropriate to such structuring than others.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0177">In the above repurchase agreements, slots of weekends and work weeks, (as well as individual days as necessary) could be bought from entities having an excess and sold back at any later date as well as sold outright. Since the services are defined as quasi-fungible to a use by the participants, similar pool participants can freely trade such quasi-fungible services among themselves without regard to which entity originated the repo transaction. This implies the capacity to trade quasi-fungible services on a multi-lateral as well as bi-lateral basis. The roles of dealers and exchanges in such structures will be intuitive to one skilled in the art. The possibilities for using such tradable underlying instruments as real, non-actuarial hedges for insurance products is of interest to dealers, insurers and re-insurers of health care risks, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0178">Consider by way of example the following, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Health Care Service Provider (HCSP) <b>602</b> has a temporary deficit that requires it to contract in the spot market for services. HCSP <b>602</b> (Reference &#x3be;) contacts a Health Care Dealer (HCD) <b>604</b> who determines spot service availability among members of already determined set &#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>2</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>3</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>5</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>6</sub>}. HCD <b>604</b>, in this example, takes the service from &#x3b6;<sub>5 </sub><b>1106</b> under a term and condition of returning (providing) the same service at a forward date in a repo.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0179">Note that this service provision can be effected with any other acceptable &#x3b6; in set &#x3bd;<sub>a </sub>and augmented set &#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>&#x2032; which contains &#x3bd;<sub>a </sub>and the Reference &#x3be;<b>1100</b>. In this instance, augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032; is created to allow for a set to include the Reference &#x3be; because the contemplated terms in the example structure require the Reference be part of a set of services that satisfies the economics of the trades. In other exemplary structures, set &#x3bd;&#x2032; could include additional null sets, the presence of which could constitute events that trigger options for additional services. Such a short position held by a Dealer can be modeled to create functional Term Repo or a Rolling Spot type of Repo short that is either renewed by a recipient or rolled between accepted candidate alternatives. A capacity to establish and hold functional short positions in spot services allows for use of such positions as hedges against other long positions or commitments whether they are spot, forward, derivative or contingent in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0180">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the repo between HCD <b>604</b> and &#x3b6;<sub>5 </sub><b>1106</b> expires prior to the repo between HCD <b>604</b> and HCSP <b>602</b> so the dealer effects a repo for services from &#x3b6;<sub>2 </sub><b>1102</b> for the remainder of the open repo with HCSP <b>602</b>. At the conclusion of the term repo, HCSP <b>602</b> (i.e., &#x3be;) sells back the services to Dealer <b>604</b> who in a reverse repo, sells them back to &#x3b6;<sub>2 </sub><b>1102</b> to close the quasi-fungibility enabled repo transaction. &#x3b6;<sub>6 </sub><b>1108</b>, which is shown as part of the complete set &#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>, does not take part in this transaction because they did not have services available when Dealer <b>604</b> needed to buy the additional block of time and its associated skill set of quasi-fungible service.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0181">Once services can be inter-changed in an agreed upon way between at least two parties according to use and at least one specification, commercially dynamic activities can ensue. The capacity of a given HCSP and a particular &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>to engage in repo and reverse repo provides a financing capability to managing what otherwise might be idle productive time for the service in question. Additionally, the capacity of dealers to create, trade and manage open repo and forward positions on a given service has implication for their ability to development of other hedge structures, including, but not limited to options, swaps and insurance products and their hedges.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0182">The subject invention enables the flow of radiology services to be packaged as a flow of services and cash which can be discounted according to standard financial mathematics with modification for the inclusion of quasi-fungibility mathematics.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0183">For example, a standard formula for calculating the Net Present Value of a set of cash flows is:</p>

<p id="p-0178" num="0185">where CF<sub>t </sub>is the cash value of the service flow at time t, and r is an interest rate associated with each cash value equivalent service flow that acts as a standard discounting function.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0186">The term structure of r can be derived from a zero or other interest rate curve or can be derived from an actual forward curve for services derived from forward contracting over the term of a given service contract.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0187">In the context of a methodology inherent in the discussed quasi-fungibility-based Telemed Radio Repo , the value CF<sub>t </sub>is strictly proportional to f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;)<sub>t </sub>in general, and is strictly proportional to f(&#x3be;,&#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>)<sub>t </sub>in the specific instance where the repo (or other product such as an individual forward or series of forwards or swap) is constructed of the elements of &#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>. For any pair (&#x3be;,&#x3b6;), the function f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;) is a scalar (a single valued real number), even if&#x2014;as in the current example embodiment&#x2014;it is a scalar that is a function of time. Since f(&#x3be;,&#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>)<sub>t </sub>is a set of scalars that are functions of time, the set {f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>2</sub>)<sub>t</sub>, f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>3</sub>)<sub>t</sub>, f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>5</sub>)<sub>t</sub>, f(&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>6</sub>)<sub>6</sub>} and the likewise f(&#x3be;,&#x3bd;<sub>a</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, is a set of four scalar functions moving through time.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0188">The implication of quasi-fungibility as a basis for financial products toward a formula for Net Present Value is that Net Present Value at any time t is not necessarily equal to replacement value of the cash/service flows as it is classically envisioned since the cash/service flows can be replaced by any member or group of members of the utilized sets &#x3bd; (or new qualifying sets at any time t) of quasi-fungible &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>if the contract allows. This condition will last as long as arbitrage between any one &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>or group of &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>, and the reference &#x3be;, and/or any one &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>or group of &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>, exists.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0189">If the quasi-fungibility conditions are well specified, any given set &#x3bd;, may be either &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; or &#x201c;elastic&#x201d;. In this case, &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; means the elements of the set are fixed for a contract term or to a specific reset time. &#x201c;Elastic&#x201d; in the context of this embodiment means that any qualifying &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>may be substituted at any time t over the life of the service flows and at any time t the forward curve for any individual &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>may vary allowing for dynamic replacement of forward positions. Moreover, as t&#x2192;0, delivery dynamics will make for competitive substitution under &#x201c;use or lose it&#x201d; valuation scenarios inherent in the delivery of services at t<sub>0 </sub>since they can not be stored.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0190">While recipients of cash flows&#x2014;or in this case service flows-are historically suspicious of what is deliverable, as long as a given set of quasi-fungibility constraints is not violated, a receiver should be indifferent, making for interesting valuation mathematics for financial products.</p>

<p id="p-0187" num="0194">The possible impact of quasi-fungibility based financial products on financial mathematics more generally will be evident to one skilled in the art of financial engineering.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0195">It is true that time management in the manner proposed might be unpopular. But for certain services, like radiology, it should not be an issue since the time in question is spent reading and interpreting images and the mechanism of digital image (product) flow to practitioners can be seamless and invisible. Third party payers should participate in this mechanism since Third party payers will pay for services for which patients receive medical care without face-to-face contact when such lack of contact is normal to the provision of the service. Thus, while internet providers of remote medical care can be analyzed according to the subject invention and defined in terms of quasi-fungible groups of service providers, except for those patients not seeking reimbursement from a third party, the provision of such services will likely lag.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0196">The foregoing discussion pertaining to Radiology services is set forth here as a model for other services in other domains of interest. The subject invention can be used, by way of non-limiting examples, to construct financial products and optimize service inventories related to: 1) legal services 2) home care monitoring (as in Hospice or long term disability care) which can be done at a central station outside the patient's locale in conjunction with local visiting medical services 3) surgical procedures which have been demonstrated as being safe even if the surgeon if distantly located 4) the provision of teaching services and 5) software programming services. Further, formulas for equipment purchase and leasing, as well as overall medical practice economics will be altered by the creation of functional larger geographical service areas. In the aggregate, groups of Telemedicine Health Care Sector Microswaps can be packaged together as Health Care Sector Mesoswaps, which in turn can be aggregated with other financial products toward the construction of Macroeconomic swaps.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0197">2. Inventory Transactions</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0198">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> Inventory Source <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> sells one or more Reference parts &#x3be; from existing inventory to a Dealer <b>1202</b> who in turn sells them to a Inventory User <b>1204</b> in what is commonly referred to in finance as a &#x201c;matched book&#x201d; repo and reverse operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates that cash flows from a Dealer <b>1202</b> to Inventory Source <b>1200</b>, and from Inventory User 1204 to a Dealer 1202. For the transaction depicted in Inventory Source&#x2014;to&#x2014;Dealer&#x2014;to&#x2014;Inventory User in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the repo is of a type that is standard and largely free of market risk. Credit risk in this transaction can be controlled through collateral and margin procedures typical to the repurchase agreement business with the added feature that permissible collateral can include Reference &#x3be; and acceptable quasi-fungible candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>to Reference &#x3be;. In the inventory examples herein, it should be understood that Inventory Source <b>1200</b> and Inventory User <b>1204</b> may each represent one or more entities, and that in at least one embodiment of the subject invention, Inventory User <b>1204</b> may be a subscriber to the subject invention and Dealer <b>1202</b> may be a user of the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0199">In an alternative deal and trade structure, in this case Inventory Source <b>1200</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Dealer <b>1202</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Cash Market <b>1206</b>, only the first part of the transaction, from Inventory Source A <b>1200</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Dealer <b>1202</b>, is essentially free of market risk. The second half of the opening transaction that flows from the Dealer <b>1202</b> to the cash (open) market <b>1206</b>, has a risk profile that is not free of market risk since there is typically no party agreeing to return the item sold for cash at the initial transaction price. In this instance, a Dealer <b>1202</b> has combined one low risk profile of repo with an agreed upon return price to Inventory Source A <b>1200</b> with a different risk profile of a floating price in an open market transaction. This part of this transaction flow that goes to the cash market is a structure that is a primary element for &#x201c;selling short&#x201d;, that is, selling an item that is obtained through repo with an expectation of being able to buy it back in the open market for less than it was sold and return it to the seller at the agreed upon price in a reverse repo that closes the original transaction. The market mechanism of selling short is essential to the development of liquid trading markets in general, to common stock and commodity portfolio management styles (long-short, market neutral, matched pairs to non-exhaustively name a few), as well as to the development of hedging for derivatives markets, in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0200">In a preferred embodiment, in both the case where inventory is involved in a repo-reverse repo matched book transaction, and in the case where inventory is independently or concurrently sold into to the cash market, the transaction is monitored via the Practical Engine <b>465</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (which contains the Financial Product Machine <b>470</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to provide quasi-fungible alternatives to the Reference &#x3be;.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0201">It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that this basic repo structure is suggestive of more complex structures for financial products, some of which will be discussed below. Further, it should be understood that the Inventory Source <b>1200</b> and the Inventory User <b>1204</b> in the depiction can deal with each other directly, without the intermediation of a Dealer, although in practice, dealer intermediaries are typical.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0202">It will be further evident to one skilled in the art that a general industry tendency to overstock inventory will make instances of inventory availability from an Inventory Source <b>1200</b> more frequent and easier to find than corresponding and offsetting consuming needs that arise with an Inventory User <b>1204</b>. It is probable that events such as strikes, accidents, unforeseen demand and natural phenomena will create contingent inventory needs to support a matched repo and reverse book based on a Reference &#x3be; and an augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032; consisting of Reference &#x3be; and acceptable quasi-fungible candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>(where &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;}). But it is more likely that at any given instant an active dealer will also use the cash market to raise funds to finance repo. Patterns of bi-directional inventory liquidity will thus impact repo financing rates and liquidity for repo. Event and outcome driven contingent inventory needs in an Inventory User <b>1204</b> will support quasi-fungibility based, contingent payoff product development by creative dealers.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0203">A key concern of market participants in less liquid markets for less traditional items is that products under contract in repo-type structures will be unavailable when it is time to unwind the transaction. This is a very important consideration when the items under loan are to be consumed according to a production schedule, a situation not typical for many categories of financial assets that usually underpin these types of transactions. In certain markets, especially those subject to intermittent supply shortages, this problem can be particularly acute since an inability to receive a part back may shut a production line and cost far more than a given transaction is capable of generating. In fact, it is fear of production line shutdown that is often the most cited reason for firms carrying excess inventory, a circumstance that in itself makes repo desirable for at least a part of the inventory. Inventory draw down features of manufacturing suggest natural amortizing structures for inventory repo and other financial products.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0204">At least part of this inventory control issue can be solved through the subject invention by the use of quasi-fungibility algorithms in an iterative subspace generator. Since these algorithms allow for identification of, and replacement by, quasi-fungible alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>to a Reference &#x3be;, the risk of liquidity driven default and problem trades can be reduced because the universe of possible replacements can greater than the original Reference &#x3be;. A system for defining candidate alternatives for &#x3be; works because the quasi-fungibility statements are under the control of the parties to the transaction and quasi-fungibility is defined to a use and set of specifications. While, at first glance, this observation might lead a reader to infer that contracts such as these are too highly tailored for more general trading and use, the reader should bear in mind that the use of the subject invention use may be sufficiently broad as to garner necessary interest for liquidity patterns that support active trading, price discovery functions and transparency.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0205">One example of an application of the subject invention that can support active trading, price discovery functions, and transparency is a non-limiting example where a DVD player manufacturer defines a Reference &#x3be; as an operational amplifier and identifies a set of six quasi-fungible alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>, for an operational amplifier integrated circuit chip, or for an operational amplifier and its passive components (resistors and capacitors) comprising an audio low pass filter subassembly. While an initial contract from a Dealer might have been defined for a single manufacturer, the same Reference &#x3be; and set &#x3bd;<sub>1 </sub>of six quasi-fungible alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>operational amplifiers are likely to be acceptable alternatives to other manufacturers of similar tier (quality) DVD players. Thereby, a quasi-standard contract based on quasi-fungibility can be defined for certain operational amplifier integrated circuit chips specific to a use in a specific product, here a DVD player of a specific product tier. Further, a quasi-standard contract based on quasi-fungibility can be defined for certain operational amplifiers that are not only specific to a use in a specific product, but even to a specific build cycle within those products. It might also be true that the same Reference operational amplifier integrated circuit chip given a specific set of reference specifications, might also be quasi-fungible to second set &#x3bd;<sub>2 </sub>of operational amplifiers for a different use in the manufacture of cell phone handsets.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0206">Further, while two sets, &#x3bd;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3bd;<sub>2</sub>, can both be quasi-fungible to a common Reference &#x3be;, &#x3bd;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3bd;<sub>2</sub>, might contain two completely different groups of &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>that do not intersect because they are not quasi-fungible to both uses of the Reference &#x3be;. Similarly, two separate References, &#x3be;<sub>&#x3b1;</sub> and &#x3be;<sub>&#x3b2;</sub>, derived from two separate uses might share a common set of candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>. The development of integrated and overlapping financial products for specific components that can serve multiple uses, and groups of components in those integrated and overlapping financial products, can provide building blocks for larger hedge products.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is an illustration of a quasi-fungibility based repo-type structure at termination. The initial Reference &#x3be; may be delivered or, in place of the Reference &#x3be;, any one or more of candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;<sub>1</sub>, that is, any member of set &#x3bd;<sub>1</sub>&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;<sub>1</sub>} may be delivered.

If a Reference &#x3be; can be replaced by any of a set of candidate alternatives, then a financial product can be built from any of a plurality of candidate alternatives according to the elements defined for its condition of quasi-fungibility.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0208">Analysis of the repo trade at termination as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows that for the part of the transaction based on Inventory Source <b>1200</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Dealer <b>1202</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Inventory User <b>1204</b>, the income earned on the Repurchase agreement is a function of the value of the underlying transaction and an interest rate r, where r differs slightly between Inventory Source <b>1200</b> and Inventory User <b>1204</b> to reflect a margin for a Dealer <b>1202</b>. This money flow shows a commercial process that can change an inventory item held by an Inventory Source <b>1200</b>, such as a manufacturer or distributor, that had before been idle and costing money or opportunity into an income earning asset. The structure of the income earning capability of that asset can range by non-limiting example, from a zero coupon bond to a coupon-like bullet instrument, depending upon the analytical model, if a profit accrues to the ultimate sale of an inventory item as part of production. In the zero coupon view, an inventory item is purchased at time t for value X and increases in value over a known inventory turn cycle to obtain value Y, with the difference accreting according to continuous compounding mathematics. In the bullet bond with coupon view, an inventory item might be acquired under a cost plus type contract and the &#x201c;plus&#x201d; part of the contract can be seen as a coupon paid to the principal amount paid for the inventory where the coupon period is the inventory turn cycle. The range of possible product structures can be realized as the structure of a Repo transaction is varied, and inventory is returned to a storage bin, or sold outright, or consumed in production.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0209">Normally, as a negative income tern, inventory has a duration that shifts longer in time the longer the inventory is held without a turn. However, the capacity to earn income on inventory as described herein shifts the duration assumptions attached to inventory so they are shorter as income opportunity is captured. This shift will impact asset-liability analysis of inventory holdings specifically, and will impact firms in general to the degree that captured income streams are meaningful. Thus, this shift can impact Duration Gap Analysis and related hedging. In a similar vein, policies of just-in-time delivery of inventory can be viewed as way to keep inventory duration short for a manufacturer. However, just-in-time delivery inventory management is often done at the expense of the supplier. Under methods described herein, the holder of inventory can shift the economics of holding inventory through owner/holder control without need to resort to a game of who is eating, and who is paying for, a &#x201c;free lunch&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0210">The capacity to define inventory in this manner creates the opportunity for working relationships between treasury departments, procurement departments and dealers that do not currently exist. Within these new working relationships, corporate treasurers with eligible inventory may be induced to participate in using an Inventory Management Machine and to organize inventory, not just by part number, but by a quasi-fungibility matrix according to parameters that maximize the ability to earn an interim return on an inventory item prior to its consumption in production. This will allow for physical movement of parts, the efficiency of which is in large part a function of logistics; creation of receipt systems by which receipts for inventory are traded without mandatory physical movement of underlying items; and creation of benchmark indices, which can serve as products independently or as the basis for other financial products such as, but not limited to, forwards, options and swaps. While the repo mechanism may occasionally distort markets through short squeezes, most often new supply from repo eligible inventory will likely act to smooth market movements and provide supply to minimize shortages under many conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0211">In this framework, Procurement Managers can have an active role, both in terms of managing specific items or groups of items for quasi-fungible inventory loans by Treasury while managing inventory needs for production lines, since it may be desirable to a firm to keep these perspectives/objectives in balance and synchronization. Part of the described integrated financial product/inventory management approach can consist of an awareness of Reference &#x3be; and candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>for any production run, in terms of economic efficiency (via Treasury) and in terms of alternate inventory availability based upon parameters certified by an engineering department.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0212">The subject invention's classifying of inventory through quasi-fungibility will likely create at least two tiers of quasi-fungible product around a single Reference &#x3be; according to whether or not a given quasi-fungibility search includes an absolute constraint of &#x201c;Engineering Tested&#x201d; to a particular use, especially for electronic components. In a case where a given quasi-fungibility search includes an absolute constraint of &#x201c;Engineering Tested&#x201d;, and that constraint is satisfied by a given candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>, then a specific candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>that is Engineering Certified to work in a particular design may have a higher usefulness to a recipient than other alternative &#x3b6;. And, in those cases where the same set of quasi-fungibility search constraints return additional candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>that are not certified, they may have lower usefulness to a particular recipient. This difference has implications for financial product design because the sets of differently certified parts are likely to have some element of price tracking error or basis risk to the Reference &#x3be;. Tracking error and basis risk are common problems with standard approaches in portfolio management and hedge product design and use. The incentive therefore is to have many parts Engineering Certified for purposes of returning inventory sets to repo participants. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of using an entire set of candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>as trading hedges will remain, even if there is some tracking error and basis risk since those skilled in the trading art are familiar with well tested compensation techniques for these parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0213">For the part of the transaction from Inventory Source <b>1200</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Dealer <b>1202</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Cash Market <b>1206</b>, the profit to the Dealer <b>1202</b> from Inventory Source <b>1200</b> is a function of the value of the underlying and an interest rate r for the transaction. The cash market component is defined by +/&#x2212;&#x394;P, where &#x394;P is the difference in value between a Reference &#x3be; sold and the value of the same Reference and one or more candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>purchased in the open market. This number may be quite large and eclipse the income produced by r, depending on market conditions. While &#x394;P may not necessarily be desirable to a dealer wanting to run a matched repo book, the risk profile of the open market position (which may be either short or long) is quite desirable for designing and hedging derivative products for a Reference &#x3be; and a given set &#x3bd; of candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>as illustrated in the below discussion of hedging and in Repo Version B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0214">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> a Dealer <b>1402</b> has established a short cash position with a flow from an Inventory Source <b>1400</b>&#x2014;to&#x2014;Dealer <b>1402</b>&#x2014;to Cash Market <b>1404</b>. In this non-limiting example, the inventory source might be a device manufacturer, franchise distributor, speculator who is financing purchases, and component and subassembly manufacturers. Against this position Dealer <b>1402</b> has bought a forward contract on a Reference &#x3be; from a Device Manufacturer <b>1406</b> which is based on and priced to an Index <b>1410</b> on Reference &#x3be; and &#x3bd;*={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;} on a floating price basis at Price<sub>index</sub>. The Index is created and priced in the Practical Engine <b>465</b> by a Financial Product Machine <b>470</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and at least one Inventory Management Machine <b>510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> from a set &#x3bd;*={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;} based on Reference &#x3be;.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0215">The index base and the set for the forward are determined through the selection process for Domain of Interest D, specification of one or more Reference &#x3be; and one or more iterations of at least one of a constraint set &#x3a6;, a minimum quasi-fungibility threshold &#x3c8;, an emphasis scoring function E, a Self-adaptive Reference Conditioning Operator A, a Reference Conditioning Function C, Programmability Conditioning Function P and Anti-fungibility Function {circumflex over (M)} as appropriate to determine a set &#x3bd; of candidate alternatives. The Device Manufacturer <b>1406</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has thus established a price hedge against a Production Commitment <b>1408</b> for the Reference &#x3be; at Price P<sub>1 </sub>as a Contract Procurement Purchase from a Component Manufacturer. Alternatively, this structure could be for an anticipated cash market purchase. The expiration date for the forward hedge and the delivery schedule for the production commitment would typically be identical. As a non-limiting example of management, all potential augmented sets &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;} (consisting of Reference &#x3be; and the accepted candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>in set &#x3bd;) may be 1) static, meaning fixed for the trade 2) dynamic, meaning updated according to rules and reset conventions contained in a contract 3) updated according to proprietary trading algorithms, especially for a Dealer <b>1402</b> with open cash market positions and 4) balanced by an Inventory Source according to inventory drawdown protocols for a production line.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0216">Corresponding to the short position in the forward held by the Device Manufacturer <b>1406</b>, the Dealer <b>1402</b> has established a long position in the forward contract on Reference &#x3be; which he has hedged with the repo-to-cash market short sale combination based on either a Reference &#x3be; or one or more &#x3b6; in &#x3bd; (in other words, based on augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;}). Ideally, the repo contract is Term Repo that expires with the hedge and is thus liquidated with the hedge. This helps keep cash flows balanced, but date mismatch is to be expected by a Dealer as it would be with hedge books for other types of financial products.</p>

A different payoff would formulated for a forward settling to delivery of its constituent index components. Device Manufacturer <b>1406</b> pays contract price P<sub>1 </sub>for Production Commitment <b>1408</b> or pays market price at hedge expiration for parts hedged. The contract procurement price was fixed at the initiation of the hedge. The open market price is the price available to purchase an augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032; consisting of Reference &#x3be; and acceptable quasi-fungible candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>(that is, &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;}) at the termination of the trade, which price should closely match the index.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0220">The payoff for the Dealer <b>1402</b> and the Device Manufacturer <b>1406</b> will vary in the subject example depending on whether the Dealer <b>1402</b> delivers actual parts according to a set &#x3bd; of an augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032; consisting of Reference &#x3be; and acceptable quasi-fungible candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>(that is, &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;}) or pays (receives) a return on an Index based on augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;}. In the latter case, the Device Manufacturer <b>1406</b> receives parts from an open market purchase or a contracted commitment from a supplier. The cash flow at termination of the derivative may be either-directional depending on prices at termination.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0221">It will evident to one skilled in the art that the Index on augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;} can be tied to manufacturer pricing tables for fixed pricing, including price cut schedules as appropriate. It will also be clear to one skilled in the art that, alternatively, the Index based on augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;} can float in price relative to the open market price fluctuations of the constituent parts. Thus an Index based on augmented set &#x3bd;&#x2032;={&#x3be;,&#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>&#x2282;&#x3bd;} can serve not only as a pricing base for derivatives, but serve as well as a mechanism for pricing an inventory swap. A non-limiting example of parties to such a swap structure would be a Component Manufacturer who receives fixed payment for production and a Device Manufacturer <b>1406</b> who pays a Component Manufacturer a fixed price for inventory but receives floating rate for his production.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0222">Further, it will be evident to one skilled in the art that large numbers of individual components for a device as well as subassemblies (including, but not limited to, ordered pairs, triplets, and quadruplets that define component placement on a circuit board and order of placement, such as in &#x201c;screw, washer, board, washer, nut&#x201d;.) can be processed through the Quasi-fungibility Apparatus, Financial Product Machine and Inventory Management Machine. Thereby, large numbers of products previously thought of as unhedgeable can approach measures of hedgeability. Under the current invention, a computer can be hedged on a possible component-by-component and subassembly-by-subassembly basis until, by the sum of its parts, a large portion of the finished machine can be represented by the sum of its quasi-fungible hedges. Standard methods of factor analysis can aid in this process.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0223">The ability to hedge on a component basis shown above is extensible. A framework for the hedging of a subassembly follows, using in this non-limiting case a relatively simple schematic <b>1800</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> for an Audio Low Pass Filter for a DVD player. The basic analysis for constructing sets of quasi-fungible parts for hedging an audio low pass filter subassembly is meant to show a non-limiting way how a progression of basic building blocks using quasi-fungibility based systems and methods can be constructed into larger hedges for larger assemblies and even finished goods and services.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0224">Following the methodology described for Radiology Services, for the single Reference component above, and elsewhere above in the detailed description, each Reference &#x3be; in the audio low-pass filter schematic <b>1800</b> is processed through Domain of Interest D, and one or more iterations of at least one of a constraint set &#x3a6;, a minimum quasi-fungibility Threshold &#x3c8;, and, as appropriate, an Emphasis Scoring Matrix E, a Self-Adaptive Reference Conditioning Operator A, a Reference Conditioning Function C, (if appropriate) a Quasi-fungibility Reference Conditioning Operator {circumflex over (M)}, and Programmability Reference Conditioning Operator P, to determine a set &#x3bd; of acceptable candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j</sub>. Each resulting set &#x3bd; is thus the basis for a potential financial product under previously described methods. The audio low-pass filter, filter itself, is the sum of its parts (plus assembly costs plus associated materials such as substrate and solder) so the base for a financial product on an audio low-pass filter <b>1800</b> subassembly in a device such as a DVD player is simply that financial product built from a set of all &#x3bd; for the product, &#x3bd;<sub>&#x3ba;</sub>, as listed below. As was already shown for a single component, a financial product could be built from each and any of the Reference &#x3be;, the sets &#x3bd;, and the augmented sets &#x3bd;&#x2032;. However, the object in the current non-limiting example is to show the aggregation of augmented sets &#x3bd;&#x2032; for each of a plurality of Reference &#x3be; into a single set which comprises the basis for such products. For each Reference &#x3be;<sub>i</sub>, the set &#x3bd; of acceptable candidate alternatives &#x3b6;<sub>j </sub>found for financial product development is shown in the list below as based on circuit diagram <b>1800</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and the list of parts for the audio low pass filter <b>1800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.

<p id="p-0218" num="0225">It will be evident to one skilled in the art that arbitrage potential between individual financial products on the constituent components of the example filter and the subassembly hedge will be high. Arbitrage possibilities represented by linkages of financial products on individual Reference operational amplifiers to other products containing a given Reference or a quasi-fungible set of operational amplifiers based on the same given Reference likely will be commercially viable as well. The multiple use aspects of common parts and certain cross-product subassemblies provide a link that can bind hedge products in one industry sector to another, which in turn ties to building blocks for the creation of meso financial products as discussed elsewhere in this application.</p>

It is noted that to optimize space and cost in some DVD player designs, the one operational amplifier may be one channel of a dual- or quad-channel package and that a sub-assembly may encompass more than a single low-pass filter. However for clarity of this non-limiting example, it is assumed that the one operational amplifier is in its own package and forms the active circuitry of a self contained low-pass filter sub-assembly. The twelve specifications &#x3be;<sub>1,1 </sub>through &#x3be;<sub>1,12 </sub>on the Reference &#x3be;<sub>1 </sub>for the operational amplifier A<b>1</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The nine specifications &#x3be;<sub>2,1 </sub>through &#x3be;<sub>2,9 </sub>on the Reference for for the resistor R<b>1</b> are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, as are the nine specifications &#x3be;<sub>3,1 </sub>through &#x3be;<sub>3,9 </sub>on the Reference &#x3be;<sub>3 </sub>for the resistor R<b>2</b>, the nine specifications &#x3be;<sub>4,1 </sub>through &#x3be;<sub>4,9 </sub>on the Reference &#x3be;<sub>4 </sub>for the resistor Rf, and the nine specifications &#x3be;<sub>5,1 </sub>through &#x3be;<sub>5,9 </sub>on the Reference &#x3be;<sub>5 </sub>for the resistor Rload. The ten specifications &#x3be;<sub>6,1 </sub>through &#x3be;6,10 on the Reference &#x3be;<sub>6 </sub>for the capacitor C<b>3</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, as are the ten specifications &#x3be;<sub>7,1 </sub>through &#x3be;<sub>7,10 </sub>on the Reference &#x3be;<sub>7 </sub>for the capacitor C<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0227">As shown above, the set of candidate alternatives that were found suitable for the development of quasi-fungibility based financial products relative to the Reference &#x3be;<sub>1 </sub>for the operational amplifier A<b>1</b> are the elements of the set &#x3bd;<sub>1</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>1,1</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>1,3</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>1,5</sub>}. Likewise, the set of candidate alternatives that were found suitable for the development of quasi-fungibility based financial products relative to the Reference &#x3be;<sub>2 </sub>for resistor R<b>1</b> are the elements of the set &#x3bd;<sub>2</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>2,2</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>2,4</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>2,6</sub>} and so on for Reference &#x3be;<sub>3 </sub>(resistor R<b>2</b>) through Reference &#x3be;<sub>7 </sub>(capacitor C<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0228">The set of candidate alternatives that were found suitable for the development of quasi-fungibility based financial products relative to the Reference &#x3be;<sub>1 </sub>for the operational amplifier A<b>1</b>, namely &#x3bd;<sub>1</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>1,1</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>1,3</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>1,5</sub>} resulted from the following process:</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0229">The Domain-of-Interest D was defined as &#x201c;low power operational amplifier integrated circuits&#x201d;. After a few iterations, the constraint set &#x3a6;, was narrowed down to the over-riding constrains for the candidate alternatives must (a) have a gain bandwidth of at least 24 MHz (b) that the slew rate must be at least 12 volts per microsecond (c) must be packaged as a single channel device in an SOT-23 package using a standard National Semiconductor Corporation pin-out for a single op amp in that package and (d) the published budgetary price per device in volumes of 1,000 and greater must not exceed $1.10.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0230">Within those constraints, quasi-fungibility was measured according to at least one method described above and the final set &#x3bd; (in this case &#x3bd;<sub>1 </sub>to reflect that it is a set of candidate alternatives specific to Reference &#x3be;<sub>1</sub>) was generated in the manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0231">Neither the Reference Conditioning Function C, nor the Reference Conditioning Operators A, {circumflex over (M)} or P were applied in this case. However, because of a high value placed on driving a strong and linear output current while consuming little power to drive the circuitry itself, an Emphasis Scoring Function, E, was used to narrow the range of candidate alternatives under consideration by placing a high importance on two specifications: 1) Supply Current per Channel at Reference specification &#x3be;<sub>1,5 </sub>and candidate alternative specification &#x3b6;<sub>1,j,5</sub>, respectively and 2) Linear Output Current at Reference specification &#x3be;<sub>1,6 </sub>and candidate alternative specification &#x3b6;<sub>1,j,6</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0232">By comparing the Reference &#x3be;<sub>1 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> with the candidate alternatives in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an extensible logical basis for constructing set &#x3bd;<sub>1</sub>={&#x3b6;<sub>1,1</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>1,3</sub>,&#x3b6;<sub>1,5</sub>} is illustrated: 1) Candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>1,4 </sub>was eliminated by an over-riding constraint set &#x3a6; requirement that Gain Bandwidth be at least 20 MHz versus the 4 MHz, and a requirement that the slew rate be at least 12 volts per microsecond versus the 1.5 volts per microsecond, provided by candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>1,4</sub>; and 2) Candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>1,2 </sub>which would pass a first sort based on over-riding constraints was nonetheless eliminated because it was not sufficiently quasi-fungible to the Reference once the Emphasis Scoring Function E was applied to raise the importance of the two characteristics for Current per Channel and Linear Output Current. In other words, candidate alternative &#x3b6;<sub>1,2 </sub>was eliminated because of |f(&#x3be;<sub>1</sub><sup>E</sup>,&#x3b6;<sup>E</sup><sub>1,2</sub>)|&#x3c;&#x3c8;<sup>E </sup>with respect to Reference &#x3be;<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0233">It will be evident to one skilled in the art that the construction of financial products based on sets of components, subassemblies and assemblies can be fine-tuned. Maximum-fit-to-hedge-needs can be obtained by using quasi-fungibility optimizations in the Primary Quasi-Fungibility (Q-F) Optimization Module <b>385</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and in the iterations of the iterative metric subspace generator <b>440</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in combination with such industry standard techniques in the Secondary Optimization Module <b>387</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to construct financial products <b>465</b> <b>0</b>f <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for a given hedge book structure. Key among such products for a robust dealer book are likely to be swaps.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0234">It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the creation of a swaps market for inventory follows from the above described methods for inventory finance, forwards, indices and production-based inventory consumption. In the context of the current discussion, recall the comparison of inventory to either a zero coupon bond or coupon bearing bullet bond. This is equivalent to a &#x201c;received fixed&#x201d; payment position in a typical swap, given that the inventory is sold for a margin of profit. Typically, inventory holders finance these positions with bank borrowings at floating rates, often tied to LIBOR or the Prime Rate. The bank borrowings are therefore the equivalent of a short position in a floating rate note. The combination of a &#x201c;receive fixed&#x201d; position with a &#x201c;pay float&#x201d; position is a basic structure of cash flows that provide the basis for a swap. The current invention provides a system and method for increasing inventory liquidity to support development of an actual swap product based on physical inventory to hedge these otherwise locked-up cash flows.</p>
