<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51</figref>, <b>55</b>A, <b>55</b>B and <b>56</b>, fragrance emitting apparatus <b>800</b> further comprises micro-pump <b>900</b>. In a preferred embodiment, micro-pump <b>900</b> is configured as the fluid ejection device that is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,112, the disclosure of which patent is hereby incorporated by reference. Micro-pump <b>900</b> is adjacent to vent <b>807</b> in top section <b>804</b>. Micro-pump <b>900</b> comprises a surface <b>902</b> that vibrates or oscillates. Surface <b>902</b> has a pair of apertures or openings (not shown). End <b>856</b> of third portion <b>855</b> of fragrance member <b>850</b> contacts surface <b>902</b>. When surface <b>902</b> vibrates or oscillates, the liquid fragrance provided by fragrance member <b>850</b> (i.e. droplets of liquid fragrance) are ejected from the apertures (not shown) at the frequency of oscillation of the surface <b>902</b>. Micro-pump <b>900</b> further includes oscillator <b>905</b>. The frequency of oscillation of surface <b>902</b> is determined by the frequency of oscillation of oscillator <b>905</b>. Oscillator <b>905</b> can be a piezoceramic or piezoelectric element. This is described in the aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,112. In one embodiment, piezoceramic oscillator <b>905</b> is positioned beneath surface <b>902</b>. Wires (not shown) connect the oscillator <b>905</b> to micro-pump control circuit <b>904</b>. Micro-pump control circuit <b>904</b> is electrically connected to frequency switch <b>906</b> and USB connector <b>808</b>. When USB connector <b>808</b> is plugged into a USB port of a computer or peripheral device, two different voltages having different magnitudes are applied to the contacts of frequency switch <b>906</b>. When frequency switch <b>906</b> is in a first position, a voltage having a first magnitude is applied to micro-pump control circuit <b>904</b>. In response, micro-pump control circuit <b>904</b> generates an electrical wave signal having a first frequency that is applied to the oscillator <b>905</b> (i.e. piezoceramic or piezoelectric element) which causes oscillator <b>905</b> to oscillate or vibrate at the first frequency thereby causing surface <b>902</b> to vibrate or oscillate and diffuse or disperse the fragrance liquid or oil provided by fragrance member <b>850</b> through the apertures (not shown) in surface <b>902</b>. The diffusion or dispersion of fragrance liquid droplets creates a fragrance that is emitted through vent <b>807</b> in top section <b>804</b> of casing <b>802</b>. When frequency switch <b>906</b> is in a second position, a voltage having a second magnitude is applied to micro-pump control circuit <b>904</b>. In response, micro-pump control circuit <b>904</b> generates an electrical wave signal having a second frequency that is different than the first frequency. Specifically, the second frequency can be greater than or less than the first frequency. The electrical wave signal having the second frequency is applied to the oscillator <b>905</b> (i.e. piezoceramic or piezoelectric element) which causes oscillator <b>905</b> to oscillate or vibrate at the second frequency thereby causing surface <b>902</b> to vibrate or oscillate and diffuse or disperse the fragrance liquid or oil provided by fragrance member <b>850</b> through the apertures (not shown) in surface <b>902</b>. As a result, oscillator <b>905</b> disperses or diffuses the fragrance liquid droplets at a rate that is different than provided by the first frequency. The diffusion or dispersion of the fragrance liquid droplets creates a fragrance that is emitted through vent <b>807</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53 and 55</figref>, switch mount <b>908</b> is mounted upon frequency switch <b>906</b> and protrudes through slot <b>910</b> in top section <b>804</b> of casing <b>802</b>. This enables a user to slide frequency switch <b>906</b> between the first position and second position so as to cause micro-pump control circuit <b>904</b> to provide the electrical wave signal having the first frequency or second frequency, respectively.</p>
