No. 60/584,801, entitled &#x201c;Integrated Shipping Label and Customs Form,&#x201d; filed Jun. 30, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The systems and methods described herein relate generally to the integration of a shipping label with a customs form to provide a single label having postage, addressing, customs and other information for international shipping.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The current procedure for preparing an international package for shipping involves a number of time-consuming steps. First, the shipping label must be generated. The typical minimum amount of information is the destination address and the sender's address. Secondly, some form of US postage must be affixed to the package. This could be conventional stamps, a postage meter strip from a conventional meter, a PVI postage strip issued by a US Post Office, or digital or &#x201c;Information Based Indicia&#x201d; postage (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;PC postage&#x201d;). Online postage was first described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,562 to Whitehouse, issued Jun. 7, 1994. A subsequent patent, U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,945 to Whitehouse, issued Dec. 21, 1999, described an extension of the Online postage concept&#x2014;a centralized postage system premised on Web or Telephonic Milli-Transactions. The contents of the above-referenced U.S. Patents are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thirdly, the US Postal Service, along with the Universal Postal Union (&#x201c;UPU&#x201d;) and the World Customs Organization (&#x201c;WCO&#x201d;), has historically required a separate and distinct customs declaration form, which must be affixed to the package. One of the simplest customs and declaration forms <b>10</b> is the PS 2976 (alternately referred to as the CN22), a representative diagram of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The form <b>10</b> repeats the sender <b>20</b> and recipient <b>30</b> address information, and adds details <b>40</b> as to the contents of the package including value and classification (Gift, Sample, Documents, Other). The newer forms, shown below, include a 6 digit Harmonization Schedule (&#x201c;HS&#x201d;) Number which represents the product using an internationally-established classification system</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A similar form <b>60</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the PS 2976A (also known as the CP72) is used for certain sub-classes of mail, or when package valuation exceeds $500. The data on the 2976A is virtually the same as that on the 2976 (e.g., sender <b>70</b> and recipient <b>80</b> information and details of contents <b>90</b>), but there are multiple copies (up to five) and the format is larger.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These conventional forms are time consuming to complete, and replicate much of the data on the shipping label itself. The forms must be properly matched with the shipping label and postage which, in a high volume shipping environment, can be problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The right hand side of the 2976 (CN22) form <b>10</b> is designed to be separated and left at the US Post Office, which inducts the mail. The copy is stored in a manual filing system for thirty days and then discarded. In the case of the 2976A (e.g., form <b>60</b>), one complete copy of the form <b>60</b> is held at the origin Post Office for thirty days. The purpose of this storage is to provide some record of the induction of the mail piece. But the storage protocol is archaic and very inefficient. If information is requested for a given package, the originating Post Office or Station must first be determined, and then a manual search of the hardcopy records must be undertaken by USPS personnel at that Post Office. The information is only retained for thirty days, which in many cases, is a shorter period of time than the overall delivery cycle (particularly in the case of Surface International mail subclasses which are transported by boat).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, improved international shipping labels, methods of international shipping, and systems and methods for storing data associated with international shipments are desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The systems and methods described herein relate generally to the integration of a shipping label with a customs form to provide a single label having postage, addressing, customs and other information for international shipping. In one embodiment, a method for generating an international shipping a package comprises the steps of providing shipping information associated with the package, the information comprising address information of the origin, address information of the destination, postage information including a postage amount due to a post service and a customs form number unique within the post service; processing a shipping label having the shipping information displayed thereon; and affixing the shipping label to the package.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, an online postage system configured to electronically generate an integrated shipping label comprises an end user computer, a centralized postage-issuing computer system, and a communications link connecting the end user computer with the centralized postage-issuing computer system. The end user computer is configured to transmit a request for postage indicium to the centralized-issuing computer system over the communications link, and the centralized postage-issuing computer system is configured for generating and transmitting a self-validating unique postage indicium to the end user computer over the communications link, the self-validating unique postage indicium containing a character string unique to the postal system and a digital signature derived from the unique character string. The end user computer is further configured to generate an international shipping label having a customs form and add the self-validating unique postage indicium to the international shipping label.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The systems and methods described herein provide for an integrated shipping label having international shipping and customs information displayed thereon. The integrated shipping label can be used in place of the conventional shipping label and separate customs form used by post services, such as the United States Post Service (&#x201c;USPS&#x201d;). The integrated shipping label has a unique customs form number displayed thereon, preferably in barcode format. The unique customs form number is unique within the post service system and can have any desired shipping and customs information for the package associated with it. Furthermore, the systems and methods allow for electronically storing data associated with each package shipment. The systems and methods allow for the management of a discount service on behalf of a post service using a centralized Online postage system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a preferred embodiment, the systems and methods described herein can be used with the systems and methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,341,505, issued Aug. 23, 1994, U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,945, issued Dec. 21, 1999, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/990,605, filed Nov. 20, 2001, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/990,625, filed on Nov. 20, 2001, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/990,341, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,831,518 on Nov. 9, 2010. The contents of the above-referenced U.S. Patents and U.S. Patent Applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. These U.S. Patents and U.S. Patent Applications, in part, point out the value of using tracking (or delivery confirmation) numbers on domestic USPS shipments to reduce fraud, provide a refund methodology which accounts for misprints and other events outside of the user's control, and also set forth a centralized online postage system capable of use with the systems and methods described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the computer environment in which a user may purchase online postage is shown. A user at a personal computer <b>11</b><i>a </i>connects to a server computer <b>12</b> configured to enable the user to electronically purchase valid postage, typically via an Internet-type network <b>13</b>. The user interacts with a software program, e.g., DAZzle by Envelope Manager Software, on the personal computer <b>11</b><i>a</i>, downloaded from the server computer <b>12</b>, installed on the personal computer <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and/or embedded in a web page accessible via a Web browser, that allows the user to manage postage purchases.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the USPS has a general format for &#x201c;universal&#x201d; shipping labels, which are shipping labels for international shipments of US origin or destination, that can be generated electronically. The shipping label <b>400</b> is generally about 4&#xd7;6 inches in size, landscape style, and includes a large capital &#x201c;I&#x201d; <b>450</b>, which typically has a serif font. Also included is content identification <b>460</b>, e.g., gift, documents, commercial samples, or other, and sender's instructions <b>470</b>, e.g., return to sender or abandon upon non-delivery. The label <b>400</b> can also include insurance information <b>480</b>, such as insurance number and insured amount. A printout of the label <b>400</b> is preferably four-ply, with two copies provided for customs declaration, one for dispatch note, and one customer copy. An online label record may also be provided. The online record contains the customs number and can be used for confirmation of acceptance by the Postal Service. The record can also be used as the proof of mailing receipt for customers who choose to bring their items to a post office for postage and acceptance. A Post Office copy is no longer required because the information is stored in a database and retained for six months.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A shipping label <b>400</b> also provides service type, e.g., Global Priority Mail, Global Airmail, or Global Economy. A shipping label corresponding to each of these service types are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a shipping label <b>400</b> corresponding to Global Economy Parcel Post <b>410</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a shipping label <b>500</b> corresponding to Global Airmail Parcel Post <b>510</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a shipping label <b>600</b> corresponding to Global Priority Mail <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also included in a shipping label <b>400</b> is a barcode <b>420</b>, typically a Code U128 type barcode. The barcode <b>420</b> typically appears above the address segment <b>430</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The barcode <b>420</b> includes a customs form tracking number, e.g., 2976-A, assigned to uniquely identify the mail piece. Below the barcode <b>420</b> are human readable numbers <b>425</b>, which are also used to identify the mail piece. For label <b>400</b> graphics, 200 dots per inch (&#x201c;dpi&#x201d;) is preferably used and can be in graphic image file (&#x201c;GIF&#x201d;), tagged image file (&#x201c;TIF&#x201d;), or portable document (&#x201c;PDF&#x201d;) format.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Postage can be paid with postage stamps, postage meter stamps, postage validation imprinter (PVI) label, or permit imprint. A designated postage area <b>490</b> alongside the &#x201c;I&#x201d; <b>450</b> is reserved for placement of the postage. In addition, the postage indicia disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/990,605, filed Nov. 20, 2001, may be used in the area <b>490</b> as well as the postage marks and indicia disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,562, U.S. Pat. No. 5,341,505, and the other U.S. Patents and U.S. Patent Applications incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a preferred embodiment of an integrated shipping label <b>700</b> having both customs information as well as postage indicia <b>705</b>. The sender's <b>710</b> and recipient's <b>720</b> address appear in the center of the label <b>700</b>. The sender's <b>710</b> address is generally left justified and preferably automatically populates &#x201c;USA&#x201d; in bold capital letters. The recipient's <b>720</b> address's destination country is also bolded with large font. A two-dimensional barcode <b>730</b> includes digitally-signed data which includes among other things the sender's USPS meter account number, origin ZIP code, postage date, and postage amount. Preferably, the customs form number (or significant digits from this number) is also embedded into the postage indicia <b>705</b>, which can then be used as a unique identifier linked to the postage transaction. The customs form number is also represented by a one dimensional barcode <b>740</b>. Because the barcode <b>730</b> includes the senders USPS meter account number, the international shipment may advantageously be traced back to the sender.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The systems and methods described herein allow the integration of heretofore disparate subcomponents used to ship packages from the United States to foreign countries into a single, integrated label combining digital postage, addressing, and customs form information. Furthermore, the systems and methods include the transfer of package data to a centralized and secure data storage cluster so that all data associated with a given package (sender, recipient, sub-class of mail, package contents, and valuation) can be aggregated in an easily accessed data repository. These data can be used to expedite the flow of goods through foreign customs operations, assist in the tracking of packages, enhance the security and safety of the common carriers transporting these packages, and assist law enforcement agencies both in the US and abroad to investigate potential criminal or terrorist activity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ability to produce such a shipping label also represents a tremendous time savings for international shippers since the addressing, postage payment and customs form preparation become integrated. These systems and methods can also be extended to manage postage discount programs (which are common in the United States for certain sub-classes of International mail). Discount programs managed via the embodiments described herein can be administered at lower costs and reduce US Postal Service financial losses due to the elimination of induction accounting errors and omissions common with permit-based mailing programs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">These systems and methods leverage the features of a centralized online postage system (such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,945 and described above) which allows for the real-time capture of data associated with a postage transaction. Mailing software utilized by the online postage system can be implemented to allow a user to generate an integrated label <b>700</b> having the addressee information, the appropriate postage, and customs information. An example user interface <b>800</b> for such mailing software is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The user interface <b>800</b> includes a workspace <b>810</b> that allows a user to design an integrated label <b>700</b>. Further included is a toolbar <b>805</b> that provides tools such as &#x201c;save,&#x201d; which allows a user to save a design on a non-volatile memory and &#x201c;file open,&#x201d; which allows a user to open a saved design. Also included is an &#x201c;address book&#x201d; <b>815</b> that allows a user to store a plurality of addresses to be readily merged with the designed shipping label <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The mailing software further includes helper screens <b>900</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which are configured to assist the user in, among other things, determining the correct amount of international postage, import restrictions to the foreign country, and customs form requirements for the shipping label <b>700</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, a helper screen <b>900</b> provides a user with a plurality of tools to establish postage rates for an international location, such as Italy <b>910</b>. The screen <b>900</b> allows a user to establish postage type <b>920</b>, e.g., airmail, high priority, etc. and weight <b>930</b>. The postage rate may then be calculated based on the user's established information. Also included are tools for restrictions <b>940</b>, prohibitions <b>935</b>, observations <b>945</b>, customs forms <b>950</b>, areas served <b>930</b>, and express mail service <b>970</b> as would be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, the prohibitions tool <b>935</b> of the user interface <b>900</b> is shown. The tool <b>935</b> shows a list of goods <b>936</b> prohibited for mailing to a particular country, e.g., France. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>c</i>, the restrictions tool <b>940</b> of the user interface is shown. The tool <b>940</b> shows a list of restrictions <b>941</b> that apply to mail to a particular country, e.g., France. This information is generally provided by the destination country and disseminated by the USPS to international shippers. Historically, this information has been available in printed catalogs. Recently, this information has been made available electronically. The user interface <b>900</b> utilizes the electronic information.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, another user interface <b>1000</b> of the mailing software is shown for establishing and printing an integrated shipping label <b>700</b>. The user interface <b>1000</b> allows a user to establish postage type <b>1045</b>, weight <b>1047</b>, date <b>1049</b>, track option <b>1051</b>, insurance <b>1055</b>, and value <b>1057</b>. The user interface <b>1000</b> also allows a user to purchase the postage <b>1061</b>, international rates <b>1065</b>, and print a test label <b>1067</b>. The user interface <b>1000</b> further allows a user to provide package information <b>1059</b>, such as description of package. Other tools within this user interface include page setup <b>1026</b>, address information <b>1030</b> and customs information <b>1040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the customs information <b>1040</b> tool of the print user interface <b>1000</b> is shown. The customs information tool <b>1040</b> allows a user to select the proper form <b>1100</b>, provide a description of the contents <b>1110</b>, and select the type of contents <b>1120</b>, e.g., sample, gift, documents, or other.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">By using the postage indicia <b>705</b> described above in the universal shipping labels <b>700</b>, which are generated by the online postage system described above, each label printed can have an associated data record stored at a central location. In the case of domestic packages, the data includes the complete destination address, complete sender information, tracking or delivery confirmation number, package weight, postage applied, and mail class (e.g., Priority). In the case of an international package, the data is expanded to include a description of contents, the value of the contents, and the country of origin for the goods. Furthermore, all of this data is indexed by a unique identifier&#x2014;the customs form number.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">This approach alleviates the need for the 30 day storage of a customs form hardcopy at the origin Post Office. In the existing system, if the information is needed, the origin Post Office must be located, contacted and a manual search for the information must be instituted. These Systems and methods provide a simple index lookup procedure which can be accessed by the Internet, e.g., via a Web browser. By entering a unique identifier, e.g., the customs form number, data about the sender and the package shipped by the sender as well as package status may be retrieved. This type of information can be used by customs personnel (in the US and in foreign countries), by air transportation coordinators, and law enforcement to further advance the safety of commercial shipping.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To achieve some measure of standardization in customs-related information globally, the Universal Postal Union (&#x201c;UPU&#x201d;) has developed a numerical &#x201c;harmonization&#x201d; table which maps products into numerical codes called &#x201c;HS&#x201d; codes. The US and other countries have been moving towards requiring shippers to provide both product description and HS code as part of the customs form information. However, the HS requirement may create a burden on those unfamiliar with the codes. A lookup mechanism may be added to the mailing software that allows the determination of the appropriate HS code. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a</i>, a user interface <b>1200</b> that allows a user to establish the proper HS code is shown. The user interface <b>1200</b> provides a text box <b>1210</b> that allows a user to perform a text-based search for the proper HS code, provided in a list box <b>1220</b>. For example, typing the two words &#x201c;cotton&#x201d; and &#x201c;shirt&#x201d; in the text box <b>1210</b> institutes a Boolean search through the HS database to find all occurrences of these two words. Note that customs organizations make a distinction between, e.g., cotton shirts and shirts made of other materials. Similarly, there is a distinction between men and women's shirts, a night shirts. Wheeled toys are considered to be distinct from general toys.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">This simplified lookup process can be integrated into the mailing software when a user is filling out the contents descriptions. In this way the user can be forced to choose amongst standardized descriptive text, rather than typing in free-form (and potentially incorrect or vague) information. In the alternative, the lookup process may be used as an adjunct or an option to a free form goods description. Recording contents data by HS number rather than by free form text also has benefits in reducing the data storage requirements for historical shipment information stored at the centralized postage server site.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>b </i>and <b>9</b><i>c</i>, the list of prohibited <b>936</b> and restrict <b>941</b> goods may pose difficulty for a user attempting to compare the list to the description of the actual item being shipped by the user. An approach to alleviate this task is to recast the lists <b>936</b> and <b>941</b> into their corresponding HS code or HTS numbers. For example, for radioactive materials <b>937</b> in the list of prohibited goods <b>936</b>, the corresponding HTS number is 28444000. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>b</i>, the user interface <b>1200</b> is shown with a search done of &#x201c;radioactive&#x201d; materials <b>1230</b>. The search results <b>1240</b> reveal that there is only one HIS number that corresponds with such type of goods. Also shown is a search done of &#x201c;bees&#x201d; <b>1250</b>. The search results <b>1255</b> reveal that there are multiple entries. Any of these entries may trigger a warning message to the user, instructing the user that there are restrictions/prohibitions in place for such type of goods being sent to the desired country.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the prohibitions and restrictions are cast in terms of HIS numbers for each country, the mailing software can enforce the prohibitions and issue warnings for restricted items. This can be achieved by requiring that descriptions be selected from a searchable HIS list and not typed free-form, and then the selected HTS numbers could be compared to the list of restricted and prohibited HTS numbers for the country of interest. The software can provide a hard lock-out&#x2014;preventing the user from printing the shipping label and accompanying customs form&#x2014;or issue warning messages of varying severity.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">There are a number of advantages in an international shipping system which fundamentally operates using the HTS numbers. First, language barriers are eliminated at foreign customs operations. A Bulgarian customs official may not be very well versed in English, but he/she will know the international HTS numbers relevant to his country intimately.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Second, the use of HIS numbers offers the shipper an automated software-based means to insure they are not inadvertently shipping restricted or prohibited goods to foreign countries. For such goods, there is no guarantee the goods will be returned to the shipper. Thirdly, the use of HTS numbers provides a convenient and uniform way to construct electronic manifests of what goes on any aircraft of ship. This is significant given the current geo-political situation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the online postage system can transmit the detailed list of items (including HTS) number about a shipment to both the central postage services and those of the USPS using the customs form number as an index for this detailed data. Thus, scanning a customs form barcode created by systems described above will allow for an instantaneous lookup of all the items in that package including the HTS code for each item.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The systems and methods described herein also provide for the management of USPS and other post service discount programs. Certain international subclasses of mail&#x2014;namely Global Express Mail&#x2014;offer discount programs for volume mailers. International mail is the only mail the USPS has freedom to negotiate rates on&#x2014;domestic rates are locked by a complete Postal Rate Commission process. Currently, the USPS administers the international discount program in an inefficient and expensive way. The USPS discounts range from 5% to 12% depending upon annual package volume. The USPS administers this process through a permit-based accounting scheme. In addition to the potential for revenue loss at induction as described above, the discount program requires additional accounting and management by USPS personnel. Discounts are based on estimated volumes, not actual volumes, and the discount schedule can therefore be out of synch with actual mailer's shipment activity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The systems and methods described herein provide a means of managing such discount programs on behalf of the USPS. A centralized online postage vendor collects funds prior to postage consumption by credit card, ACH direct debit, or commercial check. Mailers &#x201c;draw down&#x201d; on their account balance as they print postage labels. A discount program administered in this environment may provide the following advantages: each package bears full rate postage for the destination country and weight; there is no revenue loss at induction since this is prepaid postage and not a permit-based system; discounts can be applied after the fact, reflecting the actual performance of the shipper and not estimate volumes; discounts can be inexpensively applied as &#x201c;electronic credits&#x201d; to the mailer's existing postage meter account; and USPS auditors and the USPS Inspection Service have access to detailed package-by-package accounting for all discount program participants.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Volume mailers often use USPS permit account as a means to pay for international shipments. With such mailers, a permit number and city/state of issue replace the live digital postage indicium. While historically convenient for the mailer, this approach is prone to revenue loss by the USPS. The USPS staff must be careful to make full note of all permit mail inducted. Failure to do so will result in the USPS assuming responsibility for delivering the package without drawing funds from the mailer's permit account. USPS losses due to induction failures of this nature are estimated to be on the order of 1-3% of total permit revenue.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">These systems and methods described herein provide the mailer with the printing convenience of a permit while simultaneously assuring the USPS of receiving the associated revenue. By printing live online postage from an active USPS meter account, there is no need for induction accounting at the Post Office and therefore no associate revenue loss. Further, the USPS and mailer save the time and expense of a face-to-face induction process. The completely prepaid packages can be picked up by a USPS carrier during normal rounds or quickly dropped off at any USPS facility.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">USPS shipping labels differ from other carriers' labels in that they represent negotiable US funds. If a hardware or software error causes this print cycle to fail, the associated dollar amount of the label is potentially lost to the mailer. Unless properly addressed, these losses can drive a shipper away from USPS as a carrier into competing carriers such as FedEx or UPS who have a different billing scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The systems and methods described herein provide a refund protocol for domestic mail labels that carry some form of delivery confirmation or tracking barcode. The documents incorporated by reference describe a means by which data stored by the centralized postage cluster in conjunction with USPS delivery scan information to determine if end-user refund requests are reasonable. International shipping labels have been problematic in this regard because only a very limited subset of USPS International mail is tracked&#x2014;specifically the relatively expensive Global Express Mail and Global Express Guaranteed services. Not only are these services expensive, they are offered for only a limited number of foreign countries. In point of fact, the vast majority of US-originating mail to foreign countries is not tracked in anyway.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">These systems and methods bond a unique customs form ID to a postage transaction. Due to security requirements, all international packages over 1 lb must carry a customs form, and furthermore all customs forms must be scanned and &#x201c;round-stamped&#x201d; by USPS personnel at acceptance. The round stamp is an indication to downstream mail processing facilities (the approximately ten USPS International Service Centers located on US soil which manage all foreign outbound mail) that a local post office authority has accepted the package in either a face-to-face transaction, or via a secure protocol where the mailer is identified as a &#x201c;known-mailer.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The customs form barcode number, which is scanned at the origin post office, is transmitted nightly via the USPS internal network to a USPS database referred to as &#x201c;GoldMine&#x201d;&#x2014;currently located in the Eagan, Minn. Postal Data Center. GoldMine data includes the date and time of the induction scan, the origin zip code of the Post Office, the package weight (as confirmed by measurement by USPS staff), the destination country, the mail class and the International Service Center (ICS) which will handle this package.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The Goldmine database has been used little if at all by USPS in past years. These systems and methods allow the use of this USPS database and similar other databases as a means to authenticate refund requests on international shipping labels featuring an integrated customs form and customs form ID. While the USPS Goldmine database is on an internal network, all USPS approved online postage vendors also have access to this network. The refund procedure <b>1300</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. A mailer (end-user) would request a refund for a given mailing label with associated customs form ID. The request would be fielded by the centralized postage system on behalf of the USPS (action block <b>1310</b>). The postage system would query the USPS Goldmine database for a reasonable time frame (e.g., two weeks) to see if any induction scan had been undertaken for that label (action block <b>1320</b>). If no induction scan was recorded by the Goldmine database after the time period expired (decision block <b>1330</b>), the refund would be granted (action block <b>1340</b>). Additional audit controls can be installed to track refund trends with a given user to detect systematic abuse of the refund request process.</p>
