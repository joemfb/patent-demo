<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are a type of semiconductor device that converts electric energy into light. LEDs have better features such as low consumption power, semipermanent service life, fast response time, stability, and affinity with environment than the existing light sources such as fluorescent lamps and incandescent lamps. Therefore, much research is being conducted for replacing the existing light source with LEDs. LEDs are increasingly used as the light sources of lighting apparatuses such as Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs), electric display boards, streetlamps, and all sorts of lamps that are used indoors and outdoors.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, a first layer <b>131</b> that is the lowermost layer of the second electrode layer <b>130</b> is formed of a metal having a high reflectivity, and a third layer <b>133</b> that is the uppermost layer of the second electrode layer <b>130</b> is formed of a metal that has high adhesive strength and thus may easily be wire-bonded. A second layer <b>132</b> between the first and third layers <b>131</b> and <b>133</b> may be formed of a metal for preventing interlayer diffusion between the first and third layers <b>131</b> and <b>133</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first layer <b>131</b> may be formed to include silver (Ag) having a high reflectivity. However, when a concave portion and a convex portion corresponding to a convex portion and concave portion of the light extraction structure <b>128</b> are formed at an interface between the first layer <b>131</b> and the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>126</b>, the reflectivity of Ag may be considerably reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing a simulation result which is obtained by comparing a reflectivity of a case where the first layer <b>131</b> is formed of Ag and a reflectivity of a case where the first layer <b>131</b> is formed of aluminum (Al), when the light extraction structure <b>128</b> having a periodic pattern is formed on the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>126</b> of the interface between the first layer <b>131</b> and the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>126</b>.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a case where the first layer <b>131</b> is formed of Ag, the first layer <b>131</b> has a high reflectivity when the first layer <b>131</b> is a smooth surface where the lattice constant of the light extraction structure <b>128</b> is close to 0.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the first embodiment, therefore, the first layer <b>131</b> may be formed to include a metal material having the Plasmon frequencies different from a blue series wavelength, for example, Al instead of Ag.</p>
