<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electric drive system includes a fuel-driven prime mover for driving an electrical power alternator controlled at least in part by an excitation voltage is disclosed. The electrical power alternator makes electrical power available on a DC link having a voltage characteristic and a current characteristic. A method for managing the response of the alternator includes determining a voltage of the DC link and a torque command by an operator. The torque command is used to derive a mechanical power that is being commanded. A desired voltage of the DC link is determined based on the derived mechanical power, and an excitation voltage command signal is provided based on the desired voltage of the DC link by use of a closed loop controller. An actual excitation voltage is applied to the electrical power alternator based on the excitation voltage command signal.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent disclosure relates generally to load demand and power generation balancing, and more particularly relates to closed loop regulation of power generation output on a drive system in direct series electric drive system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Heavy machinery, such as off-highway trucks, are commonly used in mining, heavy construction, quarrying, and other applications. Although such machines are traditionally directly driven via an internal combustion engine, the extensive fuel consumption and mechanical complexity of such systems has spurred wide-ranging exploration of alternative power systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One advance that has improved efficiency associated with the use of heavy machinery is the adoption of Alternating Current (AC) on electric drive systems. Electric drive systems for machines typically include a power circuit that selectively activates one or more drive motors at a desired torque. Each of the drive motors is connected to a wheel or other traction device that operates to propel the machine. An electric drive system includes a prime mover, for example, an internal combustion engine, that drives an alternator. The alternator produces electrical power that is often conditioned, and ultimately used to drive the motor. The motor transforms the electrical power back into mechanical power that drives the wheel and propels the vehicle. Electric drive systems typically require less maintenance and thus, have lower life cycle costs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there are other faults associated with such machines that warrant attention in order to provide optimal machine operation. For instance, the drive systems on transmission driven vehicles are inherently stable insofar as the load applied to the engine is generated directly from ground force exertion (causing acceleration). Hence, as the vehicle accelerates, the load can steadily increase. Electric drive systems, however, may include an intermediate state of loading, the electrical system, which adds a degree of freedom. This added degree of freedom disconnects the mechanical connection between the ground and the engine, thus making the system less stable. For example, the load on the alternator, and thus the primary power source, can be increased in a step-wise manner instead of the more gradual manner usually experienced with engine driven machines. Such sudden increases in demanded power are not easily accommodated, and in some cases may cause the primary power source or the alternator to lag or ignore the power command, or in fact, to fail. Especially under unusual or abnormal driving conditions, such as abrupt starting and stopping of the vehicle, the issue of alternator power lag may become pronounced. This and other shortcomings in the state of the art are addressed by aspects of the disclosed principles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure describes, in one aspect, an electric drive system.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This disclosure relates to systems and methods for managing power in a direct series electric drive system, such as may be used in an off-highway truck or other heavy machine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrate, respectively, a front and a side view of a machine <b>100</b>. The machine <b>100</b> has a direct series electric drive system. One example of the machine <b>100</b> is an off-highway truck <b>101</b> such as those used for construction, mining, or quarrying. In the description that follows, this example illustrates the various arrangements that can be used on machines having direct series electric drive system systems. As can be appreciated, any other vehicle having a hybrid drive, electric-only, or direct series electric drive arrangement can benefit from the advantages described herein. The term &#x201c;machine,&#x201d; therefore, is used to generically describe any machine having at least one drive wheel that is driven by a motor connected to the wheel. Electrical power may be generated onboard by an alternator, generator, or another power-generation device, which may be driven by an engine or other prime mover. Alternatively, electrical power may be stored but not generated on-board.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A front view of the off-highway truck <b>101</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and a side view is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The off-highway truck <b>101</b> includes a chassis <b>102</b> that supports an operator cab <b>104</b> and a bucket <b>106</b>. The bucket <b>106</b> is pivotally connected to the chassis <b>102</b> and is arranged to carry a payload when the off-highway truck <b>101</b> is in service. An operator occupying the operator cab <b>104</b> can control the motion and the various functions of the off-highway truck <b>101</b>. The chassis <b>102</b> supports various drive system components. These drive system components are capable of driving a set of drive wheels <b>108</b> to propel the off-highway truck <b>101</b>. A set of idle wheels <b>110</b> can steer such that the off-highway truck <b>101</b> can move in any direction. Even though the off-highway truck <b>101</b> includes a rigid chassis with powered wheels for motion and steerable wheels for steering, one can appreciate that other machine configurations can be used. For example, such configurations may include articulated chassis with one or more driven wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The off-highway truck <b>101</b> has a direct series electric drive system, which in this instance refers to the use of more than one source or form of power to drive the drive wheels <b>108</b>. A block diagram for the direct series electric drive system of the machine <b>100</b>, for example, the off-highway truck <b>101</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the block diagram, the flow direction of power in the system when the machine is propelled is denoted by solid-lined arrows. Conversely, the flow of power during a retarding mode is shown in dash-lined arrows. The direct series electric drive system includes an engine <b>202</b>, for example, an internal combustion engine such as a diesel engine, which produces an output torque at an output shaft (not shown). The output shaft of the engine <b>202</b> is connected to a alternator <b>204</b>. In operation, the output shaft of the engine <b>202</b> rotates a rotor of the alternator <b>204</b> to produce electrical power, for example, in the form of alternating current (AC) power. This electrical power is supplied to a rectifier <b>206</b> and converted to direct current (DC) power. The rectified DC power may be converted again to an AC power by an inverter circuit <b>208</b>. The inverter circuit <b>208</b> may be capable of selectively adjusting the frequency and/or pulse-width of its output, such that motors <b>210</b> that are connected to an output of the inverter circuit <b>208</b> may be operated at variable speeds. The motors <b>210</b> may be connected via final assemblies (not shown) or directly to drive wheels <b>212</b> of the machine <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the off-highway truck <b>101</b> is propelled, the engine <b>202</b> generates mechanical power that is transformed into electrical power, which is conditioned by various electrical components. In an illustrated embodiment, such components are housed within a cabinet <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The cabinet <b>114</b> is disposed on a platform that is adjacent to the operator cab <b>104</b> and may include the rectifier <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), inverter circuit <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and/or other components. When the off-highway truck <b>101</b> is to be decelerated or its motion is otherwise to be retarded, for example, to prevent acceleration of the machine when travelling down an incline, its kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy. Effective disposition of this generated electrical power enables effective retarding of the off-highway truck <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Specifically, when the machine <b>100</b> is retarding, the kinetic energy of the machine <b>100</b> is transferred into rotational power of the drive wheels that rotates the motors <b>210</b>, which act as electrical alternators. The electrical power generated by the motors <b>210</b> has an AC waveform. Because the inverter circuit <b>208</b> is a bridge inverter, power supplied by the motors <b>210</b> is rectified by the inverter circuit <b>208</b> into DC power. Dissipation of the DC power generated by the motors <b>210</b> produces a counter-rotational torque at the drive wheels <b>108</b> to decelerate the machine. Dissipation of this DC power may be accomplished by passing the generated current rectified by the inverter circuit <b>208</b> through a resistance. To accomplish this, a retarder arrangement <b>213</b> may include a first resistor grid <b>214</b>, described in greater detail below, that is arranged to receive current from the inverter circuit <b>208</b> via a switch <b>216</b>. When the switch <b>216</b> is closed, the electrical power corresponding to the current generated by the motors <b>210</b> may pass through the first resistor grid <b>214</b> and dissipate as heat. Additionally, excess electrical power is also dissipated as heat as it passes through a second resistor grid <b>218</b>, which is arranged to receive electrical power via a chopper circuit <b>220</b>. The chopper circuit <b>220</b> operates to selectively route a portion of the developed electrical power through the second resistor grid <b>218</b>. One embodiment for the drive and retard system is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A block diagram of the direct series electric drive system of the off-highway truck <b>101</b>, as one example for the machine <b>100</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In these views, elements that were previously described are denoted by the same reference numerals for the sake of simplicity. Further, the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a particular embodiment with component examples that can be included in the functional blocks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Hence, the block diagrams shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> should be referred to together when considering the description that follows. As shown, the engine <b>202</b> is connected to the alternator <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) via an output drive shaft <b>304</b>. Even though a direct connection to the output drive shaft <b>304</b> is shown, other drive components, such as a transmission or other gear arrangements, may be utilized to couple the output of the engine <b>202</b> to the alternator <b>204</b>. The alternator <b>204</b> may be any appropriate type of alternator or alternator known in the power generation art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the alternator <b>204</b> is a three-phase alternating current (AC) synchronous alternator having a brushless, wound rotor. The alternator <b>204</b> has an output <b>301</b> for each of three phases of alternating current being generated, with each output having a respective current transducer <b>306</b> connected thereto. The rotor of the alternator <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) includes a rotating rectifier <b>302</b> that is connected to a rotating exciter armature <b>302</b>A. The rotating exciter armature <b>302</b>A is energized by an excitation field produced by an excitation winding <b>303</b>. Thus, the application of an excitation signal at the input to the excitation winding <b>303</b> creates an excitation field to activate the alternator field <b>305</b>. The alternator field <b>305</b>, in turn, produces the output available at three leads of the armature <b>307</b> of the alternator <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the illustrated embodiment, the rotating rectifier <b>302</b> includes a rotating exciter armature <b>302</b>A that is connected to an array of rotating diodes <b>302</b>B. The three current outputs of the alternator <b>204</b>, which are collectively considered the output of the alternator <b>204</b>, are connected to a rectifier <b>206</b>. If one of the array of rotating diodes <b>302</b>B fails, a greater current is required to develop a given voltage. Thus, the direct series electric drive system tends to operate less efficiently when such a malfunction occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rectifier <b>206</b> converts the AC power supplied by the alternator <b>204</b> into DC power. Any type of rectifier <b>206</b> may be used. In the example shown, the rectifier <b>206</b> includes six power diodes <b>310</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that are arranged in diode pairs around each phase of the output of the alternator <b>204</b>. Each diode pair includes two power diodes <b>310</b> that are connected in series to each other, with a connection to each phased output of the alternator <b>204</b> between each pair. The three pairs of power diodes <b>310</b> are connected in parallel to each other and operate to develop a voltage across a DC linkage or DC link <b>312</b>. This DC link voltage is available at a first rail and a second rail of the DC link <b>312</b>. The first rail is typically at a first voltage and the second rail is typically at a second voltage during operation. Either of the first and second voltages may be zero.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">During operation, a voltage is developed across the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b> by the rectifier <b>206</b> and/or an inverter circuit <b>208</b>. One or more capacitors <b>320</b> may be connected in parallel with one or more resistors <b>321</b> across the DC link <b>312</b> to smooth the voltage V across the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b>. The DC link <b>312</b> exhibits a DC link voltage, V, which can be measured by a voltage transducer <b>314</b>, and a current, A, which can be measured by a current transducer <b>316</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inverter circuit <b>208</b> is connected in parallel with the rectifier <b>206</b> and operates to transform the DC voltage V into variable frequency sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal AC power that drives, in this example, two drive motors <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Any known inverter may be used for the arrangement of the inverter circuit <b>208</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the inverter circuit <b>208</b> includes three phase arrays of insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) <b>324</b> that are arranged in transistor pairs and that are configured to supply a 3-phase AC output to each drive motor <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inverter circuit <b>208</b> can control the speed of the motors <b>210</b> by controlling the frequency and/or the pulse-width of the AC output. The drive motors <b>210</b> may be directly connected to the drive wheels <b>108</b> or may power the final drives that power the drive wheels <b>212</b>. Final drives, as is known, operate to reduce the rate of rotation and increase the torque between each drive motor <b>210</b> and each set of drive wheels <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In alternative embodiments, the engine <b>202</b> and alternator <b>204</b> are not required to supply the power necessary to drive the drive motors <b>210</b>. Instead, such alternative embodiments use another source of power, such as a battery or contact with an electrified rail or cable. In some embodiments, one drive motor <b>210</b> may be used to power all drive wheels of the machine, while in other embodiments, any number of drive motors may be used to power any number of drive wheels, including all wheels connected to the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Returning now to the block diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the machine <b>100</b> operates in an electric braking mode, which is also known as electric retarding, less power is supplied from the alternator <b>204</b> to the DC link <b>312</b>. Because the machine is travelling at some non-zero speed, rotation of the drive wheels <b>108</b> due to the kinetic energy of the machine <b>100</b> will power the drive motors <b>210</b>. The drive motors <b>210</b>, in this mode, act as alternators by producing AC electrical power. Consumption or disposition of this electrical power will consume work and act to apply a counter-rotational torque on the drive wheels <b>108</b>, causing them to reduce their rotational speed, thus retarding the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The generated AC electrical power can be converted into DC electrical power through the inverter circuit <b>208</b> for eventual consumption or disposition, for example, in the form of heat. In an illustrated embodiment, a retarder arrangement <b>213</b> consumes such electrical power generated during retarding. The retarder arrangement <b>213</b> can include any suitable arrangement that will operate to dissipate electrical power during retarding of the machine. In the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the retarder arrangement <b>213</b> includes a first resistor grid <b>214</b> that is arranged to dissipate electrical energy at a fixed rate. The retarder arrangement <b>213</b> also includes a second resistor grid <b>218</b>, to which DC current is supplied at a selectively variable rate by use of a pulse width modulator (PWM) or chopper circuit <b>220</b>. In this way, the second resistor grid <b>218</b> dissipates electrical energy at a variable rate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the machine <b>100</b> is to operate in a retarding mode, the first resistor grid <b>214</b> is connected between the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b> so that current may be passed therethrough. When the machine <b>100</b> is being propelled, however, the first resistor grid <b>214</b> is electrically isolated from the DC link <b>312</b> by two contactors or bipolar automatic switches (BAS) <b>216</b>. Each BAS <b>216</b> may include a pair of electrical contacts that are closed by an actuating mechanism, for example, a solenoid (not shown) or a coil creating a magnetic force that attracts the electric contacts to a closed position. The BAS <b>216</b> may include appropriate electrical shielding and anti-spark features that can allow these items to operate repeatedly in a high voltage environment.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the machine <b>100</b> initiates retarding, it is desirable to close both BAS <b>216</b> within a relatively short period such that the first resistor grid <b>214</b> is placed in circuit between the first and second DC rails to begin energy dissipation rapidly. Simultaneous actuation or actuation at about the same time, such as, within a few milliseconds, of the pair of BAS <b>216</b> may also advantageously avoid charging the first resistor grid <b>214</b> and other circuit elements to the voltage present at the rails of the DC link <b>312</b>. The pair of BAS <b>216</b> also prevents exposure of each of the BAS <b>216</b> or other components in the system to a large voltage difference (the voltage difference across the DC link <b>312</b>) for a prolonged period. A diode <b>334</b> may be disposed in parallel to the first resistor grid <b>214</b> to reduce arcing across the BAS <b>216</b>, which also electrically isolates the first resistor grid <b>214</b> from the DC link <b>312</b> during a propel mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the machine <b>100</b> is retarding, a large amount of heat can be produced by the first resistor grid <b>214</b>. Such energy, when converted to heat, must be removed from the first resistor grid <b>214</b> to avoid an overheating condition. For this reason, a blower <b>338</b>, driven by a motor <b>336</b>, operates to convectively cool the first resistor grid <b>214</b>. There are a number of different alternatives available for generating the power to drive the motor <b>336</b>. In this embodiment, a DC/AC inverter <b>340</b> is arranged to draw power from voltage-regulated locations across a portion of the first resistor grid <b>214</b>. The DC/AC inverter <b>340</b> may advantageously convert DC power from the DC link <b>312</b> to 3-phase AC power that drives the motor <b>336</b> when voltage is applied to the first resistor grid <b>214</b> during retarding.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the illustrated embodiment, the BAS <b>216</b> are not arranged to modulate the amount of energy that is dissipated through the first resistor grid <b>214</b>. During retarding, however, the machine <b>100</b> may have different energy dissipation requirements. This is because, among other things, the voltage V in the DC link <b>312</b> should be controlled to be within a predetermined range. To meet such dissipation requirements, the second resistor grid <b>218</b> can be exposed to a controlled current during retarding through action of the chopper circuit <b>220</b>. The chopper circuit <b>220</b> may have any appropriate configuration that will allow modulation of the current supplied to the second resistor grid <b>218</b>. In this embodiment, the chopper circuit <b>220</b> includes an arrangement of transistors <b>342</b> that can, when actuated according to a desired frequency and/or duration, modulate the current passed to the second resistor grid <b>218</b>. This controls the amount of energy dissipated by the second resistor grid <b>218</b> during retarding. The chopper circuit <b>220</b> may additionally include a capacitor <b>344</b> that is disposed between the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b> and that regulates the voltage input to the chopper circuit <b>220</b>. A switched diode <b>346</b> may be connected between the second resistor grid <b>218</b> and the DC link <b>312</b> to protect against short circuit conditions in the DC link <b>312</b> and to provide a device that can deactivate the DC link <b>312</b>, for example, during service.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The passage of current through the second resistor grid <b>218</b> will also generate heat, necessitating cooling of the second resistor grid <b>218</b>. In this embodiment, the first and second resistor grids <b>214</b> and <b>218</b> may both be located within the blower housing <b>116</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for convective cooling when the motor <b>336</b> and blower <b>338</b> are active.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The embodiment for a drive system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes other components that are discussed for the sake of completeness. Such components are optional but are shown herein because they promote smooth and efficient operation of the drive system. In this exemplary embodiment, a leakage detector <b>348</b> is connected between the two resistors <b>321</b>, in series with a capacitor <b>349</b>, to the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b>. The leakage detector <b>348</b> detects any current leakage to ground from either of the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b>. Further, in one embodiment, a first voltage indicator <b>350</b> may be connected between resistors <b>352</b> across the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b>. The first voltage indicator <b>350</b> may be disposed between the rectifier <b>206</b> and the retarder arrangement <b>213</b> such that a high voltage condition may be detected. In a similar fashion, a second voltage indicator <b>354</b> may be connected between resistors <b>356</b> across the first and second rails of the DC link <b>312</b>. The second voltage indicator <b>354</b> may be disposed between connection nodes <b>353</b> that connect to the drive motors <b>210</b> and the inverter circuit <b>208</b> to detect a voltage condition occurring during, for example, a bus bar fracture where the DC link <b>312</b> is not continuous, in order to diagnose whether the inverter circuit <b>208</b> is operating.</p>

The electronic controller may be a single controller or may include more than one controller disposed to control various functions and/or features of a machine. For example, a master controller, used to control the overall operation and function of the machine, may be cooperatively implemented with a motor or engine controller, used to control the engine <b>202</b>. In this embodiment, the term &#x201c;controller&#x201d; is meant to include one, two, or more controllers that may be associated with the machine <b>100</b> and that may cooperate in controlling various functions and operations of the machine <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The functionality of the controller, while shown conceptually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to include various discrete functions for illustrative purposes only, may be implemented in hardware and/or software without regard to the discrete functionality shown. Accordingly, various interfaces of the controller are described relative to components of the drive system shown in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Such interfaces are not intended to limit the type and number of components that are connected, nor the number of controllers that are described.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will be appreciated that the controllers discussed herein are or comprise a computing device, e.g., a processor, which reads computer-executable instructions from a computer-readable medium and executes those instructions. Media that are readable by a computer include both tangible and intangible media. Examples of the former include magnetic discs, optical discs, flash memory, RAM, ROM, tapes, cards, etc. Examples of the latter include acoustic signals, electrical signals, AM and FM waves, etc. As used in the appended claims, the term &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; denotes only tangible media that are readable by a computer unless otherwise specifically noted in the claim.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a controller <b>500</b>, which can be an electronic controller, is disposed to receive a voltage signal provided at a node <b>502</b>, which voltage signal is indicative of the instantaneous DC voltage present at the DC link <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The voltage transducer <b>314</b>, for example, measures this value. In a similar fashion, the controller <b>500</b> receives a torque command signal provided at a second node <b>504</b>, which is indicative of the torque being commanded by an operator of the machine. The torque command signal may be generated directly or indirectly by an accelerator pedal or lever that is displaced by the operator. In an alternate embodiment, the torque command signal may be generated by the same or another controller of the machine, e.g., a speed governor.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the machine <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) may include sensors that measure the rotational speed of each of the drive motors. For example, the motors <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may each have a speed sensor (not shown) integrated or otherwise associated therewith. Each speed sensor may be arranged to measure a rotational speed of each motor <b>210</b> and make such information available to the electronic controller <b>500</b> via appropriate connections there between. Hence, the electronic controller <b>500</b> receives first and second motor speed signals at a third and fourth nodes <b>506</b> and <b>508</b>, respectively. In one embodiment, the first and second motor speed signals are indicative of the rotational speed of each of two electric drive motors of the machine. In an alternative embodiment having fewer or more than two drive motors, the electronic controller may be arranged to receive a respective drive motor speed signal for each drive motor of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The electronic controller <b>500</b> further receives signals indicative of operating parameters of the engine. For example, the electronic controller receives an engine speed (RPM) at a fifth node <b>510</b>, which is indicative of the rotational speed of the engine. The electronic controller <b>500</b> may receive other information from the engine or a separate controller (not shown) that is connected to the engine. Such other engine parameters can include an actual fuel command to the injectors of the engine at a sixth node <b>512</b>, a boost pressure or air pressure in the intake manifold of the engine at a seventh node <b>514</b>, and other parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The electronic controller <b>500</b> may also receive signals indicative of other parameters that relate to the operation of other machine systems or to the operating environment of the machine. Such signals include a throttle position at an eighth node <b>516</b>. The throttle position signal may be a signal indicative of the position as well as the rate of change of position of a control of the operator that is used to set the acceleration state of the machine. A gear position at a ninth node <b>518</b> carries a signal that is indicative of the state of a gear system of the machine. Such a gear system may be employed, for example, to set a travel direction of the machine, to adjust the torque between one or more drive motors of the machine and the wheels, to operate a motor connected to an implement of the machine, and so forth. Lastly, the electronic controller <b>500</b> may receive other inputs that are indicative of the operating environment of the machine, such as a barometric pressure at tenth node <b>520</b>, an ambient temperature at an eleventh node <b>522</b>, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The electronic controller <b>500</b> is connected to and operates to control the operation of various components and systems of the machine. In one embodiment, the electronic controller <b>500</b> is connected to the inverter circuit <b>208</b> that operates the drive motors <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The electronic controller <b>500</b> is arranged to control the power generation of the system, for example, by adjusting the excitation voltage to control the voltage at the DC link <b>312</b> during operation, by sending an appropriate power generation control command signal to the alternator <b>204</b> via first output node <b>524</b>. The power generation control command signal may be appropriately limited and modified to represent the maximum permissible increase or, in general, rate of change of power generation that the direct series electric drive system can deliver under any given steady state or transient operating circumstances. The methods of limiting and modifying the generation control command signal by the electronic controller <b>500</b> are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The electronic controller <b>500</b> is capable of executing control algorithms that provide closed loop regulation of power generation output, for example, of the voltage at the DC link <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) by employing various compensation schemes such as proportional/integral (PI) control with lead compensation, non-linear gain scheduling of controller gain parameters and others, which are configured to provide robust and fast closed loop response. From a broad perspective, the electronic controller <b>500</b> can consider the operating state of the alternator in terms of predicting the state of the magnetic fields when changes in the operation of the machine are commanded, as well as being capable of proactively effecting changes in the power generation of the system based on a load change indication in a manner that maintains stability in the system by reducing lag in the response of the power generation system. At the same time, the electronic controller may also be capable of predicting the rate of change of delivery of power by the engine when the engine is undergoing transient state changes, as well as being able to cope or react to operating conditions that would tend to place the engine in an underspeed condition, for example, when load increases occur suddenly in the drive system as would occur when a fully loaded machine begins ascending a steep incline from a dead stop.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To address such conditions, concurrent changes to the power of the alternator by adjustment of the excitation signal are required. If such conditions are not effectively addressed, a mismatch in the power supply and consumption of the drive system may occur, which can lead to either a drop in the voltage of the DC link or to a dramatic increase in the current of the DC link during operation. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, proactive control of power generation is used to insure that sufficient power is generated to accommodate a change in power consumption. Such proactive control of power generation may be implemented instead of or in addition to other power management or power generation and consumption balancing methods. For example, a previously proposed control device and method effected changes to the power consumption of the system by adjusting the torque commanded to the drive motors.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">One such previously proposed solution is described in further detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/210,896, which was published on Mar. 18, 2010, as Pub. No. US 2010-0066277 A1, is entitled &#x201c;Load Demand and Power Generation Balancing in Direct Series Electric Drive System,&#x201d; and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In this previously proposed solution, the power consumption of the system, i.e. the torque commanded to the motors, is limited by the ability of the power generation system to change its output. In the present disclosure, a proactive control of the power generation system enables a faster response of the power generation system that can be used in addition to or instead of load consumption management techniques. When used in addition to a power consumption management technique, such as that described in the aforementioned application, the limiting of the torque commands may be minimized or even avoided under various operating conditions. These and other functions of the electronic controller <b>500</b> are described below relative to exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents one embodiment for an electronic controller <b>600</b>, which is illustrated as a block diagram of various functional algorithms that are included in the electronic controller <b>600</b>. The electronic controller <b>600</b> includes subroutines that can impose predictive control to the power generation system of the machine <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) in response to the load consumption of the system, by implementing various compensation schemes such as a closed loop PI controller with lead compensation, non-linear gain scheduling of controller gain parameters, and other techniques. The techniques described herein provide robust, fast, and stable system response.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">More specifically, the electronic controller <b>600</b> includes a summing junction <b>602</b> that calculates a voltage error value, Verr <b>604</b>, between a desired DC link voltage value, Vdes <b>606</b>, and the actual DC link voltage value, Vact <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The desired voltage value Vdes <b>606</b> may be a value calculated based on various parameters, for example, a load or torque command, or may be a value determined based on an operating condition of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The voltage error value Verr <b>604</b> is indicative of a change in voltage that is required in the DC link to meet the demands of the system. In the illustrated embodiment, system stability is promoted by appropriately commanding a change in the excitation voltage of the generator. Such change in the excitation voltage of the alternator is arranged to provide the required voltage change in the DC link while still remaining within the acceptable rates of change of the various parameters in the system as well as in a fashion that minimizes or avoids torque limiting. Accordingly, the error value Verr <b>604</b> is provided to a lead compensator function <b>607</b> which compensates for inertia delays in the system. The lead compensator function is described in further detail relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> below. A compensated error value <b>608</b> provided by the lead compensator function <b>607</b> is provided to a closed loop controller, for example, the proportional/integral (PI) controller <b>610</b>, which is configured to provide an excitation voltage command <b>612</b>. The PI controller <b>610</b> is described in more detail below relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. By use of the disclosed configuration, the DC link voltage will change in response to changes in the excitation voltage command <b>612</b> such that the error Verr <b>604</b> is minimized during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A block diagram of one embodiment of the lead compensation function <b>607</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As shown, the lead compensation function <b>607</b> receives the voltage error Verr <b>604</b> as an input to a multiplier junction <b>702</b>. A voltage error gain <b>704</b>, which may be a constant or variable parameter, is multiplied into the voltage error Verr <b>604</b> to provide a scaled error value <b>706</b>. Scaling of the error value in this fashion is done to insure that the proper units and magnitudes of the error are used in subsequent calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The scaled error value <b>706</b> may generally be regarded as the extent to which the output voltage of the alternator must be changed. The alternator or DC link voltage is changed by a corresponding change in the magnitude of the excitation voltage provided to the alternator, for example, at the excitation windings <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In this way, the response of the alternator to a changing excitation voltage may be analyzed as a dynamic system having excitation voltage as an input and DC link voltage as an output. As with any dynamic system, a rational transfer function of the response of the alternator output to a changing excitation voltage input will have zeros and poles when plotted on the complex plane. Thus, by understanding the stable regions of a system's response, a filter may be used to insure a stable system response regardless of input fluctuation. Thus, the lead compensation function may operate as a filter in addition to providing other functions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">More specifically, the scaled error value <b>706</b> is provided to a summing junction <b>708</b>. The scaled error value <b>706</b> is also provided to a polar coordinate transform <b>710</b>, the result of which is multiplied by a zero gain <b>712</b> at a multiplier <b>714</b>. The result of the multiplication at <b>714</b> represents a zero compensation term <b>716</b>, which is subtracted from the scaled error value <b>706</b> at the junction <b>708</b>. The difference between the scaled error value <b>706</b> and the zero compensation term <b>716</b> is again transformed to polar coordinates at <b>718</b> and is multiplied by a pole gain <b>720</b> at a multiplier <b>722</b>. The result of this multiplication is a pole compensation term <b>724</b>. In an implementation of an electronic controller that conducts calculations in cyclical fashion, the pole compensation term <b>724</b> corresponds to the immediately previous value of the scaled error value <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The result of the summing junction <b>708</b>, which represents a compensated error value based on the poles and zeros of the system, is provided to an integrator filter <b>726</b>. The integrator filter <b>726</b> provides the compensated error value <b>608</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) as its output. As previously discussed, the compensated error value <b>608</b> is provided to the PI controller <b>610</b>. A block diagram of one possible implementation of the PI controller <b>610</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a typical PI controller <b>610</b> is shown, although other control algorithms may be used. To promote system stability over a broad range of operating conditions, the PI controller <b>610</b> includes gain scheduling. The control input to the PI controller <b>610</b> is the compensated error value <b>608</b>, which drives the excitation voltage command <b>612</b> as an output. In this way, changes in the actual and desired DC link voltages Vdes <b>606</b> and Vact <b>502</b>, which determine the compensated error value <b>608</b>, directly determine changes in the excitation voltage command <b>612</b>, which as previously described determines the actual voltage Vact <b>502</b> provided to the DC link by the alternator.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown, the PI controller <b>610</b> includes a summing junction <b>730</b> that determines a voltage error difference <b>732</b> based on the different between the compensated error value <b>608</b> and the excitation voltage command <b>612</b>. In other words, the PI controller <b>610</b> is a closed loop controller that uses its output, the excitation voltage command <b>612</b>, as feedback. The voltage error difference <b>732</b> is provided separately to a proportional term calculation <b>734</b> and to a integral term calculation <b>736</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The proportional term calculation <b>734</b> includes a proportional function <b>738</b> that essentially multiplies the voltage error difference <b>732</b> by a proportional gain <b>740</b> to provide a proportional term <b>742</b>. Although the proportional gain <b>740</b> may be a constant, it may also be determined dynamically according to a gain schedule. Any appropriate machine parameter may be used as the basis for determining the proportional gain according to the gain schedule such that the response time and stability of the PI controller <b>610</b> may be improved. In the illustrated embodiment, the voltage error difference <b>732</b> is used as an input to the gain schedule determinator, which in the illustrated embodiment is a non-linear function. For instance, the proportional gain may be increased for large values of the voltage error difference <b>732</b> and be reduced for small values such that the time response of the system may be improved. The gain schedule determinator may operate as a single dimensional equation, a lookup table, a model based algorithm, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Similar to the proportional term calculation <b>734</b>, the integral term calculation <b>736</b> includes an integral function <b>744</b> that calculates a value indicative of the rate of change of the voltage error difference <b>732</b>. The rate of change of the voltage error difference <b>732</b> is scaled by an integral gain <b>746</b>. The scaled integral value is provided as an integral term <b>748</b>. Although the integral gain <b>746</b> may be a constant, it may also be determined dynamically according to a gain schedule. Any appropriate machine parameter may be used as the basis for determining the integral gain according to the gain schedule such that the response time and stability of the PI controller <b>610</b> may be improved. In the illustrated embodiment, the voltage error difference <b>732</b> is used as an input to the gain schedule determinator. For instance, the integral gain may be decreased for large values of the voltage error difference <b>732</b> and be increased for small values such that the time response of the system may be improved. The gain schedule determinator may operate as a single dimensional equation, a lookup table, a model based algorithm, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The proportional and integral terms <b>742</b> and <b>748</b> are added at a summing junction <b>750</b> to yield a control signal <b>752</b>. The control signal <b>752</b> is converted in a process function <b>754</b> to become the excitation voltage command <b>612</b>. The process function <b>754</b> may include unit and other conversions to appropriately format the control signal <b>752</b> into a value that is appropriate for commanding a change in the excitation voltage. For example, the process function <b>754</b> may convert the otherwise continuous values provided by the control signal <b>752</b> into discrete values, such as in the form of a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal. Moreover, the process function <b>754</b> may include maximum and minimum value delimiters for the excitation voltage command <b>612</b>, which are configured to maintain the output within a predetermined range that may be fixed or variable.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The industrial applicability of the methods and systems for power management as described herein should be readily appreciated from the foregoing discussion. The present disclosure is applicable to many machines and many environments. One exemplary machine suited to the disclosure is an off-highway truck. Exemplary off-highway trucks are commonly used in mines, construction sites, and quarries. Entities that use these off-highway trucks often sustain significant monetary losses from an off-highway truck that is not operating at peak efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Off-highway trucks, particularly those adapted to use electric, hybrid, or direct series electric drive systems, are subject to sudden load changes, and it can often be difficult to accommodate such load changes. Thus, a method and system that can improve the speed and accuracy with which a machine responds to changing power demands can significantly increase operating efficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, the methods and systems described above can be adapted to a large variety of machines and tasks. For example, other types of industrial machines, such as backhoe loaders, compactors, feller bunchers, forest machines, industrial loaders, skid steer loaders, wheel loaders and many other machines can benefit from the methods and systems described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one alternative embodiment, the active control of the power output of the alternator may be augmented by the addition of dynamic ramp rate limiters to various parameters, which limiters can be customized to match the physical characteristics of components of the drive system, such as the electric motors, the alternator, and the like. The limiters described below and/or other similar limiters may be used instead of or, advantageously, in addition to the active controller described herein. Accordingly, a partial block diagram of functionality that may be found within the electronic controller <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in addition to functionality already described is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the illustrated embodiment, the electronic controller <b>500</b> includes additional functionality to limit the rate of change of various parameters dynamically during operation. More specifically, the torque command <b>504</b> is multiplied by a motor speed, for example, the first motor speed <b>506</b>, at a multiplier <b>802</b>. Alternatively, the speed of the second or any other motor may be used. In one embodiment, the controller may use the average speed of all drive or other motors on a machine. The product <b>804</b>, which represents a normalized torque command based on the then present speed of one or more motors, is provided to a dynamic rate limiter <b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The dynamic rate limiter <b>806</b> may be any appropriate function or operation that controls or limits the rate of change of a parameter during operation. For example, the limiter <b>806</b> may be a derivative based calculation, a filter, or any other appropriate type of function that avoids spikes or valleys in a parameter signal that exceed a predetermined minimum or maximum magnitude. In the illustrated embodiment, the limiter <b>806</b> may include a comparator that compares a current with a previous value and delimits that difference based on a predetermined threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The output <b>808</b> of the limiter <b>806</b> is a rate-adjusted parameter generally indicative of power, which is divided by the motor speed <b>506</b> at a divider <b>810</b> to yield a modified torque command <b>812</b>. During operation, the modified torque command <b>812</b> will track the torque command <b>504</b> but will advantageously avoid excessive changes in the value of the torque command <b>504</b> that may result in a mismatch between the torque commanded of the system and the transient torque capability of the system. The normalization of the torque command by the motor speed, which may have units equivalent to power, can help insure that that the rate limiting is consonant with the power state of the machine during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A similar configuration is used to control the rate of change of other parameters. In the illustrated embodiment, the controller <b>500</b> is further configured to dynamically limit the rate of change of the DC link voltage parameter <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and of the electrical power of the drive motors. Accordingly, a motor power <b>814</b> and, optionally, a motor efficiency <b>816</b> are provided to the controller <b>500</b>. The motor power <b>814</b> may be a value indicative of the power collectively used by the drive motors of a machine at any given time. The motor efficiency <b>816</b> is a parameter indicative of the operating efficiency of the electric drive system that can be calculated based on known system response as well as based on environmental conditions such as ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The motor power <b>814</b> is divided by the motor efficiency <b>816</b> at a divider <b>818</b> to yield a corrected power value <b>820</b>, which is provided to an additional rate limiter function <b>822</b> that yields a rate-adjusted power value <b>824</b>. The motor efficiency <b>816</b> is multiplied back out of the rate-adjusted power value <b>824</b> at a multiplier <b>826</b> to yield a modified electrical power value <b>828</b>, which can be used in the controller <b>500</b> for various calculations and operations. The modified electrical power value <b>828</b> is indicative of a realistic estimation of the physical capability of the motors to consume or otherwise use electrical power during operation because, in one aspect, it accounts for various mechanical aspects of the structure of the electrical drive system such as moment of inertia, machine payload, grade of travel, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The expected DC link voltage <b>502</b> is also used as a basis for modifying the corrected power value <b>820</b> as the drive system is the largest consistent consumer of electrical power in the drive system. More particularly, the corrected power value <b>820</b> is divided by the DC link voltage <b>502</b> at a divider <b>830</b> to yield a corrected DC link current value <b>832</b>. The corrected DC link current value <b>832</b> is provided to yet another dynamic rate limiter function <b>834</b> that yields a rate-adjusted DC link current value <b>836</b>. The DC link voltage <b>502</b> and the motor efficiency <b>816</b> are multiplied back out of the rate-adjusted DC link current value <b>836</b> at a multiplier <b>838</b> to yield a modified electrical power <b>840</b>, which can then be used in the various calculations and estimations of the controller <b>500</b>. In this way, the operation of the machine can become more stable insofar as the various mechanical aspects of the operation of the alternator, such as inertia, ambient temperature and the like, can be considered when changes in the voltage of the DC link are required.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In general, the systems and methods described herein are well suited for applications of propulsion systems in which the torque applied to move a machine is based on operator requests, such as a throttle input command signal, as well as machine operating parameters, such as a motor torque versus speed curve. In this type of propulsion configuration, changes in the alternator power output are required. The method described herein provides for such changes that are arranged to match the power requirements of a system while minimizing the torque limiting of command signals that were previously used to match the power output of the alternator to the maximum feasible power consumption of the machine. In this way, mismatches of load and power supply are minimized during certain operating conditions of the machine, such as hill starts, in which the change in power can be high, grade changes, in which although power may remain constant while the driving voltage may change with motor speed, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, a flowchart for one embodiment of a method for controlling the power response of a hybrid propulsion system for a machine is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The method is configured to improve the response of a power generation system by reducing the gap created between the inherent power generation system response and changes in load consumption. This method may be used in conjunction with or instead of previously proposed methods aimed at curtailing load consumption to match power generation capability in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">More particularly, the method includes providing signals indicative of various operating parameters to an electronic controller at <b>902</b>. The operating parameters provided at <b>902</b> may include various machine and propulsion parameters, such as a torque command signal, an actual voltage at the output of an alternator, and the like. The electronic controller processes the various operating parameter signals at <b>904</b> and provides a desired voltage at the output of the alternator at <b>906</b>. The desired voltage determined at <b>906</b> may depend on a load command, the operating state of an engine or alternator, and/or other parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The desired voltage determined at <b>906</b> is compared with an actual voltage at the output of the alternator at <b>908</b>. A determination whether the actual and desired voltages match is made at <b>910</b>. At times when the actual voltage substantially matches the desired voltage, the process repeats starting at <b>902</b>. At times when the actual and desired voltages do not match, the method proceeds at <b>912</b> with a determination of the extent of change in actual voltage that is required to reach the desired voltage. This determination is made, for example, in the illustrated embodiment by calculating a difference between the desired and actual voltage values Vdes and Vact (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and by carrying out subsequent operations when the difference is non-zero.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The voltage difference determined at <b>912</b> is provided to a lead compensator at <b>914</b>. The lead compensator <b>914</b> may optionally filter the voltage difference signal at <b>916</b> and/or integrate the signal at <b>918</b> for predetermined periods, as well as compensate for poles and zeros of a relevant machine system's transfer function at <b>920</b>. A compensated voltage difference value is provided from the lead compensator at <b>922</b>.
