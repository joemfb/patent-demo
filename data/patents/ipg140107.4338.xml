<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to network communications and relates more particularly to the handling of performance alerts in a packet network, e.g., an Internet Protocol (IP) networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network is a type of IP network that delivers voice communications. These communications produce call detail records (CDRs), which are computer records containing the details of the calls that are handled by the VoIP network. Although traditionally used for billing purposes, CDRs may also be used to monitor the performance of the VoIP network. In particular, if a network element performance management system detects a call failure in a CDR (such as a dropped call), the network element performance management system generates an alert that may be forwarded, for example, to a network administrator or a security system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Any given call failure will typically result in a plurality of such alerts. For instance, multiple network elements involved in a failed call may each produce CDRs that generate an alert for the same failed call, or a single network element may produce multiple CDRs that generate multiple types of alerts for the same failed call. Such a volume of redundant alerts wastes the resources of administrators and also increases the likelihood of inaccurate network performance results being generated. Moreover, the volume of redundant alerts often makes it difficult for administrators to isolate faults and detect delays in the VoIP network.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the present disclosure is a method and apparatus for correlating and suppressing performance alerts in a packet network, e.g., an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Embodiments of the disclosure may be implemented, for example, to correlate performance alerts generated by network element performance management systems in a Voice over IP (VoIP) network. In particular, the disclosure correlates performance alerts for calls and/or network elements that indicate the same type of call failure, and then takes steps to suppress further alerts for the same type of call failure from these calls and/or network elements. As a result, redundant alerts are significantly reduced. This not only improves the accuracy of the performance alerts, but also reduces the amount of time required to analyze and respond to performance alerts. Although the present disclosure is described below within the exemplary context of a VoIP network, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques disclosed herein may be extended to IP networks and packet networks in general.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary packet network <b>100</b>, configured according to embodiments of the current disclosure. Exemplary packet networks include IP networks, Ethernet networks, and the like. An IP network is broadly defined as a network that uses Internet Protocol such as IPv4 or IPv6, and the like to exchange data packets. In one embodiment, the packet network <b>100</b> is a VoIP network.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, a first plurality of endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> reside outside the packet network and are configured for communication with the core packet network <b>110</b> (e.g., an IP-based core backbone network) via a first access network <b>101</b>. Similarly, a second plurality of endpoint devices <b>105</b>-<b>107</b> reside outside the packet network and are configured for communication with the core packet network <b>110</b> via a second access network <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The network elements (NEs) <b>109</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>, and <b>120</b> may serve as gateway servers or edge routers for the core packet network <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the first and second pluralities of endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and <b>105</b>-<b>107</b> may comprise ISDN private branch exchanges (PBXs), automatic call distributors (ACDs), or ISDN telephones. In one embodiment, the first and second access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b> are time division multiplex (TDM) networks, and the like. In another embodiment, the first and second access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b> are IP-based networks, similar to the core packet network <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b> may comprise customer endpoint devices such as personal computers, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), landline telephones, cellular telephones, servers, routers, and the like. In one embodiment, at least some of the endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b> are ISDN telephones. The first and second access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b> serve as a means to establish a connection between the endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b> and the NEs <b>109</b> and <b>111</b> of the core packet network <b>110</b>. Thus, the endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b> are outside of the access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b> and the core packet network <b>110</b>. The first and second access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b> may each comprise a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) network, a broadband cable access network, a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wireless Access Network (WAN), a third party network, a cellular network and the like. The first and second access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b> may be either directly connected to NEs <b>109</b> and <b>111</b> of the core packet network <b>110</b>, or indirectly through another network.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some NEs (e.g., NEs <b>109</b> and <b>111</b>) reside at the edge of the core packet network <b>110</b> and interface with customer endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b> over various types of access networks (e.g., first and second access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b>). An NE that resides at the edge of a core infrastructure is typically implemented as an edge router, a media gateway, a border element, a firewall, a switch, or the like. An NE may also reside within the network (e.g., NEs <b>118</b>-<b>120</b>) and may be used as a mail server, a router, or a like device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the core packet network <b>110</b> also comprises an analyzer <b>112</b> and a correlator <b>122</b>. Collectively, the analyzer <b>112</b> and correlator <b>122</b> form a network element performance management system that classifies call detail records (CDRs), generates alerts from the CDRs, and performs correlation and suppression of the alerts. For example, the analyzer <b>112</b> may collect CDRs generally from the NEs <b>109</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>118</b>-<b>120</b> and/or CDRs based on the numbering plan areas (NPAs) of the customer endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b>. As discussed above, CDRs are electronic records containing the details of calls placed in the packet network <b>100</b>. The analyzer <b>112</b> parses call statistics from the data fields of the CDRs. These call statistics may include information that indicates call failures (e.g., blocked or cut off calls) or successful calls. It should be noted that there are many faults or call events that can be documented in the CDRs. As such, the illustrative faults discussed in the present disclosures are only illustrative in nature and should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the present disclosure. When the analyzer <b>112</b> detects a call failure in a CDR, the analyzer <b>112</b> outputs an alert that may be used to notify an administrator of a problem in the packet network <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the analyzer <b>112</b> may simply output the call statistics that indicate failures (and/or the corresponding CDRs) to a dedicated alert generator (not shown). In this case, the alert generator outputs the actual alerts based on the call statistics received from the analyzer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the correlator <b>122</b> is coupled to the analyzer <b>112</b> and receives the alerts that are generated from the CDR data. It should be noted that although the correlator <b>122</b> and the analyzer <b>112</b> are illustrated as two separate units, in one embodiment, the correlator <b>122</b> and the analyzer <b>112</b> can be implemented as a single system or module. The correlator <b>122</b> attempts to correlate the alerts into groups that indicate a common failure or root cause. For example, a single call failure may result in a plurality of alerts generated from the CDRs of multiple network elements and/or NPAs. Alternatively, the failure of a single network element may result in a plurality of alerts generated from the CDRs for calls that involved the failed network element. The correlator <b>122</b> applies one or more algorithms in order to correlate the alerts that are received. In addition, these algorithms may further require the correlator <b>122</b> to take measures to suppress further alerts related to certain network elements and/or NPAs, as discussed in further detail below. The correlator <b>122</b> outputs correlated alerts to a network administrator or security system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Those skilled in the art will realize that although only six endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b>, two access networks <b>101</b> and <b>108</b>, and so on are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the packet network <b>100</b> may be expanded by including additional endpoint devices, access networks, border elements, and the like without altering the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a method <b>200</b> for correlating and suppressing performance alerts in a packet network, e.g., an IP network. The method <b>200</b> may be implemented, for example, by the analyzer <b>112</b> and correlator <b>122</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As such, reference is made in the discussion of the method <b>200</b> to various elements of the packet network <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that the method <b>200</b> is not limited to deployment in networks configured as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The method <b>200</b> may, in fact, be deployed in networks that are configured in manners that differ from the configuration of the packet network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The method <b>200</b> is initialized in step <b>202</b> and proceeds to step <b>204</b>, where the analyzer <b>112</b> collects CDRs from the network elements <b>109</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>118</b>-<b>120</b> and/or from the NPAs of the endpoint devices <b>102</b>-<b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>206</b>, the analyzer <b>112</b> parses call statistics from the collected CDRs. For example, the analyzer <b>112</b> examines the data fields of the CDRs for information that would indicate a call failure or a call success.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In step <b>208</b>, the analyzer <b>112</b> generates one or more alerts, based on the call statistics. These alerts may indicate, for example, a blockage at a network element or in an NPA, a cutoff at a network element or in an NPA, the presence of a busy signal, a packet loss, the presence of a disconnect cause code, the presence of a data not ready signal, or the lack of an answer to a call. Again, this is only an illustrative list of recorded call events and the present disclosure is not limited to this list.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In step <b>210</b>, the correlator <b>122</b> correlates the alerts. In particular, the correlator <b>122</b> groups the alerts into sets that indicate a common problem or a root cause. For example, a plurality of alerts generated from CDRs from a plurality of different network elements may indicate the same call failure. Similarly, a plurality of alerts generated from CDRs from a given NPA may indicate the same network element failure in a particular NPA.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step <b>212</b>, the correlator <b>122</b> suppresses redundant alerts, using information from the correlation step (i.e., step <b>210</b>). In particular, the correlator <b>122</b> suppresses further alerts that relate to one of the common problems or root causes identified in the correlation step. In one embodiment, the suppression of redundant alerts is guided by one or more specific algorithms that determine when and how to suppress alerts. In general, these algorithms suppress NPA-related alerts when the root cause is a network element problem, and suppress network element-based alerts when the root cause is an NPA (i.e., routing-related) problem. In one embodiment, this also includes generating only one network element-based alert and suppressing other network element-based alerts when calls have the same call flow with the same root cause. Some exemplary algorithms that may be used to suppress alerts are discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In step <b>214</b>, the correlator <b>122</b> outputs the correlated results, for example to a security system or to a network administrator. The method <b>200</b> then terminates in step <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a first exemplary scenario in which multiple alerts may be generated from CDRs produced by the same network element for multiple calls having the same type of call failure. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates three calls placed to the NPA &#x201c;732&#x201d;, from callers A, B, and C. All three of these calls fail due to a fault at the network element labeled as NE<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Without the correlation and suppression technique discussed above, at least two different alerts will be generated for this fault. Assuming that the &#x201c;blockage node&#x201d; alert threshold for the network elements is two (i.e., two failed calls), a first alert will be generated. In addition, assuming that the &#x201c;blockage NPA&#x201d; alert threshold for the NPA (La, NPA <b>732</b>) of the network element NE<b>2</b> is three (i.e., three failed calls), a second alert will also be generated. In one embodiment, counts for the number of failed calls for each NPA and the network elements are maintained, and the alerts are generated by the network element performance management system when these counts meet or exceed their respective thresholds.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the present disclosure employs a correlation and suppression algorithm that results in only a single alert being generated for the call failure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As discussed above, assuming that the threshold is two for the network element NE<b>2</b>, a &#x201c;blockage node&#x201d; alert will be generated for the network element NE<b>2</b> when A's and B's calls to the NPA <b>732</b> fail. When this occurs, the correlation and suppression method of the present disclosure will reduce the failed call count for &#x201c;blockage NPA&#x201d; alerts for the NPA <b>732</b> by two (i.e., the number of failed calls thus far counted for the network element NE<b>2</b>); thus the new failed call count for the NPA <b>732</b> is zero. Next, when C calls the NPA <b>732</b> and fails, the count for &#x201c;blockage NPA&#x201d; alerts will be only one. Thus, no &#x201c;blockage NPA&#x201d; alert will be generated by the network element performance management system at this time (again assuming that the threshold for &#x201c;blockage NPA&#x201d; alerts is three). Therefore, by suppressing &#x201c;blockage NPA&#x201d; alerts for an NPA in which a &#x201c;blockage node&#x201d; alert has already been generated, the number of alerts generated for the same type of call failure can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a second exemplary scenario in which multiple alerts for the same type of call failure may be generated from a single network element for a single call. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one call placed to 911 from caller A (whose telephone number is 732-420-1111). This call fails due to a fault at the network element NE<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Without the correlation and suppression technique discussed above, at least two different alerts will be generated for this fault. Assuming that the &#x201c;originating caller 911 cutoff&#x201d; alert threshold for the calling number 732-420-1111 is one (i.e., one failed call), a first alert will be generated. An &#x201c;originating caller 911 cutoff&#x201d; is an NPA-related alert. In addition, assuming that the &#x201c;cutoff 911 node&#x201d; alert threshold for the network element NE<b>2</b> is one (i.e., one failed call), a second alert will also be generated. Counts for the number of failed calls for each calling number and the network elements are maintained, and the alerts are generated by the network element performance management system when these counts meet or exceed their respective thresholds.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the present disclosure employs a correlation and suppression algorithm that results in only a single alert being generated for the call failure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As discussed above, assuming that the threshold is one for the calling number 732-420-1111 dialing 911, an &#x201c;originating caller 911 cutoff&#x201d; alert will be generated for the calling number 732-420-1111 when A's call to 911 fails. When this happens, the correlation and suppression method of the present disclosure will reduce the failed call count for &#x201c;cutoff 911 node&#x201d; alerts for the network element NE<b>2</b> by one (i.e., the number of failed calls thus far counted for the calling number 732-420-1111); thus the new failed call count for the network element NE<b>2</b> is zero. As a result, no &#x201c;cutoff 911 node&#x201d; alert will be generated by the network element performance management system at this time (again assuming that the threshold for &#x201c;cutoff 911 node&#x201d; alerts is one). Therefore, by suppressing &#x201c;cutoff 911 node&#x201d; alerts for a network element that serves an NPA in which an &#x201c;originating caller 911 cutoff&#x201d; alert has already been generated, the number of alerts generated for the same type of call failure can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a third exemplary scenario in which multiple alerts may be generated from multiple network elements for the multiple calls having the same type of call failure. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates ten calls placed from the same NPA (La, NPA <b>732</b>) to the same NPA (i.e., NPA <b>908</b>), from callers A<b>1</b> through A<b>10</b> to callees B<b>1</b> through B<b>10</b>, respectively. All ten of these calls fail due to faults at multiple network elements labeled as NE<b>1</b>-NE<b>4</b>. Specifically, all callers receive a signal indicating that the telephone numbers that they are respectively calling are busy.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Without the correlation and suppression technique discussed above, at least four different alerts will be generated for this fault. Assuming that the &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alert threshold for each of the network elements is ten (i.e., ten failed calls), one alert will be generated for each of the network elements NE<b>1</b>, NE<b>2</b>, NE<b>3</b>, and NE<b>4</b>. The network elements each maintains counts for the number of failed calls, and the alerts are generated by the network element performance management system when these counts meet or exceed their respective thresholds.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the present disclosure employs a correlation and suppression algorithm that results in only a single alert being generated for the call failures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As discussed above, assuming that the threshold is ten for each of the networks elements, when callers' A<b>1</b>-A<b>10</b> calls fail, the network element NE<b>4</b> will generate an error message that is propagated back through NE<b>3</b>, NE<b>2</b>, and NE<b>1</b>. This error message ensures that the callers A<b>1</b>-A<b>10</b> will hear an audible &#x201c;busy&#x201d; ring-back. The CDRs for each of the network elements NE<b>1</b>-NE<b>4</b> will contain this error message. In addition, a &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alert will be generated for each of these network elements NE<b>1</b>-NE<b>4</b> when their respective &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alert thresholds are crossed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the present disclosure uses multiple common fields (such as the NPAs of the calling and called numbers) for all &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alerts. Thus, only one &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alert for the network element NE<b>1</b> needs to be generated; &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alerts for the remaining network elements NE<b>2</b>-NE<b>4</b> are not generated. Therefore, by suppressing &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alerts for a network element in an NPA in which a &#x201c;busy node&#x201d; alert has already been generated for another network element, the number of alerts generated by the network element performance management system for the same type of call failure can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a high level block diagram of the alert correlation and suppression method that is implemented using a general purpose computing device <b>600</b>. The general purpose computing device <b>600</b> may be part of a media gateway, for example. In one embodiment, a general purpose computing device <b>600</b> comprises a processor <b>602</b>, a memory <b>604</b>, a correlation and suppression module <b>605</b> and various input/output (I/O) devices <b>606</b> such as a display, a keyboard, a mouse, a modem, a stylus, a joystick, a keypad, controller, a network interface, and the like. In one embodiment, at least one I/O device is a storage device (e.g., a disk drive, an optical disk drive, a floppy disk drive). It should be understood that the correlation and suppression module <b>605</b> can be implemented as a physical device or subsystem that is coupled to a processor through a communication channel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, the correlation and suppression module <b>605</b> can be represented by one or more software applications (or even a combination of software and hardware, e.g., using Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)), where the software is loaded from a storage medium (e.g., I/O devices <b>606</b>) and operated by the processor <b>602</b> in the memory <b>604</b> of the general purpose computing device <b>600</b>.
