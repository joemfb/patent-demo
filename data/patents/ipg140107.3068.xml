<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the structure of a related art, a contact section between a touch panel and a portable device is provided at an edge of the touch panel. For example, when a flexible substrate is connected to the touch panel, the flexible substrate extends from the edge of the touch panel. The flexible substrate is connected to the touch panel at one end and to a control board in a housing at the other end. The flexible substrate extends into the housing such that a waterproof structure is provided between the flexible substrate and the housing. The waterproof structure is provided to prevent water from entering through a space between the flexible substrate and the housing. However, when such a waterproof structure is provided, the number of components of the portable device increases.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a portable device described below, the number of components of a waterproofed touch panel may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A mobile phone will be described as an example of a portable device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a mobile phone <b>1</b> according to an embodiment.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the touch panel <b>30</b> includes a design sheet <b>31</b>, a first sensor <b>32</b>, a second sensor <b>34</b>, and a reinforcing plate <b>38</b>. The design sheet <b>31</b> is located on a front side of the touch panel <b>30</b>. The design sheet <b>31</b> is flexible and is made of synthetic resin. The design sheet <b>31</b> is bonded to a front surface of the first sensor <b>32</b>. The design sheet <b>31</b> has a function of protecting the first sensor <b>32</b>. The design sheet <b>31</b> is optically transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each of the first sensor <b>32</b> and the second sensor <b>34</b> includes a conductive film, which will be described in detail below. The reinforcing plate <b>38</b> is located on a back surface of the second sensor <b>34</b>. The reinforcing plate <b>38</b> is made of synthetic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second housing <b>70</b> includes a bottom wall section <b>72</b> and a peripheral wall section <b>74</b> provided on the bottom wall section <b>72</b>. The first housing <b>40</b> is bonded to a top surface of the peripheral wall section <b>74</b>. The first housing <b>40</b> includes a peripheral wall section <b>44</b> that projects inward. The first housing <b>40</b> and the second housing <b>70</b> are made of synthetic resin. The first housing <b>40</b> and the second housing <b>70</b> function as a housing of the display unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The touch panel <b>30</b> is bonded to the peripheral wall section <b>44</b> with a piece of double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b>. The double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b> has waterproof properties. The double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b> corresponds to a waterproof member that prevents water from flowing into the display unit <b>20</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b> is applied to a back surface of the touch panel <b>30</b> along the peripheral edge. The touch panel <b>30</b> is bonded to the first housing <b>40</b> so as to cover the opening <b>42</b>. The peripheral edge section of the back surface of the touch panel <b>30</b> corresponds to a bonding section of the touch panel <b>30</b> that is bonded to the first housing <b>40</b>. More specifically, a peripheral edge section of a back surface of the reinforcing plate <b>38</b> corresponds to the bonding section.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cut section <b>30</b>P is formed in the touch panel <b>30</b>. The cut section <b>30</b>P is formed by partially cutting the second sensor <b>34</b> and the reinforcing plate <b>38</b>. The back surface of the first sensor <b>32</b> is partially exposed at the cut section <b>30</b>P. Contact sections <b>37</b> to which the flexible substrate <b>39</b> is connected to at one end are provided on the exposed section of the first sensor <b>32</b>. The contact sections <b>37</b> are connected to the flexible substrate <b>39</b> by an anisotropic conductive film (ACF) connection. The contact sections <b>37</b> have a function of providing an electrical connection between the touch panel <b>30</b> and an external device. The number of the contact sections <b>37</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described above, the contact sections <b>37</b> are positioned inside the double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b> at the back side of the touch panel <b>30</b>. Therefore, the contact sections <b>37</b> and the flexible substrate <b>39</b> are surrounded by the first housing <b>40</b> and the second housing <b>70</b>. Thus, a waterproof structure is provided. The display unit <b>20</b> is waterproofed by a single piece of double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b>. Therefore, there are a fewer number of waterproof members, and the number of components of the display unit <b>20</b> is reduced accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The peripheral edge section of the back surface of the touch panel <b>30</b> is bonded to the first housing <b>40</b>, and a peripheral edge section of a front surface of the touch panel <b>30</b> is not covered by another component. Therefore, the front surface of the touch panel <b>30</b> has a relatively large area. Accordingly, a relatively large operating area may be provided on the front surface of the touch panel <b>30</b>. For example, when a frame that covers the peripheral edge section of the front surface of the touch panel <b>30</b> is provided on the housing, the operating area of the touch panel <b>30</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the structure of the touch panel <b>30</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first sensor <b>32</b> includes a substrate <b>32</b><i>a </i>and an indium tin oxide (ITO) film <b>32</b><i>b </i>formed on a back surface of the substrate <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The second sensor <b>34</b> includes a substrate <b>34</b><i>a </i>and an ITO film <b>34</b><i>b </i>formed on a front surface of the substrate <b>34</b><i>a</i>. The ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>correspond to a conductive film.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The substrate <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be a film. The film may be a polyester film, such as a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film. The substrate <b>32</b><i>a </i>may also be a plastic sheet. The plastic sheet may be a sheet of polycarbonate, polycycloolefin, acrylic resin, or the like. The substrate <b>34</b><i>a </i>is made of glass. The substrate <b>34</b><i>a </i>may instead be a film or a plastic sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>are an example of a metal oxide film. Zinc oxide films (ZnO films), for example, may be used as the ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>. The ITO film <b>32</b><i>b </i>may be formed on the substrate <b>32</b><i>a </i>by sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A bonding member <b>36</b> is provided between the first sensor <b>32</b> and the second sensor <b>34</b>. The bonding member <b>36</b> is interposed between a peripheral edge section of the ITO film <b>32</b><i>b </i>and a peripheral edge section of the ITO film <b>34</b><i>b</i>. The bonding member <b>36</b> is frame shaped. The bonding member <b>36</b> has a function of providing a space between the ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>such that the ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>do not come into contact with each other when the front surface of the touch panel <b>30</b> is not pressed. Thus, the ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>face each other with a space provided between the films.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a back view of the touch panel <b>30</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of the ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>is provided with a pair of electrodes. The ITO film <b>32</b><i>b </i>is provided with a pair of electrodes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>that face each other and that are approximately parallel to each other. The ITO film <b>34</b><i>b </i>is provided with a pair of electrodes <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>b </i>that face each other and that are approximately parallel to each other. The electrodes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>are approximately parallel to the electrodes <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>b</i>. The contact sections <b>37</b> include contact sections <b>37</b><i>a </i>to <b>37</b><i>d</i>. The contact sections <b>37</b><i>a </i>to <b>37</b><i>d </i>are electrically connected to the electrodes <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, and <b>33</b><i>a</i>, respectively. The electrical connections are provided by wires.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A function of the CPU mounted on the control board <b>60</b> will now be described. For example, when the touch panel <b>30</b> is pressed while a voltage is applied between the electrodes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b</i>, the ITO films <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>come into contact with each other. At this time, the CPU reads voltage values from the electrodes <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>b </i>and thereby detects the position in the Y-direction at which the touch panel <b>30</b> has been pressed. Similarly, when the touch panel <b>30</b> is pressed while a voltage is applied between the electrodes <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>b</i>, the CPU reads voltage values from the electrodes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>and thereby detects the position in the X-direction at which the touch panel <b>30</b> has been pressed. The above-described method for detecting the pressing position is commonly known.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, a display unit <b>20</b><i>x </i>having a structure different from that of the display unit <b>20</b> in the mobile phone <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate the display unit <b>20</b><i>x </i>having a structure different from that of the display unit <b>20</b> in the mobile phone <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x </i>extends out from an edge of a touch panel <b>30</b><i>x</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, contact sections <b>37</b><i>x </i>are provided at an edge of the touch panel <b>30</b><i>x</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a peripheral edge section of a back surface of a reinforcing plate <b>38</b><i>x </i>is bonded to a peripheral wall section <b>44</b><i>x </i>of a first housing <b>40</b><i>x </i>with a piece of double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b>. The flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x </i>extends into a housing formed by the first housing <b>40</b><i>x </i>and a second housing <b>70</b><i>x </i>through a through-hole <b>45</b><i>x </i>formed in the peripheral wall section <b>44</b><i>x</i>. The through-hole <b>45</b><i>x </i>extends in the direction of the thickness of the display unit <b>20</b><i>x</i>. A gasket <b>100</b><i>x </i>is provided between the inner wall of the through-hole <b>45</b><i>x </i>and the flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x</i>. The gasket <b>100</b><i>x </i>is elastic. The gasket <b>100</b><i>x </i>prevents water from flowing into the housing formed by the first housing <b>40</b><i>x </i>and the second housing <b>70</b><i>x </i>through a gap between the inner wall of the through-hole <b>45</b><i>x </i>and the flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, the flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x </i>extends from the edge of the touch panel <b>30</b>. In other words, the contact sections <b>37</b><i>x </i>are provided at the edge of the touch panel <b>30</b>. Therefore, the flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x </i>is located so as to extend into the display unit <b>20</b><i>x</i>, and it is desirable to provide the gasket <b>100</b><i>x</i>. Thus, two waterproof members, which are the double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b> and the gasket <b>100</b><i>x</i>, are provided in the display unit <b>20</b><i>x</i>. Accordingly, the number of components is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, in the mobile phone <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, providing the gasket <b>100</b><i>x </i>is unnecessary. Thus, it is acceptable to not provide a special additional waterproof member due to the presence of the flexible substrate <b>39</b>. Thus, the number of components in the mobile phone <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment is reduced by 1.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, to ensure the waterproof performance of the gasket <b>100</b><i>x</i>, the gasket <b>100</b><i>x </i>preferably has sufficient length in the direction of the thickness TD of the display unit <b>20</b><i>x</i>. If the gasket <b>100</b><i>x </i>is short, there is a risk that water will flow into the display unit <b>20</b><i>x</i>. Therefore, the dimension of the display unit <b>20</b><i>x </i>in the thickness direction TD is increased. In addition, since the flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x </i>extends from the edge of the touch panel <b>30</b>, the dimension of the display unit <b>20</b><i>x </i>along a planar direction PD is also increased.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">However, in the mobile phone <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the above-described waterproof structure may be omitted. Therefore, the dimension of the display unit <b>20</b> in the direction of the thickness TD may be reduced. In addition, the dimension of the display unit <b>20</b> in the planar direction PD may also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, an area around the contact sections <b>37</b><i>x</i>, that is, an area around a connecting section between the touch panel <b>30</b><i>x </i>and the flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x</i>, is exposed to the outside. Therefore, there is also a risk that water will flow into a space between a first sensor <b>32</b><i>x </i>and a second sensor <b>34</b><i>x </i>through a gap between the second sensor <b>34</b><i>x </i>and the flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>x. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, in the mobile phone <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flexible substrate <b>39</b> and the contact sections <b>37</b> are surrounded and thus waterproofed by the first housing <b>40</b> and the second housing <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, a display unit according to a modification will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a display unit <b>20</b><i>m </i>according to a modification. A cut section <b>30</b>Pm is formed by partially cutting a first sensor <b>32</b><i>m</i>, a second sensor <b>34</b><i>m</i>, and a reinforcing plate <b>38</b><i>m</i>. The cut section <b>30</b>Pm is slit-shaped. Contact sections <b>37</b><i>m </i>are located in an ITO film <b>34</b><i>b</i>. A flexible substrate <b>39</b><i>m </i>extends from a touch panel <b>30</b><i>m </i>through the cut section <b>30</b>Pm, and is connected to a connector <b>68</b>. Thus, the structure may be such that the contact sections <b>37</b><i>m </i>are not exposed. The display unit <b>20</b><i>m </i>includes a single housing <b>70</b><i>m</i>. The housing <b>70</b><i>m </i>includes a frame-shaped peripheral wall section <b>74</b><i>m </i>that extends along a peripheral edge of an opening in the housing <b>70</b><i>m</i>. The touch panel <b>30</b><i>m </i>is bonded to a top surface of the peripheral wall section <b>74</b><i>m </i>with a piece of double-sided adhesive tape <b>90</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The touch panel <b>30</b> and the control board <b>60</b> may be electrically coupled to each other using a component other than the flexible substrate <b>39</b>. For example, a connector pin may be provided on the control board <b>60</b> and be arranged such that the connector pin is in contact with the contact sections <b>37</b> of the touch panel <b>30</b>.
