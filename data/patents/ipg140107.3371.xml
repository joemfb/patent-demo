<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a memory, and more particularly, to a protection circuit for flash memory.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flash memory is a non-volatile memory that is capable of retaining data stored therein even when not powered. Since flash memory has the advantages of having low volume, low power consumption, good shock resistance and fast writing speed, flash memory is widely applied to various types of electronic products such as memory cards, portable disks, digital cameras, portable electronic game consoles, minicomputers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flash memories apply floating-gate transistors for storing data, and are divided into two types&#x2014;NOR flash and NAND flash according to an access mode of the flash memory; NOR flash memory is used for storing program code, and NAND flash memory is used for storing digital data. NAND flash memories are also divided into two structures according to the number of data stored in each of the transistors&#x2014;a single-level cell (SLC) structure and a multi-level cell (MLC) structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">NAND flash memory with the SLC structure has advantages of having a faster speed and lower power consumption, and each of the storage units in such NAND flash memory can store one information bit. Although a NAND flash memory with the MLC structure has a slower transmission speed and higher power consumption, each of the storage units in such NAND flash can store more than two information bits, thereby reducing production cost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">NOR flash memory comprises an address pin, a data pin and a control pin, which are independent from one another. In contrast, NAND flash memory transmits addresses, digital data and commands via a single input/output pin, and identifies types of current transmission information at the input/output pin via different control signals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With respect to NAND flash memory, in a write procedure, an external control chip or a microprocessor transmits target addresses and digital data in sequence to the NAND flash memory via the input/output pin. The digital data is first temporarily stored in buffers in the NAND flash memory, and is then shifted from the buffers to storage units corresponding to the target addresses in a write period after the control chip or the microprocessor gives a write command.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When power supply of the NAND flash memory is interrupted before the write period ends, digital data being written into certain storage units may be destroyed. Since data being stored into the NAND flash memory may be program code currently being executed or calculated or other important data, when errors of the data occur, an electronic product containing the NAND flash memory may crash or incur critical errors.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, many conventional flash memories comprise write protection pins. When a write protection pin of a conventional flash memory is programmed to a write protection status, the flash conventional memory rejects commands of writing data from any external systems. In theory, the conventional flash memory begins performing a write procedure only when the write protection pin is programmed to allow write operations.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the foregoing write period, when a user or an external system accidentally switches the write protection pin of the conventional flash memory to enable write protection, the write procedure in process is interrupted. Accordingly, digital data currently being written into certain storage units may be destroyed and thereby detrimentally influence normal operations of an electronic product containing the conventional flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Compared to NAND flash memory with the SLC structure, when power supply is cut off or the write protection pin is changed during the write procedure, the consequences caused in the NAND flash memory with the MLC structure becomes more severe since not only is the digital data in the process of being written into the storage units destroyed, but other digital data originally stored in the same storage units may also be ruined.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Solutions for solving the foregoing problem of data destruction of a flash memory are not yet available in the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, a protection circuit and a power supply system applied to a flash memory are provided to avoid failure of a write procedure of the flash memory due to interruption of power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a protection circuit comprises a capacitor and a switch. The capacitor is electrically connected between a power supply pin of a flash memory and a ground point. The switch is electrically connected between the power supply pin and a power supply that provides a reference voltage to the power supply pin. When the reference voltage is higher than a threshold voltage, the switch is turned on to input the reference voltage to the power supply pin; when the reference voltage is lower than the threshold voltage, the switch is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a situation that the switch is turned on, the power supply charges the capacitor of the protection circuit. Once the reference voltage provided by the power supply is interrupted, the switch is turned off. After the power supply is interrupted, the capacitor provides power to the power supply pin to ensure that the flash memory smoothly completes a write procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a power supply system, applied to a flash memory, comprises a power supply, a switch and a capacitor. The flash memory comprises a power supply pin, and the power supply is for providing a reference voltage. The switch is electrically connected between the power supply pin and the power supply. When the reference voltage is higher than a threshold voltage, the switch is turned on to input the reference voltage to the power supply pin via the switch; when the reference voltage is lower than the threshold voltage, the switch is turned off. The capacitor is connected between the power supply pin and a ground point.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a protection circuit applied to a flash memory in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. A protection circuit <b>10</b> comprises a first capacitor <b>12</b> and a first switch <b>14</b>. A flash memory <b>20</b> comprises a power supply pin SUP. A power supply <b>30</b> provides a reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>to the flash memory via the power supply pin SUP, and the reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>serves as a power source for operating internal circuits of the flash memory <b>20</b>. In practice, the flash memory <b>20</b> may be a NAND flash memory in an SLC or MLC structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first capacitor <b>12</b> is electrically connected between the power supply pin SUP of the flash memory <b>20</b> and a ground point GND. The first switch <b>14</b> is electrically connected between the power supply pin SUP and the power supply <b>30</b>. According to the present invention, a status of the first switch <b>14</b> is associated with a voltage value of the reference voltage V<sub>DD</sub>. When the reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>is higher than a predetermined threshold voltage V<sub>TH</sub>, the first switch <b>14</b> is turned on; when the reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>is lower than the predetermined threshold voltage V<sub>TH</sub>, the first switch <b>14</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a practical application, switch <b>14</b> can be implemented with a diode, e.g., a Schottky diode, or other circuit components having the operating characteristics of the foregoing switch. In addition, the threshold voltage V<sub>TH </sub>can be defined as being approximately equal to or smaller than the reference voltage V<sub>DD</sub>. Taking the reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>equal to 3.3 V as an example, the threshold voltage V<sub>TH </sub>is relatively defined as 3.2 V or 3 V.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the first switch <b>14</b> is turned on, in addition to providing the reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>to the power supply pin SUP, the power supply <b>30</b> also charges the first capacitor <b>12</b> until a voltage at a connection point between the first capacitor <b>12</b> and the power supply pin SUP becomes equal to the reference voltage V<sub>DD</sub>. Accordingly, when the power supply <b>30</b> provides a voltage under normal circumstances, the first capacitor <b>12</b> and the first switch <b>14</b> almost do not affect the flash memory <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once the power supply provided by the power supply <b>30</b> becomes unstable or is suddenly interrupted, the voltage value of the reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>is reduced to lower than the threshold voltage V<sub>TH</sub>, and the first switch <b>14</b> is turned off, such that the voltage value of the power supply pin SUP is not dramatically reduced along with abrupt fluctuations of the reference voltage V<sub>DD</sub>. At this point, the previously charged first capacitor <b>12</b> starts to provide power to the power supply pin SUP, so that the flash memory <b>20</b> can maintain a normal operation for a period, e.g., the flash memory <b>20</b> completes an on-going write procedure. Accordingly, the protection circuit <b>10</b> can avoid data destruction due to power instability or interruption during the write procedure of the flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the present invention, capacitance of the first capacitor <b>12</b> can be associated with an operation power consumption amount of the flash memory <b>20</b> in a write period. More specifically, the capacitance of the first capacitor <b>12</b> can be determined according to a power amount needed by the flash memory <b>20</b> for the write period, so that the power amount stored in the first capacitor <b>12</b> is enough to support operations of the flash memory <b>20</b> to complete the write period.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a protection circuit in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a flash memory <b>20</b> comprises a write protection pin WP, and the flash memory <b>20</b> rejects a write procedure when an input voltage of the write protection pin WP is at a low level. The write protection pin WP is fixedly connected to the power supply pin SUP. Accordingly, in a process that the flash memory <b>20</b> performs a write procedure, a voltage value of the write protection pin WP remains at a high level due to the existence of the first capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The protection circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be controlled by software to enter or be released from a write protection status of the flash memory <b>20</b>, so that the flash memory <b>20</b> is not completely incapable of write protection for the reason that the write protection pin WP is fixedly connected to a predetermined voltage. Thus, the protection circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is capable of ensuring that data is not destroyed during the write procedure of the flash memory resulting from a status switch of the write protection pin.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a protection circuit in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the protection circuit further comprises a second capacitor <b>16</b> electrically connected between a write protection pin WP and a ground point, and the write protection pin WP is electrically connected to a power supply <b>30</b> via a first switch <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the first switch <b>14</b> is turned on, in addition to charging the first capacitor <b>12</b>, the power supply <b>30</b> also charges the second capacitor <b>16</b> until a voltage of a connection point between the second capacitor <b>16</b> and the write protection pin WP is equal to a reference voltage V<sub>DD</sub>. When the reference voltage V<sub>DD </sub>is lower than a threshold voltage V<sub>TH</sub>, the first switch <b>14</b> is turned off, and the connection between the write protection pin WP and the power supply <b>30</b> is cut off. At this point, the second capacitor <b>16</b> provides assistance to maintain a voltage of the write protection pin WP at approximately equal to V<sub>DD </sub>for a predetermined period.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A main difference between the third embodiment and the second embodiment is that, the second capacitor <b>16</b> is responsible for maintaining the voltage of the write protection pin WP in the third embodiment, instead of sharing the first capacitor <b>12</b> with the power supply pin SUP in the second embodiment. In a practical application, the capacitance of the second capacitor <b>16</b> can be determined according to a length of a write period of the flash memory <b>20</b>, so that the amount of power stored in the second capacitor <b>16</b> is enough to maintain the write protection pin WP at a high-level voltage during the write period of the flash memory <b>20</b>. Accordingly, it is also ensured that the flash memory <b>20</b> is prevented from data destruction in the write procedure due to a status switch of the write protection pin WP.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a protection circuit in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, supposing that an input voltage of a write protection pin WP is at a low level, the flash memory <b>20</b> rejects a write procedure. In this embodiment, the protection circuit provided by the present invention further comprises a second switch <b>18</b> and a resistor <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The resistor <b>19</b> is electrically connected between the write protection pin WP and a power supply pin SUP. The second switch <b>18</b> is electrically connected between the write protection pin WP and a ground point GND. When the second switch <b>18</b> is turned on, the write protection pin WP is electrically connected to the ground point GND. In practice, the second switch <b>18</b> is realized by one or multiple metal-oxide semiconductor components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second switch <b>18</b> is controlled by a memory control <b>40</b>. Under normal circumstances, the memory control <b>40</b> turns off the second switch <b>18</b> to connect the write protection pin WP to the power supply pin SUP via the resistor <b>19</b> without being influenced by the second switch <b>18</b> and the connected ground point GND. Since input resistance of the write protection pin WP is rather large, voltages of the write protection pin WP and the power pin SUP are almost the same. Therefore, the protection circuit according to this embodiment of the present invention also can provide a protection effect of the write protection pin WP as that of the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When a user wishes that the flash memory <b>20</b> enters a write protection status, the memory control <b>40</b> turns on the second switch <b>18</b>, and thus the write protection pin WP is electrically connected to a ground point GND to achieve an effect that the flash memory <b>20</b> enters the write protection status. Provided that the resistance of the resistor <b>19</b> is large enough, a voltage of the power supply pin SUP is not dramatically affected. In an embodiment, the second switch <b>18</b> is integrated inside the memory control <b>40</b>.</p>
