<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Multimodal Ethylene Copolymer</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) comprises a low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component and a high molecular weight ethylene copolymer component. The multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) has a weight average molecular weight of 70000 to 250000 g/mol, a melt index MFR<sub>2 </sub>of from 0.05 to 5 g/10 min, preferably from 0.1 to 1.2 g/10 min, and more preferably from 0.2 to 1.0 g/10 min. Preferably, it further has an MFR<sub>5 </sub>of 0.5 to 10 g/10 min, more preferably from 1.0 to 5.0 g/10 min. Furthermore, the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) has a density of from 930 to 955 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, preferably from 935 to 955 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and more preferably from 935 to 953 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) has a broad molecular weight distribution as indicated by the ratio of weight average molecular weight to the number average molecular weight, Mw/Mn, of from 20 to 50, preferably from 24 to 50 and in particular from 25 to 40.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) comprises from 49 to 59% by weight, based on the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1), of low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component (B-1-1). The low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component (B-1-1) has a weight average molecular weight of from 5000 to 70000 g/mol, preferably form 15000 to 50000 g/mol. Preferably the low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component (B-1-1) has a melt index MFR<sub>2 </sub>of from 100 to 1500 g/10 min, more preferably from 150 to 1000 g/10 min.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The inventors have found that when the amount of the low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer fraction is within the specified limits the processability of the coating composition is improved. Usually also the resulting multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) then has a broad molecular weight distribution and a high tendency for shear thinning, as indicated by a high value of the shear thinning index. Furthermore, smooth coatings without surface defects are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be understood that within the meaning of the present invention the term &#x201c;homopolymer&#x201d; is used to mean a linear ethylene polymer which essentially consists of ethylene repeating units. It may contain trace amount of units derived from other polymerisable monomers, but it should contain at least about 99.9% by mole of ethylene repeating units, based on all the repeating units present in the low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component (B-1-1).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) also comprises from 41 to 51% by weight, based on the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1), a high molecular weight copolymer of ethylene and alpha-olefins having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms (B-1-2). The high molecular weight copolymer component (B-1-2) has a weight average molecular weight of from 100000 to 700000 g/mol, preferably 150000 to 300000 g/mol. Preferably it further has a content of alpha-olefin comonomers having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms of 0.5 to 10% by mole, in particular from 1 to 5% by mole, based on the total number of moles of repeating units in the high molecular weight copolymer component (B-1-2).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be understood that within the meaning of the present invention the term &#x201c;copolymer of ethylene and alpha-olefins having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms&#x201d; is used to mean an ethylene polymer which essentially consists of ethylene repeating units and repeating units derived from alpha-olefins having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms. It may contain trace amount of units derived from other polymerisable monomers, but it should contain at least about 99.9% by mole of above-mentioned repeating units, based on all the repeating units present in the high molecular weight ethylene copolymer component (B-1-2).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition to the two components referred above the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) may contain up to 10% by weight of other polymer components. The amount and the properties of such additional polymer components may be selected freely provided that the properties of the multimodal ethylene copolymer and of the two above-mentioned components are those discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Polymerisation Process</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The multimodal ethylene copolymer may be produced in any suitable polymerisation process known in the art. Preferably the multimodal ethylene copolymer is produced in a sequential polymerisation process comprising at least two polymerisation zones operating at different conditions to produce the multimodal copolymer. The polymerisation zones may operate in slurry, solution, or gas phase conditions or their combinations. Suitable processes are disclosed, among others, in WO-A-92/12182 and WO-A-96/18662.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Catalyst</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The polymerisation is conducted in the presence of an olefin polymerisation catalyst. The catalyst may be any catalyst which is capable of producing all components of the multimodal ethylene copolymer. Suitable catalysts are, among others, Ziegler-Natta catalysts based on a transition metal, such as titanium, zirconium and/or vanadium or metallocene catalysts or late transition metal catalysts, as well as their mixtures. Especially Ziegler-Natta catalysts and metallocene catalysts are useful as they can produce polymers within a wide range of molecular weight with a high productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Suitable Ziegler-Natta catalysts preferably contain a magnesium compound, an aluminium compound and a titanium compound supported on a particulate support.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The particulate support can be an inorganic oxide support, such as silica, alumina, titania, silica-alumina and silica-titania. Preferably, the support is silica.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The average particle size of the silica support can be typically from 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m. However, it has turned out that special advantages can be obtained if the support has an average particle size from 15 to 30 &#x3bc;m, preferably from 18 to 25 &#x3bc;m. Alternatively, the support may have an average particle size of from 30 a 80 &#x3bc;m, preferably from 30 to 50 &#x3bc;m. Examples of suitable support materials are, for instance, ES747JR produced and marketed by Ineos Silicas (former Crossfield), and SP9-491, produced and marketed by Grace.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The magnesium compound is a reaction product of a magnesium dialkyl and an alcohol. The alcohol is a linear or branched aliphatic monoalcohol. Preferably, the alcohol has from 6 to 16 carbon atoms. Branched alcohols are especially preferred, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol is one example of the preferred alcohols. The magnesium dialkyl may be any compound of magnesium bonding to two alkyl groups, which may be the same or different. Butyl-octyl magnesium is one example of the preferred magnesium dialkyls.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The aluminium compound is chlorine containing aluminium alkyl. Especially preferred compounds are aluminium alkyl dichlorides and aluminium alkyl sesquichlorides.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The titanium compound is a halogen containing titanium compound, preferably chlorine containing titanium compound. Especially preferred titanium compound is titanium tetrachloride.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The catalyst can be prepared by sequentially contacting the carrier with the above mentioned compounds, as described in EP-A-688794 or WO-A-99/51646. Alternatively, it can be prepared by first preparing a solution from the components and then contacting the solution with a carrier, as described in WO-A-01/55230.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another, especially preferred, group of suitable Ziegler-Natta catalysts contain a titanium compound together with a magnesium halide compound without an inert support. Thus, the catalyst contains a titanium compound on a magnesium dihalide, like magnesium dichloride. Such catalysts are disclosed, for instance, in WO-A-2005/118655 and EP-A-810235.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The Ziegler-Natta catalyst is used together with an activator. Suitable activators are metal alkyl compounds and especially aluminium alkyl compounds. These compounds include alkyl aluminium halides, such as ethylaluminium dichloride, diethylaluminium chloride, ethylaluminium sesquichloride, dimethylaluminium chloride and the like. They also include trialkylaluminium compounds, such as trimethylaluminium, triethylaluminium, tri-isobutylaluminium, trihexylaluminium and tri-n-octylaluminium. Furthermore they include alkylaluminium oxy-compounds, such as methylaluminiumoxane, hexaisobutylaluminiumoxane and tetraisobutylaluminiumoxane. Also other aluminium alkyl compounds, such as isoprenylaluminium, may be used. Especially preferred activators are trialkylaluminiums, of which triethylaluminium, trimethylaluminium and tri-isobutylaluminium are particularly used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The amount in which the activator is used depends on the specific catalyst and activator. Typically triethylaluminium is used in such amount that the molar ratio of aluminium to the transition metal, like Al/Ti, is from 1 to 1000, preferably from 3 to 100 and in particular from about 5 to about 30 mol/mol.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As discussed above, also metallocene catalysts may be used to produce the multimodal ethylene copolymer. Suitable metallocene catalysts are known in the art and are disclosed, among others, in WO-A-95/12622, WO-A-96/32423, WO-A-97/28170, WO-A-98/32776, WO-A-99/61489, WO-A-03/010208, WO-A-03/051934, WO-A-03/051514, WO-A-2004/085499, EP-A-1752462 and EP-A-1739103.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Polymerisation</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The polymerisation zone where the low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer (B-1-1) is produced typically operates at a temperature of from 20 to 150&#xb0; C., preferably from 50 to 110&#xb0; C. and more preferably from 60 to 100&#xb0; C. The polymerisation may be conducted in slurry, gas phase or solution.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The catalyst may be transferred into the polymerisation zone by any means known in the art. It is thus possible to suspend the catalyst in a diluent and maintain it as homogeneous slurry. Especially preferred it is to use oil having a viscosity form 20 to 1500 mPa&#xb7;s as diluent, as disclosed in WO-A-2006/063771, it is also possible to mix the catalyst with a viscous mixture of grease and oil and feed the resultant paste into the polymerisation zone. Further still, it is possible to let the catalyst settle and introduce portions of thus obtained catalyst mud into the polymerisation zone in a manner disclosed, for instance, in EP-A-428054. The polymerisation zone may also be preceded by a prepolymerisation zone, in which case the mixture withdrawn from the prepolymerisation zone is directed into the polymerisation zone.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Into the polymerisation zone is also introduced ethylene, optionally an inert diluent, and optionally hydrogen and/or comonomer. The low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component (B-1-1) is produced in a first polymerisation zone and the high molecular weight ethylene copolymer component (B-1-2) is produced in a second polymerisation zone. The first polymerisation zone and the second polymerization zone may be connected in any order, i.e. the first polymerisation zone may precede the second polymerisation zone, or the second polymerisation zone may precede the first polymerisation zone or, alternatively, polymerisation zones may be connected in parallel. However, it is preferred to operate the polymerisation zones in cascaded mode.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As it was disclosed above, the low molecular weight homopolymer (B-1-1) is produced in the first polymerisation zone. Into the first polymerisation zone are introduced ethylene, hydrogen and optionally an inert diluent. Comonomer is not introduced into the first polymerisation zone. The polymerisation in the first polymerisation zone is conducted at a temperature within the range of from 50 to 115&#xb0; C., preferably from 80 to 110&#xb0; C. and in particular from 90 to 105&#xb0; C. The pressure in the first polymerisation zone is from 1 to 300 bar, preferably from 5 to 100 bar.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The polymerisation in the first polymerisation zone may be conducted in slurry. Then the polymer particles formed in the polymerisation, together with the catalyst fragmented and dispersed within the particles, are suspended in the fluid hydrocarbon. The slurry is agitated to enable the transfer of reactants from the fluid into the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The polymerisation usually takes place in an inert diluent, typically a hydrocarbon diluent such as methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane, pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, octanes etc., or their mixtures. Preferably the diluent is a low-boiling hydrocarbon having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture of such hydrocarbons. An especially preferred diluent is propane, possibly containing minor amount of methane, ethane and/or butane.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The ethylene content in the fluid phase of the slurry may be from 2 to about 50% by mole, preferably from about 2 to about 20% by mole and in particular from about 3 to about 15% by mole. The benefit of having a high ethylene concentration is that the productivity of the catalyst is increased but the drawback is that more ethylene then needs to be recycled than if the concentration was lower.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The slurry polymerisation may be conducted in any known reactor used for slurry polymerisation. Such reactors include a continuous stirred tank reactor and a loop reactor. It is especially preferred to conduct the polymerisation in loop reactor. In such reactors the slurry is circulated with a high velocity along a closed pipe by using a circulation pump. Loop reactors are generally known in the art and examples are given, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,816, U.S. Pat. No. 3,405,109, U.S. Pat. No. 3,324,093, EP-A-479186 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,654.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is sometimes advantageous to conduct the slurry polymerisation above the critical temperature and pressure of the fluid mixture. Such operation is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,654.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The amount of hydrogen is adjusted based on the desired melt flow rate and it also depends on the specific catalyst used. For many generally used Ziegler-Natta catalysts the molar ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 100 to 1500 mol/kmol, preferably from 200 to 1200 mol/kmol and in particular from 300 to 1000 mol/kmol.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The polymerisation in the first polymerisation zone may also be conducted in gas phase. A preferable embodiment of gas phase polymerisation reactor is a fluidised bed reactor. There the polymer particles formed in the polymerisation are suspended in upwards moving gas. The gas is introduced into the bottom part of the reactor. The upwards moving gas passes the fluidised bed wherein a part of the gas reacts in the presence of the catalyst and the unreacted gas is withdrawn from the top of the reactor. The gas is then compressed and cooled to remove the heat of polymerisation. To increase the cooling capacity it is sometimes desired to cool the recycle gas to a temperature where a part of the gas condenses. After cooling the recycle gas is reintroduced into the bottom of the reactor. Fluidised bed polymerisation reactors are disclosed, among others, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,534, U.S. Pat. No. 4,588,790, EP-A-699213, EP-A-628343, FI-A-921632, FI-A-935856, U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,587, FI-A-933073 and EP-A-75049.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In gas phase polymerisation using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst hydrogen is typically added in such amount that the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 500 to 10000 mol/kmol, preferably from 1000 to 5000 mol/kmol to obtain the desired molecular weight of the low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The high molecular weight copolymer of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin having 4 to 10 carbon atoms (B-1-2) is produced in the second polymerisation zone. Into the second polymerisation zone are introduced ethylene, alpha-olefin having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, hydrogen and optionally an inert diluent. The polymerisation in second polymerisation zone is conducted at a temperature within the range of from 50 to 100&#xb0; C., preferably from 60 to 100&#xb0; C. and in particular from 70 to 95&#xb0; C. The pressure in the second polymerisation zone is from 1 to 300 bar, preferably from 5 to 100 bar.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The polymerisation in the second polymerisation zone may be conducted in slurry. The polymerisation may then be conducted along the lines as was discussed above for the first polymerisation zone.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The amount of hydrogen is adjusted based on the desired melt flow rate and it also depends on the specific catalyst used. For many generally used Ziegler-Natta catalysts the molar ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 0 to 50 mol/kmol, preferably from 10 to 35 mol/kmol.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, the amount of alpha-olefin having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms is adjusted to reach the targeted density. The ratio of the alpha-olefin to ethylene is typically from 100 to 500 mol/kmol, preferably from 150 to 350 mol/kmol.</p>

In gas phase polymerisation using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst hydrogen is typically added in such amount that the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 5 to 500 mol/kmol, preferably from 30 to 150 mol/kmol to obtain the desired molecular weight of the high molecular weight ethylene copolymer component (B-1-2). The amount of alpha-olefin having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms is adjusted to reach the targeted density. The ratio of the alpha-olefin to ethylene is typically from 10 to 300 mol/kmol, preferably from 30 to 200 mol/kmol.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is also possible to add a suitable amount of the adhesion polymer into the coating composition (B-2) to improve the adhesion between the pipe and the coating layer. In this way the amount of the polymer used in the adhesion layer may be reduced and in some cases it may be possible to eliminate the adhesion layer altogether.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Pipe Coating and Coated Pipe</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is preferable to properly prepare the surface of the pipe before coating as it is known in the art. The pipe surface is typically inspected for any rust, dirt, flaws, discontinuities, and metal defects. All the excess material needs be removed from the pipe surface to make sure that the coating is properly adhered to the pipe. Suitable cleaning methods include air and water high pressure washing, grit or shot blasting and mechanical brushing. Also acid wash and chromate pre-treatment is sometimes used.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Typically the pipes are heated with induction heating up to about 200&#xb0; C. The temperature is adjustable depending on the line speed and the material being used in the corrosion preventing layer (C). When the epoxy Teknos AR8434 is used the steel pipe is preferably heated to 190&#xb0; C. The temperature decreases slightly during the coating process.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If epoxy powder (at 23&#xb0; C.) is used it is typically sprayed on with epoxy guns, where the speed of the rotating pipe is about 9 m/min. The thickness of the epoxy and other coating materials are set in accordance with end use specified requirements. Normal thickness value for the epoxy layer (on-shore installations) is from 70 to 200 &#x3bc;m, such as 135 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Materials that may be used in the corrosion protection layer (C) are, for instance, epoxy resins and organosilicon compounds.

They may have a diameter of, for instance, from 30 to 100 mm, such as 60 mm, and a length of from 15 to 50 L/D, such as 30 L/D. The temperature is typically controlled in several zones and the temperature of the PE adhesive (D) and coating (B) layer after the die is from 190 to 300&#xb0; C., such as 225 and 250&#xb0; C., respectively. Die widths are from 50 to 300 mm, such as 110 mm and 240 mm for the adhesive layer (D) and coating layer (B), respectively. Both adhesive (D) and the coating (B) layer are usually rolled tightly onto the pipe with a silicone pressure roller. The thickness of the adhesive layer (D) is typically from 200 to 400 &#x3bc;m, such as 290 &#x3bc;m.

Examples of especially suitable adhesion plastics are given in EP-A-1316598.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">After the coating the coated pipe is cooled, for instance by providing water flow on the coated pipe surface.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The use of the coating composition (B-2) allows the coating process to be operated with a high throughput without operational problems, such as film line breaks. Moreover, the problem of neck-in variations after the die is reduced with the present coating compositions compared with the prior art compositions. Further still, smooth coatings having good mechanical properties are obtained.</p>

Samples were prepared by dissolving approximately 0.100 g of polymer and 2.5 ml of solvent in a 10 mm NMR tube. The solvent was a 90/10 mixture of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and benzene-d6. Samples were dissolved and homogenised by heating the tube and its contents at 150 C in a heating block.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The proton decoupled carbon-13 single pulse NMR spectra with NOE were recorded on a Joel ECX 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The acquisition parameters used for the experiment included a flip-angle of 45 degrees, 4 dummy scans, 3000 transients and a 1.6 s acquisition time, a spectral width of 20 kHz, temperature of 125 C, WALTZ decoupling and a relaxation delay of 6.0 s. The processing parameters used included zero-filling to 32 k data points and apodisation using an exponential window function with in 1.0 Hz artificial line broadening followed by automatic zeroth and first order phase correction and automatic baseline correction.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Comonomer contents were calculated using integral ratios taken from the processed spectrum using the assignments described in J C. Randall's work (JMS&#x2014;Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., C29(2&#x26;3), 201-317 (1989) using:

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A loop reactor having a volume of 50 dm<sup>3 </sup>was operated continuously at a temperature of 60&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 62 bar. Into the reactor were introduced 42 kg/h of propane diluent, 2 kg/h of ethylene and 35 g/h of hydrogen. In addition 6.3 g/h of a solid polymerisation catalyst component sold by BASF under a trade name of Lynx 200 was introduced into the reactor together with triethylaluminium cocatalyst so that the ratio of aluminium to titanium was 30 mol/mol. The rate of polymer production was about 1.8 kg/h.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The slurry from the 50 dm<sup>3 </sup>loop reactor was withdrawn and transferred continuously to another loop reactor having a volume of 500 dm<sup>3 </sup>and which was operated at a temperature of 95&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 60 bar. Into the reactor were introduced additional propane diluent, ethylene and hydrogen. The ethylene concentration in the fluid mixture was 3.4 mol-%, based on the total number of moles in the fluid mixture, and the rate of polymer production was about 32 kg/h. The conditions and data can be seen in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The slurry from the loop reactor was withdrawn by using settling legs into a flash vessel operated at a temperature of 50&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 3 bar where the hydrogen and major part of the hydrocarbons was removed from the polymer. The polymer was directed into a fluidised bed gas phase reactor operated at 85&#xb0; C. temperature and 20 bar pressure. Into the reactor were introduced additional ethylene, 1-hexene comonomer, hydrogen and nitrogen as inert gas. Ethylene content in the fluidisation gas was 10 mol-%. The conditions and the data are shown in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The resulting polymer powder was dried from hydrocarbons and mixed with 3000 ppm of Irganox B225, 1000 ppm of calcium stearate and 2.4% of carbon black, based on the final composition. The mixture was then extruded into pellets by using a CIM90P twin screw extruder (manufactured by Japan Steel Works). The properties of the compound are shown in Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The resulting composition was used in coating a steel pipe as described above in the description of the methods under the title &#x201c;Pipe coating&#x201d;. Data is shown in Table 2.</p>
