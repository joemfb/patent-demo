In one embodiment, the blocking member <b>30</b> is substantially columnar, the through hole <b>37</b> is substantially circular, and the outer diameter of the cap <b>21</b> is substantially equal to the outer diameter of the blocking member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The pivot member <b>40</b> comprises an operating portion <b>41</b> and two latching portions <b>43</b> extending from two opposite ends of the operating member <b>41</b>. In one embodiment, the operating portion <b>41</b> is arched so as to resemble a semicircle.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, in assembly, each of the two latching portions <b>43</b> engages in a latching groove <b>35</b>. The pole <b>23</b> of the screw member <b>20</b> extends through the through hole <b>37</b> and engages in the through hole <b>37</b>. The cap <b>21</b> rests on the blocking member <b>30</b>. Each of the two latching portions <b>43</b> is sandwiched between the cap <b>21</b> and the blocking member <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the blocking member <b>30</b> is secured to the positioning portion <b>231</b> by means of an interference fit. The screw structure is thereby assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in use, the operating portion <b>41</b> of the screw structure is raised and twisted, and the operating portion <b>41</b> is rotated round a pivot axis <b>70</b>, and an end of the pole <b>23</b> is aligned with an installation hole (not labeled) defined in the first object member <b>50</b>. The operating portion <b>41</b> is rotated around a center axis <b>80</b> in a first direction to push the pole <b>23</b> through the installation hole of the first object member <b>50</b>. The screw portion <b>235</b> is screwed into a threaded securing hole of the second object member <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, the pivot axis <b>70</b> is substantially perpendicular to the center axis <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In disassembly of the screw structure, the operating portion <b>41</b> is rotated in a second direction opposite to the first direction, and the screw portion <b>235</b> is disengaged from the threaded securing hole of the second object member <b>60</b>, until the pole <b>23</b> can be freed from the installation hole of the first object member <b>50</b>. Thereby, the screw structure is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages have been set forth in the foregoing description of embodiments, together with details of the structures and functions of the embodiments, the disclosure is illustrative only and changes may be made in detail, especially in the matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
