<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of pending International patent application PCT/DK2007/000562 filed on Dec. 20, 2007 which designates the United States and the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention disclosed and claimed herein and the subject matter related thereto was developed pursuant to a joint research agreement between Fertin Pharma NS and Gumlink A/S, both of Denmark.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of compressed chewing gum. In particular, the present invention provides improved possibilities of controlling the release of active ingredients from a compressed chewing gum tablet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A problem related to compressed chewing gum is that it may be difficult to obtain the same prolonged release of active ingredients as may be obtained in conventionally mixed chewing gum as compressed chewing gum tends to release active ingredients relatively fast.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further problem related to conventional compressed chewing gum is that active ingredients may differ significantly in nature as the active ingredients may be contained in different delivery systems if such systems are applied. A further problem is that the desired release of the individual active ingredient may be difficult to control, thereby resulting in a non-synchronized release of different active ingredients which need to be synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved possibilities of designing a release profile according to a present desire.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to a compressed chewing gum tablet comprising at least a first and a second chewing gum module,
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">said first chewing gum module comprising a first chewing gum composition comprising at least a first active ingredient and chewing gum granules containing gum base,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">said second chewing gum module comprising a second chewing gum composition comprising at least a second active ingredient and chewing gum granules containing gum base,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">wherein said first active ingredient is a pharmaceutically active ingredient, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">said second active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of pharmaceutically active ingredients and enhancers,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">wherein the gum base content of said first and second chewing gum modules is different.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">The invention facilitates that different pharmaceutically active ingredients in different modules may be affected individually by the content of gum base contained in the different respective modules, thereby obtaining an improved administration of different pharmaceutically active ingredients with respect to a desired release and according to a desired synchronism. The desired synchronism may both involve that two different active ingredients are released at the same time and may also involve an offset.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">In some embodiments it may be desired to have a fast release of a first active ingredient and a slower release of a second active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">The release may be controlled by the different gum base content of the modules, whereby a number of possibilities arise of designing a release profile of the active ingredients as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">In an embodiment of the invention, the first and second active ingredients are the same.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">With the use of the same active ingredient as the first and second active ingredient and release controlling both of these it is e.g. possible to obtain a &#x201c;quick shot&#x201d; of the active ingredient upon initial chewing but also maintain a release of the same active ingredient over some time.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">In an embodiment of the invention, the first and second active ingredients are different.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">Using different active ingredients may e.g. be advantageous when the two ingredients are collaborating, e.g. the one active ingredient enhances the uptake of the other, or the first ensures an advantageous pH-level for the second active ingredient. However in some embodiments it may also be advantageous to have two or more independent active ingredients in the same chewing gum tablet.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">In an embodiment of the invention, said first chewing gum composition comprises a further active ingredient different from said first active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">According to embodiments of the invention two or more active ingredients may be present in said first chewing gum composition. In this manner a number of combinations of active ingredients may be delivered from a single chewing gum tablet.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">In an embodiment of the invention, wherein said second chewing gum composition comprises a further active ingredient different from said second active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">According to embodiments of the invention two or more active ingredients may be present in said second chewing gum composition. In this manner a number of combinations of active ingredients may be delivered from a single chewing gum tablet.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">In an embodiment of the invention, wherein said active ingredients in said first chewing gum module are at least partly contained within said chewing gum granules.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">In an embodiment of the invention, wherein said active ingredients in said second chewing gum module are at least partly contained within said chewing gum granules.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">In an embodiment of the invention, the gum base content is different with respect to composition.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">With a gum base content different with respect to composition, release profiles may be adjusted in that an active ingredient contained within a chewing gum granule will be released slower than an active ingredient which is added to the chewing gum layer outside the granules prior to compression. Hereby a desired amount of an active ingredient which is to be released relatively slowly may be added into the granules of the composition and another amount of the same or another active ingredient which is to be released relatively slowly may be added to the composition outside the granules, whereby a faster release of these are ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">In an embodiment of the invention, the gum base content is different with respect to weight.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">With a gum base content different with respect to weight, release profiles may be adjusted in that e.g. an active ingredient in a module without any gum base may tend to release faster than an active ingredient in a module with a relatively large amount of gum base. Hence it seems that release profile control may be controlled by selecting a certain amount of gum base for each module.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">In an embodiment of the invention, the gum base content is different with respect to the size of applied chewing gum granules.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">With a gum base content different with respect to the size of applied chewing gum granules, release profiles may be adjusted in that indications have been seen that the release rate is different depending on an average size of the granules of the module, in which the active ingredient is positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">In an embodiment of the invention, wherein the size of the applied chewing gum granules is less in said first chewing gum module than in said second chewing gum module.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">In an embodiment of the invention, the gum base content is different with respect to the degree of mixing with the active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">A further way to have different gum base content of two modules is to mix the two compositions with active ingredients differently, e.g. mixing the active ingredient more thoroughly into one composition than into the other.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">In an embodiment of the invention, at least one of said first and second chewing gum composition facilitates a bi-phasic release of said second active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">In an embodiment of the invention, wherein said compressed chewing gum tablet comprises control means to at least partly synchronize the release of said at least one pharmaceutically active ingredient and the release of said at least one enhancer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">In an embodiment of the invention, said enhancer is a pH control agent.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">In an embodiment of the invention, said pharmaceutically active ingredient is nicotine and/or varenicline.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">In some embodiments nicotine is added as a salt such as nicotine bitartrate, nicotine pftalate, nicotine polacrilex, nicotine sulphate, nicotine tartrate, nicotine citrate, or nicotine lactate. Varenicline is often added as varenicline tartrate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">In an embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutically active ingredients are selected from the group consisting of antihistamines, anti-smoking agents, agents used for diabetes, decongestrants, peptides, pain-relieving agents, antacids, nausea-relieving agents, statines, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">In an embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutically active ingredients are selected from the group consisting of cetirizine, levo cetirizine, nicotine, nicotine polacrilex, nicotine in combination with alkaline agents, metformin, metformin HCL, phenylephrine, GLP-1, exenatide, MC-4 receptor antagonist, PPY(3-36), deca-peptide, KSL-W (acetate), fluor, chlorhexidine, or any combination thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0122" num="0130">In the prior art active ingredients may differ significantly in nature as the active ingredients may be contained in different delivery systems if such systems are applied and the release of the individual active ingredient may be difficult to control, thereby resulting in a non-synchronized release of different active ingredients which need to be synchronized. With the present invention, as described in the following, advantageous control of the release of the active ingredients is made possible.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0131">AI (AI: Active ingredients) as used herein is used to cover e.g. API (API: pharmaceutically active ingredients) and enhancers.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0132">The word granule throughout this document should be understood as broadly as possibly being powder, particles, agglomerates or the like. Generally the four terms may be used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0133">The term &#x201c;average diameter&#x201d; as used herein is defined as the diameter of a sphere having the same volume as the granule or particle, which is the consequence of that granules may possess almost any shape, and according to the definition granules having the same volume also have the same average diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a cross-section of a compressed multi modular chewing gum tablet according the invention and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0135">The illustrated chewing gum tablet <b>10</b> comprises two chewing gum modules <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0136">According to the illustrated embodiment, each module is simply comprised by a layer. The multi-module tablet may in this embodiment be regarded as a two-layer chewing gum tablet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0137">The illustrated chewing gum tablet <b>10</b> may for example weigh approximately 1.3 gram and comprise a first GB-containing chewing gum module <b>11</b> and a second GB-containing module <b>12</b> (GB: gum base).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0138">The illustrated tablet has an approximate diameter of 16 mm and a thickness at the thickest point in the center of approximately 7 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0139">The two modules <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are adhered to each other. Different processes may be applied for the purpose. However, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the mutual adhering between the two layers is obtained by the compression of one module <b>11</b> onto the other <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0140">According to an embodiment of the invention, the illustrated chewing gum tablet <b>10</b> may be provided with a coating, e.g. a film coating.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0141">It should be noted that various concentrations of gum base in the different modules (here: layers) may be applied within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0142">The modules may for instance comprise compressible chewing gum ingredients, for example sweeteners and flavors, more or less pre-processed for the purpose of facilitating a true compression. Other optional ingredients to be emphasized here may e.g. comprise pharmaceutically active ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0143">In other applications, e.g. for the purpose of establishing different release profiles the different modules may comprise different content of gum base.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0144">The tablet may moreover comprise (not shown) one or several barrier layers adapted for establishment of a barrier between inter-reacting ingredients, such as certain acids and flavors.</p>

<p id="p-0138" num="0146">The illustrated embodiment <b>20</b> comprises a three-module chewing gum of which the each of the layers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b> optionally comprise a gum base incorporated chewing gum module having a certain gum base concentration. As an example layers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> may contain gum base and layer <b>23</b> may be a substantially gum base-free chewing gum module.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0147">A layer without gum base, which could be chewing gum module <b>23</b>, may for example comprise compressed chewing gum ingredients, such as sweeteners, flavor, freeze-dried fruit, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0148">Modules containing gum base, here the two modules <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, may advantageously comprise different gum base content for the purpose of providing a desired release profile, whereas a non-GB module, here module <b>23</b>, may ensure a fast release of an active ingredient or simply add an amount of bulk sweetener or other chewing gum ingredients, which are quickly released when the tablet is chewed.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>illustrates a composition comprising a mixture of chewing gum granules <b>60</b> and agglomerated bulk sweetener with flavor-&#x201c;glued&#x201d; API <b>61</b>, wherein the size of the chewing gum granules <b>60</b> and the agglomerated bulk sweetener with flavor-&#x201c;glued&#x201d; API <b>61</b> is essentially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<b>6</b><i>c </i>are illustrative examples only of how compositions may look according to embodiments of the invention. As should be apparent from the content of the description, the compositions as mentioned herein may comprise active ingredients and gum base in different layers, wherein the AIs may be incorporated in the granules or added to the composition outside the granules as long as the gum base content is different and a desired release profile may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0162">The formulations, applied pharmaceutically active ingredients, examples of compositions and layers given herein are exemplary and only given for the purpose of evaluating and explaining different features of the invention. Compositions and the combinations of layers may be varied significantly within the scope of the invention. Specific variations and details with respect to ingredients, formulations and compositions within the scope of the invention are given below.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0163">In accordance with the general principles in manufacturing a chewing gum tablet within the scope of the invention, variations of different suitable ingredients are listed and explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0164">Chewing gum of the present invention typically comprises a water-soluble portion, a water-insoluble chewable gum base portion and flavoring agents. The water-soluble portion dissipates with a portion of the flavoring agent over a period of time during chewing. The gum base portion is retained in the mouth throughout the chew. The term chewing gum refers to both a chewing and bubble type gum in its general sense.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0165">The gum base is the masticatory substance of the chewing gum, which imparts the chew characteristics to the final product. The gum base typically defines the release profile of flavors and sweeteners and plays a significant role in the gum product.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0166">The insoluble portion of the gum typically may contain any combination of elastomers, vinyl polymers, elastomer plasticizers, waxes, softeners, fillers and other optional ingredients such as colorants and antioxidants.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0167">The composition of gum base formulations can vary substantially depending on the particular product to be prepared and on the desired masticatory and other sensory characteristics of the final product. However, typical ranges (% by weight) of the above gum base components are: 5 to 80% by weight elastomeric compounds, 5 to 80% by weight elastomer plasticizers, 0 to 40% by weight of waxes, 5 to 35% by weight softener, 0 to 50% by weight filler, and 0 to 5% by weight of miscellaneous ingredients such as antioxidants, colourants, etc. The gum base may comprise about 5 to about 95 percent, by weight, of the chewing gum, more commonly the gum base comprises 10 to about 60 percent, by weight, of the gum.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0168">Elastomers provide the rubbery, cohesive nature to the gum, which varies depending on this ingredient's chemical structure and how it may be compounded with other ingredients. Elastomers suitable for use in the gum base and gum of the present invention may include natural or synthetic types.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0169">Elastomer plasticizers vary the firmness of the gum base. Their specificity on elastomer inter-molecular chain breaking (plasticizing) along with their varying softening points cause varying degrees of finished gum firmness and compatibility when used in base. This may be important when one wants to provide more elastomeric chain exposure to the alkane chains of the waxes.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0170">The elastomer compounds may be of natural origin but are preferably of synthetic origin, preferably synthetic polyesters.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0171">It is noted that gum base or gum granules may also include components typically referred to as chewing gum ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0172">The chewing gum may, according to embodiments of the invention, comprise conventionally non-biodegradable polymers, such as natural resins, synthetic resins and/or synthetic or natural elastomers.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0173">According to an embodiment of the invention, at least a part of the polymers of the chewing gum are biodegradable.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0174">In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum may comprise combinations of biodegradable polymers and polymers generally regarded as non-biodegradable, such as natural resins, synthetic resins and/or synthetic/natural elastomers.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0175">In an embodiment of the invention, said natural resin comprises terpene resins, e.g. derived from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and/or d-limonene, natural terpene resins, glycerol esters of gum rosins, tall oil rosins, wood rosins or other derivatives thereof such as glycerol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, glycerol esters of polymerized rosins, glycerol esters of partially dimerised rosins, pentaerythritol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, methyl esters of rosins, partially hydrogenated methyl esters of rosins or pentaerythritol esters of rosins and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0176">Materials to be used for encapsulation methods may e.g. include Gelatine, Wheat protein, Soya protein, Sodium caseinate, Caseine, Gum arabic, Mod. starch, Hydrolyzed starches (maltodextrines), Alginates, Pectin, Carregeenan, Xanthan gum, Locus bean gum, Chitosan, Bees wax, Candelilla wax, Carnauba wax, Hydrogenated vegetable oils, Zein and/or Sucrose.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0177">Examples of generally non-biodegradable synthetic resins include polyvinyl acetate, vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymers and mixtures thereof. Examples of non-biodegradable synthetic elastomers include, but are not limited to, synthetic elastomers listed in Food and Drug Administration, CFR, Title 21, Section 172,615, the Masticatory Substances, Synthetic) such as polyisobutylene. e.g. having a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) average molecular weight in the range of about 10,000 to 1,000,000 including the range of 50,000 to 80,000, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer (butyl elastomer), styrene-butadiene copolymers e.g. having styrene-butadiene ratios of about 1:3 to 3:1, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), e.g. having a GPC average molecular weight in the range of 2,000 to 90,000 such as the range of 3,000 to 80,000 including the range of 30,000 to 50,000, where the higher molecular weight polyvinyl acetates are typically used in bubble gum base, polyisoprene, polyethylene, vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymer e.g. having a vinyl laurate content of about 5 to 50% by weight such as 10 to 45% by weight of the copolymer, and combinations hereof.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0178">The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base may vary depending upon various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the texture of gum composition desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum product. The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes those gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example, those polymers which are suitable in gum base compositions include, without limitation, natural substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle gum, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero, rosidinha, jelutong, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, balata, guttapercha, lechi capsi, sorva, gutta kay, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without limitation, styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymers, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate and the like, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0179">It is common in the industry to combine in a gum base a synthetic elastomer having a high molecular weight and a synthetic elastomer having a low molecular weight. Examples of such combinations are polyisobutylene and styrene-butadiene, polyisobutylene and polyisoprene, polyisobutylene and isobutylene-isoprene copolymer (butyl rubber) and a combination of polyisobutylene, styrene-butadiene copolymer and isobutylene isoprene copolymer, and all of the above individual synthetic polymers in admixture with polyvinyl acetate, vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymers, respectively and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0180">Examples of natural resins are: Natural rosin esters, often referred to as ester gums including as examples glycerol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, glycerol esters of polymerised rosins, glycerol esters of partially dimerized rosins, glycerol esters of tally oil rosins, pentaerythritol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, methyl esters of rosins, partially hydrogenated methyl esters of rosins, pentaerythritol esters of rosins, synthetic resins such as terpene resins derived from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and/or d-limonene, and natural terpene resins.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0181">Chewing gums according to embodiments of the invention may be provided with an outer coating.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0182">The applicable hard coating may be selected from the group comprising of sugar coating and a sugarless coating and a combination thereof. The hard coating may e.g. comprise 50 to 100% by weight of a polyol selected from the group consisting of sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol and Isomalt and variations thereof. In an embodiment of the invention, the outer coating is an edible film comprising at least one component selected from the group consisting of an edible film-forming agent and a wax. The film-forming agent may e.g. be selected from the group comprising cellulose derivative, a modified starch, a dextrin, gelatine, shellac, gum arabic, zein, a vegetable gum, a synthetic polymer and any combination thereof. In an embodiment of the invention, the outer coating comprises at least one additive component selected from the group comprising of a binding agent, a moisture-absorbing component, a film-forming agent, a dispersing agent, an antisticking component, a bulking agent, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, a pharmaceutically or cosmetically active component, a lipid component, a wax component, a sugar, an acid and an agent capable of accelerating the after-chewing degradation of the degradable polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0183">Generally, the ingredients may be mixed by first melting the gum base and adding it to the running mixer. Colors, active agents and/or emulsifiers may also be added at this time. A softener such as glycerin may also be added at this time, along with syrup and a portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. Further portions of the bulking agent/sweetener may then be added to the mixer. A flavoring agent is typically added with the final portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. A high-intensity sweetener is preferably added after the final portion of bulking agent and flavor has been added.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0184">The entire mixing procedure typically takes from five to fifteen minutes, but longer mixing times may sometimes be required. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many variations of the above-described procedure may be followed. Including the one-step method described in US patent application 2004/0115305 hereby incorporated as reference. Chewing gums are formed by extrusion, compression, rolling and may be centre filled with liquids and/or solids in any form.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0185">When manufacturing a compressed chewing gum tablet another method is applied, which is basically very different than the above described, but may broadly be described as an initial conventional mixing of the gum base, as above described, followed by a granulation of the obtained gum base mix. The obtained chewing gum granules may then be mixed with further chewing gum ingredients, such as sweeteners and flavor. This final granule mix may then be compressed under high pressure (typically when applying cooling) into a chewing gum tablet. For each compression a layer is made and in this way it is possible to make multi-layered chewing gums, such as two, three or four layers, wherein each layer may include an individual composition, i.e. different active ingredients may be used for medical purposes or different colors may be used for visual purposes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0186">This type of chewing gum has been widely used especially within a segment of medical chewing gum due to the thereto-related relatively careful way of handling the chewing gum ingredients and especially the active ingredient typically being quite vulnerable to for example high temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0187">In further embodiments of the present invention, a chewing gum may also be provided with an outer coating, which may be a hard coating, a soft coating, a film coating, or a coating of any type that is known in the art, or a combination of such coatings. The coating may typically constitute 0.1 to 75% by weight of a coated chewing gum piece.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0188">One preferred outer coating type is a hard coating, which term is including sugar coatings and sugar-free (or sugarless) coatings and combinations thereof. The object of hard coating is to obtain a sweet, crunchy layer, which is appreciated by the consumer and to protect the gum centers. In a typical process of providing the chewing gum centers with a protective sugar coating the gum centers are successively treated in suitable coating equipment with aqueous solutions of crystallizable sugar such as sucrose or dextrose, which, depending on the stage of coating reached, may contain other functional ingredients, e.g. fillers, colors, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0189">In one presently preferred embodiment, the coating agent applied in a hard coating process is a sugarless coating agent, e.g. a polyol including as examples sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol and isomalt or e.g. a mono-di-saccharide including as example trehalose.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0190">Or alternatively a sugar-free soft coating e.g. comprising alternately applying to the centers a syrup of a polyol or a mono-di-saccharide, including as examples sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol, isomalt and trehalose.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0191">In further useful embodiments, a film coating is provided by film-forming agents such as a cellulose derivative, a modified starch, a dextrin, gelatine, zein, shellec, gum arabic, a vegetable gum, a synthetic polymer, etc. or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0192">In an embodiment of the invention, the outer coating comprises at least one additive component selected from the group comprising a binding agent, a moisture-absorbing component, a film-forming agent, a dispersing agent, an antisticking component, a bulking agent, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, a pharmaceutically or cosmetically active component, a lipid component, a wax component, a sugar, and an acid.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0193">A coated chewing gum center according to embodiments of the invention may have any form, shape or dimension that permits the chewing gum center to be coated using any conventional coating process.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0194">It should however be noted that application of different coating should be done with care as compressed chewing gum tablets may be negatively affected by direct contact with moisture or water.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0195">The composition of gum base formulations can vary substantially depending on the particular product to be prepared and on the desired masticatory and other sensory characteristics of the final product. However, typical ranges of the above gum base components are: 5 to 80% by weight of elastomeric compounds, 5 to 80% by weight of elastomer plasticizers, 0 to 40% by weight of waxes, 5 to 35% by weight of softener, 0 to 50% by weight of filler, and 0 to 5% by weight of miscellaneous ingredients such as antioxidants, colorants, etc. The gum base may comprise about 5 to about 95% by weight of the chewing gum, more commonly; the gum base comprises 10 to about 60% by weight of the gum.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0196">Elastomers provide the rubbery, cohesive nature to the gum, which varies depending on this ingredient's chemical structure and how it may be compounded with other ingredients. Elastomers suitable for use in the gum base and gum of the present invention may include natural or synthetic types.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0197">Elastomer plasticizers vary the firmness of the gum base. Their specificity on elastomer inter-molecular chain breaking (plasticizing) along with their varying softening points cause varying degrees of finished gum firmness and compatibility when used in gum base. This may be important when one wants to provide more elastomeric chain exposure to the alkanic chains of the waxes.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0198">If desired, conventional elastomers or resins may be supplemented or substituted by biodegradable polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0199">Biodegradable polymers that may be used in the chewing gum of the present invention may be homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers, including graft- and block-polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0200">Useful biodegradable polymers, which may be applied as gum base polymers in the chewing gum of the present invention, may generally be prepared by step-growth polymerization of di-, tri- or higher-functional alcohols or esters thereof with di-, tri- or higher-functional aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids or esters thereof. Likewise, also hydroxy acids or anhydrides and halides of polyfunctional carboxylic acids may be used as monomers. The polymerization may involve direct polyesterification or transesterification and may be catalyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0201">The usually preferred polyfunctional alcohols contain 2 to 100 carbon atoms as for instance polyglycols and polyglycerols.</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0214">Examples of such protein based compounds include but are not limited to prolamine, zein, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten, gliadin, glutenin and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0215">Such suitable biodegradable gum base polymers include polyesters, polycarbonates, polyesteramides, polyesterurethanes, polyamides, prolamine, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0216">Carbonates may typically be co-polymerised with esters. Some typically preferred cyclic carbonates, which may be used as starting material, may e.g. comprise trimethylene carbonate, 2,2-dimethyltrimethylene carbonate, 2-methyltrimethylene carbonate, 3-methyltrimethylene carbonate, 2,3-dimethyltrimethylene carbonate, 2,4-dimethyltrimethylene carbonate, 2,3,4-trimethyltrimethylene carbonate, 2,3,3,4-tetramethyltrimethylene carbonate, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0217">In some embodiments, suitable polyesteramides can be constructed from monomers of the following groups: dialcohols, such as ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,6-hexanediol diethylene glycol and others; and/or dicarboxylic acid, such as oxalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid and others, including those in the form of their respective esters (methyl, ethyl, etc.); and/or hydroxycarboxylic acids and lactones, such as caprolactone and others; and/or amino alcohols, such as ethanolamine, propanolamine, etc.; and/or cyclic lactams, such as .epsilon.-caprolactam or laurolactam, etc.; and/or .omega.-aminocarboxylic acids, such as aminocaproic acid, etc.; and/or mixtures (1:1 salts) of dicarboxylic acids such as adipic acid, succinic acid etc., and diamines such as hexamethyl enediamine, diaminobutane, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0218">In the case where the polymer mixture is based extensively on thermoplastic starch and an aromatic polyester, an aliphatic-aromatic copolyester, or a polyesteramide, it may be advantageous to add an aliphatic polyester or copolyester, such as polycaprolactone, for example, as a further component. As an example of this there may be mentioned a polymer mixture consisting of thermoplastic starch, at least one polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or a polyalkylene terephthalate, and polycaprolactone. Other examples of aliphatic polyesters or copolyesters are polylactic acid, polyhydroxybutyric acid, polyhydroxybutyric acid-hydroxyvaleric acid copolymer, and/or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0219">Suitable polyesters may be obtained through polycondensation polymerisation or ring-opening polymerisation reactions. Some preferred polyesters include those polymerised from at least one carboxylic acid and at least one aliphatic di- or polyfunctional alcohols. The carboxylic acids may include aromatic dicarboxylic acids and aliphatic di- or polyfunctional carboxylic acids. In some preferred embodiments, the majority of the carboxylic acids are aliphatic.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0220">Some of the preferred polyesters according to embodiments of the invention may e.g. be prepared by step-growth polymerization of di-, tri- or higher-functional alcohols or esters thereof with di-, tri- or higher-functional aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids or esters thereof. Likewise, also hydroxy acids or anhydrides and halides of polyfunctional carboxylic acids may be used as monomers. The polymerization may involve direct polyesterification or transesterification and may be catalyzed. Use of branched monomers suppresses the crystallinity of the polyester polymers. Mixing of dissimilar monomer units along the chain also suppresses crystallinity. To control the reaction and the molecular weight of the resulting polymer it is possible to stop the polymer chains by addition of monofunctional alcohols or acids and/or to utilize a stoichiometric imbalance between acid groups and alcohol groups or derivatives of either. Also the adding of long chain aliphatic carboxylic acids or aromatic monocarboxylic acids may be used to control the degree of branching in the polymer and conversely multifunctional monomers are sometimes used to create branching. Moreover, following the polymerization monofunctional compounds may be used to end cap the free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0221">Examples of aliphatic di- or polyfunctional carboxylic acids, which may be applied as monomers of suitable polyesters include oxalic, malonic, citric, succinic, malic, tartaric, fumaric, maleic, glutaric, glutamic, adipic, glucaric, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, dodecanedioic acid, etc. Likewise, specific examples of aromatic polyfunctional carboxylic acids may be terephthalic, isophthalic, phthalic, trimellitic, pyromellitic and naphthalene 1,4-, 2,3-, 2,6-dicarboxylic acids and the like. Some preferred polyesters are disclosed in CA2523510, hereby included by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0222">In a preferred embodiment, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids applied in the polyesters are selected from aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 4 to 12 carbons, such as succinic acid, glutaric acid, 2-methylglutaric acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, 2,2-dimethylglutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid and sebacic acid, higher homologues and stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Preferred aliphatic dicarboxylic acids in this embodiment are succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, azelaic acid and sebacic acid, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0223">In an embodiment, aromatic dicarboxylic acids applied in the polyesters contain two carboxyl groups which are bound to one aromatic system. Preferably, the aromatic system is carboaromatic, such as phenyl or naphthyl. In the case of polynuclear aromatics, the two carboxyl groups may be bound to the same ring or different rings. The aromatic system can also have one or more alkyl groups, for example methyl groups. The aromatic dicarboxylic acid is then generally selected from aromatic dicarboxylic acids having from 8 to 12 carbons, such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, 1,5- and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. Preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acids in this embodiment are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and phthalic acid and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0224">Furthermore, some usually preferred polyfunctional alcohols suitable for preparing advantageous polyesters according to embodiments of the invention contain 2 to 100 carbon atoms as for instance polyglycols and polyglycerols. Suitable examples of alcohols, which may be employed in the polymerization process as such or as derivatives thereof, includes polyols such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, neopentyl glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, etc. For the purpose of illustration and not limitation, some examples of alcohol derivatives include triacetin, glycerol palmitate, glycerol sebacate, glycerol adipate, tripropionin, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0225">Additionally, with regard to polyesters polymerized from alcohols or derivatives thereof and carboxylic acids or derivatives thereof, chain-stoppers sometimes used are monofunctional compounds. They are preferably either monohydroxy alcohols containing 1-20 carbon atoms or monocarboxylic acids containing 2-26 carbon atoms. General examples are medium or long-chain fatty alcohols or acids, and specific examples include monohydroxy alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, hexanol, octanol, etc., and lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, stearic alcohol, etc., and monocarboxylic acids such as acetic, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic, cerotic, dodecylenic, palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, erucic, benzoic, naphthoic acids and substituted naphthoic acids, 1-methyl-2 naphthoic acid and 2-isopropyl-1-naphthoic acid, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0226">Typically, an acid catalyst or a transesterification catalyst may be used in such polyester polymerization processes, and non-limiting examples of those are the metal catalysts such as acetates of manganese, zinc, calcium, cobalt or magnesium, and antimony(III)oxide, germanium oxide or halide and tetraalkoxygermanium, titanium alkoxide, zinc or aluminum salts.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0227">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the polyesters can for example include copolymers containing any combination of the monomers lactic acid, lactide, glycolic acid, glycolide, citric acid, adipic acid, caprolactone, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, propylene oxide, propylene glycol and combinations thereof.</p>

In order to provide longer lasting sweetness and flavor perception, it may be desirable to encapsulate or otherwise control the release of at least a portion of the artificial sweetener. Techniques such as wet granulation, wax granulation, spray drying, spray chilling, fluid bed coating, coascervation, encapsulation in yeast cells and fiber extrusion may be used to achieve the desired release characteristics. Encapsulation of sweetening agents can also be provided using another chewing gum component such as a resinous compound.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0281">Usage level of the high-intensity artificial sweetener will vary considerably and will depend on factors such as potency of the sweetener, rate of release, desired sweetness of the product, level and type of flavor used and cost considerations. Thus, the active level of high-potency artificial sweetener may vary from about 0 to about 8% by weight, preferably 0.001 to about 5% by weight. When carriers used for encapsulation are included, the usage level of the encapsulated sweetener will be proportionately higher.</p>

As another possibility, one or more of the ingredients may be free (e.g. unencapsulated) while one or more other ingredients may be encapsulated. A compressible chewing gum may include a group of ingredients for which managed release of the group during consumption of the compressible chewing gum is desired. Groups of two or more ingredients for which managed release from a compressible chewing gum during consumption of the compressible chewing gum may be desired include, but are not limited to: color and flavor, multiple flavors, multiple colors, cooling agent and flavor, warming agent and flavor, cooling agent and warming agent, cooling agent and high-intensity sweetener, warming agent and high-intensity sweetener, multiple cooling agents (e.g., WS-3 and WS-23, WS-3 and menthyl succinate), menthol and one or more cooling agents, menthol and one or more warming agents, multiple warming agents, high-intensity sweetener(s) and tooth whitening active(s), high-intensity sweetener(s) and breath-freshening active(s), an ingredient with some bitterness and a bitterness suppressor for the ingredient, multiple high-intensity sweeteners (e.g., acesulfame-k and aspartame), multiple tooth whitening active ingredients (e.g., an abrasive ingredient and an antimicrobial ingredient, a peroxide and a nitrate, a warming agent and a polyol, a cooling agent and a polyol, multiple polyols, a warming agent and micronutrient, a cooling agent and a micronutrient, a warming agent and a mouth moistening agent, a cooling agent and a mouth moistening agent, a warming agent and a throat care agent, a cooling agent and a throat care agent, a warming agent and a food acid, a cooling agent and food acid, a warming agent and an emulsifier/surfactant, a cooling agent and an emulsifier/surfactant, a warming agent and a color, a cooling agent and a color, a warming agent and a flavor potentiator, a cooling agent and a flavor potentiator, a warming agent with sweetness potentiator, a cooling agent with a sweetness potentiator, a warming agent and an appetite suppressant, a cooling agent and an appetite suppressant, a high-intensity sweetener and a flavor, a cooling agent and a teeth-whitening agent, a warming agent and a teeth-whitening agent, a warming agent and breath-freshening agent, a cooling agent and a breath-freshening agent, a cooling agent and an effervescing system, a warming agent and an effervescing system, a warming agent and an antimicrobial agent, a cooling agent and an antimicrobial agent, multiple anticalcums ingredients, multiple remineralization ingredients, multiple surfactants, remineralization ingredients with demineralization ingredients, acidic ingredients with acid buffering ingredients, anticalculus ingredients with antibacterial ingredients, remineralization ingredients with anticalculus ingredients, anticalculus ingredients with remineralization ingredients with antibacterial ingredients, surfactant ingredients with anticalculus ingredients, surfactant ingredients with antibacterial ingredients, surfactant ingredients with remineralization ingredients, surfactants with anticalculus ingredients with antibacterial ingredients, multiple types of vitamins or minerals, multiple micronutrients, multiple acids, multiple antimicrobial ingredients, multiple breath-freshening ingredients, breath-freshening ingredients and antimicrobial ingredients, multiple appetite suppressors, acids and bases that react to effervesce, a bitter compound with a high-intensity sweetener, a cooling agent and an appetite suppressant, a warming agent and an appetite suppressant, a high-intensity sweetener and an appetite suppressant, a high-intensity sweetener with an acid, a probiotic ingredient and a prebiotic ingredient, a vitamin and a mineral, a metabolic enhancement ingredient with a macronutrient, a metabolic enhancement ingredient with a micronutrient, an enzyme with a substrate, a high-intensity sweetener with a sweetness potentiator, a cooling compound with a cooling potentiator, a flavor with a flavor potentiator, a warming compound with a warming potentiator, a flavor with salt, a high-intensity sweetener with salt, an acid with salt, a cooling compound with salt, a warming compound with salt, a flavor with a surfactant, an astringent compound with an ingredient to provide a sensation of hydration, etc. In some embodiments, the multiple ingredients may be part of the same delivery system or may be part of different delivery systems. Different delivery systems may use the same or different encapsulating materials.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0362">Typically, encapsulation of the multiple ingredients will result in a delay in the release of the predominant amount of the multiple ingredients during consumption of a compressible chewing gum that includes the encapsulated multiple ingredients (e.g. as part of a delivery system added as an ingredient to the compressible chewing gum). This may be particularly helpful in situations wherein separate encapsulation of the ingredients may cause them to release with different release profiles. For example, different high-intensity sweeteners may have different release profiles because they have different water solubilities or differences in other characteristics. Encapsulating them together may cause them to release more simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0363">In some embodiments, the release profile of the multiple ingredients can be managed for a compressible gum by managing various characteristics of the multiple ingredients, the delivery system containing the multiple ingredients, and/or the compressible chewing gum containing the delivery system and/or how the delivery system is made in a manner as previously discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0364">The active ingredients mentioned above are meant as examples of active ingredients which could be applicable in a chewing gum granule or compressed chewing gum, however, this list should not be considered as exhaustive.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0365">Active ingredients to be applied in tablets according to embodiments of the invention may be applied as such or be included or bonded in different ways, such as being part of an inclusion complex e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,179, which is hereby incorporated by reference. A resin-bonding of nicotine is described in e.g. WO 2006/000232 which is also incorporated herein by reference. Further conventional methods of applying active ingredients may obviously be applied within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0366">The active ingredients may advantageously be applied in a gum base-containing module or a tablet-module substantially free of gum base depending on the applied type of active ingredient. If the active ingredient is of the pharmaceutical type, such ingredient may very often advantageously be comprised in a tablet module substantially free of gum base whereas taste relevant active ingredients advantageously may be added to the gum base-containing module and very often to both types of modules. The taste relevant active ingredient may both be added as separate particles which are mixed and compressed with gum base-containing particles in one module and it may be incorporated into gum base-containing granules.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0367">In the present context, the terms granule and particle are used interchangeable in the sense that a granule or particle for use in a compression process is regarded to be a relatively small object, which together with other granules or particles may be compressed into a stable chewing gum tablet. The granules or particles may be produced in several different ways. A gum base-containing granule of particle may typically be produced substantially into the desired shape by means of an extrusion process or alternatively be produced on the basis of a gum base-containing mass which is subsequently separated into particles of a smaller size.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0368">The following non-limiting examples illustrate different methods of obtaining a different gum base content including the evaluation of the release properties of these.

<p id="p-0357" num="0371">For a two-layer tablet with each module comprising gum base, the composition of these gum bases may be different or the same. An example would be to use GB1 as the gum base part in a first layer and use GB2 as the gum base part in a second layer. It is seen that the only active ingredient indicated in table 1 is the pH control agent Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. According to embodiments of the invention, this could be replaced with any other active ingredients as mentioned within this description.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0372">Example 1 disclosed examples of content of chewing gum granules according to embodiments of the invention. Examples on how API may be added to a composition of a layer of a compressed chewing gum tablet in order to avoid possible segregation problems are shown in the following examples 2-5.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Single Line Binding API with Flavor</heading>
<p id="p-0359" num="0373">The API (API: pharmaceutically active ingredient), in this example NPR, was dispersed in a mixture of grinded chewing gum granules and isomalt in a ratio of approximately 2:3.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0374">In a next step 1.0 Wt-% peppermint flavor was sprayed into the powder mixture from a nozzle, whereby the NPR was &#x2018;glued&#x201d; to both the grinded chewing gum granules and the isomalt.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0375">In a next step the resulting mixture was sieved through an 800 &#x3bc;m sieve in order to remove larger cloggings.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0376">The resulting product was a mixture of not very distinctly sized granules with NPR bound to both grinded chewing gum granules and to isomalt, whereby an improved mixing was facilitated.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Dual Line Binding API with Flavor</heading>
<p id="p-0363" num="0377">The pharmaceutically active ingredient (API), in this example NPR, was dispersed with an isomalt composition.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0378">In a next step 1.0 Wt-% peppermint flavor was sprayed into the powder mixture from a nozzle, whereby the NPR was attached to the surface of the isomalt.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0379">Hereby particles with an approximate diameter, corresponding to the approximate diameter of the chewing gum granules to be used in the same module, were obtained, and subsequently a desired amount of chewing gum granules were added to obtain a resulting mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0380">The resulting product was a mixture of not very distinctly sized granules of which some were chewing gum granules and some were isomalt with bound NPR, whereby an improved mixing was facilitated.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Dry Binding an API in the Pores or the Irregular Surface of a Dry Binder by Means of an Ordered Blending Process</heading>
<p id="p-0367" num="0381">The powder blend was produced in an ordered blending process where the ingredients were blended in a specific order. The pharmaceutically active ingredient (API), in this example NPR, was mixed with a dry binder, in this example a dextrate consisting of large porous particles. The API was bound physically in the pores of the dry binder by Van der Waal forces or electrostatic forces to a degree in order for segregation to be avoided. In a next step the resulting spaces between the dry binders were filled up by isomalt.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0382">Dry binders for use in a method like described here will typically have an average diameter of approximately 190 to 220 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0383">The resulting product was a dry bound NPR powder blend with an approximate diameter corresponding to the approximate diameter of the grinded gum base. In this mixture/composition segregation is reduced to an acceptable level due to the more equal sizes and due to the dry binder mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0384">It should be noted, that by &#x201c;more equal sizes&#x201d; it is not meant that the particle sizes do actually have to be equal or almost equal, but it is meant that the difference in particle size has been significantly reduced as compared to NPR particles by themselves in blend with the chewing gum granules.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Dry Binding an API by Means of Adhesive Contact to the Dry Binder</heading>
<p id="p-0371" num="0385">A dry binding process as in example 4 was repeated with the modification that small dry binder particles were now used, in this example a copovidone. Hereby the dry binding is the result of small dry binders which fill the spaces between e.g. the NPR and the further ingredients such as isomalt and mannitol. With smaller dry binders the dry binder particles are able to establish several adhesive contacts with the API and the further ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0386">Dry binders for use in a method like described here will typically have an average diameter of approximately 65 to 75 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0387">The resulting product was a dry bound NPR powder blend with an approximate diameter corresponding to the approximate diameter of the grinded gum base.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0388">Another method of dry binding known to the skilled person may be used within the scope of the present invention. The method is known as a Carrier Mixing in which a dry binder with an average diameter of approximately 75 to 150 &#x3bc;m (e.g. Mannitol EZ) is used. Here the active ingredient is binded in the internal space of the dry binder particles.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 6</heading>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Different Gum Base Weight</heading>
<p id="p-0375" num="0389">Besides as seen in example 1, a further example of how to obtain different gum base content of said first and second chewing gum modules is to have different gum base weight in each module. Table 2 discloses two different examples of two-layered chewing gum tablets, wherein the two layers in each tablet comprise a different amount of gum base by weight.</p>

<p id="p-0380" num="0394">A composition of gum base particles will typically vary slightly in size, however to be able to obtain an improved administration of different pharmaceutically active ingredients with respect to a desired release and according to a desired synchronism through a different size of the particles, a more markedly difference in the particle sizes is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0395">Different sizes of the gum base particles may be obtained in a number of different ways, for example through grinding.

<p id="p-0385" num="0399">A further example of how to obtain different gum base content of said first and second chewing gum modules is to have different active ingredients in each gum base in each module. Four examples of gum base compositions are shown in table 4, wherein GB6 comprises polysorbate as the active ingredient, GB7 comprises Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>as the active ingredient, GB5 comprises two active ingredients, namely both polysorbate and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and GB8 is an example of a gum base free of active ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0400">The active ingredients mentioned in this example are not to be considered as limiting for which active ingredients may be used; on the contrary one or both of polysorbate and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>in the gum bases below may be substituted with many different active ingredients to create a large number of advantageous gum bases.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0401">It can be seen that the gum base compositions may be free of active ingredients (e.g. GB8) or comprise one (e.g. GB6 and GB7) or more (e.g. GB5) active ingredients.</p>

<p id="p-0403" num="0417">Control of the release was tested for chewing gum tablets comprising two modules with different gum base content and a different active ingredient in each of them.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0418">In this example a gum base content different with respect to composition was investigated. In the first layer the active ingredient (NPR) was added to the chewing gum composition outside the gum base granules and in the second layer the active ingredient (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>pH control agent) was added approximately 50 Wt-% to the chewing gum composition outside the gum base granules and approximately 50 Wt-% incorporated in the granules. A fast release of part of the pH control agent was seen which quickly ensured a desired pH in the mouth cavity, whereby the following slower release of NPR was given good conditions in that the pH was initially set to a value where the NPR was maintained essentially on non-ionic form and the slower release of the remaining part of the pH control agent (contained inside the granules) of the second layer helped to maintain this desired pH in the mouth cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0419">To ensure that the result of this example was not due to different API in the two layers, the example was further supplemented with a test with the same amount of a same API incorporated in the granules and added directly to the composition respectively, where it was again seen that the release was dependent on the chewing gum composition</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0420">The conclusion of this example was that a desired release or a desired synchronism could be obtained from different compositions of the gum bases and improved control of release profiles was made possible.</p>

<p id="p-0407" num="0421">Control of the release was tested for chewing gum tablets comprising two modules with different gum base content and a different active ingredient in each of them.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0422">In this example a gum base content different with respect to weight was investigated. In the first layer the active ingredient (NPR) was present with a large amount of gum base and in the second layer the active ingredient (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>pH control agent) was present with a small amount of gum base. The release of the pH control agent was seen to occur faster than the release of the NPR, whereby a desired pH in the mouth cavity was obtained relatively fast, and the release of NPR was given good conditions in that the pH relatively quickly reached a value where the NPR was maintained essentially on non-ionic form.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0423">To ensure that the result of this example was not due to different API in the two layers, the example was further supplemented with a test with two different weights of the same API in the compositions in the two layers, where it was again seen that the release was dependent on the weight of the gum base content in the chewing gum composition.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0424">The conclusion of this example was that a desired release or a desired synchronism could be obtained from different weights of the gum bases and improved control of release profiles was made possible. Hence it seems that release profile control may be controlled by selecting a certain amount of gum base for each module.</p>

<p id="p-0413" num="0427">In the first layer the active ingredient (NPR) was present with chewing gum granules with a relatively smaller average diameter and in the second layer the active ingredient (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>pH control agent) was present with chewing gum granules with a relatively larger average diameter.
