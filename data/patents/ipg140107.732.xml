<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of measuring the levels of gases in the body of individuals or the environment for treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">All forms of life are supported by a variety of substances; including but not limited to hormones, proteins, peptides, amino acids, minerals (ions), vitamins (chemicals or compounds that function as vitamins) and bacteria. These substances create the homeostasis essential to maintain life for humans as well as plants and animals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current scientific findings have not identified that some pairs of substances affect levels of each other in the body. Furthermore, certain other substances modulate (regulate) levels of the pairs of substances. Additionally, certain substances are a part of more than one modulated pair of substances. These relationships can be utilized in order to determine various health parameters of an individual, however, to date; these corollary relationships have not been established in order to effectively use them.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need in the field to identify and utilize the homeostatic relationship between the substances that are important to the body's functioning via the measuring of various levels of the substances that are part of these pairings. There is also a need to utilize the homeostatic relationships in order to analyze different environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the invention is the establishing of a treatment based upon gases in the body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the invention is remediation of imbalances in relationships between gases in the body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still yet another object of the invention of the invention is the establishing of a treatment based upon gases in an environment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the invention is remediation of imbalances in relationships between gases in an environment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still yet another object of the invention of the invention is the establishing of a treatment based upon gases in water.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the invention is remediation of imbalances in relationships between gases in water.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An aspect of the present invention may be a method for treating an individual by comparing levels of gases in an individual: measuring a level of nitric oxide in the individual; measuring a level of carbon monoxide in the individual; measuring a level of hydrogen sulfide in the individual; comparing the measured levels; and establishing a treatment based upon the compared measured levels.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another aspect of the present invention may be a method for establishing a treatment by comparing levels of gases in an environment: measuring a level of nitric oxide in the environment; measuring a level of carbon monoxide in the environment; measuring a level of hydrogen sulfide in the environment; comparing the measured levels; and establishing a treatment based upon the compared measured levels.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still yet another aspect of the present invention may be a method for establishing a treatment by comparing levels of gases in water; measuring a level of nitric oxide in the water; measuring a level of carbon monoxide in the water; measuring a level of hydrogen sulfide in the water; comparing the measured levels; and establishing a diagnosis based upon the compared measured levels.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">All forms of life are supported by modulated pairs of substances. These substances create the homeostasis essential to maintain life for humans as well as animals.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Several terms are used herein and are defined as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The term &#x201c;modulator&#x201d; means an agent, substance or mechanism that facilitates the maintenance of homeostasis between pairs. &#x201c;Pairs&#x201d; may be hormones, minerals, proteins, amino acids, bacteria, virus, gases and natural processes. The agent can decrease intensity of stimulatory processes or substances, or increase intensity of compensatory ones.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;catalyst&#x201d; means the driver which initiates modulation to take place. Such catalysts can include enzymes, hormones, RNA, gases and countless signaling mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;gas&#x201d; refers to all compounds and molecules that are distinguished from the solid and liquid states by relatively low density and viscosity and relatively great expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;Homeostatic Relationship (Homeostasis)&#x201d; means the balance or equilibrium between two substances. The relationship does not have to be 50%-50% but can vary depending upon the two substances in question.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;Extracellular Matter (ECM)&#x201d; means all body fluid outside of cells and blood; including but not limited to cerebrospinal fluid, lymph, chyle, interstitial fluid, saliva, transcellular fluid, amniotic fluid, sperm, and sputum.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;Mental Functioning Activity (MFA)&#x201d; means the rate of activity attributable to the neural firing rate in the brain and elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The invention addresses the diagnostic analysis of the corollary relationships between gases that provide and maintain homeostasis in an individual as well as within the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The data for measuring homeostasis between gases within a modulated pair can vary from one individual or specimen to another due to environmental factors, basic metabolism, genetic make-up and other factors. Accordingly, a range of homeostatic relationships will need to be determined for all modulated pairs in order to assess deviations and disruptions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">By utilizing the analysis of data relative to the ranges of homeostasis and the deviations thereof, medical science (for humans as well as well as in veterinary medicine for animals) will be able to manufacture new pharmaceutical products and other substances, prepare diets, manufacture devices, create therapies, compound personalized nutrients or substances of various types in order to maintain or regulate homeostasis.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Data derived from the application of the invention will allow for diagnostic analysis and control of levels of gases in order to prevent their depletion, to maintain adequate levels to prevent disruption as well as to create recommendations for which substances may counteract with others and the levels of which substances must be modified on an ongoing basis in order to provide optimal health/well being through homeostasis.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, enzymes, amino acids, proteins, etc., are essential to create defenses for the organs, glands and operating systems of the body, as well as to provide the energy to sustain life, establishing corollary relationships between gases that may require &#x201c;nutrients&#x201d; for their production will enable cross-category analysis to prevent depletion of the body's defense in order to prevent illness as well as to increase levels of nutritional energy to strengthen the body to offset the effects of existing ailments and diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The concept of modulation in relation to homeostatic pairs is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This example illustrates a relationship between two substances, A and B, and the existence of a third substance C that serves to support A or B in order to attempt to maintain an adequate level of homeostasis (balance) between the two substances.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some examples of modulated pairs in gases within an individual include, nitric oxide and carbon dioxide modulated by hydrogen sulfide and oxygen and carbon monoxide modulated by nitric oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that some gases can function as part of a pair and also be a modulator for another pair. For example, noted above was the pair of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, which is modulated by hydrogen sulfide. Nitric oxide also operates as a modulator for the pair of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Correlation between base values expressed when the range of homeostasis is determined and individual test results can be used as a means of assessing levels or disruptions between pairs or the existence of increases in the levels of modulators in order to maintain homeostasis. Methods of diagnostic analysis may also detect the presence of catalysts as markers for the existence of a disruption within a modulated pair that the body is in the process of correcting. Detection of such catalysts may be included as a factor in the process of analyzing the correlation of substances within modulated pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Described herein is an example of the determination of homeostatic levels of the sets of modulated pairs discussed above. The first set is the pair of nitric oxide <b>10</b> and carbon monoxide <b>12</b> which is modulated by hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b> and the pair of oxygen <b>16</b> and carbon dioxide <b>18</b> modulated by nitric oxide <b>10</b>. These relationships are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> how nitric oxide <b>10</b> is both modulated and a modulator. As such the five gases are interconnected and their interrelationship plays a role in the functioning of an individual's health processes.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the method of evaluating the homeostatic levels of one set of the modulated pairs in order to provide a base index for administering medication and performing analysis. In step <b>102</b> the level of nitric oxide <b>10</b> is measured in an individual. The level of nitric oxide <b>10</b> may be measured by a variety of diagnostic tests that include but are not limited to the analysis of diagnostic imaging that indicates activity and the analysis of various fluids, excretions and exhalations, within and produced by the body. Examples of these fluids and excretions include: blood and its components; serum; urine; fecal matter; collagen; chyle; interstitial fluid (tissue fluid); lymph; extracellular fluid; amniotic fluid; sweat tears; saliva; mucus; phlegm; hair; fingernails; bone marrow and exhaled breath.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition to the conventional diagnostic analysis of levels of substances from the aforementioned sources, various existing and yet to be developed diagnostic processes that measure outcomes resulting from these substances can be utilized. These devices may include blood gas analysis devices, devices to assess levels of gases exhaled from individuals, EEG, PET scans, use of MEG machines, SPECT analysis, functional and diffusion MRI technologies as well as other iterations thereof (fMRI and dMRI respectively), CT scans, and ultrasound. Correlation between base values expressed when the range of homeostasis is determined and individual test results may then be used as a means of assessing levels or disruptions between pairs or the existence of increases in the levels of modulators in order to maintain homeostasis. Methods of diagnostic analysis may also detect the presence of catalysts as markers for the existence of a disruption within a modulated pair that the body is in the process of remediating. Detection of such catalysts is included as a factor in the process of analyzing the correlation of substances within modulated pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">This invention provides the biological foundation that will enable monitoring relationships within modulated pairs of substances as they relate to medical care; including wellness, prevention and treatment pertaining to the mind (brain) and body as well as environmental issues; e.g. the quality of air and water.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The measured level of nitric oxide <b>10</b> in the body or environment may be expressed in various units depending upon the test employed in order to measure the level of the nitric oxide <b>10</b>. This level can be expressed by the variable X. There is a preferred range in which X may fall that varies depending upon the type of test that is used in order to measure the level of nitric oxide <b>10</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention a standard type of test is used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In step <b>104</b> the level of carbon monoxide <b>12</b> in an individual is measured. This level can be measured using one of the various processes listed above. The measured level of carbon monoxide <b>12</b> is preferably expressed in the same units of measurement as that used in the measurement of nitric oxide <b>10</b> so as to more readily compare the levels with respect to each other in order to obtain a base level. This level can be expressed by the variable Y. There is a preferred range in which Y may fall that varies depending upon the type of test that is used in order to measure the level of carbon monoxide <b>12</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention a standard type of test is used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In step <b>106</b> the level of hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b> in an individual is measured. This level can be measured using one of the processes listed above. The measured level of hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b> is preferably expressed in the same units of measurement as that used in the measurement of nitric oxide <b>10</b> so as to more readily compare the levels with respect to each other in order to obtain a base level.

There is a preferred range in which Z may fall that varies depending upon the type of test that is used in order to measure the level of hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention a standard type of test is used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>108</b>, the measured levels X, Y and Z are then compared to standard levels. This may be done in a number of different ways. One possible way in which this can be accomplished is to total the values of all of the levels (X+Y+Z) in order to establish sum level C. This sum level C can be used in step <b>110</b> in order to establish an appropriate treatment of the individual that may include the provision of medication and other matters related to the measured levels. Another method is to compare the ratios of X:Y, X:Z and Y:Z to determine whether or not the proper ratio levels are maintained and/or present. These ratio levels may then be used in providing an appropriate treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The treatment may include, but is not limited to the provision of more hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b> to an individual. Alternatively, the reduction of hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b> may be necessitated. The provision of and/or reduction of carbon monoxide <b>12</b> and/or nitric oxide <b>10</b> may also be part of the treatment in order to return the levels of nitric oxide <b>10</b>, carbon monoxide <b>12</b> and hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b> to normal levels.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An example of this is provided below using hypothetical numbers so as to make understanding of the process easier.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Measuring nitric oxide <b>10</b> via a blood test results in a number for X that results in a number 5, from within a range of 1-10. Measuring carbon monoxide <b>12</b> via a blood test results in a number for Y of 4 from within a range of 1-10. Measuring hydrogen sulfide <b>14</b> via a blood test results in a number for Z of 6 from within a range of between 1-10. These numbers are then totaled and results in a C value of 15. A value for C between 10 and 20 may indicate a normal level.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The method of evaluating the homeostatic levels of the pair of oxygen <b>16</b> and carbon dioxide <b>18</b> modulated by nitric oxide <b>10</b> may be used in order to provide a base index for administering medication and to perform behavioral analysis. This method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In step <b>202</b> the level of oxygen <b>16</b> is measured in an individual.

In an embodiment of the present invention a standard type of test is used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In step <b>204</b> the level of carbon dioxide <b>18</b> in an individual is measured. This level can be measured using one of the various processes listed above. The measured level of carbon dioxide <b>18</b> is preferably expressed in the same units of measurement as that used in the measurement of oxygen <b>16</b> so as to more readily compare the levels with respect to each other in order to obtain a base level.
