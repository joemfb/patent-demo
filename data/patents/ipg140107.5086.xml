<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Provided is a method and apparatus for reducing transmission of location information when tracking the geographic location of one or more mobile devices. A mobile device generates location information using GPS technology and provides the location information to a communication device on an ongoing basis. In a first embodiment, if the location information of the mobile device is not needed, then the communication device transmits a message indicating that the location information of the mobile device is not needed. Upon receiving the message, the mobile device stops providing location information to the communication device on the ongoing basis. This can reduce the amount of information that gets transferred over the air between users sharing their location information.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application relates to mobile devices, and more particularly to tracking the geographic location of one or more mobile devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A location-based service (LBS) is an information and entertainment service that makes use of the geographical position of one or more mobile devices. Some applications involves tracking the geographic location of one or more mobile devices. In order for a communication device to track the location of a mobile device, the communication device receives location information from which the geographical location of the mobile device can be determined. The location information can be generated by the mobile device using GPS technology or by other means. The communication device can receive location information on an ongoing basis in order to keep up to date on the geographical location of the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to accurately track the geographical location of the mobile device, location information might be provided rather frequently, for example every few seconds. Unfortunately, this can involve a lot of messaging. Excessive messaging can be costly in terms of network utilization and power consumption for the mobile device. If the communication device performing the tracking is also mobile, then power consumption for the communication device is also a concern.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This problem can be worsened if the communication device is tracking more than one mobile device. Tracking the geographic location of several different mobile devices increases the number of messages involved.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Other aspects and features of the present disclosure will become apparent, to those ordinarily skilled in the art, upon review of the following description of the specific embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Apparatus for Reducing Location Messages</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shown is a block diagram of an example communication system. The communication system has a wireless network <b>20</b>, and a plurality of devices <b>10</b>,<b>30</b> including a mobile device <b>10</b> and a communication device <b>30</b>. There might be other devices, but they are not shown for simplicity. The mobile device <b>10</b> has a wireless access radio <b>11</b>, a GPS receiver <b>12</b>, a processor <b>13</b>, a location data provider <b>14</b>, and might have other components but they are not shown for simplicity. The communication device <b>30</b> has a network interface <b>31</b>, a processor <b>32</b>, a location message reducer <b>33</b>, a tracking application <b>34</b>, a screen <b>35</b>, and might have other components but they are not shown for simplicity. There are a plurality of GPS satellites <b>40</b> (only one shown for simplicity) for those devices that are GPS-enabled, for example the mobile device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The operation of the communication system will now be described by way of example. For this example, it is assumed that the communication device <b>30</b> is tracking the geographic location of at least one mobile device including the mobile device <b>10</b> shown in the illustrated example. The mobile device <b>10</b> generates location information using GPS technology, which involves receiving GPS signals <b>41</b> from the GPS satellites <b>40</b> using its GPS receiver <b>12</b>. The location data provider <b>14</b> of the mobile device <b>10</b> provides location information to the communication device <b>30</b> for location tracking. Communication between the communication device <b>30</b> and the mobile device <b>10</b> is through the wireless network <b>20</b>. The mobile device <b>10</b> uses its wireless access radio for communicating wirelessly over a wireless connection <b>21</b>, while the communication device <b>30</b> uses its network interface <b>31</b> for communicating over a connection <b>22</b>. The network interface <b>31</b> can be a wireless access radio if the communication device <b>30</b> is a mobile device, or any suitable network interface if the communication device <b>30</b> is a wired device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The tracking application <b>34</b> uses the location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> for tracking the location of the mobile device <b>10</b>. The tracking application <b>34</b> might for example display on the screen <b>35</b> a graphic representation of the location of the mobile device <b>10</b> on a map. In order to accurately track the geographical location of the mobile device <b>10</b>, location information might be sent rather frequently, for example every few seconds. Unfortunately, this can involve a lot of messaging. Excessive messaging can be costly in terms of network utilization and power consumption for the mobile device <b>10</b>. If the communication device <b>30</b> is a mobile device, then its power consumption is also a concern. In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, the location message reducer <b>33</b> is configured to reduce the number of location information messages involved. This can reduce the amount of information that gets transferred over the air between users sharing their location information.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a first embodiment, if the location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> is not needed, for example if the tracking application <b>34</b> is no longer running or is otherwise not presently tracking the location of the mobile device <b>10</b>, then the location message reducer <b>33</b> transmits a message indicating that the location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> is not needed. Upon receiving the message, the location data provider <b>14</b> of the mobile device <b>10</b> stops providing location information to the communication device <b>30</b>. This can avoid excessive messaging by avoiding location messages that are not needed. The mobile device <b>10</b> might also shut down its GPS receiver <b>12</b> if it is not needed for any other purpose. The GPS receiver <b>12</b> can be turned back on if for example the mobile device <b>10</b> later receives notification that another device needs its location. Further details of the first embodiment are provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a second embodiment, the location message reducer <b>33</b> transmits a message indicating a specified distance for the mobile device <b>10</b> to travel before location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> is needed. In some implementations, the specified distance is determined based on a distance that corresponds to a pixel of the screen <b>35</b> at a given resolution. Upon receiving the message, the location data provider <b>14</b> of the mobile device <b>10</b> sends location information only whenever the mobile device <b>10</b> moves the specified distance. This can avoid excessive messaging, especially when the mobile device is not moving much. Further details of the second embodiment are provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A combination of the first embodiment and the second embodiment is also possible. For instance, in accordance with the second embodiment, the location message reducer <b>33</b> can transmit a message indicating a specified distance for the mobile device <b>10</b> to travel before location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> is needed. Thus, the communication device <b>30</b> receives location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> only whenever the mobile device <b>10</b> moves the specified distance. If at a later time the location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> is no longer needed, then in accordance with the first embodiment the location message reducer <b>33</b> transmits a message indicating that the location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> is not needed. Thus, the communication device <b>30</b> no longer receives location information of the mobile device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated example, the location message reducer <b>33</b> is implemented as software and is executed on the processor <b>32</b>. However, more generally, the location message reducer <b>33</b> may be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, or any appropriate combination thereof. Although shown as a single component, more generally, the location message reducer <b>33</b> may have one or more components. The one or more components may be integrated with other components. Also, functionality of the location message reducer <b>33</b> might be combined with other components. For example, in alternative implementations, the location message reducer <b>33</b> and the tracking application <b>34</b> are combined as a single component. Other implementations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, the location data provider <b>14</b> of the mobile device <b>10</b> stores rules of location sharing, including proximity detection, geofencing and simple location sharing to determine if the mobile device <b>10</b> even has to send its location information and how often it should be sent. This can reduce the amount of information that gets transferred over the air between users sharing their location information. Example details of location sharing for proximity detection and geofencing are provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the illustrated example, the location data provider <b>14</b> is implemented as software and is executed on the processor <b>13</b>. However, more generally, the location data provider <b>14</b> may be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, or any appropriate combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the illustrated example, it is assumed that the communication device <b>30</b> and the mobile device <b>10</b> communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, it is to be understood that alternative arrangements are possible and are within the scope of the disclosure. In alternative implementations, the communication device <b>30</b> and the mobile device <b>10</b> communicate via a server (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For server-based implementations, the mobile device <b>10</b> provides location information to the server, which in turn provides the location information to the communication device <b>30</b>. If the communication device <b>30</b> sends a message for reducing the number of location messages, then the message is processed by the server. For example, if the communication device <b>30</b> sends a message indicating that the location information of the mobile device <b>10</b> is not needed, then the server can forward the message along to the mobile device <b>10</b> so that the mobile device <b>10</b> stops providing location information, assuming of course that the server does not need the location information for other purposes (e.g. for providing location information to another tracking device). If the server needs the location information for other purposes, then the server does not forward the message along to the mobile device <b>10</b> and instead continues to receive location information from the mobile device <b>10</b> but does not forward the location information to the communication device <b>30</b>. Thus, the communication device <b>30</b> does not receive location information when it is not needed, as similarly described for the peer-to-peer implementation. Further details of server-based implementation are provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the illustrated example, it is assumed that at least some of the plurality of devices <b>10</b>,<b>30</b> are GPS-enabled for determining geographic location. Whilst examples presented herein focus on use of GPS, it is to be understood that alternative means for determining geographic location are possible and are within the scope of this disclosure. For example, geographic location can alternatively be determined based on cell/sector identification within cellular network. As another example, geographic location can be determined using triangulation of signals from in-range base towers, such as those used for Wireless E911. Wireless Enhanced 911 services enable a cell phone or other wireless device to be located geographically using radiolocation techniques such as (i) angle of arrival (AOA) which entails locating the caller at the point where signals from two towers intersect; (ii) time difference of arrival (TDOA), which uses multilateration like GPS, except that the networks determine the time difference and therefore the distance from each tower; and (iii) location signature, which uses &#x201c;fingerprinting&#x201d; to store and recall patterns (such as multipath) which mobile phone signals exhibit at different locations in each cell. Coarser location information can be obtained not only be triangulating the device's position based on nearby cell towers but also based on nearby Wi-Fi access points via a WLAN radio. As an alternative example, geographic location can be determined based on bar codes. Each bar code is located in a predefined location and encodes location information for that location. A mobile device, upon scanning/taking picture of one of these bar codes, can obtain the location information. The bar codes can be 1-dimensional, or 2-dimensional. Other means for determining geographic location may be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the examples presented herein, reference is made to &#x201c;location information&#x201d; of a mobile device. It is to be understood that there are many possibilities for the location information. In specific implementations, the location information is presence information. In some implementations, the location information includes coordinates of the location of the mobile device. The coordinates might for example be derived using GPS technology. More generally, the location information includes any suitable information from which the location of the mobile device can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The communication device <b>30</b> has been described to have a configuration for location tracking, whilst the mobile device <b>10</b> has been described to have a configuration for providing location information. In some implementations, the communication device <b>30</b> is mobile and is also configured to provide location information in a similar manner as the mobile device <b>10</b>. Likewise, in some implementations, the mobile device <b>10</b> is configured to perform location tracking in a similar manner as the communication device <b>30</b>. In some implementations, both the communication device <b>30</b> and the mobile device <b>10</b> are configured for location tracking and for providing location information. In specific implementations, the mobile device <b>10</b> and the communication device <b>30</b> have identical configurations. Other implementations are possible.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">First Method for Reducing Location Messages</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown is a flowchart of a first method of reducing transmission of location information for location tracking. This method may be implemented in a communication device, for example by the location message reducer <b>33</b> of the communication device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, this method may be implemented in any appropriately configured communication device that tracks the location of a mobile device. The communication device might be wireless or wired. For this example it is assumed that the communication device and the mobile device communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, it is to be understood that they can alternatively communicate via a server as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some implementations, as indicated at step <b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, the communication device requests to automatically receive location information of the mobile device on an ongoing basis. Upon receiving the request, the mobile device starts to provide location information on an ongoing basis. Therefore, at step <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, the communication device automatically receives location information of the mobile device on an ongoing basis. The location information might for example be used by an application tracking the geographic location of the mobile device. In order to accurately track the geographical location of the mobile device, location information might be provided rather frequently, for example every few seconds. Unfortunately, this can involve a lot of messaging.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At step <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>, the communication device determines whether location information of the mobile device is needed. This might for example involve determining whether the location information is presently needed. In specific implementations, this involves determining whether an application that uses the location information is no longer running or is otherwise not presently tracking the location of the mobile device. Alternatively, or additionally, a determination might be made as to whether the location information is expected to be needed at some future time. In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, if the location information of the mobile device is not needed, then at step <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> the communication device transmits a message indicating that the location information of the mobile device is not needed. Upon receiving the message, the mobile device stops providing location information to the communication device on an ongoing basis. This avoids excessive messaging by avoiding location messages that are not needed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Later at step <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> the communication device determines whether location information of the mobile device is needed. This might for example involve determining whether the application that uses the location information has been re-executed or is otherwise not tacking the location of the mobile device. If location information of the mobile device is needed, then at step <b>2</b>-<b>6</b> the communication device transmits a message indicating that the location information of the mobile device is needed. Upon receiving the message, the mobile device continues to provide location information on an ongoing basis. At step <b>2</b>-<b>7</b>, the communication device automatically receives the location information on an ongoing basis. Thus, the application that uses the location information can continue to use the location information for tracking purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some implementations, the method returns to step <b>2</b>-<b>3</b> so that the communication device can determine at a later time whether location information of the mobile device is needed. In other words, the method can repeat itself.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the examples presented herein, reference is made to a communication device automatically receiving location information of the mobile device on an &#x201c;ongoing basis&#x201d;. In some implementations, the ongoing basis is periodic. However, it is to be understood that the ongoing basis can be irregular and might be dependent upon one or more events or variables. For example, an update of location information of a mobile device might be received only whenever the mobile device moves a specified distance. Regardless, location information is provided automatically without any specific request except for an initial request for automatically receiving location information on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The method described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> pertains to a communication device performing location tracking. Other methods for a communication device performing location tracking are presented later. It is to be understood that, for each method described for the communication device performing location tracking, there is a corresponding method for the mobile device being tracked. An example is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, shown is a flowchart of a method of ceasing to send location information if it is not needed for location tracking. This method may be implemented in a mobile device, for example by the location data provider <b>14</b> of the mobile device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, this method may be implemented in any appropriately configured mobile device. For this example it is assumed that the mobile device communicates with a communication device in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, it is to be understood that they can alternatively communicate via a server as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, as indicated at step <b>3</b>-<b>1</b>, the mobile device receives a request for location information of the mobile device on an ongoing basis. This might be for example because a tracking application of the communication device is to track the location of the mobile device. At step <b>3</b>-<b>2</b>, the mobile device automatically sends location information of the mobile device on an ongoing basis. This allows the communication device to track the location of the mobile device. In some implementations, a GPS receiver used for determining the location information of the mobile device is turned on if it is off at the time of the request.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If at step <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> the mobile device receives a message indicating that location information of the mobile device is not needed, then at step <b>3</b>-<b>4</b> the mobile device ceases to send location information of the mobile device on the ongoing basis. The mobile device might receive the message for example if a tracking application that uses the location information is no longer running or is otherwise not presently tracking the location of the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some implementations, as indicated at step <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>, the mobile device turns off a GPS receiver used for determining the location information of the mobile device if the GPS receiver is not needed for any other purpose. Turning off the GPS receiver can reduce power consumption for the mobile device. The GPS receiver can be turned back on if for example the mobile device later receives notification that another device needs its location.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some implementations, the method returns to step <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> at a later time if the mobile device receives another request for location information of the mobile device on an ongoing basis. In other words, the method can repeat itself.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, shown are signaling diagrams showing example signaling that might be used for location tracking. The signaling is shown between a first device <b>50</b> having a first location sharing application <b>51</b> and a first event service <b>52</b>, and a second device <b>60</b> having a second location sharing application <b>61</b> and a second event service <b>62</b>. For this example it is assumed that the first device <b>50</b> and the second device <b>60</b> communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, it is to be understood that they can alternatively communicate via a server as described earlier. It is also to be understood that these signaling diagrams are very specific for exemplary purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, signaling is shown for a scenario in which the first device <b>50</b> wants to be notified about the location of the second device <b>60</b> on an ongoing basis. At step <b>4</b>A-<b>1</b>, the first location sharing application <b>51</b> sends to the first event service <b>52</b> a location event request. At step <b>4</b>A-<b>2</b>, the first event service <b>52</b> sends to the second event service <b>62</b> an event request for receiving location information every 120 seconds. Note that the interval of 120 seconds is implementation specific. The event request is processed by the second event service <b>62</b> to determine whether permission has been granted for location information. If permission has not already been granted, then at step <b>4</b>A-<b>3</b> the second event service <b>62</b> sends to the second location sharing application <b>61</b> a request for permission. At step <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>, the second location sharing application <b>61</b> sends to the second event service <b>62</b> a response indicating whether permission has been granted. Note that steps <b>4</b>A-<b>3</b> and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b> can be skipped if permission has been previously granted. For this example, it is assumed that permission has been granted, either previously or by the response at step <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>. At step <b>4</b>A-<b>5</b>, the second event service <b>62</b> sends to the first event service <b>52</b> an acknowledgement indicating whether the event request has been granted. The acknowledgement indicates an identifier (e.g. location event &#x2018;xyz&#x2019;) to the first device <b>50</b> so that any subsequent request involving the location event can identify the location event using the identifier. At step <b>4</b>A-<b>6</b>, the first event service <b>52</b> sends to the first location sharing application <b>51</b> an indication of whether the location event request was granted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For this example, it is assumed that the location event request has been granted. Therefore, at step <b>4</b>A-<b>7</b> the second event service <b>62</b> sends location messages to the first event service <b>52</b>. In this example, this includes location information at periodic intervals of 120 seconds as requested. At step <b>4</b>A-<b>8</b>, for each message received at step <b>4</b>A-<b>7</b>, the first event service <b>52</b> sends to the first location sharing application <b>51</b> a notification about the event. Thus, the first location sharing application <b>51</b> receives location information of the second device <b>60</b> on a periodic basis.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, signaling is shown for a scenario in which the first device <b>50</b> no longer wants to be notified about the location of the second device <b>60</b>. This scenario might arise for example if the first location sharing application <b>51</b> is no longer running or is otherwise not tracking the location of the second mobile device <b>60</b> and so there is no need for location information of the second device <b>60</b>. At step <b>4</b>B-<b>1</b>, the first location sharing application <b>51</b> sends to the first event service <b>52</b> a remove location event request. At step <b>4</b>B-<b>2</b>, the first event service <b>52</b> sends to the second event service <b>62</b> a remove event request. The remove event request identifies the location event using the identifier previously received (i.e. location event &#x2018;xyz&#x2019;) and is processed by the second event service <b>62</b> to remove the location event. Once removed, the second event service <b>62</b> no longer sends location messages to the first event service <b>52</b>. Finally, at step <b>4</b>B-<b>3</b> the second event service <b>62</b> sends to the second location sharing application <b>61</b> a notification that the location event has been removed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the illustrated example, the location event is removed using a remove event request. In alternative implementations, the location event is merely paused or placed on hold. Note that there is no need to remove the location event. There might be advantages and disadvantages to each approach. For instance, if a location event is merely paused or placed on hold, then state might be maintained in order to keep track of which events are on hold. However, with removing the event request, there is no need to remember the event request. Another consideration is that there might be a fair bit of handshaking for establishing location events between devices. Therefore, if a location event is merely paused or placed on hold, then the overhead involved in re-establishing a location event can be avoided. Rather, a simple resume message can be used to resume the location event after a simple pause/hold message is used to pause or hold the location event.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Second Method for Reducing Location Messages</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, shown is a flowchart of a second method of reducing transmission of location information for location tracking. This method may be implemented in a communication device, for example by the location message reducer <b>33</b> of the communication device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, this method may be implemented in any appropriately configured communication device that tracks the location of a mobile device. The communication device might be wireless or wired. For this example it is assumed that the communication device and the mobile device communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, it is to be understood that they can alternatively communicate via a server as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At step <b>5</b>-<b>1</b>, the communication device requests to automatically receive location information of a mobile device on an ongoing basis. Upon receiving the request, the mobile device starts to provide location information on an ongoing basis. At step <b>5</b>-<b>2</b>, the communication device automatically receives location information of the mobile device on an ongoing basis. The location information might for example be used by an application tracking the geographic location of the mobile device. In some implementations, as indicated at step <b>5</b>-<b>3</b>, the communication device displays on a screen a graphic representation of the location of the mobile device on a map at a given resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In order to accurately track the geographic location of the mobile device, location information might be received rather frequently, for example every few seconds. Unfortunately, this can involve a lot of messaging. However, depending on the resolution of the map being displayed, small changes in location of the mobile device might have no effect on how the location is displayed on the map. For instance, if a map of the entire world is being displayed, then a single pixel on the screen might correspond to approximately 32 km. Accordingly, there might be no need to receive location information for the mobile device unless it moves 32 km from its current position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Therefore, at step <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> the communication device determines an amount of distance for the mobile device to travel before location information of the mobile device is needed. In some implementations, the communication device determines the smallest distance that the mobile device has to move for any application on the communication device to be interested in being notified. At step <b>5</b>-<b>5</b>, the communication device transmits a message indicating the specified distance and that location information of the mobile device is needed only if the mobile device travels the specified distance. This might for example inform the mobile device that its location information is not needed unless the mobile device moves 32 km (or other distance based on current resolution) from its current position. Upon receiving the message, the mobile device provides location information to the communication device only whenever there is movement of the specified distance as indicated by the communication device. This avoids excessive messaging by avoiding location messages that are not needed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that the communication device continues to receive location information of the mobile device on an ongoing basis, but that the frequency of updates can be reduced because updates are provided only whenever the mobile device travels the specified distance.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some implementations, the method returns to step <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> if there is any change to the amount of distance for the mobile device to travel before location information of the mobile device is needed. This might occur for example if there is a change to the resolution of a map being displayed. This might also occur if the tracking application used for displaying the location of the mobile device in the map has been closed, or if another tracking application is launched.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the illustrated example, it is assumed that the communication device determines the specified distance. In alternative implementations, the specified distance is static and pre-configured in the communication device in which case the communication device might not determine the specified distance per se. Note that this would not allow changes to the specified distance based on changes to the resolution of a map being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A combination of the first method and the second method is also possible. For instance, in accordance with the first method, the communication device can transmit a message indicating a specified distance for the mobile device to travel before location information of the mobile device is needed. Thus, the communication device receives location information of the mobile device only whenever the mobile device moves the specified distance. If at a later time the location information of the mobile device is no longer needed, then in accordance with the first method the communication device transmits a message indicating that the location information of the mobile device is not needed. Thus, the communication device no longer receives location information of the mobile device.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Proximity Detection</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Proximity detection involves detecting whether two objects are within vicinity of one another, or conversely out of vicinity of one another. A mobile device can determine whether it is within vicinity of another mobile device by receiving location information of the other mobile device and comparing it to its own location information. Frequently receiving location information of the other mobile device can allow for accurate tracking. However, as explained earlier, excessive messaging is undesirable. Proximity detection implemented in a manner that can reduce the amount of location information involved will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, shown is a block diagram featuring two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b>. For this example, it is assumed that the second mobile device <b>80</b> is tracking the location of the first mobile device <b>70</b> in order to determine whether the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are within vicinity of one another. The two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are shown to be separated by distance D, which is assumed to be great enough so that the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are not considered to be within vicinity of one another. The two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are considered to be within vicinity of one another if the distance between them is less than a predefined proximity distance.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Details of the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are not shown for simplicity. In a specific implementation, the first device <b>70</b> is configured in a similar manner as the mobile device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while the second mobile device <b>80</b> is configured in a similar manner as the communication device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The second mobile device <b>80</b> nonetheless has a location message reducer (not shown) configured to reduce the number of location information messages involved. Alternative configurations are possible and are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The operation of the second mobile device <b>80</b> performing the proximity detection will now be described by way of example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is a flowchart of a method of reducing transmission of location information for proximity detection. For this example it is assumed that the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, it is to be understood that they can alternatively communicate via a server as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The method starts under the assumption that the second mobile device <b>80</b> has already calculated the distance D between the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> and has determined that the distance D is greater than the predefined proximity distance. At step <b>7</b>-<b>1</b>, the second mobile device <b>80</b> determines a first boundary <b>71</b> defining an area of possible locations for the first mobile device outside of which location information of the first mobile device <b>70</b> is needed. At step <b>7</b>-<b>2</b>, the second mobile device <b>80</b> determines a second boundary <b>81</b> defining an area of possible locations for the second mobile device outside of which location information of the first mobile device <b>70</b> is needed. The boundaries <b>71</b>,<b>81</b> are determined such that the first mobile device <b>70</b> and the second mobile device <b>81</b> cannot be less than the predefined proximity distance from one another without at least one of the mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> leaving its respective boundary <b>71</b>,<b>81</b>. Therefore, as long as neither mobile device <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> leaves its respective boundary <b>71</b>,<b>81</b>, there is no need for transmission of location information for proximity detection. This avoids excessive messaging.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the illustrated example, each boundary <b>71</b>,<b>81</b> is a circle having a respective radius R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>. However, it is to be understood that any boundary is possible, provided that the first mobile device <b>70</b> and the second mobile device <b>81</b> cannot be less than the predefined proximity distance from one another without at least one of the mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> leaving its respective boundary <b>71</b>,<b>81</b>. Alternative boundaries include squares, other polygons, irregular shapes, infinite strips, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>7</b>-<b>3</b>, the second mobile device <b>80</b> transmits a message indicating the first boundary and that location information of the first mobile device <b>70</b> is needed upon the first device <b>70</b> leaving the first boundary. At step <b>7</b>-<b>4</b>, the second mobile device <b>80</b> requests location information of the first mobile device <b>70</b> if the second mobile device <b>80</b> leaves the second boundary <b>81</b>. Therefore, at step <b>7</b>-<b>5</b> the second mobile device <b>80</b> receives location information of the first mobile device <b>70</b> if the first mobile device <b>70</b> leaves the first boundary <b>71</b> or if the second mobile device <b>80</b> leaves the second boundary <b>81</b>. This allows the second mobile device <b>80</b> to determine whether the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are in vicinity of one another if either of the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> leaves its respective boundary <b>71</b>,<b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If at step <b>7</b>-<b>5</b> the second mobile device <b>80</b> receives location information of the first mobile device <b>70</b>, then at step <b>7</b>-<b>6</b> the second mobile device <b>80</b> determines whether further location tracking is needed. In particular, if the second mobile device <b>80</b> determines that the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are in vicinity of one another, then no further location tracking is performed and instead at step <b>7</b>-<b>7</b> the second mobile device <b>80</b> executes a user notification to inform the user that the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are in vicinity of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">However, if the second mobile device <b>80</b> determines that the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are not in vicinity of one another, then further location tracking is performed. In particular, the method goes back to the start in which the boundaries <b>71</b>,<b>81</b> are re-determined based on the new locations of the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">There are many ways to determine the size of the boundaries <b>71</b>,<b>81</b>. In some implementations, they are determined to be large enough to reduce excessive messaging, but small enough to ensure that the two mobile devices do not quickly become in vicinity of one another before being detected by the second mobile device <b>80</b>. In some implementations, the radius R<sub>1 </sub>of the first boundary <b>71</b> is slightly less than half the distance D between the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b>, but is greater than the predefined proximity distance. In some implementations, the radius R<sub>1 </sub>of the first boundary <b>71</b> is computed by subtracting the predefined proximity distance plus some margin from the total distance D between the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> and taking half of the remaining distance. In some implementations, the radius R<sub>2 </sub>of the second boundary <b>81</b> is identical to the radius R<sub>1 </sub>of the first boundary <b>71</b>. However, note that there is no need for the boundaries <b>71</b>,<b>81</b> to be equal in size or shape.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, the boundaries are determined as a function of both location and speed. For instance, if the first mobile device <b>70</b> is moving faster than the second mobile device <b>80</b>, then the first boundary <b>71</b> can be larger than the second boundary <b>81</b>. This can reduce the number of times the boundaries are updated. If one user is not moving or is completely stationary, then the boundary around this user can be very small. In some implementations, the size of the boundaries can change as a function of speed each time the boundaries <b>71</b>,<b>81</b> are updated. Thus, changes in speed can result in change in boundary size.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some implementations, each boundary <b>71</b>,<b>81</b> is a geofence, which is a virtual boundary on a geographic area. A geofence request can be sent to the first mobile device <b>70</b> for instructing the first mobile device <b>70</b> to provide its location information only if it leaves the first geofence <b>71</b>. The geofence request can specify the geofence <b>71</b>, for example by defining center and the radius R<sub>2 </sub>of the second boundary <b>81</b>. Other implementations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The illustrated method focuses on determining whether the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> are in vicinity of one another. A similar method can be used for determining whether two mobile devices are no longer in vicinity of one another. For such method, the first boundary and the second boundary can be determined such that the first mobile device and the second mobile device cannot be more than the predefined proximity distance from one another without at least one of the mobile devices leaving its respective boundary. The second mobile device determines whether the two mobile devices are no longer in vicinity of one another when they are separated by at least the predefined proximity distance.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Geofencing is a limited case of proximity detection in which a communication device tracks movement of a mobile device, regardless of any movement of the communication device. Because any movement of the communication device is not considered, the communication device might be a wired device. The communication device determines a boundary that the mobile device must leave before location information of the mobile device is needed. The boundary is determined such that location information of the mobile device is not needed as long as the mobile device resides in the boundary. The communication device transmits a message indicating the boundary so that the mobile device will automatically provide location information only if it leaves the first boundary. Therefore, the communication device automatically receives location information of the mobile device only if the mobile device has left the boundary. This avoids excessive messaging.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the illustrated example, it is assumed that the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, it is to be understood that alternative arrangements are possible and are within the scope of the disclosure. In alternative implementations, the two mobile devices <b>70</b>,<b>80</b> communicate via a server (not shown). If a server-based architecture is used, then the server can do the proximity calculation, but the same principles apply. A method similar to the one described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be implemented for server-based implementations. If a server-based architecture is used, then from the perspective of the first mobile device <b>70</b>, there would be no difference except that messages would be sent to/from a server. The second mobile device <b>80</b> would send its location to the server as a message requesting proximity detection. If a proximity threshold is reached, then a message would be sent from the server to the second mobile device <b>80</b>. By contrast, in a peer-to-peer implementation, the notification would originate from the second mobile device <b>80</b>. A specific server-based implementation is described below for exemplary purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once a server determines that proximity detection is to be performed (e.g. a request is received) between a first mobile device and a second mobile device, then the server determines respective boundaries for the mobile devices. The server transmits a message to the first mobile device indicating a first boundary and that an update of location information of the first mobile device is needed upon the first mobile device leaving the first boundary. The server also transmits a message to the second mobile device indicating a second boundary and that an update of location information of the second mobile device is needed upon the second mobile device leaving the second boundary. In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, the first and second boundaries are determined based on both location and speed of the mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the first mobile device leaves the first boundary, then the server receives location information of the first mobile device and requests location information of the second mobile device. Also, if the second mobile device leaves the second boundary, then the server receives location information of the second mobile device and requests location information of the first mobile device. Therefore, if either mobile device leaves its respective boundary, then the server will become updated with the respective locations of the mobile devices. This allows the server to determine proximity of the mobile devices. More generally, the server determines whether further location tracking is needed. If further location tracking is needed, then the server goes back to determining the first boundary and the second boundary for performing further location tracking. Otherwise, the server notifies at least one of the mobile devices. In some implementations, the notification includes a result of the determination. For instance, if the server determines that the mobile devices are within a predefined proximity distance from one another, then the notification can indicate this.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Aggregating Location Information</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, shown is a block diagram of another example communication system. The communication system has a wireless network <b>25</b>, and a plurality of devices <b>75</b>,<b>76</b>,<b>85</b> including at least two mobile devices <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> and a communication device <b>85</b>. There might be other devices, but they are not shown for simplicity. Details of the devices <b>75</b>,<b>76</b>,<b>85</b> are not shown for simplicity. In a specific implementation, each mobile device <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> is configured in a similar manner as the mobile device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while the communication device <b>85</b> is configured in a similar manner as the communication device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternative configurations are possible and are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operation of the communication system will now be described by way of example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is a flowchart of a method of reducing transmission of location information by aggregating location information. For this example it is assumed that the communication device <b>85</b> is tracking the location of each mobile device <b>75</b>,<b>76</b>. Each mobile device <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> provides location information to the server <b>26</b>, which in turn provides the location information to the communication device <b>85</b>. In some implementations, the server <b>26</b> combines location information from each mobile device <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> into one message. Therefore, as indicated at step <b>9</b>-<b>1</b>, the communication device <b>85</b> can receive location information for each mobile device <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> in the same message. This reduces the number of messages provided to the communication device <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a specific example, if the communication device <b>85</b> is to receive location information from five other users (not shown) every 20 seconds, then instead of receiving five individual messages over a 20 second period, all the messages received within the 20 second period can be aggregated on the server <b>26</b> and sent as one message. The reception of location information from various devices can be aggregated on the server <b>26</b> and sent as one message/packet to the communication device <b>85</b> at an agreed upon &#x201c;heartbeat&#x201d; thereby reducing multiple asynchronous messages to a single message.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Conversely, if each mobile device <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> is tracking the location of the communication device <b>85</b>, assuming that the communication device <b>85</b> is mobile, then after the communication device <b>85</b> determines location information at step <b>9</b>-<b>2</b> the communication device <b>85</b> can send the location information to all mobile devices <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> using the same message at step <b>9</b>-<b>3</b>. In particular, the communication device <b>85</b> sends location information to the server <b>26</b>, which in turn sends the location information to each mobile devices <b>75</b>,<b>76</b>. Thus, only one message is sent by the communication device <b>85</b> for providing the location information to each mobile device <b>75</b>,<b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some implementations, the communication device <b>85</b> has rules and filters for location sharing stored on the server <b>26</b> so that the server <b>26</b> can determine if any location information is to be provided to devices such as the mobile devices <b>75</b>,<b>76</b> shown in the illustrated example. In some implementations, all location information is stored on the server <b>26</b> and external applications receive location updates from the server <b>26</b> instead of directly from the communication device <b>85</b>. This can allow the location information to be sent once (to the server <b>26</b>) and the server <b>26</b> can then send it along to all recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a specific example, if both a Twitter site and a Facebook site are to be updated with location information, then this can come from the server <b>26</b> instead of directly from the communication device <b>85</b>. The communication device <b>85</b> sends location information to the server <b>26</b>, which in turn sends the location information to Twitter and Facebook applications on other servers so as to update Twitter and Facebook accounts. Therefore, the communication device <b>85</b> sends location information once (to the server <b>26</b>) as opposed to sending it twice (once to Twitter server, and once to Facebook server). Once the Twitter and Facebook accounts are updated, then any device using Twitter and/or Facebook can be updated with the location information using Twitter and/or Facebook protocols. In some implementations, twitter and/or facebook applications notify a device application of the change in location information. Other implementations are possible.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Another Mobile Device</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, shown is a block diagram of another mobile device <b>100</b> that may implement any of the device methods described herein. The mobile device <b>100</b> is shown with specific components for implementing features similar to those of the communication device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is to be understood that the mobile device <b>100</b> is shown with very specific details for exemplary purposes only.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A processing device (a microprocessor <b>128</b>) is shown schematically as coupled between a keyboard <b>114</b> and a display <b>126</b>. The microprocessor <b>128</b> is a type of processor with features similar to those of the processor <b>32</b> of the communication device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The microprocessor <b>128</b> controls operation of the display <b>126</b>, as well as overall operation of the mobile device <b>100</b>, in response to actuation of keys on the keyboard <b>114</b> by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The mobile device <b>100</b> has a housing that may be elongated vertically, or may take on other sizes and shapes (including clamshell housing structures). The keyboard <b>114</b> may include a mode selection key, or other hardware or software for switching between text entry and telephony entry.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition to the microprocessor <b>128</b>, other parts of the mobile device <b>100</b> are shown schematically. These include: a communications subsystem <b>170</b>; a short-range communications subsystem <b>102</b>; the keyboard <b>114</b> and the display <b>126</b>, along with other input/output devices including a set of LEDs <b>104</b>, a set of auxiliary I/O devices <b>106</b>, a serial port <b>108</b>, a speaker <b>111</b> and a microphone <b>112</b>; as well as memory devices including a flash memory <b>116</b> and a Random Access Memory (RAM) <b>118</b>; and various other device subsystems <b>120</b>. The mobile device <b>100</b> may have a battery <b>121</b> to power the active elements of the mobile device <b>100</b>. The mobile device <b>100</b> is in some embodiments a two-way radio frequency (RF) communication device having voice and data communication capabilities. In addition, the mobile device <b>100</b> in some embodiments has the capability to communicate with other computer systems via the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Operating system software executed by the microprocessor <b>128</b> is in some embodiments stored in a persistent store, such as the flash memory <b>116</b>, but may be stored in other types of memory devices, such as a read only memory (ROM) or similar storage element. In addition, system software, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as the RAM <b>118</b>. Communication signals received by the mobile device <b>100</b> may also be stored to the RAM <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The microprocessor <b>128</b>, in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software applications on the mobile device <b>100</b>. A predetermined set of software applications that control basic device operations, such as a voice communications module <b>130</b>A and a data communications module <b>130</b>B, may be installed on the mobile device <b>100</b> during manufacture. In addition, a personal information manager (PIM) application module <b>130</b>C may also be installed on the mobile device <b>100</b> during manufacture. The PIM application is in some embodiments capable of organizing and managing data items, such as e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. The PIM application is also in some embodiments capable of sending and receiving data items via a wireless network <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the data items managed by the PIM application are seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated via the wireless network <b>110</b> with the device user's corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system. As well, additional software modules, illustrated as another software module <b>130</b>N, may be installed during manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The flash memory <b>116</b> stores computer executable instructions for implementing features similar to those of the location message reducer <b>33</b> of the communication device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In a specific implementation, the other module <b>130</b>N of the flash memory <b>116</b> stores computer executable instructions that when executed implement a location message reducer. Note that the implementations described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are very specific for exemplary purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through the communication subsystem <b>170</b>, and possibly through the short-range communications subsystem <b>102</b>. The communication subsystem <b>170</b> includes a receiver <b>150</b>, a transmitter <b>152</b>, a GPS receiver <b>162</b>, and one or more antennas, illustrated as a receive antenna <b>154</b>, a transmit antenna <b>156</b>, and a GPS antenna <b>164</b>. In addition, the communication subsystem <b>170</b> also includes a processing module, such as a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>158</b>, and local oscillators (LOs) <b>160</b>. The communication subsystem <b>170</b> having the transmitter <b>152</b> and the receiver <b>150</b> is a specific implementation of the network interface <b>31</b> of the communication device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem <b>170</b> is dependent upon the communication network in which the mobile device <b>100</b> is intended to operate. For example, the communication subsystem <b>170</b> of the mobile device <b>100</b> may be designed to operate with the Mobitex&#x2122;, DataTAC&#x2122; or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile data communication networks and also designed to operate with any of a variety of voice communication networks, such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Personal Communications Service (PCS), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), etc. Examples of CDMA include 1&#xd7; and 1&#xd7;EV-DO. The communication subsystem <b>170</b> may also be designed to operate with an 802.11 Wi-Fi network, and/or an 802.16 WiMAX network. Other types of data and voice networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized with the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Network access may vary depending upon the type of communication system. For example, in the Mobitex&#x2122; and DataTAC&#x2122; networks, mobile devices are registered on the network using a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) associated with each device. In GPRS networks, however, network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of a device. A GPRS device therefore typically has a subscriber identity module, commonly referred to as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, in order to operate on a GPRS network.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When network registration or activation procedures have been completed, the mobile device <b>100</b> may send and receive communication signals over the communication network <b>110</b>. Signals received from the communication network <b>110</b> by the receive antenna <b>154</b> are routed to the receiver <b>150</b>, which provides for signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog-to-digital conversion of the received signal allows the DSP <b>158</b> to perform more complex communication functions, such as demodulation and decoding. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network <b>110</b> are processed (e.g., modulated and encoded) by the DSP <b>158</b> and are then provided to the transmitter <b>152</b> for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network <b>110</b> (or networks) via the transmit antenna <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition to processing communication signals, the DSP <b>158</b> provides for control of the receiver <b>150</b>, the transmitter <b>152</b>, and the GPS receiver <b>162</b>. For example, gains applied to communication signals in the receiver <b>150</b> and the transmitter <b>152</b> may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or web page download, is processed by the communication subsystem <b>170</b> and is input to the microprocessor <b>128</b>. The received signal is then further processed by the microprocessor <b>128</b> for an output to the display <b>126</b>, or alternatively to some other auxiliary I/O devices <b>106</b>. A device user may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using the keyboard <b>114</b> and/or some other auxiliary I/O device <b>106</b>, such as a touchpad, a rocker switch, a thumb-wheel, or some other type of input device. The composed data items may then be transmitted over the communication network <b>110</b> via the communication subsystem <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a voice communication mode, overall operation of the device is substantially similar to the data communication mode, except that received signals are output to a speaker <b>111</b>, and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone <b>112</b>. Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device <b>100</b>. In addition, the display <b>126</b> may also be utilized in voice communication mode, for example, to display the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Location determination using GPS technology involves receiving GPS signals from GPS satellites <b>166</b> on the antenna <b>164</b>. The GPS signals are received using the GPS receiver <b>162</b> and processed by the DSP <b>158</b>. Typically, GPS signals from at least four satellites are processed. Further details of GPS are omitted for simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The short-range communications subsystem <b>102</b> enables communication between the mobile device <b>100</b> and other proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short range communications subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth&#x2122; communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Numerous modifications and variations of the present disclosure are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the disclosure may be practised otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p>
