<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, a method of forming a semiconductor device, and a data processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-115538, May 19, 2010, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, dimensions of transistors have become smaller due to miniaturization of semiconductor elements. The dimensional reductions of the transistors will cause remarkable short channel effects of the transistors. As the dimensions of memory cells in dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) and the like are reduced, the channel lengths of transistors are also reduced, which may cause degradation of the performance of transistors. The deterioration in retention of memory cells or writing characteristics has been problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above, recess (trench) field effect transistors (FETs), fin FETs, and the like have been developed. The recess (trench) FET has a structure in which a trench (also called a groove) is formed in a semiconductor substrate to obtain a channel having a three-dimensional structure. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publications, Nos. JP-A-2005-064500, JP-A-2007-027753, and JP-A-2007-305827 disclose that the fin FET has a structure in which a fin is formed between trenches to obtain a channel having a three-dimensional structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The trench FET is formed by forming a trench in a semiconductor substrate and forming a gate electrode within the trench while a gate insulating film is interposed between the gate electrode and the semiconductor substrate. A channel of the trench FET has a three-dimensional structure. The fin FET is formed by forming a gate electrode over a gate insulting film so as to cross over a fin protruding from a bottom surface of the trenches formed in the semiconductor substrate. Consequently, the channel has a three-dimensional structure. In any case, it is possible to suppress the short channel effects because the gate length can be lengthened with respect to the channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A study has been carried out to adopt buried gate transistors for selecting transistors included in memory cells in the DRAMs due to reduction in size of the memory cell. The buried gate transistor has a structure in which a gate electrode is buried in the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The gate electrode of the buried gate transistor does not protrude from the surface of the substrate because the gate electrode (word line) is buried in the semiconductor substrate. Among wirings connected to memory cells, only bit lines are located over the semiconductor substrate. This will increase flexibility of layouts of capacitors, contact plugs, and the like, which are included in the memory cell and formed over the semiconductor substrate. This will reduce the difficulty of processing the capacitors, the contact plugs, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a semiconductor device may include, but is not limited to, a semiconductor substrate including a fin. The fin includes first and second fin portions. The first fin portion extends substantially in a horizontal direction to a surface of the semiconductor substrate. The second fin portion extends substantially in a vertical direction to the surface of the semiconductor substrate. The fin has a channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, a semiconductor device may include, but is not limited to, the following elements. A semiconductor substrate includes an active region. The active region has a fin. The fin includes first, second, and third fin portions. The first fin portion extends substantially in a first horizontal direction to a surface of the semiconductor substrate. The second and third fin portions extend substantially in a vertical direction to the surface of the semiconductor substrate. An isolation region defines the active region. A word line extends over the isolation region and the active region. The word line extends across the fin. The word line extends substantially in a second horizontal direction perpendicular to the first horizontal direction. The word line has first and second portions. The first portion is interposed between the second and third fin portions. The second portion is over the isolation region. The first portion is smaller in width than the second portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In still another embodiment, a semiconductor device may include, but is not limited to, the following elements. A semiconductor substrate has a fin having a channel region in the vicinity of a surface of the fin. The fin includes an end portion. The end portion has first and second channel portions of the channel region. The first and second channel portions are opposed to each other. The first and second channel portions extend substantially vertical to a surface of the semiconductor substrate. A diffusion region has a bottom. The bottom is in contact with the end portion and with the first and second channel portions.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Before describing the present invention, the related art will be explained in detail, in order to facilitate the understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">A transistor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> has the channel of the three-dimensional structure described above. The transistor is formed as follows. An isolation region <b>101</b> and an active region <b>102</b> are formed in a surface portion of a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Trench portions <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> for a buried gate electrode are formed in the isolation region <b>101</b> and the active region <b>102</b>, respectively. A fin portion <b>107</b> is a protrusion which is a part of the active region <b>102</b> between the trench portions <b>103</b>. A saddle fin gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed by burying a conductive material in the trench portions <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> while a gate insulating film <b>105</b> is interposed between the saddle fin gate electrode <b>106</b> and the semiconductor substrate. That is, the saddle fin gate electrode <b>106</b> crosses over the fin portion <b>107</b>. An upper surface <b>107</b><i>a </i>of the fin portion <b>107</b> is located to be higher than a bottom surface of the trench portion <b>103</b> and to be lower than an upper surface of the active region <b>102</b> (an upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>). This is because the trench portion <b>104</b> in the active region <b>102</b> is shallower than the trench portion <b>103</b> formed in the isolation region <b>102</b>. A source region <b>108</b><i>a </i>and a drain region <b>108</b><i>b </i>(impurity diffusion layers) are formed, by implanting ions, in two active regions <b>102</b> between which the gate electrode <b>106</b> is interposed.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">However, widths of the trench portions <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> for the buried gate electrode become narrow due to the reduction in dimensions of the memory cell described above. Thus, widths of channel regions formed in the upper surface <b>107</b><i>a </i>and a side surface <b>107</b><i>b </i>of the fin portion <b>107</b> also become narrow in correspondence with the widths of the buried gate trench portions <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. Therefore, in some cases, it is difficult to sufficiently secure an ON current due to a short channel effect.</p>

At this time, the first trench portion <b>9</b> is formed in at least the surface portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> (the active region <b>6</b>). An upper trench portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>serving as a part of the second trench portion <b>10</b> is formed in the silicon nitride film <b>31</b> (the isolation region <b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The silicon oxide film <b>26</b> forming a bottom surface of the upper trench portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> is selectively removed by a wet etching process using a solution containing HF as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A to 19F</figref>. It is possible to etch the silicon oxide film <b>26</b> to the silicon nitride film <b>31</b> at a high selectivity using the HF-containing solution. Therefore, the silicon oxide film <b>26</b> under the silicon nitride film <b>31</b> is selectively removed without removing the silicon nitride film <b>31</b>. Because the wet etching process is an isotropic etching process, the silicon oxide film <b>26</b> forming the bottom surface of the upper trench portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>is etched in a depth direction and a width direction. Therefore, under the upper trench portion <b>10</b><i>a</i>, a lower trench portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>is formed to be 2&#x394;W wider than the upper trench portion <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The wet etching process by the HF-containing solution is used for forming the lower trench portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>in this embodiment, but the present embodiment is not limited thereto. In some cases, a chemical dry etching method using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride gas and ammonia gas may be used. For example, after the processes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18F</figref> are completed, the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> is set in an etching device. The semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> is kept in the etching device under the condition at 20 mTorr and at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 minute while a constant amount of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride gas and ammonia gas are supplied to the etching device. Thereby, ammonium fluorosilicate is formed on the surface of the silicon oxide film <b>26</b>. The ammonium fluorosilicate is sublimed and removed if the temperature is raised to 180&#xb0; C. At this time, an etching amount of the silicon oxide film <b>26</b> is 5 nm in thickness direction, and the etching amount can be controlled by setting a condition of the chemical dry etching method. The silicon oxide film <b>26</b> is etched since the chemical dry etching method is an isotropic etching process. Other structure members than the silicon oxide film <b>26</b> are not affected by the chemical dry etching method. The lower trench portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>can be formed with higher precision than in the above-described wet etching method.</p>
