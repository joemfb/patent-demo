<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-184375, filed on Aug. 23, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a multitrack recorder that records a sound signal in a plurality of tracks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A hitherto-known multitrack recorder records a sound signal into a plurality of tracks. A multitrack recorder makes it possible to record a rhythm guitar part in a track <b>1</b> and a lead guitar part in a track <b>2</b> by use of; for instance, an electric guitar and a vocal sound in a track <b>3</b> by use of a built-in microphone and mix down them to thereby generate and record a stereo signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is desirable that the multitrack recorder be able to record a sound signal in as many tracks as possible. In the meantime, when an attempt is made to make the multitrack recorder compact in consideration of portability, limiting the number of tracks might be unavoidable. Measures that are conceivable in the circumstances are to limit the number of tracks to a certain number; for instance, four and make some of the tracks assignable to either a monaural type or a stereo type rather than fixing the tracks solely to monaural types to enhance user's convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A magneto-optical disc editor described in JP 2002-208258 A is not directed toward a multitrack recorder but intended to enable simple edition of data recorded in a recording medium in conformance with a recording mode. The magneto-optical disc editor is configured so as to display an edit function in a selectable manner by switching a window on a display section when a recording mode is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of the configuration that enables limiting the number of tracks to a certain number and makes some of the tracks assignable to either a monaural type or a stereo type, user's operability could be deteriorated depending on processing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For instance, in a case where a sound signal recorded in a certain track is replicated (copied) to another track, if a source track is a monaural type and a monaural signal is recorded, a destination track should also be a monaural type. If a destination track desired by the user is set to a stereo type rather than to a monaural type, the sound signal cannot be replicated, which will embarrass the user. No problem will arise, as long as the user accurately takes hold of which tracks are of a monaural type or a stereo type. However, an additional burden will be imposed on the user. It will also be troublesome for the user to check which tracks are monaural types and which tracks are of a stereo type on a dedicated screen, or the like, every time a sound signal is copied.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention easily, reliably puts into practice processing for replicating a sound signal recorded in a certain track to another track in a multitrack recorder that enables assigning at least some of a plurality of tracks to a monaural type or a stereo type.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention provides a multitrack recorder that records sound signals into a plurality of tracks and that is characterized by comprising: setting means capable of setting at least any of the plurality of tracks to either a monaural track type or a stereo track type; storage means that stores the track type set by the setting means; and control means that records the sound signal recorded in a source track to a destination track in a replicating manner and that presents a track conforming to the track type of a source track as a possible destination track by use of the track types stored in the storage means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the invention, the control means is characterized by presenting a monaural track as a possible destination track when the source track is a monaural track and presenting a stereo track or a pair of monaural tracks as a possible destination track when the source track is a stereo track.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment of the invention, the control means presents a stereo track or a pair of monaural tracks as a possible destination track when the source track is a pair of monaural tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, a track conforming to a track type of a source track is automatically presented as a possible destination track. Hence, a user can easily, reliably realize processing for replicating a sound signal recorded in a certain track to another track, which results in enhancement of operability and lessening of a burden on the user.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention will be more clearly comprehended by reference to the embodiment provided below. However, the scope of the invention is not limited to the embodiment.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Assignment information is stored in the RAM <b>30</b>. The user sets the track <b>3</b> and the track <b>4</b> by switching them to a monaural type or a stereo type, by use of the operation knobs <b>20</b>. For instance, the following are set:</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Track <b>3</b>&#x2014;stereo</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Track <b>4</b>&#x2014;monaural</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, each of the track <b>3</b> and the track <b>4</b> is made up of two channels. When the track is set to a monaural type, only one of the two channels is enabled. In contrast, when the track is set to a stereo type, both of the two channels are enabled and set as an L channel and an R channel. Accordingly, when the track <b>3</b> is set to a stereo type, an L channel sound signal and an R channel sound signal are recorded in the track <b>3</b>.</p>

In response to manipulation of the menu key <b>20</b><i>i </i>and the data wheel <b>20</b><i>j</i>, the CPU <b>32</b> displays on the display section <b>24</b> a setting screen as to whether to set the track <b>3</b> and the track <b>4</b> to a monaural type or a stereo type. Alternatives, or monaural and stereo, for the respective tracks <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are displayed on the screen.

Type information about the track <b>3</b> and the track <b>4</b> is stored in the RAM <b>30</b>. Since the track <b>1</b> and the track <b>2</b> are fixed to a monaural type, information about their types does not need to be stored in the RAM <b>30</b>. However, information about types of all the tracks <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> can also be collectively stored in the RAM <b>30</b> as a table. A monaural identifier is taken as M, and a stereo identifier is taken as S.</p>

In response to manipulation of the menu key <b>20</b><i>i </i>and the data wheel <b>20</b><i>j</i>, the CPU <b>32</b> displays on the display section <b>24</b> a screen for setting a source track (SOURCE TRK) and a destination track (DESTINATION TRK). The screen shows alternatives pertaining to the source track and the destination track. The user selects a desired source track and a desired destination track.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The CPU <b>32</b> automatically displays, on this occasion, only selectable alternatives according to the type of the track <b>3</b> and the type of the track <b>4</b> stored in the RAM <b>30</b>; namely, whether each of the track <b>3</b> and the track <b>4</b> is a monaural type or a stereo type. Although a sound signal recorded in a monaural track can be replicated in a monaural track but not in a stereo track. Conversely, a sound signal recorded in a stereo track can be replicated to a stereo track but cannot be replicated to a monaural track. Incidentally, a sound signal recorded in a stereo track can be replicated to two monaural tracks that pair up with each other. Thus, given the fact that a combination of replicable tracks and a combination of tracks that cannot be replicated occur depending on track types, the CPU <b>32</b> displays only replicable tracks on the display section <b>24</b> as alternatives. Specifically, when the source track is selected, the CPU <b>32</b> accesses a table of track type information stored in the RAM <b>30</b> to identify whether or not the source track is a monaural type or a stereo type and determines an alternative for the destination track according to an identification result. An algorithm for determining alternatives for destination tracks is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">(1) When a source track is of monaural type, a destination track is of monaural type.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">(2) When a source track is of stereo type, a destination track is of stereo type or a pair of monaural-type tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">(3) When a source track is a pair of monaural-type tracks, a destination track is of stereo type. The pair of monaural-type tracks can also be included as a destination track. In particular, when a recorder includes a plurality of tracks, creation of a plurality of pairs of monaural tracks is feasible depending on specifications, and hence the plurality of pairs of monaural tracks are available.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It can also be construed that, since the track <b>3</b> and the track <b>4</b> can be set to either a monaural type or a stereo type, alternatives for a destination track can vary according to a setting status.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows possible combinations of source tracks with destination tracks achieved when the track <b>3</b> is set to a stereo type and when the track <b>4</b> is set to a monaural type.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the source track (a source TR in the drawing) is the monaural track <b>1</b>, the destination track (a destination TR in the drawing) must be of monaural type. Therefore, the destination track is limited to the track <b>2</b> or the track <b>4</b>. The CPU <b>32</b> displays on the display section <b>24</b> the track <b>2</b> and the track <b>4</b> as alternatives for the destination track. Neither the track <b>1</b> nor the track <b>3</b> is displayed as alternatives. All the user has to do is to select either the track <b>2</b> or the track <b>4</b> and does not need to take into account the track <b>1</b> and the track <b>3</b>, so that a user's choice is made simple. In the meantime, when the source track and the destination track are identical with each other, no replication can be performed. For this reason, displaying the track <b>1</b> is originally meaningless. It is, however, also possible to tentatively display the track <b>1</b> as an alternative. If the track <b>1</b> is selected, a predetermined error message can also be displayed. This is equivalent to substantial elimination of the track <b>1</b> from alternatives; namely, disabling selection of the track <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the source track is the monaural track <b>2</b>, the destination track must be of monaural type. Hence, the destination track is limited to the track <b>1</b> or the track <b>4</b>. The CPU <b>32</b> displays on the display section <b>24</b> the track <b>1</b> and the track <b>4</b> as alternatives for a destination track.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the source track is the stereo track <b>3</b>, the destination track must be of stereo type. However, since there is no more stereo track, the destination track is limited to a pair of monaural tracks. In the drawing, a pair of monaural tracks is designated by reference symbol <b>1</b>/<b>2</b>. The pair of monaural tracks <b>1</b>/<b>2</b> signifies that two monaural tracks <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are handled as a single stereo track. The CPU <b>32</b> displays on the display section <b>24</b> the track <b>1</b>/<b>2</b> as an alternative for a destination track.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the source track is the monaural track <b>4</b>, a destination track must be of monaural type.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the source track is the pair of tracks <b>1</b>/<b>2</b>, a destination track must be of stereo type; therefore, the destination track is limited to the track <b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the meantime, it is easily comprehended that, although unillustrated, possible combinations of source tracks with destination tracks that are achieved when the track <b>3</b> is set to a monaural track and when the track <b>4</b> is set to a stereo track are determined by easily replacing the destination TR <b>3</b> with the track <b>4</b> and the destination TR <b>4</b> with the track <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The CPU <b>32</b> can store tables that define the combinations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> into the RAM <b>30</b> and also display as alternatives for possible destination tracks conforming to source tracks by reference to the table.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As above, in the embodiment, the types of the tracks <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> are stored in the RAM <b>30</b>. The CPU <b>32</b> automatically extracts only possible destination tracks conforming to types of selected source tracks and presents to the user the thus-selected tracks as alternatives for the destination tracks. Accordingly, the user does not have to go to the trouble of ascertaining types of the tracks <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> in each case and seeking possible tracks. The user can quickly, reliably set destination tracks and replicate source tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Although the embodiment exemplifies the multitrack recorder having the track <b>1</b> through the track <b>4</b>, the invention is not limited to this multitrack recorder. The invention can also be applied to a multitrack recorder having five tracks or more.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the embodiment, the types of the tracks <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> or the types of all the tracks <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> are stored in the RAM <b>30</b>. However, the track types can also be stored in nonvolatile memory, such as the flash ROM <b>28</b>, and information about the track types can also be retained even after power of the multitrack recorder is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the embodiment, a number of a source track and a number of a destination track are displayed. When the source track is selected, numbers of tracks that are selectable as destination tracks are correspondingly displayed as alternatives. However, the display mode is not limited to this display. It is also possible to display numbers of destination tracks in the form of a list and highlight, as being selectable, numbers of only tracks in the list that are selectable in conformance with a type of a source track. Conversely, numbers of tracks that cannot be selected as destination tracks may also be displayed with symbol &#x201c;x.&#x201d; In short, the essential requirement for the CPU <b>32</b> is to present to the user possible destination tracks in conformance with a type of a source track.</p>
