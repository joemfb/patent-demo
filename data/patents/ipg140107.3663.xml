<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Today, home appliances often have status indicators such as timers, buzzers, lights, and beepers to indicate their status. For example, an oven may have a timer that beeps when the set time is up, indicating that whatever is baking in the oven should be done. A buzzer may go off on a washing machine when a load of laundry is finished washing. A red LED may stay on while a dish washer is still operating. These status indicators are typically only effective in conveying status information to a user if the user is in the vicinity of the appliance. Home appliances are continuously becoming more sophisticated. For example, the ability to connect appliances to a computer-based network is beginning to come about in the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, TV (television) sets are used simply to consume programming information such as audio and video. TV sets typically receive programming information via cable, satellite, or direct RF broadcast. The TV set performs standard TV broadcast channel processing and displays the associated program. A TV set is not typically interfaced to a computer-based network.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A device and/or method for accessing, monitoring, and controlling appliances via a media processing system, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other advantages, aspects and novel features of the present invention, as well as details of an illustrated embodiment thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.</p>

Specifically, a media exchange network <b>100</b> is a communication network comprising a MPS (media processing system) <b>101</b> located in a home location <b>109</b> of the media exchange network <b>100</b>, a home appliance(s) <b>102</b> located in the home location <b>109</b>, a remote PC <b>103</b> at a remote location, a 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b>, a WAN (Wide Area Network) <b>105</b>, and a LAN (Local Area Network) <b>106</b>. The MPS <b>101</b> may interface wirelessly or via a wired connection to both the LAN <b>106</b> and the WAN <b>105</b>. The remote location may be, for example, a user's second home, a friend's home, or a family member's home. The remote PC <b>103</b> may comprise a desktop PC, a notebook PC, a PDA, or any computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, a MPS may comprise a set-top-box (STB), a PC, or a TV with a media management system (MMS). A MMS is also known herein as a media exchange software (MES) platform. A MPS includes at least one media peripheral (such as a TV screen, a PC monitor, a media player, some other display device) and a broadband communication interface to allow interfacing to a wide area network (WAN), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The MPS may also include a remote control user interface to allow for controlling functionality of the MMS of the MPS, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A MMS comprises a software platform operating on at least one processor to provide certain functionality including user interface functionality, distributed storage functionality, and networking functionality. For example, a MMS may provide control of home appliances, status monitoring of home appliances, and inter-home MPS routing selection, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. An MPS is also known, herein, as a media-box and/or an M-box.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The remote PC <b>103</b>, the MPS <b>101</b>, and the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> each interface to the WAN <b>105</b>. The home appliance(s) <b>102</b> interfaces to the MPS <b>101</b> via the LAN <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The LAN <b>106</b> may comprise, for example, a home cable infrastructure, an Ethernet infrastructure, an 802.11b wireless infrastructure, or a home PNA (phoneline networking alliance) infrastructure, providing local networking capability within the home location <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The WAN <b>105</b> may include cable infrastructure, DSL infrastructure, Internet infrastructure, broadband access headends (e.g., cable headends, satellite headends), or intranet infrastructure in order to provide communications between, for example, the MPS <b>101</b>, the remote PC <b>103</b>, and the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The MPS <b>101</b> comprises a TV screen <b>107</b> (i.e., media peripheral) for selection and viewing of media content and for access, monitoring, and control of the home appliance(s) <b>102</b>. The media exchange network <b>100</b> further comprises a remote control <b>108</b> (i.e., a user control device) that a user may employ to control the functionality of the MPS <b>101</b>. Other user control devices may include a keyboard and a mouse connected to a PC, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The home appliance(s) <b>102</b> may comprise a dishwasher, a refrigerator, a microwave oven, a clothes washer, a clothes dryer, a hot water heater, a heating system, an air conditioning system, or any other type of home appliance that is capable of being networked to the LAN <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the MPS <b>101</b> may indirectly access, monitor, and control the home appliance(s) <b>102</b> via the LAN <b>106</b> with the remote control <b>108</b> interacting with the TV screen <b>107</b>. The remote PC <b>103</b> may indirectly access, monitor, and control the home appliance(s) <b>102</b>. Such access, monitoring, and control may be accomplished in a communication pathway via the WAN <b>105</b> and MPS <b>101</b>. Similarly, the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> may also indirectly access, monitor, and control the home appliance(s) <b>102</b> via the WAN <b>105</b> and MPS <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Today, TV is typically only used for media consumption, not to control home appliances without performing media consumption, for example. An MPS may or may not be the beneficiary or initiator of home appliance control, monitoring, and access. For example, the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> may carry out access, monitoring, and control of a home appliance(s) <b>102</b> via the MPS <b>101</b> without information consumption or user interaction. In such a case, the MPS <b>101</b> is not going to receive or use information directly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">There are many types of indirect control commands available to manipulate the home appliance(s) <b>102</b>. Each home appliance may have particular indirect commands unique to that appliance or type of appliance. Many of the indirect commands find parallels to the available direct commands. Exemplary commands include turning the home appliance(s) <b>102</b> on and off, parameter adjustment commands, access commands, monitoring commands, mode change commands, and programming commands.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The home appliance(s) <b>102</b> may be controlled from the TV screen <b>107</b>, the remote PC <b>103</b>, or the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> via user interaction, or automatically, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a first method <b>200</b>, using the media exchange network <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for indirectly accessing, monitoring, or controlling a home appliance, in accordance with certain aspects of the present invention. In step <b>201</b>, indirect access, monitoring, or control of a home appliance is initiated by a communication initiation device. The communication initiation device may comprise, for example, a MPS, a PC, or a third party system. The home appliance may comprise, for example, a clothes washer, a clothes dryer, a refrigerator, a microwave oven, or a dish washer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>202</b>, a decision is made based on whether or not the communication initiation device is a MPS or not. If the communication initiation device is a MPS, then the method <b>200</b> proceeds to step <b>203</b>, else the method <b>200</b> proceeds to step <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>203</b>, at least one access, monitor, or control command is communicated indirectly from the communication initiation device to the home appliance over a communication path (link) comprising at least one wired and/or wireless network connection between the communication initiation device and the home appliance. The at least one wired and/or wireless network connection may comprise at least one local area network and/or at least one wide area network, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step <b>204</b>, at least one access, monitor, or control command is communicated indirectly from the communication initiation device to the home appliance over a communication path (link) comprising at least one MPS and at least one wired and/or wireless network connection between the communication initiation device and the home appliance. The at least one wired and/or wireless network connection may comprise at least one local area network and/or at least one wide area network, or any combination thereof. In step <b>205</b>, the home appliance responds to the at least one access, monitor, or control command.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As defined herein, a communication initiation device may include a MPS, a PC, or a 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a second method <b>210</b>, using the media exchange network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for indirectly accessing, monitoring, and controlling a home appliance, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. In step <b>211</b>, a communication link is established between a communication initiation device and a home appliance. In step <b>212</b>, a command is communicated from the communication initiation device to the home appliance via the communication link. In step <b>213</b>, the home appliance generates a response to the command.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, various home appliance responses may include powering on, powering off, changing a mode of operation (e.g., heat, cool, wash, dry, rinse, etc.), sending a status (e.g., temperature) to the communication initiation device, adjusting an operational parameter (e.g., water temperature, oven temperature, etc.), and changing a programmed operational step (e.g., wash, dry, rinse, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As an example, a user of the MPS <b>101</b> may be washing clothes in the home appliance <b>102</b> which comprises a clothes washer. The home appliance <b>102</b> is connected to the MPS <b>101</b> via the LAN <b>106</b>. The user of the MPS <b>101</b> may send a command to the home appliance <b>102</b> in order to monitor the status of the home appliance <b>102</b>. The home appliance <b>102</b> may respond by sending status information to the MPS <b>101</b>. For example, when the load of clothes are finished washing, the home appliance <b>102</b> sends a &#x201c;laundry done&#x201d; response to the MPS <b>101</b>. The response may appear on the TV screen <b>107</b> of the MPS <b>101</b> to alert the user. As a result, the user knows to go put the washed clothes in the clothes dryer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As another example, the user of the MPS <b>101</b> may go on vacation. The user signs up with the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> to monitor and control the home appliance <b>102</b>, which is an air conditioning unit, while the user is on vacation. The air conditioning unit is networked to the MPS <b>101</b> via the LAN <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> may send a command to the home appliance <b>102</b> via the WAN <b>105</b>, the MPS <b>101</b>, and the LAN <b>106</b> in order to monitor the on/off status of the home appliance <b>102</b>. The home appliance <b>102</b> may respond by sending status information corresponding to its on/off state over the media exchange network <b>100</b> to the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the user gets back from vacation, the 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> may provide the user with a report of the percentage of time the home appliance <b>102</b> (i.e., air conditioning unit) was on versus off during the user's vacation. The user may use this information to set the temperature in his home <b>109</b> the next time he goes on vacation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As yet another example, the user of the MPS <b>101</b> may be at work at a location remote from his home <b>109</b>. The user has access to the PC <b>103</b> at the remote location. While working on the PC <b>103</b>, the user remembers that he wants to turn on the home appliance <b>102</b>, which is an oven, at 5:00 pm in order to bake some potatoes that he previously placed in the oven before he left for work. As a result, the user uses the PC <b>103</b> to command the home appliance <b>102</b> to turn on and be set to a baking temperature of 350 degrees. The command is sent to the home appliance <b>102</b> via the WAN <b>105</b>, the MPS <b>101</b>, and the LAN <b>106</b>. The oven responds by turning on and heating to 350 degrees. When the user gets home at 5:45 pm, the potatoes are done baking.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other examples may include a 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> checking on whether or not a home appliance <b>102</b> has the latest software upgrade or a 3<sup>rd </sup>party service provider <b>104</b> performing a test of a home appliance <b>102</b>, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A major challenge is to be able to transfer and share many different types of digital media, data, and services between one device/location and another with ease while being able to index, manage, and store the digital media and data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, it is desirable to be able to distribute and store many types of digital media in a PC and/or television environment in a user-friendly manner without requiring many different types of software applications and/or unique and dedicated interfaces. Any networking issues or other technical issues should be transparent to the users. It is also desirable to take advantage of existing hardware infrastructure, as much as possible, when providing such capability.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment of the present invention, a media exchange network is provided that enables many types of digital media, data, and/or services to be stored, indexed, viewed, searched for, pushed from one user to another, and requested by users, using a media guide user interface. The media exchange network also allows a user to construct personal media channels that comprise his personal digital media (e.g., captured digital pictures, digital video, digital audio, etc.), request that third-party media channels be constructed from third-party digital media, and access the media channels pushed to him by other users on the media exchange network.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">PC's may be used but are not required to interface to the media exchange network for the purpose of exchanging digital media, data, and services. Instead, set-top-boxes or integrated MPS's (media processing systems) may be used with the media exchange network to perform all of the previously described media exchange functions using a remote control with a television screen.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Current set-top-boxes may be software enhanced to create a MPS that provides full media exchange network interfacing and functionality via a TV screen with a TV guide look-and-feel. PC's may be software enhanced as well and provide the same TV guide look-and-feel. Therefore, the media exchange network supports both PC's and MPS's in a similar manner. Alternatively, a fully integrated MPS may be designed from the ground up, having full MPS capability.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the case of an MPS configuration, the user takes advantage of his remote control and TV screen to use the media exchange network. In the case of a PC configuration, the user takes advantage of his keyboard and/or mouse to use the media exchange network.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An MPS or enhanced PC is effectively a storage and distribution platform for the exchange of personal and third party digital media, data, and services as well as for bringing the conventional television channels to a user's home. An MPS and/or PC connects to the media exchange network via an existing communication infrastructure which may include cable, DSL, satellite, etc. The connection to the communication infrastructure may be hard-wired or wireless.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The media exchange network allows users to effectively become their own broadcasters from their own homes by creating their own media channels and pushing those media channels to other authorized users on the media exchange network, such as friends and family members.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises a media exchange network <b>300</b> for exchanging and sharing digital media, data, and services in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The media exchange network <b>300</b> is a secure, closed network environment that is only accessible to pre-defined users and service providers. The media exchange network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises a first PC <b>301</b> and a first media processing system (MPS) <b>302</b> at a user's home <b>303</b>, a communication infrastructure <b>304</b>, external processing hardware support <b>305</b>, remote media storage <b>306</b>, a second PC <b>307</b> at a remote location <b>308</b> such as an office, and a second MPS <b>309</b> at a parent's home <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The PC's <b>301</b> and <b>307</b> and the MPS's <b>302</b> and <b>309</b> each include a media exchange software (MES) platform <b>311</b> and a networking component <b>312</b> for connectivity. The MES platform <b>311</b> provides multiple capabilities including media &#x201c;push&#x201d; capability, media &#x201c;access&#x201d; capability, media channel construction/selection, image sequence selection, text and voice overlay, channel and program naming, inter-home routing selection, authorship and media rights management, shared inter-home media experience, billing service, and an integrated media guide interface providing a TV channel guide look-and-feel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The external processing hardware support <b>305</b> comprises at least one server such as a centralized internet server, a peer-to-peer server, or cable head end. The server may alternatively be distributed over various hosts or remote PC's. The MES platform <b>311</b> may also reside on the external processing hardware support server <b>305</b>. The remote media storage <b>306</b> may comprise user media storage and distribution systems <b>313</b> and/or third party media storage and distribution systems <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The communication infrastructure <b>304</b> may comprise at least one of internet infrastructure, satellite infrastructure, cable infrastructure, dial-up infrastructure, cellular infrastructure, xDSL infrastructure, optical infrastructure, or some other infrastructure. The communication infrastructure <b>304</b> links the user's home <b>303</b>, parent's home <b>310</b>, remote media storage <b>306</b>, and remote location office <b>308</b> to each other (i.e., the communication infrastructure <b>304</b> links all users and service providers of the media exchange network <b>300</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The various functions <b>315</b> of the media exchange network <b>300</b> comprise generating personal network associations, personal storage management, media capture device support, security/authentication/authorization support, authorship tracking and billing and address registration and maintenance. These media exchange management functions <b>315</b> may be distributed over various parts of the media exchange network <b>300</b>. For example, the personal network associations and personal storage management functions may be integrated in the PC <b>301</b> at the user's home <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of personal media exchange over a media exchange network <b>400</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In step <b>1</b>, the media exchange software (MES) platform <b>401</b> is used to construct personal media channels on a PC <b>402</b> by a user at &#x201c;my house&#x201d; <b>403</b>. For example, with various media stored on the PC <b>402</b> such as digital pictures <b>404</b>, videos <b>405</b>, and music <b>406</b>, the MES platform <b>401</b> allows the digital media to be organized by a user into several channels having a media guide user interface <b>407</b> on the PC <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step <b>2</b>, the user at &#x201c;my house&#x201d; <b>403</b> pushes a media channel <b>408</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Joe's Music&#x201d;) to &#x201c;brother's house&#x201d; <b>409</b> and pushes two media channels <b>410</b> and <b>411</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Vacation Video&#x201d; and &#x201c;Kid's Pictures&#x201d;) to &#x201c;Mom's house&#x201d; <b>412</b> via a peer-to-peer server <b>413</b> over the internet-based media exchange network <b>400</b>. &#x201c;Brother's house&#x201d; <b>409</b> includes a first MPS <b>414</b> connected to the media exchange network <b>400</b>. &#x201c;Mom's house&#x201d; <b>412</b> includes a second MPS <b>415</b> connected to the media exchange network <b>400</b>. The MPS's <b>414</b> and <b>415</b> also provide a media guide user interface <b>407</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>3</b>, brother and/or Mom access the pushed media channels via their respective media processing systems (MPS's) <b>414</b> and <b>415</b> using their respective MPS TV screens and remote controls.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of third-party media exchange over a media exchange network <b>500</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In step <b>1</b>, a PC-initiated third-party request is made by a first party <b>501</b> via an internet-based media exchange network <b>500</b> using a media guide user interface <b>502</b> on a PC <b>503</b>. In step <b>2</b>, an anonymous delivery of the requested third-party channel <b>504</b> is made to a second party <b>505</b> via the internet-based media exchange network <b>500</b>. In step <b>3</b>, the second party <b>505</b> accesses the third-party channel <b>504</b> using a media guide user interface <b>506</b> on a TV screen <b>507</b> that is integrated into an MPS <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Similarly, in step A, an MPS-initiated third-party request is made by a second party <b>505</b> via an internet-based media exchange network <b>500</b> using a media guide user interface <b>506</b> on a TV screen <b>507</b> using a remote control <b>509</b>. The second party <b>505</b> may key in a code, using his remote control <b>509</b>, that is correlated to a commercial or some other third party broadcast media. In step B, an anonymous delivery of the requested third-party channel <b>504</b> is made to a first party <b>501</b> via the internet-based media exchange network <b>500</b>. In step C, the first party <b>501</b> accesses the third-party channel <b>504</b> using a media guide user interface <b>502</b> on a PC <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a media guide user interface <b>600</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The media guide user interface <b>600</b> may be displayed on a TV screen <b>608</b> and controlled by a remote control device <b>609</b>. Also, the media guide user interface <b>600</b> may be displayed on a PC monitor and controlled by a keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The media guide user interface <b>600</b> may be configured not only for conventional TV channels but also for personal media channels <b>601</b> that are constructed by a user of a media exchange network, friend's and family's media channels <b>602</b> constructed by friends and family, and third party channels <b>603</b> that are constructed by third parties either upon request by a user of a media exchange network or based on a profile of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The personal media channels <b>601</b> may include, for example, a &#x201c;family vacations channel&#x201d;, a &#x201c;kid's sports channel&#x201d;, a &#x201c;my life channel&#x201d;, a &#x201c;son's life channel&#x201d;, a &#x201c;my music channel&#x201d;, and a &#x201c;kid's music channel&#x201d;. The friends and family media channels <b>602</b> may include, for example, a &#x201c;brother's channel&#x201d;, a &#x201c;Mom's channel&#x201d;, and a &#x201c;friend's channel&#x201d;. The third party media channels <b>603</b> may include, for example, a &#x201c;Sears Fall sale channel&#x201d; and a &#x201c;car commercials channel&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Each media channel may correspond to a schedule <b>604</b> showing, for example, a week <b>605</b> and a year <b>606</b>. For example, under the &#x201c;kid's sports channel&#x201d;, Ty's soccer game could be scheduled to be viewed on Tuesday of the current week <b>605</b> and current year <b>606</b>. For each media channel, a sub-menu <b>607</b> allows for selection of certain control and access functions such as &#x201c;play&#x201d;, &#x201c;send to list&#x201d;, &#x201c;send to archive&#x201d;, &#x201c;confirm receipt&#x201d;, &#x201c;view&#x201d;, &#x201c;purchase&#x201d;, and &#x201c;profile&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates possible multiple instantiations of a media guide user interface <b>700</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The media guide user interface <b>700</b> may be viewed with a schedule having formats of, for example, &#x201c;month, year&#x201d;, &#x201c;week#, year&#x201d;, &#x201c;day, week#&#x201d;, or &#x201c;hour, day&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a user of a media exchange network may push a media channel (e.g., &#x201c;Vacation in Alaska Video&#x201d;) to a friend who is on the same media exchange network. The media guide user interface <b>800</b> may give the friend several options <b>801</b> for how to accept and download the pushed media in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, a first, most expensive option <b>803</b> may be &#x201c;Express Delivery&#x201d; which would deliver the pushed media to the friend in 18 minutes using queuing and cost $1.20, for example. The pushed media may be stored in a file in an MPEG 2 format that was recorded at a rate of 4 Mbps, for example. Queuing comprises buffering and delivering a previous part of the media and then buffering and delivering a next part of the media. For example, a first six minutes of the &#x201c;Vacation in Alaska Video&#x201d; may be buffered and delivered first, then a second six minutes may be buffered and delivered next, and so on until the entire media is delivered.</p>
