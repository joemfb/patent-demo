<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor devices using a wide-gap semiconductor such as GaN, SiC, diamond, ZnO and the like are characterized by high breakdown voltage, low resistance and a high-speed operation as compared with a semiconductor device using Si. Particularly, since a HEMT (High Electron Mobility Transistor) having an AlGaN/GaN heterostructure has high electron mobility and carrier density, high-frequency performances are favorable and ON resistance is low.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the examination by the inventor, when a high-speed switching element is to be actually used, it is desirable that performances of the driving circuit that drives the high-speed switching element are high, but it was known that such a driving circuit cannot be obtained in some cases in actuality. For example, it is desirable that a gate driving circuit that drives the high-speed switching element, and wiring can address the high-speed operation and output impedance is low. However, in actuality, such a configuration cannot be obtained in some cases. Thus, a GaN element capable of high-speed switching is in demand even if the wiring inductor or output impedance is high and a high-speed signal cannot be obtained.</p>

In the heterojunction of the first layer <b>75</b> (the carrier running layer, for example) and the second layer <b>73</b> (the electron induction layer, for example), a well <b>70</b><i>c </i>having an energy level lower than that of a Fermi level <b>70</b><i>a </i>is formed on an interface between the first layer <b>75</b> and the second layer <b>73</b>. The well <b>70</b><i>c </i>is a quantum well distributed in a planar state, for example. This well <b>70</b><i>c </i>has an energy level lower than that of the Fermi level <b>70</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> is further provided with the nitride semiconductor layer <b>70</b>, and the first, second, third and fourth transistors use a part of the nitride semiconductor layer <b>70</b> as a channel.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">That is, each of the channels contained in each of the first, second, third, and fourth transistors <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> is disposed inside the nitride semiconductor layer <b>70</b> (specifically, the two-dimensional electron gas channel <b>74</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An example of an operation of the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> will be described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a state in which a supply voltage is being supplied to the power-supply electrode pad <b>64</b>, when a low-level signal is inputted to the gate terminal (gate electrode pad <b>63</b>), the third transistor <b>30</b> and the fourth transistor <b>40</b> are turned off. Thus, a high voltage is applied to the second gate <b>20</b><i>g </i>of the second transistor <b>20</b> through the resistor <b>51</b>. Then, the second transistor <b>20</b> enters the ON state. As a result, the power supply and the first gate <b>10</b><i>g </i>of the first transistor <b>10</b> are connected to each other by low impedance at such a degree of ON resistance of the second transistor <b>20</b>. As a result, the first gate <b>10</b><i>g </i>of the first transistor <b>10</b> is rapidly charged. That is, the first transistor <b>10</b> can be brought into the ON state at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, when a high-level signal is inputted to the gate terminal, the third transistor <b>30</b> and the fourth transistor <b>40</b> enter the ON state, a voltage between the second gate <b>20</b><i>g </i>and the second source <b>20</b><i>s </i>of the second transistor <b>20</b> becomes 0 V, and the second transistor <b>20</b> enters the OFF state.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The characteristic of the operation of the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> according to the embodiment will be described in comparison with a nitride semiconductor device of a reference example.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are schematic views illustrating an operation of the nitride semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">These figures illustrate a result of simulation of the characteristics of the nitride semiconductor device according to the embodiment and a nitride semiconductor device <b>119</b> in the reference example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an input signal into these nitride semiconductor devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an output signal (a signal waveform of a drain current) of these nitride semiconductor devices. The horizontal axes of these figures indicate time t. The vertical axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> indicates a voltage Vin of the input signal. The vertical axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> indicates a voltage Vout of the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in this simulation, a sinusoidal wave is used as an input signal. A state in which the gate signals inputted into the gate terminals of the nitride semiconductor devices <b>111</b> and <b>119</b> are not operated at a high speed, a state in which output impedance of the gate driving circuit is high, and a state in which an influence of wiring inductance is worried are assumed. That is, a state in which high-speed properties of a circuit that drives the nitride semiconductor device are extremely obstructed is assumed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the nitride semiconductor device <b>119</b> in the reference example, the output signal has a trapezoidal shape. During switching of the nitride semiconductor device, it is desirable that the output signal (drain current waveform) is a rectangular wave, but distortion occurs in the waveform in the case of the sinusoidal input, and switching is not operated at a high speed. If switching is not operated at a high speed, a loss of an element is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> according to the embodiment, the output signal (drain current waveform) is a substantially rectangular wave even if the input signal is a sinusoidal wave. That is, a difference between ON and OFF is clear.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, in the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> according to the embodiment, even if the gate signal inputted into the gate terminal is not operated at a high speed, even if the output impedance of the gate driving circuit is high, and even if the influence of wiring inductance is worried, switching can be operated at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment, a circuit that operates at a high speed is obtained as above by an n-type channel transistor without using a p-type channel. A p-type channel transistor is usually used in a gate driving circuit. However, in a nitride semiconductor device, it is extremely difficult to form a p-type channel transistor in practice. In the embodiment, by using the above-mentioned configuration, a driving circuit is formed by an n-type channel transistor without using a p-type channel transistor, which is highly practical.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b>, most of electric power required for driving of the first transistor <b>10</b> is supplied from a power-supply terminal. Thus, a load of the gate driving circuit disposed outside may be extremely small, and output impedance of the gate driving circuit may be high.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Moreover, in the embodiment, it is only necessary to apply only a small amount of electric power from the gate driving circuit to the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b>. Thus, an electric current (gate driving current) flowing between the gate driving circuit and the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> can be made small. Since inductance depends on the size of the electric current, the influence of wiring inductance can be suppressed by making the gate driving current small.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Examples of the size of each transistor in the embodiment will be described below. The size of the first transistor <b>10</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating a configuration of the nitride semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an area S (size) of the first transistor <b>10</b> is assumed to be an area of an active portion <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The active portion <b>11</b> is a portion where the operation of the transistor is substantially performed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is assumed that the product of a length L<b>1</b> and a width L<b>2</b> of a portion where the source (the first source <b>10</b><i>s</i>) and the drain (the first drain <b>10</b><i>d</i>) oppose each other through the gate (the first gate <b>10</b><i>g</i>) is the area S. As in this example, if the source has a plurality of portions, the drain has a plurality of portions and they are combined in the comb state, the length including the source or drain on one end and the source or drain on the other end is assumed to be the width L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The areas of the second to fourth transistors <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> are also defined similarly.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">From the viewpoints of a cost and yield, the smaller the area the transistors occupy in a chip, the better the performances become. However, if the area of the transistor is reduced excessively, ON resistance becomes larger, which lowers driving capability.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the areas of the second to fourth transistors <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> are excessively small, for example, it becomes difficult to drive the first transistor <b>10</b> sufficiently at a high speed. If the areas of the second to fourth transistors <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> are increased so as to reduce the ON resistance, though the first transistor <b>10</b> can be driven at a high speed, a cost is increased, and a yield is lowered. Moreover, an input capacity of the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> is increased. That is, it becomes difficult to drive the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> with a low-impedance signal source.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiment, there can be appropriate areas (sizes) for the second to fourth transistors <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">First, in order to drive the first transistor <b>10</b> at a high speed, a mirror period needs to be made short. The mirror period corresponds to charging or discharging time of gate input capacity at a threshold voltage of the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an operation of the nitride semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The figure illustrates the operation of the transistor of the nitride semiconductor. The horizontal axis indicates time t. The vertical axis indicates a gate voltage Vg.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if the gate voltage Vg of the transistor is gradually raised from an initial time t<b>0</b> to a first time t<b>1</b>, the gate voltage Vg is raised. When the gate voltage Vg reaches a threshold voltage Vth of the transistor, the gate voltage Vg does not rise for a certain period (a period from the first time t<b>1</b> to a second time t<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">That is because, since the gate voltage Vg of the transistor has reached the threshold value Vth, the drain voltage is changed in synchronization with start of flowing of the drain current, and this voltage change creeps into the gate voltage Vg through a parasitic capacity of the transistor. In order for the transistor to operate at a high speed, this mirror period should be short. An electric charge amount required to go out of this mirror period is referred to as &#x201c;Qgd&#x201d;. To give this Qgd quickly to the gate enables a high-speed operation of the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Assume that the mirror period is &#x394;t (&#x394;t=t<b>2</b>&#x2212;t<b>1</b> in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The voltage to be applied to the power-supply electrode pad <b>64</b> of the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> is assumed to be Vin<b>1</b>. The threshold voltage of the first transistor <b>10</b> is assumed to be Vth<b>1</b>. Moreover, it is assumed that &#x394;V=Vin<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth<b>1</b>. An index RonQgd (having the dimension of &#x3a9;&#xb7;C) of performances of the transistor not depending on the area of the transistor is used. The area of the first transistor <b>10</b> is assumed to be A<b>10</b>, and the area of the third transistor <b>30</b> is assumed to be A<b>30</b>. The area ratio R<b>13</b> of these transistors is expressed as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>R</i>13=<i>A</i>30/<i>A</i>10=<i>R</i>on<i>Qgd/</i>(&#x394;<i>V&#xb7;&#x394;t</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">RonQgd is changed by the breakdown voltage of the transistor, for example, and is approximately 0.05 n&#x3a9;C or more and 0.5 n&#x3a9;C or less.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Since Vin<b>1</b> is the voltage determined by a user, &#x394;V is also determined by the user. As a practical range, an appropriate value of &#x394;V is 1 V or more and 20 V or less. On the other hand, a practically useful value of &#x394;t is 1 ns or more and 50 ns or less.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">By using these appropriate constants, it results in R<b>13</b>=A<b>30</b>/A<b>10</b>=5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Similarly, the area ratio of the second transistor <b>20</b> and the fourth transistor <b>40</b> can be set.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">That is, it is desirable that a ratio of the area of the active portion of the second transistor <b>20</b>, the area of the active portion of the third transistor <b>30</b>, and the area of the active portion of the fourth transistor <b>40</b> to the area of the active portion of the first transistor <b>10</b> is 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>or more and 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or less. As a result, more appropriate driving with a shorter mirror period can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">However, the above-mentioned value (area ratio) is the area ratio when the third transistor <b>30</b> is formed with the same breakdown voltage as that of the first transistor <b>10</b>. Since it is only necessary that the breakdown voltage of the third transistor <b>30</b> can withstand the input voltage of Vin<b>1</b>, the design does not necessarily have to be the same as that of the first transistor <b>10</b>. That is, the area of the third transistor <b>30</b> may be smaller than the value of the above-mentioned area ratio. Moreover, the third transistor <b>30</b>, the fourth transistor <b>40</b>, and the second transistor <b>20</b> do not necessarily have to have the same area. Particularly, the fourth transistor <b>40</b> may have the same area as or a smaller area than that of the third transistor <b>30</b> and the second transistor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The area of the active portion of the fourth transistor <b>40</b> is not more than the area of the active portion of the second transistor <b>20</b> or not more than the area of the active portion of the third transistor <b>30</b>. As a result, the area of the fourth transistor <b>40</b> can be reduced appropriately while the appropriate driving characteristics are maintained, and an increase in a cost, a decline in yield and an increase in an input capacity can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The area of the transistor can be acquired on the basis of an image of an electrode of the nitride semiconductor device by using a microscope, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the embodiment, a resistor formed by working a conductive thin film such as a metal thin film into an appropriate shape can be used for the resistor <b>51</b>. Also, the two-dimensional electron gas <b>70</b><i>b </i>(two-dimensional electron gas channel <b>74</b>) may be used for the resistor <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic sectional view illustrating a configuration of a part of the nitride semiconductor device according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">That is, the figure illustrates the configuration of the resistor <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, on the second layer <b>73</b> of the nitride semiconductor layer <b>70</b>, an electrode <b>51</b><i>a </i>and an electrode <b>51</b><i>b </i>are provided.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a recess <b>73</b><i>d </i>is disposed in the second layer <b>73</b>, and by changing the depth (recess amount) of the recess <b>73</b><i>d</i>, resistance of the two-dimensional electron gas channel <b>24</b> can be changed. By using this, the resistor <b>51</b> having an appropriate resistance value can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As described above, in the embodiment, the nitride semiconductor layer <b>70</b> including the first layer <b>75</b> and the second layer <b>73</b> may be provided, and the resistor <b>51</b> may include a part of the nitride semiconductor layer <b>70</b> (specifically, the two-dimensional electron gas channel <b>74</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As compared with use of a metal thin film as the resistor <b>51</b>, if the two-dimensional electron gas channel <b>74</b> is used, a change in the resistance value caused by a temperature change is small. Thus, use of the two-dimensional electron gas <b>70</b><i>b </i>as the resistor <b>51</b> is more desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the embodiment, an example of the configuration of the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> is described by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but the layout of elements included in the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> is not limited to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but arbitrary.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Also, in the above, use of the configuration of GaN-HEMT illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is described as the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b>, but the embodiment is not limited to that example. Also, a composition ratio or a dopant may be changed in various ways in the semiconductor material to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b>, as a voltage to be applied to the power-supply terminal (supply voltage), 3 V or more and 20 V or less, for example, is appropriate. However, the embodiment is not limited to that, and the supply voltage is arbitrary. The supply voltage is changed as appropriate depending on the condition of the system side on which the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b> is used and the like. If the supply voltage exceeds 20 V, the area of the transistor is enlarged due to the higher breakdown voltage of each transistor, and power consumption is also increased.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In general, output impedance tends to be larger in a high-speed circuit. In the high-speed circuit, it becomes difficult to drive a capacitive load such as driving of a field effect transistor (FET). If the output impedance is large, charging/discharging of the capacitive load becomes slow, and driving of the FET also becomes slow in the end.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Also, a wiring inductor is physically present between the gate of the FET and the gate driving circuit. The wiring inductor causes ringing in the gate of the FET and might break the FET. Also, the inductance delays a gate signal and slows the driving of the FET.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Such a phenomenon becomes more remarkable as the signal moves at a higher speed. Thus, if a GaN element for which application in a high-speed switching circuit is expected is to be used, these problems come to the fore.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As a method of solving these problems, formation of an auxiliary driving circuit to be connected to a gate of the FET on the same wafer as the FET can be considered. However, a p-type semiconductor is difficult to be controlled in GaN, and it is difficult to form a p-type channel FET. Particularly, it is extremely difficult to realize a p-type channel FET in GaN-HEMT. In general, a method of combining a p-type channel FET and an n-type channel FET is used for an FET driving circuit, but it is difficult to apply this method to GaN as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the embodiment, a p-type channel transistor is not used but the driving circuit is formed by an n-type channel transistor, and its utility is high.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the nitride semiconductor device <b>112</b> according to the embodiment is further provided with a capacitor <b>52</b> in addition to the first to fourth transistors <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> and the resistor <b>51</b> in the above. The other configurations can be the same as those in the nitride semiconductor device <b>111</b>, and description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">One end of the capacitor <b>52</b> is electrically connected to the second drain <b>20</b><i>d </i>and the above-mentioned one end of the resistor <b>51</b>.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Also, the capacitor <b>52</b> levels a driving load current when seen from the power supply that supplies electricity to the nitride semiconductor device <b>112</b>. Thus, an external capacitor can be omitted, and the influence of wiring inductance can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">By setting the capacity of the capacitor <b>52</b> to input capacity or more of the first transistor <b>10</b>, the capacitor works more effectively.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The capacity of the capacitor <b>52</b> may be large. However, if the capacity is set to an excessive value, the area of the capacitor <b>52</b> is increased, and a cost is raised. Also, it causes lowered yield and lowered breakdown voltage. Therefore, the capacity of the capacitor <b>52</b> is desirably set to approximately 100 times or less of the input capacity at the threshold voltage of the first transistor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The capacitor <b>52</b> is formed by a lamination structure of a metal or highly conductive polysilicon and an insulating film, for example.
