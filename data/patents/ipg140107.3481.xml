<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a non-contact power reception apparatus and a jig for fabricating a core for the non-contact power reception apparatus, and more particularly to a non-contact power reception apparatus, in which a power reception coil for a charging system and a loop antenna for an electronic settlement system are mounted on a battery pack and a cover case of a portable terminal such that the power reception coil is arranged in the center thereof and the loop antenna is disposed outside the power reception coil, so that a mode of receiving a wireless power signal and a mode of transmitting and receiving data are selectively performed, thereby preventing interference from harmonic components and enabling non-contact charging and electronic settlement using a single portable terminal, and a jig for fabricating a core to be mounted to the non-contact power reception apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, a battery pack is a kind of power supply that is charged with power (electric energy) received from an external charger and supplies the power so that portable electronic devices, such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and the like can be operated, and consists of a battery cell which is charged with electric energy and circuits for charging and discharging the battery cell (supplying electric energy to portable terminals).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The electrical connection between the battery pack, which is used in the portable terminals, and the charger for charging electric energy to the battery pack may be achieved using a connector supply system, which receives the power from a regular power source and converts the voltage and current thereof to correspond to those of the battery pack, and supplies the electric power to the battery pack via a connector of the corresponding battery pack.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when the charger and the batteries are connected or disconnected to replenish the electric power of the batteries using such a connector supply system, there may be drawbacks, such as instant discharge owing to the difference in potential between the charger connector and the battery connector, the risk of fire and concomitant damage due to fire caused by the presence of foreign substances gathered on both connectors, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, accumulated humidity will cause the discharge of the battery through the battery connector and other problems will occur, such as the reduction in the life and performance of the battery pack, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve the above-mentioned problems, a non-contact charging system using a wireless power transmission and reception system was recently proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, portable terminals that have recently proliferated include an electronic settlement system using a Local Area Network (LAN), so that settlement is carried out by bringing the portable terminals into proximity with electronic settlement devices and conducting a settlement process.</p>

While the invention(s) will be described in conjunction with exemplary embodiments, it will be understood that the present description is not intended to limit the invention(s) to those exemplary embodiments. On the contrary, the invention(s) is/are intended to cover not only the exemplary embodiments, but also various alternatives, modifications, equivalents and other embodiments, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A non-contact power reception apparatus and a jig for fabricating a core for the power reception apparatus according to the present invention are variously applicable, and preferred embodiments thereof will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of an exemplary non-contact power transmission system in accordance with the present invention, which includes a non-contact power transmission apparatus <b>100</b> for sending out a wireless power signal and a non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b> receiving the wireless power signal and charging a battery cell with it.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The non-contact power transmission apparatus <b>100</b> includes a primary core <b>110</b>, an identifier <b>120</b>, a wireless power transmission controller <b>130</b>, a switching controller <b>140</b>, an operating driver <b>150</b>, a series resonance converter <b>160</b>, and a feedback circuit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The primary core <b>110</b> consists of a plurality of power transmission cores <b>111</b> and is connected in parallel with the series resonance converter <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The identifier <b>120</b> detects a change in the load of the primary core <b>110</b> and determines whether the change is induced by the non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b> or not. Thus, the identifier serves both to detect the change in the load and to analyze and process a data signal code of an AC signal of the signals transmitted from the non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The wireless power transmission controller <b>130</b> receives and checks the determination result from the identifier <b>120</b>, and, if the change in the load is induced by the non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b>, sends out a power control signal to the operating driver <b>150</b> via the primary core <b>110</b> to transmit the wireless power signal.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Then, the controller <b>130</b> analyzes and processes the data signal filtered by the identifier <b>120</b> and correspondingly controls the operating driver <b>150</b>. In addition, the controller creates a data signal (e.g. an ID asking signal) and transmits it to the non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b> via the primary core <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The switching controller <b>140</b> controls the switching operation of a plurality of switches (not shown), which are provided between the series resonance circuit <b>160</b> and the power transmission cores <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The operating driver <b>150</b> controls the operation of the series resonance converter <b>160</b> depending upon the intensity of the wireless power signal that is to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The series resonance converter <b>160</b> creates a transmission power source for creating a wireless power signal to be transmitted under the control of the operating driver <b>150</b>, and supplies it to the primary core <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">That is, when the wireless power transmission controller <b>130</b> transmits a power control signal for transmitting a wireless power signal, which has a required power value, to the operating driver <b>150</b>, the operating driver <b>150</b> controls the operation of the series resonance converter <b>160</b> to correspond to the transmitted power control signal, and the series resonance converter <b>160</b> applies to the primary core <b>110</b> a transmission power source, which corresponds to the required power value, under the control of the operating driver <b>150</b>, thereby transmitting a wireless power signal having the required intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the primary core <b>110</b> receives the code data of an AC signal, the feedback circuit <b>170</b> extracts the code data of the AC signal from a DC signal applied to the primary core <b>110</b>. The feedback circuit <b>170</b> includes an RC filter circuit section (not shown), which is electrically connected with ends of the power transmission cores <b>111</b> of the primary core <b>110</b> to remove a DC signal component (low frequency component), and an amplifying circuit section (not shown), which has an OP-AMP that is electrically connected with the RC filter circuit section.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">That is, the low frequency signal, which is a DC signal component, is removed by the RC filter circuit section and the extracted AC signal component is amplified by the amplifying circuit section.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, it is possible to transmit and receive a low-amplitude signal.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b> to be supplied with power by receiving the wireless power signal includes a power reception coil <b>211</b> of a secondary core <b>220</b>, which creates induced power using the transmitted wireless power signal, a rectifier <b>230</b>, which rectifies the induced power, and a battery cell module (not designated), which charges a battery cell <b>270</b> with the rectified power.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This battery module includes a protection circuit, such as an overvoltage and overcurrent prevention circuit, a temperature detecting circuit and the like, and a charging management module, which collects and processes information such as the charged state of the battery cell and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b> further includes a wireless power receiver controller, which checks the current induced to the power reception coil <b>211</b> of the secondary core <b>220</b> and requests the control of the intensity of a wireless power signal based on the information on the charging of the battery cell, which is collected and processed by the battery cell module, and an ID transmitter, which, via the secondary core <b>220</b>, transmits and receives the code data of an AC signal modulated in an AC modulation manner.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b> further includes a capacitor C, which is connected in parallel with the power reception coil <b>211</b> of the secondary core <b>220</b> to remove a DC signal component, and a MOSFET, in which a drain terminal is serially connected with the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The MOSFET performs on/off control under the control of the ID transmitter. The ID transmitter inputs the operation voltage of the MOSFET to the gate terminal of the MOSFET in correspondence with a duty rate, which is set to correspond to the control request for the intensity of the wireless power signal by the wireless power receiver controller.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">That is, when the ID transmitter inputs an on-signal and an off-signal, which correspond to the operation voltage, to the gate terminal, the MOSFET creates and outputs a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal corresponding to voltage input to the gate terminal, and the PWM signal is transmitted to the non-contact power transmission apparatus <b>100</b> via the power reception core <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The non-contact power transmission apparatus <b>100</b> is supplied with power via a power supply port <b>181</b> from an adapter supplied with a regular power source, a power source of a USB port of a portable terminal such as a notebook, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The apparatus <b>100</b> further includes a current detector <b>191</b>, which detects the internal current of the apparatus <b>100</b>, and a temperature detector <b>192</b>, which detects the internal temperature of the apparatus <b>100</b> during the charging process, so that if overheating, overvoltage or overcurrent occurs, the operation can be stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The battery cell module <b>230</b> of the non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b> further includes a charging circuit <b>231</b> for charging a battery cell, a gauge circuit <b>232</b> for checking the charged quantity, and a charging monitoring circuit <b>233</b> for monitoring the charging state.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A display <b>193</b> is further provided to display the state of operation of the non-contact power transmission apparatus <b>100</b> and the charging state of the non-contact power reception apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The mode switching unit <b>213</b> serves to select either one of the power reception coil <b>211</b> and the loop antenna <b>212</b> and perform a switching operation to allow electrical connection to either one of the rectification block <b>230</b> and the data processing block <b>250</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The mode control unit <b>214</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes a voltage detector <b>214</b> that is connected to a common contact point between the power reception coil <b>211</b> and the loop antenna <b>212</b>, so as to detect a voltage induced to the power reception coil <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, reference will now be made to an example in which non-contact charging and the control module of data communication in the portable terminals have been adapted according to the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The data that is transmitted/received via the loop antenna <b>212</b> communicates with the data processing block <b>250</b> via the third connector module <b>263</b>, and the data processing block <b>250</b> analyzes and processes the communicated data and performs a process such as settlement or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Meanwhile, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the battery pack A is configured to include a battery cell <b>273</b>, a temperature detecting module <b>272</b>, and a charging monitoring module <b>271</b> in the battery pack A, which consists of an upper case Aa and a lower case Ab.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">That is, the power reception coil <b>211</b> and the loop antenna <b>212</b> are provided on different pieces of shielding material on the same plane, thereby minimizing the thickness of the battery pack A.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Here, the power reception coil <b>211</b> has a structure in which a plurality of windings is wound around it, and the loop antenna <b>212</b> has a loop type structure, so that it is preferred that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the power reception coil <b>211</b> is provided in the center of the apparatus, and the loop antenna <b>212</b> is provided outside the power reception coil.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The detailed electrical connection between the respective elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> or the like is modifiable into various forms by persons skilled in the art, so that it is not limited to the specific construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of an exemplary non-contact power reception apparatus in accordance with the present invention. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the apparatus is configured so that the common transmission and reception module <b>210</b> is arranged in a cover case C such that the module <b>210</b> is electrically connected with a fourth connector module <b>264</b> of the cover case C, the fourth connector module <b>264</b> is connected with a third connector module <b>263</b> of the terminal body B, and the rectification block <b>220</b>, the received-power control block <b>230</b>, the charging control block <b>240</b>, and the data processing block <b>250</b> are arranged between the third connector module <b>263</b> and the second connector module <b>262</b> in the terminal body B.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The second connector module <b>262</b> of the terminal body B is connected with the first connector module <b>261</b> of the battery pack A.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Meanwhile, the cover case C is configured so that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, space (not designated) for the common transmission and reception block <b>210</b> is formed in the cover case C, and the power reception coil <b>211</b> and the loop antenna <b>212</b> are mounted in the space such that a shield plate <b>211</b><i>a </i>is disposed on the power reception coil <b>211</b>, and an absorber <b>212</b><i>a </i>is arranged on the loop antenna <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, preferably, the cover case includes the power reception coil <b>211</b> in the center thereof and the loop antenna <b>212</b> outside the power reception coil.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Thus, according to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, the power reception coil <b>211</b>, which receives a non-contact wireless power signal and charges a battery, and the loop antenna <b>212</b> for data communication for electronic settlement are arranged on the same plane, and the common transmission and reception block <b>212</b>, which includes the power reception coil <b>211</b> and the loop antenna <b>212</b>, is mounted in the cover case C, so that the thickness of the cover case C can be minimized, and the rectification module <b>220</b>, the received-power control block <b>230</b>, the charging control block <b>240</b>, and the data processing block <b>250</b> are mounted in the terminal body B, so that traditional battery packs can continue to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Meanwhile, in order to minimize the size of the non-contact power transmission apparatus and the non-contact power reception apparatus, the power reception cores <b>211</b> according to the above embodiments are preferably fabricated to be thin. Thus, a coil is used in which a coil wire, which comprises a plurality of thin metal wires, is wound around itself in the winding diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In non-contact charging, a shielding sheet is generally provided on one side of a secondary coil in order to protect electric circuit elements from electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Here, if the secondary coil is circular, there is no coil near the four corners of the rectangular shield sheet, so that an eddy current is generated, thus raising the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Due to the non-contact power transmission nature, the positions of the primary core and the secondary core are variable, so that the mobility and transmission efficiency for the secondary core become an important evaluating reference for the reliability of products.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Generally, the coil may be shaped so that a transmitter and a receiver are circular windings, or otherwise so that the transmitter is circular windings and the receiver is rectangular windings.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Here, if the coil of the receiver is circular, mobility is excellent, whereas power transmission efficiency suffers because area is decreased compared to the rectangular coil. If the coil is rectangular, relative to the circular coil, power transmission efficiency is excellent, but mobility suffers.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">According to the present invention, a jig is provided which facilitates fabricating the secondary core for the non-contact reception apparatus, the secondary core is configured to have the shape of both a circle and a rectangle, so that the mobility and transmission efficiency for the secondary core can be advantageously improved at the same time, by combining the advantages of a circular coil and a rectangular coil.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a partially cut away perspective view of an exemplary jig for fabricating the non-contact power reception apparatus, showing a double-structure core <b>320</b> wound around the coil-winding jig <b>310</b>, the double-structure core consisting of circular and rectangular core portions.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The coil-winding jig <b>310</b> includes a lower disk <b>311</b>, an upper disk <b>312</b>, and a guide unit <b>313</b> guiding the double-structure core <b>320</b> so that the circular and rectangular core portions are separately wound around the coil-winding jig <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The lower disk <b>311</b> is formed in a planar form as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and has a winding protrusion <b>311</b><i>a</i>, about which the double-structure core is wound, in the center of the upper surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Here, it is preferred that the height of the winding protrusion <b>311</b><i>a </i>be greater than the height (diameter) of the coil wire.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A through-hole <b>311</b><i>b </i>is formed adjacent to the winding protrusion <b>311</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The through-hole <b>311</b><i>b </i>passes through the lower disk <b>311</b>, and is formed at an incline, preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The inclined through-hole <b>311</b><i>b </i>prevents the coil wire from being drawn up towards the upper portion of the lower disk <b>311</b> when the double-structure core <b>320</b> is wound.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The upper disk <b>312</b> is placed above the lower disk at a certain distance therefrom, and is formed in a planar form, preferably like the lower disk <b>311</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Here, various methods of separating and fixing the lower and upper disks <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> can be adopted, without being limited to a specific one, as desired by persons skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">For example, a separate holder holds and fixes one side (opposite corner or the like) of the upper disk <b>312</b>, so that the upper disk can be separated from the lower disk <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The upper disk <b>312</b> has at least one slide hole <b>312</b><i>a</i>, and preferably, at least four slide holes.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The guide unit <b>313</b> is inserted into the slide hole <b>312</b><i>a </i>in the upper disk <b>312</b> so that the guide unit is movable in a vertical direction. It is preferred that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, if the outer surface extends, an imaginary rectangle is formed, and if the inner surface extends, an imaginary circle is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">That is, the guide unit <b>313</b> has a shape corresponding to the corners of a rectangle (preferably, a rectangular plane having a certain thickness) and an inner curved section <b>313</b><i>a </i>corresponding to a circle.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Hereinafter, a method of fabricating a double-structure core <b>320</b> using the jig <b>310</b> for the non-contact power reception apparatus will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Here, various kinds of separate devices for controlling the construction of the present invention, such as a separator for separating the upper disk <b>312</b>, a winder for coiling wire, and the like, may be adopted, without being limited to a specific one, as desired by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">First, a coil wire (not designated) as a basic unit of the double-structure core <b>320</b> is inserted into the through-hole <b>311</b><i>b </i>of the lower disk <b>311</b> from a lower side thereof and drawn upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Here, as desired by a person skilled in the art, the coil wire may of course be inserted into the through-hole from the upper side thereof and drawn downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The drawn coil wire is circularly wound about the winding protrusion <b>311</b><i>a </i>to form a first coil <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Here, in the case where the winding protrusion <b>311</b><i>a </i>is provided to have the same height as the thickness (height) of the coil wire and the undersurface of the upper disk <b>312</b> is separated by the height of the winding protrusion <b>311</b><i>a</i>, winding the coil wire is of course easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">If the diameter of the first coil <b>321</b> increases to reach an imaginary circular diameter by the inner curved section <b>313</b><i>a </i>of the guide unit <b>313</b> as the coil wire is wound, winding the coil wire stops and the formation of the first coil <b>321</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">After the completion of the formation of the first coil <b>321</b>, the guide units <b>313</b> provided in the upper disk <b>321</b> are slid and lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Here, it is preferred that the curved section <b>313</b><i>a </i>of the guide unit <b>313</b> come close to the outer circumference of the first coil <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">When the lower surface of the guide unit <b>313</b> has come close to the upper surface of the lower disk <b>312</b> through the above process, the coil wire is wound around the outer surface of the guide unit <b>313</b> to form a second coil <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Here, the coil wire for forming the second coil <b>322</b> may be different from that for the first coil <b>321</b>, but it is preferred that the coil wire forming the first coil <b>321</b> be continuously used while extending from the first coil.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">If the second coil <b>322</b> formed by the coil wire corresponds to the area (size) of the lower or upper disk <b>311</b> or <b>312</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the formation of the second coil <b>322</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">After the double-structure core <b>320</b> has been completely fabricated through the above process, the double-structure core <b>320</b>, consisting of first and second coils <b>321</b> and <b>322</b>, is removed from the coil-winding jig <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Thus, the wireless power transmission double-structure core is fabricated such that the first circular coil <b>321</b> is provided in the center thereof and the second rectangular coil <b>322</b> is provided outside the first coil, so that the core with advantageous circular and rectangular coils have can be accomplished.</p>
