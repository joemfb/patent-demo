<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. National Stage of International Application Serial No. PCT/GB2009/000032 filed Jan. 7, 2009, which claims priority to Great Britain Application No. 0800225.5 filed Jan. 7, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference to its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a rotor for an axial-flux electrical machine. More particularly, but not exclusively, this invention relates to a rotor for an axial-flux electrical machine for use in a hybrid vehicle or a purely electric vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hybrid vehicles are vehicles in which two power sources, for example an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, play a part in supplying power for use in automotive propulsion. In some hybrid vehicles, both the engine and the motor are connectable to driveline components for supplying rotary power to wheels for driving the vehicle. In other hybrid vehicles, only the motor is connectable to the driveline components for supplying the rotary power; and the engine is used only as a prime mover for driving a generator which generates the electrical power needed to operate the motor. Examples of existing hybrid vehicles include passenger cars (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;automobiles&#x201d;), vans, buses and light trucks. There is also an increasing interest in incorporating hybrid vehicle technology into light rail vehicles such as trams.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In nearly all hybrid vehicles, it is desirable to minimise the size and weight of the automotive components. In passenger cars, successfully minimising the size and weight of these components results in greater room and hence comfort for the passengers, and may also improve the operating efficiency of the vehicle. The same is true in other hybrid vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">At the same time, it is also desirable to maximise the power output of electrical machines used in hybrid vehicles: consumers are used to the high power output of internal combustion engines and so would be disappointed with lesser performance from hybrid vehicles. This is true of both motors and generators used in hybrid vehicles. For motors, a high mechanical power output is needed in order to provide adequate automotive propulsion; and accordingly for generators, a high electrical power output is needed in order to operate the motors at high power.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, for hybrid vehicles it is desirable to use electrical machines with high power output per unit mass (often referred to as &#x201c;power density&#x201d; and measured in kW/kg). Unfortunately, however, existing electrical machines do not satisfy these requirements and so do not lend themselves well to use in hybrid vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Similar considerations apply to electrical machines used to power purely electric vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Electrical machines that are of the axial-flux type are in several ways suited for use in hybrid vehicles and purely electric vehicles. One reason for this is because they can be designed to have a high power density. However, the design of axial-flux machines insofar as it relates to their assembly and operation is not optimised: assembly can be difficult and operation can be unreliable. This is particularly the case in relation to the rotors of such machines. An object of this invention is to address this problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect of this invention, there is provided a rotor for an axial-flux electrical machine, the rotor having a plurality of permanent magnets fixed thereto, wherein each of the plurality of magnets extends at least partly through an aperture in the rotor, the arrangement being such that material of the rotor abuts the magnet so as to locate the magnet substantially circumferentially with respect to the axis of rotation of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">By providing apertures in the rotor that are arranged to receive magnets in this way, location of the magnets is provided, at least circumferentially, by surrounding material of the rotor abutting the magnets and retaining them in position. Thus, there is no need for additional, separate, structure to locate and retain the magnets at least circumferentially. As a result assembly is simplified and the magnets are held more reliably in position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The aperture may be an aperture completely through the rotor from one side to the other. The aperture may be a blind aperture, such as a recess.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Material of the rotor may also abut each magnet so as to locate the magnet substantially axially in at least one axial direction. Material of the rotor may abut each magnet so as to locate the magnet substantially axially in both axial directions. Material of the rotor may also abut each magnet so as to locate the magnet substantially radially in one, at least one, or both, radial directions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rotor may be formed of more than one piece. The rotor may include a first rotor portion and a second rotor portion. The arrangement may be such that fitting the second rotor portion to the first rotor portion, with the magnets therebetween, locates the magnets therebetween substantially tangentially, substantially radially and substantially axially in at least one axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first and second rotor portions may be arranged to encase the magnets therebetween axially. Each rotor portion may include apertures therethrough, each aperture sized to receive a respective magnet. Each rotor portion may be provided with abutment means adjacent the aperture to abut a magnet received therein so as to prevent it passing through the aperture. The abutment means may be adjacent one face of the respective rotor portion. The abutment means may serve to narrow the aperture. The abutment means may include at least one lip.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first and second rotor portions may be arranged to encase the magnets therebetween radially. The first rotor portion may be arranged to abut the magnets in substantially both circumferential directions and one radial direction. The second rotor portion may be arranged to abut at least some of the magnets substantially in the other radial direction. The first rotor portion may have the apertures formed therein. The second rotor portion may be a substantially annular portion, or a segment of a substantially annular portion, that is arranged to surround all, or a segment of, the first portion with the magnets received therein. The second rotor portion may be formed of tape wound around the first rotor portion. The second rotor portion may be provided by a retaining ring. The retaining ring may be of the same material as the first rotor potion. The magnets and/or the first portion may be provided with structure that locates the magnets axially. The magnets and the first portion may be provided with cooperating structure that cooperates to locate the magnets radially. On the first portion, the structure may be provided in one or more side walls of the apertures. On the magnets, the structure may be provided in one or more side walls thereof. The cooperating structure may include a tongue-and-groove arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Two magnets may be received in each aperture. The two magnets may be axially juxtaposed. The rotor may be arranged to receive a first one of the two magnets in a first axial direction and a second one of the two magnets in a second axial direction. One or more sidewalls of each aperture may include an abutment against which one or both of the respective magnets abuts when received in the aperture. The abutment may be a lip. The two magnets in each aperture may be magnetised so as to attract one another, thereby providing axial location. The magnets may be magnetised such that one of each magnet in each aperture has a North-seeking pole facing axially inwards and the respective other magnet has a South-seeking pole facing axially inwards.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each magnet may be fixed on the rotor by an adhesive material provided between each magnet and material of the rotor. The adhesive material may be a glue. Each magnet may be flush with surrounding material of the rotor on one or each side of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The rotor may be of a magnetically and/or electrically insulating material. This assists in avoiding losses in the rotor, such as losses due to eddy currents, and assists in avoiding magnetic short circuits in the flux path. The rotor may be of a heat insulating material and may be resistant to high temperatures. The rotor may be of a composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The rotor may be a substantially flat disc with apertures formed therein, each aperture sized to receive a respective magnet. Preferably each magnet fits in the respective aperture such that surrounding material of the rotor acts to locate the magnet radially, in one or both radial directions, and circumferentially.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">By providing apertures in the rotor and a magnet that extends substantially through each aperture, the amount of magnetised material at angular locations of the rotor, for a given rotor thickness, is maximised. Thus, the strength of the excitation field set up by the permanent magnets is maximised for a given rotor thickness, thereby increasing the power density.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a second aspect of this invention, there is provided an axial-flux electrical machine having at least one rotor according to the first aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a third aspect of this invention, there is provided a wheel for a vehicle and an electrical machine according to any previous aspect or embodiment this invention, wherein one of the rotor and the stator is coupled to the wheel and the other of the rotor and the stator is arranged for fixing to structure of the vehicle such that the electrical machine may be used as a direct drive motor in rotating the wheel and thereby driving the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The electrical machine may also be arranged to operate as a generator to slow the vehicle by regenerative braking.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a rotor <b>200</b> for use in an axial-flux electrical machine. The rotor <b>200</b> is a generally flat, thin, disc. It is formed from a composite material, which, in this embodiment, is a glass-fibre-and-resin-based cross-laminated material. The composite material is a good electrical insulator and a good thermal insulator. The rotor <b>200</b> has a central, round, aperture <b>210</b> through it. A series of smaller apertures <b>215</b> are formed through the rotor <b>200</b> in positions adjacent the central aperture <b>210</b> and so as to form, collectively, a ring around the central aperture <b>210</b> that is concentric with the central aperture <b>210</b> about the rotational axis of the rotor <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The rotor <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes twelve apertures <b>220</b> therethrough, each aperture being shaped like a segment of a flattened, planar, ring. Each of these apertures <b>220</b> is arranged adjacent the radially-outer edge of the rotor <b>200</b>, and so as to be concentric therewith. The twelve apertures <b>220</b> are distributed around the rotor <b>200</b> with constant angular pitch. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of the twelve apertures <b>220</b> has two concentric arcuate sidewalls <b>222</b>, concentric with the rotor <b>200</b>, and two straight sidewalls <b>224</b> in-between the arcuate sides and extending radially. With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sidewalls of the apertures <b>220</b> are slightly recessed along much of their length with respect to the ends of the sidewalls. This is true of the radially-innermost of the arcuate sidewalls <b>222</b> and the two radial sidewalls <b>224</b>. Thus, there are projecting surfaces <b>226</b> towards the ends of each of the sidewalls <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> that are slightly recessed. It is envisaged that the twelve apertures <b>220</b> be formed in the rotor <b>200</b> by milling.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a permanent magnet <b>230</b> is provided in each of the twelve apertures <b>220</b>. The magnets <b>230</b> are also shaped as segments of a flattened, planar, ring, with two arcuate and concentric sides and two straight and radially-extending sides therebetween. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it should be noted, however, that, in this embodiment, none of the sides of the magnets <b>230</b> are recessed. The magnets <b>230</b> are further sized and shaped such that each fits in one of the ring-segment apertures <b>220</b> such that sides of the magnets <b>230</b> are abutted by the projecting surfaces <b>226</b>, and the radially-outermost arcuate side of each magnet <b>230</b> is abutted by structure of the rotor <b>200</b> defining the radially-outermost arcuate sidewall of the respective aperture <b>220</b>. Thus, each magnet <b>230</b> is located radially and circumferentially with respect to the rotor <b>200</b>. It will be appreciated that this arrangement gives rise to gaps between the sides of the magnets <b>230</b> and the recessed parts of sides of the apertures <b>220</b>. An adhesive material, which in this embodiment is glue (not shown in the drawings), is provided in these gaps to provide adhesion between the magnets <b>230</b> and surrounding structure of the rotor <b>200</b>. This retains the magnets <b>230</b> axially with respect to the rotor <b>200</b>. The magnets are of a thickness such that surfaces of the magnets are flush with each side of the rotor <b>200</b> when positioned in the apertures <b>220</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The magnets <b>230</b> are mounted on the rotor such that each has its polarities reversed with respect to its two immediate neighbours. Each magnet has two principle pole surfaces, these are the surfaces that are flush with the surfaces of the rotor <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a rotor arrangement <b>100</b> of a second embodiment that is made up of a rotor disc <b>110</b> and a series of magnets <b>120</b>. The assembled arrangement <b>100</b> is similar in size and shape to that of the first embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Indeed, it is envisaged that the arrangement of the second embodiment is an alternative to that of the first embodiment and may be substituted therefor in an electrical machine.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The rotor disc <b>110</b> of this second embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment in being formed of the same composite material and having a central aperture <b>112</b> together with a series of holes therearound <b>115</b>. The rotor disc <b>110</b> is also similar in having twelve apertures <b>120</b> therethrough that are arranged adjacent the radially-outer edge of the rotor <b>110</b>. The twelve apertures <b>120</b> in the rotor <b>110</b> of this embodiment are, again, similarly shaped to those of the first embodiment, but differ in certain important respects</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The rotor disc <b>110</b> of this embodiment differs, however, in that it is formed of two rotor portions <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>. Each of the two portions <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> is a flat disc that fits together with the other axially: it is as if a single disc has been sliced in two to give two similar, but thinner, discs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a first one of the rotor portions <b>130</b> in more detail. As can be seen, each of the twelve apertures <b>120</b> that is adjacent the radially outer edge of the rotor portion <b>130</b> is shaped generally like a segment from a flattened, planar, ring: that is, each segment has radially outer <b>121</b> and inner <b>122</b> sidewalls that are arcuate and concentric, with radial sidewalls <b>123</b> extending therebetween. An arcuate recess <b>124</b> is provided at each end of each of the radial sidewalls <b>123</b>. As it is envisaged that the apertures are formed by milling, these recesses are to accommodate right-angled edges of the magnets (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Part of each of the sidewalls <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> projects slightly into the aperture <b>120</b> where the sidewalls <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> meet the axially-outer face of the rotor portion <b>130</b> (as opposed to the face that lies against the second rotor portion <b>140</b> when the two are placed together). The sidewalls <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> project so as to form a lip <b>125</b> that is flush with the outer face of the rotor portion <b>120</b> and that extends around the opening of the aperture <b>120</b> so as to narrow that aperture <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the second rotor portion <b>140</b> in more detail. The second rotor portion <b>140</b> is the similar to the first <b>130</b>, but is thinner in an axial direction. It will therefore be appreciated that the second rotor portion also has a lip <b>145</b> that extends around the opening of the each aperture <b>120</b> and that is flush with the axially-outer face of the second rotor portion <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the two rotor portions <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> axially spaced apart from each other. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rotor arrangement <b>100</b> also includes twelve magnets <b>150</b> that are shaped as the magnets of the first embodiment. The magnets <b>150</b> of this embodiment are sized and shaped to fit within the apertures <b>120</b> formed in the first <b>130</b> and second <b>140</b> rotor portions. The magnets <b>150</b> fit within the portions such that they are abutted (with respect to the axis of rotation of the rotor) circumferentially and radially by the sidewalls <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> of the two rotor portions <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> to locate the magnets <b>150</b> circumferentially and radially; and axially by the lips <b>135</b>, <b>145</b> of the rotor portions <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> when these two rotor portions <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> are brought together to locate the magnets <b>150</b> axially. The second rotor portion <b>140</b> includes a plurality of bolt holes <b>147</b> adjacent the radially outer edge thereof. The first rotor portion <b>130</b> includes a plurality of corresponding holes <b>137</b> that are threaded to receive a respective bolt <b>160</b>. The two rotor portions <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> are fixed together by fitting a respective bolt <b>160</b> through each bolt hole <b>147</b> into a respective one of the threaded holes <b>137</b>. The reason for the first rotor portion <b>130</b> being thicker than the second rotor portion <b>140</b> in the present embodiment is to allow the threaded holes <b>137</b> to be of sufficient length to retain the bolts <b>160</b>. In other embodiments the relative thicknesses of the first <b>130</b> and second <b>140</b> rotor portions may differ.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a rotor arrangement <b>300</b> of a third embodiment. In similarity with the second embodiment, the rotor <b>310</b> of this embodiment is formed of a first rotor portion <b>330</b> and a second rotor portion <b>340</b>. However, in this embodiment, the two rotor portions <b>330</b>, <b>340</b> fit together in a radial direction, rather than an axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the first rotor portion <b>330</b> in more detail. The first rotor portion is similar to that of the first embodiment, but differs in two respects. Firstly, the first rotor portion <b>330</b> lacks the radially-outer part thereof that provides the radially-outer arcuate sidewall of each of the magnet-receiving apertures through the rotor of the first embodiment. Thus, the first rotor part <b>330</b> of this embodiment provides only a radially-inner arcuate sidewall <b>322</b> and two radial sidewalls <b>323</b> extending radially outwards therefrom, each with an arcuate recess <b>324</b> at the radially inner end only thereof. The first rotor portion <b>330</b> therefore resembles a &#x201c;spider&#x201d;, in the engineering sense of that word. A projecting ridge <b>325</b> projects from the middle of each of the radially-extending sidewalls <b>323</b> and extends along the length of each of those sidewalls.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a representative one of twelve magnets <b>350</b> of the rotor assembly <b>300</b> of this third embodiment. The magnet <b>350</b> is as those of the first and second embodiments but differs in having a groove <b>355</b> formed in each of the radially-extending sidewalls <b>352</b> thereof. Each groove <b>355</b> is formed in the middle of each of the radially-extending sidewalls <b>352</b> and runs the length thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the magnets <b>350</b> are slotted into the apertures through the first rotor portion <b>330</b>, with each projecting ridge <b>325</b> of the first rotor portion <b>330</b> fitting into a respective groove. Adhesive tape reinforced with wire is then wound repeatedly around the radially outer edge of the first rotor portion <b>330</b> to form the second rotor portion <b>340</b>. Thus, the first rotor portion <b>330</b> and the second rotor portion cooperate to locate the magnets <b>350</b> radially. Circumferential and axial location is provided by the first rotor portion <b>330</b>, with the projecting ridges <b>325</b> of the first rotor portion <b>330</b> and cooperating grooves <b>355</b> in the magnets providing the axial location by virtue of a tongue-and-groove type arrangement. Whilst in this embodiment adhesive tape is used to form the second rotor portion <b>340</b>, it is envisaged that this portion <b>340</b> may be formed in other ways. For example, the second rotor portion <b>340</b> could be a ring of composite material formed by laying-up appropriate material on a forming mandrel. The ring would then be fitted to the outside of the first rotor portion <b>330</b> and glued in place. It is envisaged that the ring could be shrink-fitted to the outside of the first rotor portion <b>330</b> by heating the ring such that it can be fitted and then allowing it to cool into a tight fit around the first rotor portion <b>330</b>. When heated, the ring may or may not be an interference fit. Alternatively, the ring could be press-fitted to the outside of the first rotor portion <b>330</b> without first heating the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a rotor arrangement <b>400</b> of a fourth embodiment. In this embodiment, the rotor <b>410</b> is formed as a single portion, but there are two magnets <b>450</b> in each magnet-receiving aperture therethrough <b>420</b>. The general arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, with more detail being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the rotor <b>410</b> of this embodiment is generally the same that the first rotor portion <b>130</b> of the second embodiment, but differs in lacking the lip <b>150</b> of that first rotor portion <b>130</b> and instead including projecting ridges <b>425</b> along the radially-extending sidewalls <b>423</b> of the apertures <b>420</b> through the rotor <b>410</b>. The ridges <b>425</b> extend along the middle of the radially-extending sidewalls <b>423</b>, between ends thereof, and thus are similar to those <b>325</b> of the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, each magnet <b>450</b> of the rotor arrangement <b>400</b> of this embodiment is geometrically the same as the other. Thus, for simplicity, a representative single magnet <b>450</b> only is described. Each magnet <b>450</b> is shaped generally as the magnets of the first and second embodiments, but differs in being slightly less that half the thickness (in an axial direction) and having a recess <b>455</b> formed along each radially-extending edge of one face only. Whilst, as mentioned, the magnets <b>450</b> are geometrically the same, each of the two magnets <b>450</b> that is received in the same aperture <b>420</b> is magnetised differently. One of the magnets <b>450</b> is magnetised such that the face along which the recesses <b>455</b> extend is a North-seeking pole. The other of the magnets <b>450</b> is magnetised such that the face along with the recesses <b>455</b> extend is a South-seeking pole.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, two differently-magnetised magnets <b>450</b> are fitted into each aperture <b>420</b> in the rotor <b>410</b>. A first one of the two magnets <b>450</b> is introduced into the aperture <b>420</b> from one side of the rotor <b>410</b> such that the projecting ridge <b>425</b> fits into the recess to locate the portion <b>450</b>. The other magnet <b>450</b> is fitted in the same way from the other side of the rotor <b>410</b>. As the two magnets <b>450</b> are differently magnetised, magnetic attraction between the magnets <b>450</b> holds the magnets in place. The arrangement is such that there is a small axial gap between the two magnets <b>450</b> in each aperture. Thus, the magnetic attraction causes each of the two magnets <b>450</b> to abut the projecting ridge <b>425</b>. It is envisaged that the small axial gap would be of the order of 10 microns. It is generally preferred that any gap between the two magnets <b>450</b> be minimised in order to encourage the passage of magnetic flux between the two magnets <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus in this embodiment, the rotor <b>410</b> provides radial and circumferential location of the magnets <b>450</b> and also locates each of the magnets <b>450</b> in one of the two possible axial directions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In other embodiments, it is envisaged that there may be no gap between the two magnets <b>450</b> in the same aperture <b>420</b>. Ideally, the dimensions of the magnets <b>450</b> and the rotor <b>410</b> would be such that the magnets <b>450</b> also abut the projecting ridge <b>425</b>, but this depends on the relevant manufacturing tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In further embodiments, it is envisaged that an adhesive, such as glue, may be provided between the two magnets <b>450</b> in the same aperture <b>420</b> such that the adhesive at least partly serves to hold the two magnets <b>450</b> together. An adhesive that has vibration-absorption properties, such as glue that cures to become resiliently deformable, may be used in order to absorb vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is envisaged that the rotor arrangements described above are for use in an electrical machine that is suited to high power applications. For example, the electrical machine may be suited to use as a generator in a diesel-electric generator set in a large hybrid-vehicle such as a tram or a bus. The electrical machine may also be suited to use as a motor in such a vehicle for providing automotive mechanical power.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In still further embodiments, the rotor disc arrangements described above are modified so as to be capable of use in an electrical machine that can be operated as an eddy current motor. In such further embodiments, the rotor discs described above would be replaced by a disc formed at least partly of an electrically conductive material. Applying a varying current to the stator winding would cause the machine to operate as an eddy current motor. Applying a constant would acts to brake the machine. The conductive material may be arranged to channel the current induced therein. This may be done by the provision of slots in the conductive material of the replacement rotor. The slots may be radial. In other words, the rotor could form an equivalent of the squirrel cage sometimes used in radial electrical machines.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In yet further embodiments, the magnets <b>450</b> may be &#x201c;split&#x201d; (that is may be made up of a plurality of magnet portions that interface one another) other than in the plane of the rotor in order to reduce eddy currents induced therein. For example, the magnets may be split in a substantially axial-radial plane or may be split in a substantially axial-tangential plane. Each magnet may be split in this way so as to be made up of two, three or more magnet portions. The portions may be joined to each other by an adhesive, such as glue, that is preferably electrically insulating. Alternatively, the portions may be located relative to each other in the rotor by abutments formed in material of the rotor that serve to space the portions from each other.</p>
