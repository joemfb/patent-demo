<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention discloses a disposable article made from absorptive material surrounded by a non-absorptive material for the use in industries in need of an absorbent for drips, residual liquid or condensates. The invention also describes a method of producing such an article, and the use of the method and article.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is essential that people in environments where there are a potential risk of leaks or spills of liquids (toxic add non-toxic) are provided with means for cleaning up and preventing leaks or spills. A number of products have been developed for absorbing liquids from leaks and spills. Usually each product is directed to a specific type of problem. For example, leaks, splashes and drips of a slippery liquid over a walkway may be addressed by a &#x201c;walk on&#x201d; mat absorbing the liquid and which has an upper surface resistant to the wear of foot traffic. The products are also used in &#x201c;non-traffic&#x201d; areas as absorbent pads. Puddles of liquid are often cleaned up by throwing absorbent response pads or pillows on the puddle. The outward flow of a leak or spill is often contained by placing a sock around the outer edges of the liquid to soak up the liquid as it reaches the sock. Drips and sprays are absorbed from surfaces with wipes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disposable absorbent articles such as diapers, incontinence and hygiene articles and spill clean-up articles are well known in the art. Typically, disposable absorbent articles comprise a liquid pervious top-sheet, a liquid impervious back-sheet, and an absorbent core disposed between the liquid previous top-sheet and the back-sheet, and sometimes further means to keep the core fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,604 a multi-layered flexible sheet for absorbing liquids is disclosed. The sheet has the capacity to absorb liquids and a segmented flexible layer of woven or non-woven materials has the capacity to absorb liquids being tacked face-to-face to the non-segmented layer. The multi-layered sheet can be used unfolded as walk on mats, wipes, absorbent pads and response pads or folded as pillows or socks for absorbing liquids.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,362 describes absorbent compositions and methods for producing the absorbent compositions, absorbent products and their use. Examples of such products are absorbent sheets for pet urine, wrapping sheets for maintaining freshness, drip absorption sheets, rice plant raising sheets, sheets used for concrete production and water-running protection sheets for cables.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention discloses a disposable article made from absorptive material surrounded by a non-absorptive material, wherein the embodiment of said article makes it suitable for industrial purposes and for applications in private homes. A significant advantage of the invention over the prior art resides in the easiness with which it can be transported, applied and disposed of, and how the present article is capable of handling a substantial over-dosage of liquid.</p>

According to the invention such derivatives may in one embodiment be sodium, potassium, or aluminium salts. These materials are typically present in the form of particles or fibres to increase the absorption ability of non-woven materials. Further, the super absorbers may also be naturally-occurring materials, such as fluff pulp/cellulose fibres, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, alginates, starches or derivatives thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0031">In one embodiment the absorbent material of the article comprises carboxymethylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose or alginate starches or derivatives thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0032">In another embodiment the absorptive material of the article comprises hydrophilic polyurethane foam.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0033">In yet another embodiment the absorptive material of the article comprises polyacryllicacid or salts thereof, such as its sodium salts.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034">In one embodiment of the invention a mixture of naturally occurring and synthetic super absorbers are present in the non-woven material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0035">In a more preferred embodiment of the invention the absorptive material may be Vizorb 3907 from Buckeye non-wovens.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0036">According to the present invention it is preferred that the super absorptive non-woven materials are produced by the air-laid method which is well known to the skilled person.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Alternatives to Non-Wovens</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0037">In a less preferred embodiment of the invention the absorptive material of the article comprises hydrophilic polyurethane foam. The foam may be in the form of sheets or as granulates. Other materials alternative to the non-woven may be selected among super absorptive particles or fibres in loose-weight, fluff pulp in loose weight, material from the textile industry, such as twist.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Absorption Speed</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0038">It is a purpose of the present invention to provide an article having a superior absorptive speed. In one aspect of the invention the initial absorption speed is determined by dropping a drop of the liquid used for the test onto the surface of the material where after the time of absorption of the drop into the material is measured. In one aspect of the invention the absorption speed of the absorptive material for 0.05-0.1 ml of water is less than 30 seconds. In another aspect the absorption speed is less than 20 seconds. In a further aspect the absorption speed is less than 10 seconds. In yet another aspect the absorption speed is less than 5 seconds. In a further aspect the absorption is less than 1 second.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Absorption Rate/Capacity</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0039">In the present context the term &#x201c;absorption rate&#x201d; and &#x201c;absorption capacity&#x201d; are used synonymously. According to the invention in one embodiment the absorptive rate of the material is determined as the absorptive rate/area for water calculated as the average of water absorption within 20 seconds after the absorptive material has been brought in contact with water. The absorptive rate is decreasing as the material is absorbing the water, however in a very important aspect of the present invention the initial absorptive rate is very fast and that is in fact one of the great advantages of the present invention. The absorption capacity may also be defined as the amount of liquid the material is capable of absorbing per gram of material (g/g). In one embodiment the absorptive rate is between 0.04 g/second/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 0.30 g/second/cm<sup>2 </sup>for water. In a preferred embodiment the absorptive rate is between 0.10 g/second/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 0.18 g/second/cm<sup>2 </sup>for water. In a more preferred embodiment the absorption rate of the absorptive material is between 0.12 g/second/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 0.15 g/second/cm<sup>2 </sup>for water.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040">The absorptive rate/capacity relates to how fast the present absorptive article can absorb a liquid, such as water in one minute compared to the absorptive article's maximum rate/capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">In one aspect of the invention the maximal absorption capacity of water of the absorptive particles when present in loose weight is reached in 3.5 to 6 seconds, such as 4.5 to 5.5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">In the present context the term &#x201c;water&#x201d; refers to tap water.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043">In a preferred embodiment of the invention the article comprises a non-woven material with a super absorptive material, wherein the article is capable of absorbing 40% of its maximal capacity of water in approximately 1 minute. In a more preferred embodiment of the invention the absorptive material of the article has an acquisition layer, which may receive and spread the incoming liquid, such as water and thereby increasing the absorption speed. The acquisition layer ensures passage of the incoming liquid into the article without the liquid spilling over. As described in the examples below when water is used on a material having a acquisition layer the absorption rate of the material is approximately 85% of its maximal capacity in 1 minute.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0044">In one embodiment of the invention the article comprises an absorptive core, of for example Vizorb 3907 from Buckeye and a substantially non-liquid permeable outer layer material. The latter material may be a polyethylene material in the shape of a bag. The absorptive core of the article may be fastened at least in one place to the outer packaging layer or it may be loosely placed inside the outer packaging layer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">According to the invention a volume space between the outer packaging layer and the absorptive core may be necessary to allow the absorptive core to expand when brought into contact with a liquid. Another very important function of the available volume space between the outer packaging layer and the enclosed absorptive core of this particular embodiment is the possibility of a liquid being overdosed as long as the overdosed liquid may be contained in the volume space of the article. Liquid, which is not immediately absorbed by the absorptive material, may in this way be absorbed over time without leaking from the article. This is a strong feature of the present article embodiment. For example an article without the mentioned feature having an absorptive speed of 5 L/min and a maximal capacity of 15 L will not initially be capable of handling a liquid dose of 7 L/min. even though this amount is far less than the maximal capacity of the article. However, the present invention is capable of overcoming this problem due to the collection of excess liquid inside the article followed by the absorption of the liquid by the absorptive material.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">Accordingly, the material of the article of the invention has in a preferred embodiment an absorption capacity for water of at least 0.5 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as at least 1.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, for example at least 1.50 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as at least 2.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, for example at least 4.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, such at least 6.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, for example at least 8.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as at least 10 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">In a more preferred embodiment of the invention the absorption capacity is between 3.5 and 5.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as between 4.0 and 4.5 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0048">In a further embodiment the absorptive material of the article has an absorption capacity for water of at least 10 g. of water/g. of material, such as at least 30 g. of water/g. of material, for example at least 50 g. of water/g. of material, such as at least 70 g. of water/g. of material, for example at least 90 g. of water/g. of material, such as at least 110 g. of water/g. of material, for example at least 130 g. of water/g. of material.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">In a preferred embodiment the absorptive material of the article has an absorption capacity for water of between 45 and 60 g. of water/g. of material, such as between 50 and 55 g. of water/g. of material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">In yet a further embodiment the absorptive particles of the present article when in loose weight has an absorption capacity of up to 200 g. water/g. of loose weight particles or an absorption capacity of up to 500 g. of distilled water/g. of loose weight particles.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Wet Burst Strength</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">According to the present invention the burst strength of the absorptive material is very low. It is important that the absorptive material of the article is solid enough to be maintained inside the outer packaging layer. In other words, the absorptive material must be in such a physical form that it may not leak from the outer packaging layer. In one embodiment of the invention the wet burst strength value of the present absorptive material may be within the interval of between 350 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 1700 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as between 550 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 1500 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, for example between 750g/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 1300 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as between 950 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 1100 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. In another embodiment the wet burst strength is as low as possible to secure the possibility of easy removal of the article after absorption when the article has expanded.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Expansion</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0052">In yet a further embodiment of the invention The article according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the absorptive material of the article has an expansion factor of at least 4 when absorbing a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053">According to one embodiment of the invention the absorptive material, of the article may only expand substantially in height and substantially not in length and/or width. This is due to the construction of this embodiment of the article wherein there is little physical space to accommodate an length/width wise expansion.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Non Water-Based</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054">Another aspect of the invention concerns the absorptive material of the article being capable of absorbing a non-water based liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">According to the invention the liquid may be selected from oil, emulsions, or chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">For the particular purpose of absorbing a non-water based liquid the absorptive material may comprise moler. Moler comprises approximately 30% clay particles and 70% fossilised diatoms. The absorptive material is often porous whereby the non water-based liquid is absorbed through capillary forces.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057">In one embodiment of the invention the absorptive material comprises porous clay, such as burned moler.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0058">In another embodiment of the invention the absorptive material comprises carbon black.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0059">In a further embodiment of the invention the absorptive material comprises a combination of moler and carbon black. The combination may in one embodiment be present in a ratio of 70% by weight of moler and 30% by weight of carbon black, such as in a ratio of 60% by weight of moler and 40% by weight of carbon black, for example in a ratio of 50% by weight of moler and 50% by weight of carbon black.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0060">In yet a further embodiment the absorptive material comprises a combination of moler and carbon black and absorptive polymer(s) or hydrogel(s). In one embodiment of the invention the combination may be present in a ratio of 70% by weight of moler and 25% by weight of carbon black and 5% by weight of a polymer or a hydrogel, such as in a ratio of 60% by weight of moler and 30% by weight of carbon black and 10% by weight of a polymer or a hydrogel, for example in a ratio of 50% by weight of moler and 35% by weight of carbon black and 15% by weight of a polymer or a hydrogel.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0061">In another embodiment the absorptive material comprises a combination of carbon black and absorptive polymer(s) or hydrogel(s). In one embodiment of the invention the combination may be present in a ratio of 70% by weight of moler and 30% by weight of a polymer or a hydrogel, such as in a ratio of 60% by weight of moler and 40% by weight of a polymer or a hydrogel, for example in a ratio of 50% by weight of moler and 50% by weight of a polymer or a hydrogel.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Flexibility</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0063">In another aspect of the invention the absorptive material of the article may be flexible. In one embodiment the present article is flexible enough to be adjusted to the purpose of the use of the article. For example, the article may be used in places which are difficult to physically reach, such as between pipes, on a machine or other places where the bending and shaping of the present article is necessary.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Attachment</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0064">In one aspect of the invention the outer packaging surface of the article may be surrounding the absorptive material attached on more than one side. The outer material may be one uninterrupted piece of material, or the outer material may comprise at least two pieces of material connected to each other. In the latter embodiment the at least one side of the outer packaging surface is connected to at least one other side of the outer packaging surface through welding.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0065">In a further embodiment the at least one side of the outer packaging surface is connected to at least one other side of the outer packaging surface through glue tape. In yet a further embodiment the at least one side of the outer packaging surface is connected to at least two outer packaging layers being connected at least at a part of their outer periphery by means of a seam, wherein the seam for example may be formed with glue or welded, or any other means of forming a seam.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0066">According to the present invention it is envisioned that the absorptive material may be in loose contact with the outer packaging layer, such that no physical attachment between the absorptive material and the outer packaging layer is provided for. However, depending on the purpose of the present article it may prove beneficial to attach the absorptive material to at least one side of the outer packaging surface.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0067">In one embodiment upon expansion of the absorptive material the present article may be changing its physical shape into a substantially box shaped article. In another embodiment the article may be changing into a substantially oval shape. In further embodiment the article may be changing into a variety of shapes depending on the purpose of the use of the article.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Method of Producing</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0068">It is also within the scope of the invention to provide for the production of the present article and the use of such a production method for the manufacture of the present article. In one embodiment of the invention the absorptive material may be prefabricated and presented as rolls of material. From these rolls of material the absorptive core of the present article may be cut or punched into the preferred size followed by the packaging of the absorptive material in an outer layer, such as flow packing or blister packing. In one embodiment the above production is performed as a continuous process, such as an in-line production providing for an effective and high-speed production. In another embodiment the production is discontinuous and is performed fully or partly manually, which provides for a low cost production.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Use of Article</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0069">The article described by the present invention has numerous application possibilities. One such application may be for the use in the plumbing business. Very often plumbers perform work on pipes, such as water pipes. When handling a filled water pipe for example water will be released to the surroundings from said pipe. It is of course possible to provide for other absorbent materials, or containers to collect the water spilled from the pipe in need of repair. However, situations may occur where there is a limited space adjacent to the pipe and therefore a container, typically a bucket may prove insufficient as a liquid collecting means. Further, it is very important that the plumber is capable of cleaning up after performing the job and thereby leaving the surroundings as tidy as possible, this is especially true when working in people's private homes. The present article has solved the problem of having an absorptive article at hand and has at the same time made it possible to discard the absorptive article without leaving any traces. It is the intention that the present article may be part of a plumber's kit when working.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0070">In yet another embodiment of the invention the article is used as a drip absorbent. Similar to the above application the article may be placed adjacent to embodiments where from liquid is dripping. Such an embodiment may be holding chemicals or oil. For example it is envisioned that the present article may be used on board ships in the engine rooms or in engine rooms in general, in chemical plants, in auto garages, in the manufacture, testing and reparation process of hydraulic systems, and in the metal manufacturing/preparatory industry.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0071">The present article may also be applied as a residual liquid absorbent. It is often very difficult to empty for example a container of its residual liquid. The present article is excellent at removing residual liquids when placed in contact with such a liquid. It is envisioned that the present article after having been brought in contact with the residual liquid is removed and disposed of without any liquid leaking from the article. The latter is a general concept valid for all the applications of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">The formation of condensate water is a major problem within all areas of production industry, wherein condensate water is not allowed to get in contact with the product. This is the case within the production of for example paper, articles of food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In the first case the condensate water may destroy the paper, and in the other cases the condensate water may destroy the products by contamination. Accordingly, the present invention may be used as a condensate absorbent, especially in connection with machines, which are cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0073">In a further embodiment the present article may be sterile.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0074">In another aspect of the invention the present article is used to substitute a pump by the capability of the article to absorb liquid from a container or a blocked pipe for example. The present article may be used in situations where there is a lack of space to fit a pump, or if unwanted objects exists in the liquid, which could cause blocking or damage of a pump, or if the liquid itself, such as acids or organic compounds would damage the pump.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0075">Liquid: can be non-water based and water based</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0076">Non-liquid permeable layer: equals not liquid permeable layer</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">Absorption speed is defined as the time it takes a predefined volume of water to be absorbed by the material. The absorption speed depends upon the surface area of the absorptive material. This means that in the case of a particle type comprising water absorptive materials having a constant mass, the absorption speed of the material becomes slower as the relationship between the surface area of the particle and the volume of the particle becomes smaller and thus the distance of diffusion of water to the inner core of the particle becomes longer, and hence it takes a longer time for the water to reach the inside of the particle. Further, an additional contribution to the slow absorption speed is due to the driving force on the water being diminished as the amount of water bound to the particle increases. Conversely, the absorption speed becomes faster as the particle size becomes smaller because the contact surface area increases accordingly. However, if the particle size is too small, a phenomenon happens in which particles of the water absorptive material cohere with each other via water (a phenomenon called &#x201c;undissolved lumping&#x201d;) upon contact with water. Thus, the apparent absorption speed becomes slower. As a result, the liquid take-up rate is low which requires a longer residence time of the absorptive material in the spill in order to reach the saturation level. This drawback is particularly significant for applications where the absorptive material is subjected in use to vigorous movements by natural forces, such as sea waves or wind, having a tendency to separate the absorbent pad from the spill. In such applications a high fluid take-up rate is desirable to allow an efficient utilisation of the available absorptive material.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0078">Absorptive rate: the amount of liquid in weight volume capable of being absorbed by a given material per area and per time unit, such as g/cm<sup>2</sup>&#xd7;s. It may also be defined as the amount of liquid capable of being absorbed in 1. min. compared to the total capacity of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0079">Capacity: the amount of liquid a material can absorb per surface area. By surface area is meant the area of one side of the article, and not the total surface area of the material, which may also comprise more than one side (unit: g/cm<sup>2</sup>). For example a sample of 5&#xd7;5 cm has a surface area of 25 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0080">Wet burst strength: is the tensile strength of the absorptive material when wet (unit: weight per areal).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0081">Super absorptive material: are capable of binding considerable amounts of liquid, such as water either by absorbing the liquid or by making the liquid gelenize. Such material is typically in the form of particles or fibres, wherein some are capable of binding liquid in an amount surpassing the weight of the material by hundred folds.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0082">The following examples are intended as non-limiting illustrations of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0083">Absorption and retention of the materials used are determined in the following way. A 5&#xd7;5 cm sample of the material is stamped out. The sample is weighed and placed in a Petri dish for 5 min. together with the liquid of which it is desired to determine the value. The sample is then removed from the liquid and the absorption is determined gravimetrically.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Retention of Absorbing Non-Woven Material</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0084">The retention is determined by placing a weight of 1.35 kg on top of the fully absorbed sample corresponding to a pressure of 40 mm Hg. The weight is removed after 1 min. and the sample is weighed again for determining the amount of liquid being retained in the sample.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0088">The absorption rate is determined in 2 ways.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0089">The initial absorption rate is determined by dropping a drop of the liquid used for the the test onto the surface of the material where after the time of absorption of the drop into the material is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090">The absorption capacity of 1 min. is also a measure of the absorption rate which is determined by weighing a 5&#xd7;5 cm sample and placing it into a Petri dish to which the liquid to be tested is added over 5 seconds. The material is left in the dish for 1 min. The sample is taken up and the amount of liquid absorbed is determined gravimetrically.</p>
