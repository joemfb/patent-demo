<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61/321,665, filed Apr. 7, 2010, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to modular power and utility receptacles. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing modular and versatile utility connections and accessories that may be installed in any workspace, and used for a variety of applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, homes or offices have specific locations where access to utilities, such as power and lighting, is provided. For example, in the kitchens of homes or restaurants, electrical outlet receptacles are usually located at particular locations on a wall, commonly called a backsplash, near or adjacent to a countertop. Therefore, the locations where electrical appliances such as blenders or toasters may be operated on the countertop are limited based on the locations of electrical outlet receptacles in the vicinity of the countertop.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Similarly, countertops can also provide space for performing work in a kitchen, such as preparing food or cleaning up after a meal. Task lighting is particularly critical to the performance of such tasks and is often installed overhead or beneath a cabinet and above the countertop. Therefore, the locations where such tasks may be performed may also be limited based on the locations of the task lighting in the vicinity of the countertop, which are generally fixed and cannot easily be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to electrical outlet receptacles and task lighting, the availability of other utility services and features, such as audio, video, Ethernet or Internet connections or consoles, is similarly limited based on the locations of service receptacles or portals in workspaces and in the vicinity of working areas, such as countertops.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need for a customizable system for providing utilities and services, such as power, lighting and other applications, where they are needed most.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to customizable systems and methods for providing utilities and services in convenient locations within workspaces, such as above or near a countertop in a kitchen. The present invention may include versatile structures and accessories that enable a user to customize the delivery of utilities and services to locations where they are needed most. Such structures and accessories may be installed within buildings during new construction, and may also be retrofitted into existing spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a customizable bus system includes a system module for supporting accessory modules and a power module for supplying power to the accessory modules. The system module may include a housing, such as a spine assembly, that is formed by a spine base and a spine cover. The spine base may include openings to connect wires and other services to the bus system, along with openings or apertures for mounting the spine bases to a surface, such as the underside of a cabinet or a backsplash or other wall. The spine cover may include openings for receiving and supporting accessory modules, and may be mounted to the spine base to form the spine assembly, for example, by snap-fitting the spine cover to the spine base, using one or more standard fasteners, such as screws or clips. Accessory modules may be placed into any of the openings in customized configurations defined by a user, and may also be removed from the openings by the user and replaced with other accessory modules or blanks.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The accessory modules are modular units that are interchangeable within various openings of the system module. Each of the accessory modules may include one or more electrical contacts that permit the accessory modules to receive power from the power module. The accessory modules may provide the bus system with accessories having different functionalities, including but not limited to lighting, electrical power receptacles, audio or video connections, Ethernet or Internet connections, Bluetooth&#xae; capabilities, docking stations or charging stations. For example, the bus systems of the present invention may provide lighting elements in the form of puck lights, arrays of light-emitting diodes (LED), tube lights or light trays.
