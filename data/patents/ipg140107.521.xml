<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a mobile sweeper comprising a housing, in which a sweeping roller driven by an electric motor is mounted for rotation, and a sweepings container for receiving sweepings, wherein there are mounted on the housing adjacent to the sweeping roller two front supporting wheels and at a distance from these at least one rear supporting wheel, each for rotation about an axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such sweepers are known, for example, from EP 1 199 971 B1. They can be moved along a surface to be cleaned, and sweepings can be picked up from the surface to be cleaned by the sweeping roller and transferred to the sweepings container.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such sweepers have proven to be effective for cleaning inside surfaces of buildings. As a rule, good cleaning results are obtained on even surfaces. However, surfaces outside buildings can often only be cleaned insufficiently with such sweepers. This is due to the unevennesses which often occur. These not only make moving the sweepers difficult. There is also the risk that the sweeping roller will be blocked by unevennesses or the sweeper will accidentally tilt about an axis aligned transversely to the main direction of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the present invention is to so develop a sweeper of the kind mentioned at the outset that also when surface unevennesses occur there is no risk of the sweeping roller being blocked or of the sweeper tilting.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This object is accomplished, in accordance with the invention, with a mobile sweeper of the generic kind in that the axis of rotation of a first front supporting wheel is arranged coaxially with the axis of rotation of the sweeping roller and&#x2014;in relation to the main direction of movement of the sweeper&#x2014;offset from the axis of rotation of the second front supporting wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the sweeper in accordance with the invention, the axes of rotation of the two front supporting wheels are arranged offset from each other in relation to the main direction of movement of the sweeper. More specifically, the axis of rotation of a first front supporting wheel is aligned coaxially with the axis of rotation of the sweeping roller, and the axis of rotation of the second front supporting wheel is positioned offset therefrom. This makes it possible to choose at least for the first front supporting wheel a relatively large diameter, which facilitates the moving of the sweeper on uneven surfaces, without a large assembly space having to be provided for the supporting wheel in front of the sweeping roller. Such an assembly space would have the disadvantage that edge regions of a surface to be cleaned that are located at the front in the main direction of movement of the sweeper could not be reached by the sweeping roller. The arrangement of the axis of rotation of the first front supporting wheel coaxially with the axis of rotation of the sweeping roller has, in addition, the advantage that there is no risk of the sweeping roller being blocked by uneven ground since the first front supporting wheel arranged in alignment with the sweeping roller forms a kind of spacer for the sweeping roller by defining a definite distance between the axis of rotation of the sweeping roller and the surface to be cleaned. There is therefore practically no risk of the sweeping roller getting too close to the surface to be cleaned in the case of unevennesses and of the brushes of the sweeping roller then getting caught up on the ground. Also an increase in the sweeping resistance of the sweeping roller on account of unevennesses of the ground can be avoided. An increased sweeping resistance would result in a higher power consumption of an electric motor driving the sweeping roller and therefore in a heating and loading of the motor. Owing to the arrangement of the first front supporting wheel in alignment with the sweeping roller, the sweeping resistance of the sweeping roller can also be kept low on uneven ground.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The offset arrangement of the axes of rotation of the two supporting wheels makes it possible to choose a position in front of or behind the sweeping roller for the second front supporting wheel, so that a tilting of the sweeper can be counteracted. The arrangement of the second front supporting wheel offset from the sweeping roller has, in addition, the advantage that the end face of the sweeping roller that is oriented away from the first front supporting wheel can extend up to the outer edge of the housing or even beyond it. Therefore, side edge regions of a surface to be cleaned can also be reliably reached by the sweeping roller. The sweeper in accordance with the invention is therefore characterized by very good edge accessibility. For example, it is also possible to easily clean areas of ground immediately adjacent to a wall with the sweeping roller. The sweeping roller in accordance with the invention, consequently, enables sweeping close to the edge.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the axis of rotation of the second front supporting wheel is arranged, in relation to the main direction of movement of the sweeper, behind the sweeping roller. This makes is possible to mount the sweeping roller at the front end of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the second front supporting wheel is arranged immediately behind the sweeping roller. This increases the stability of the sweeper while moving it along an uneven surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Expediently, the diameter of the first front supporting wheel is larger than the diameter of the second front supporting wheel. As large a diameter as possible for the first front supporting wheel improves the handling characteristics of the sweeper. In contrast, a smaller diameter can be chosen for the second front supporting wheel arranged offset from the first front supporting wheel. This reduces the assembly space required for the second front supporting wheel without noticeably impairing the handling characteristics of the sweeper.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It may be provided that the diameter of the first front supporting wheel is at least 8 cm, preferably approximately 10 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The diameter of the second front supporting wheel is less that approximately 7 cm in a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an advantageous embodiment, the diameter of the first front supporting wheel is at least 1.3 times the diameter of the second front supporting wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the end face, oriented away from the first front supporting wheel, of the sweeping roller is arranged, transversely to the main direction of movement of the sweeper, level with the second front supporting wheel. It is particularly advantageous for the end face, oriented away from the first front supporting wheel, of the sweeping roller to project beyond the second front supporting wheel. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, transversely to the main direction of movement of the sweeper, the second front supporting wheel is offset inwardly in the direction of the center axis of the sweeper. This enables sweeping particularly close to the edge as the brushes of the sweeping roller can extend laterally up to the edge of a floor surface to be cleaned without being obstructed by the second front supporting wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As explained above, the sweeper in accordance with the invention comprises in addition to the two front supporting wheels at least one rear supporting wheel, which is mounted so as to rotate freely about an axis of rotation. In this case, it is expedient for the at least one rear supporting wheel to be mounted for rotation on a pivot support which is pivotable about a vertical pivot axis. The at least one rear supporting wheel therefore forms a steering wheel, which facilitates the moving of the sweeper along a surface, in particular, an uneven surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is expedient for the sweeper to comprise two rear supporting wheels. This eliminates the risk of the sweeper tilting about its longitudinal axis while moving along a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When two rear supporting wheels are used, it has proven particularly advantageous for the second front supporting wheel to be arranged, transversely to the main direction of movement of the sweeper, between a rear supporting wheel and the end face, oriented away from the first front supporting wheel, of the sweeping roller.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an advantageous embodiment, the at least one rear supporting wheel has a smaller diameter than a front supporting wheel. In particular, it may be provided that the diameter of the at least one rear supporting wheel is smaller than the diameter of the second front supporting wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sweeping roller in the sweeper in accordance with the invention is driven by an electric motor. The electric motor can be supplied with power through a supply cable which is connectable to a voltage supply network or a generator. It is, however, particularly advantageous for the mobile sweeper to comprise at least one rechargeable battery. There is then no necessity for a voltage supply network or a generator to be accessible for operation of the sweeper. Use of a rechargeable battery, which is equipped with lithium-ion cells, has the particular advantage that the battery has practically no self-discharge. Therefore, even if the sweeper remains unused for a long time, it is not always necessary to first charge the battery. Lithium-ion cells also have the advantage that they are insensitive to cold and that they have a relatively low weight. In addition, they can be charged within a short time. Owing to the arrangement of the first front supporting wheel in alignment with the sweeping roller, its sweeping resistance, as explained above, can be kept low, even on uneven ground. There is therefore no necessity for high power consumption for the electric motors. This, in turn, extends the service life of the battery.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Schematically represented in the drawings is a preferred embodiment of a mobile sweeper <b>10</b> in accordance with the invention with a housing <b>12</b> surrounding a sweepings container <b>14</b>. The sweepings container <b>14</b> is configured in the manner of a drawer and can be pulled out of the housing at the rear side <b>16</b> of the housing, emptied and then pushed back into the housing <b>12</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Immediately adjacent to the front side <b>18</b> of the housing <b>12</b>, a sweeping roller <b>20</b> is mounted inside the housing for rotation about an axis of rotation <b>21</b>. The sweeping roller <b>20</b> is set in rotation by an electric motor, which is known per se and, therefore, in order to achieve a better overview, is not shown in the drawings. The electric motor is arranged inside the housing <b>12</b> in a central region in front of an ON/OFF switch <b>22</b>. The electric motor is in rotational connection with the sweeping roller via a belt drive <b>24</b>. The belt drive <b>24</b> comprises, as usual, a belt pulley <b>26</b>, which is rotationally fixedly held on a rotatably mounted drive shaft <b>28</b>, and around which a drive belt <b>30</b> is led, which is driven by a two-stage belt transmission and a belt pulley (not shown in the drawings) coupled in a rotationally fixed manner to the motor shaft. The drive shaft <b>28</b> enters a lateral recess <b>34</b> of a roller core <b>36</b> of the sweeping roller <b>20</b> by means of a catch <b>32</b>. The drive shaft <b>28</b> is rotationally fixedly connected by means of the catch <b>32</b> to the roller core <b>36</b>, so that the latter can be set in rotation by the drive shaft <b>28</b>. A multiplicity of brushes <b>38</b>, with the aid of which a surface <b>40</b> can be cleaned, project radially outwards from the roller core <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sweeper <b>10</b> has a total of four supporting wheels for moving it along the surface <b>40</b>. A first front supporting wheel <b>41</b> is aligned with its axis of rotation <b>42</b> coaxially with the axis of rotation <b>21</b> of the sweeping roller <b>20</b>. The first front supporting wheel <b>41</b> therefore acts as spacer for the sweeping roller <b>20</b> and prevents too great a sweeping resistance or even a blocking of the sweeping roller on uneven ground. The power consumption of the electric motor is thereby kept low, and this, in turn, increases the service life of the rechargeable battery <b>51</b>, which supplies the electric motor with power.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A second front supporting wheel <b>44</b> is arranged, in relation to the main direction of movement <b>45</b> of the sweeper <b>10</b>, rearwardly offset from the axis of rotation <b>21</b> of the sweeping roller <b>20</b> and therefore also offset from the axis of rotation <b>42</b> of the first front supporting wheel <b>41</b>. The axis of rotation of the second front supporting wheel <b>44</b> is designated by reference numeral <b>46</b> in the drawings. Two rear supporting wheels <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> are arranged at a distance from the front supporting wheels <b>41</b> and <b>44</b> in a rearward region of the housing <b>12</b>. A first rear supporting wheel <b>48</b> is arranged below the ON/OFF switch <b>22</b>, and the second rear supporting wheel <b>49</b> is arranged below the rechargeable battery <b>51</b>. The battery <b>51</b> is equipped with lithium-ion cells which are characterized not only by a very high service life and by a relatively low weight but also by having practically no self-discharge and being insensitive to cold. The rechargeable battery <b>51</b> can be recharged within a very short time. In this connection, it may be provided that the battery <b>51</b> is removed from the housing <b>12</b> and connected to a separate charging station. It may, however, also be provided that the sweeper <b>10</b> has its own charging electronics, so that the battery <b>51</b> can be recharged inside the housing <b>12</b>, provided the sweeper <b>10</b> is connected to a voltage supply network.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A shaft <b>52</b> is held for pivotal movement on the upper side of the housing <b>12</b>. With the aid of this the sweeper <b>10</b> can be moved by the user along a surface <b>40</b> to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sweeping roller <b>20</b> projects with its end face <b>53</b> that is oriented away from the first front supporting wheel <b>41</b> transversely to the main direction of movement <b>45</b> beyond the second front supporting wheel <b>44</b>. The end face <b>53</b> is arranged on an outer wall <b>54</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. As a result, an edge region of a surface to be cleaned can also be reached by the sweeping roller <b>20</b>. For example, the sweeper <b>10</b> can be moved directly along a building wall delimiting a floor surface, with the sweeping roller <b>20</b> arranged at a very slight distance from the wall. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> it is apparent that the sweeping roller <b>20</b> extends right up to the front side <b>18</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. It is therefore also possible, in the main direction of movement <b>45</b>, to clean a surface up to a very short distance from a front wall. The sweeper <b>10</b> therefore has very good edge accessibility.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As is apparent, in particular, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the diameter of the first supporting wheel <b>41</b> is chosen so as to be larger than the diameter of the second front supporting wheel <b>44</b>. For example, the diameter of the first front supporting wheel <b>41</b> may be approximately 10 cm, whereas the diameter of the second front supporting wheel is preferably approximately 4 to 6 cm. The diameter of the two rear supporting wheels <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> is chosen so as to be smaller than the diameter of the second front supporting wheel <b>44</b>. For example, the rear supporting wheels may each have a diameter of approximately 4 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The relatively large diameter of the first front supporting wheel <b>41</b> ensures that the sweeper <b>10</b> can also be reliably moved over uneven surfaces, i.e., uneven ground can be safely negotiated. At the same time, the arrangement of the first front supporting wheel <b>41</b> in alignment with the sweeping roller <b>20</b> ensures that the sweeping roller <b>20</b> maintains a constant distance from the surface <b>40</b> to be cleaned, even where uneven ground occurs. The risk of the sweeping roller <b>20</b> being blocked by unevennesses is therefore very slight.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To facilitate the moving of the sweeper <b>10</b> along the surface <b>40</b>, the rear supporting wheels <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> are configured as steering wheels, which are not only mounted for free rotation about an axis of rotation <b>56</b> and <b>57</b>, respectively but can also be pivoted about a vertical pivot axis <b>59</b>, <b>60</b>. For this purpose, the rear supporting wheels <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> are each mounted on a pivot support <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>, respectively, which is pivotable about the respective vertical pivot axis <b>59</b> and <b>60</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A surface <b>40</b> can be reliably cleaned using the sweeper <b>10</b>. Sweepings are thereby picked up by the sweeping roller in accordance with the so-called throw-over principle from the surface <b>40</b> and transferred to the sweepings container <b>14</b>. The direction of rotation of the sweeping roller <b>20</b> is chosen such that the brushes <b>38</b> contacting the surface <b>40</b> are moved parallel to the main direction of movement <b>45</b>. This is symbolized by the arrow <b>65</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which represents the direction of rotation of the sweeping roller <b>20</b>. The sweepings are therefore thrown over the sweeping roller <b>20</b> into the adjoining sweepings container <b>14</b>. It has been found that particularly good cleaning results are obtained by such a direction of rotation of the sweeping roller <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Owing to its good movability on uneven surfaces, too, the sweeper <b>10</b> is suited, in particular, for cleaning surfaces outside buildings. However, the sweeper <b>10</b> is not limited to this use. The inside surfaces of buildings can, of course, also be cleaned with the sweeper <b>10</b>. Very good cleaning results are obtained with the sweeper <b>10</b> both outside and inside buildings.</p>
