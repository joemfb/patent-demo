<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing food, more particularly for manufacturing cookies, and even more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a cookie manufacturing apparatus with a modular extruder capable of depositing extruded product at a speed substantially equal to the speed of a transport mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(2) History of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems for the production of cookies have been common in the cookie industry since the early twentieth century. Historically, however, cookie production was a mostly manual procedure. Individuals manually procured and extruded dough into a defined shape, and manually prepared the extruded materials for production. As is the case with most manual tasks, this procedure was slow, imprecise, and inefficient. With the advent of cookie machinery, materials may now be extruded automatically and deposited from the machine in a consistent and repetitive manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modern cookie machinery, however, has created new issues of concern. The modern cookie marketplace demands quantity, economical prices, and variety. For cookie making machines, these objectives translate into the manufacturing goals of versatility and speed. In cookie machinery known in the art, however, extruders are limited to an attached input feed system. If, for example, one production task involves extruding dough and another involves extruding aerated creams such as whipped cream, two different cookie making machines are usually utilized. Further, while some machines are somewhat adaptable to the speed of a conveyor belt or other transport mechanism, they involve moving a complete extruder, with all of its cables and tubes, making maintenance frequent, costly, and problematic.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is directed to a food manufacturing apparatus comprising a feed system for inputting a plurality of materials, an extruder and a cutting assembly. The extruder comprises a pump system and a rotating extrusion die removably connected to the pump system, wherein the rotating extrusion die comprises at least one product channel for receiving and extruding the plurality of materials. The cutting assembly comprises at least one groove and a wire attached through the groove. The feed system is attached to the extruder and the cutting assembly is located at a position to cut the extruded plurality of materials with the wire from the rotating extrusion die.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is additionally directed to a food manufacturing apparatus comprising a feed system for inputting a plurality of materials, an extruder and a cutting assembly. The extruder comprises a pump system and an extrusion die removably connected to the pump system, wherein the extrusion die comprises at least one product channel for receiving and extruding the plurality of materials. The cutting assembly comprises at least one groove and a wire attached through the groove. The feed system is removably attached to the extruder and the cutting assembly is located at a position to cut the extruded plurality of materials with the wire from the extrusion die.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is further directed to a food manufacturing apparatus comprising a feed system for inputting a plurality of materials, an extruder and a cutting assembly. The extruder comprises a pump system and an extrusion die removably connected to the pump system, wherein the extrusion die comprises at least one product channel for receiving and extruding the plurality of materials. The cutting assembly comprises at least one groove and a wire attached through the groove.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> depict the adaptability of the present invention to different types of food manufacturing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the same apparatus as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except that the input feed system <b>106</b> has been replaced with stainless steel open hoppers <b>202</b> instead of open hoppers with driven feed rolls. The stainless steel open hoppers <b>202</b> may be useful in manufacturing where the inputted materials' temperatures must be regulated. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows another variation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein the input feed system <b>106</b> is comprised of closed manifolds <b>302</b>, which may be useful for feeding aerated creams such as whipped creams and ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the extruder assembly <b>102</b> of the present embodiment is shown detached from the wire cutting assembly <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows in more detail additional components of the present embodiment, including extruder pumps <b>402</b> (two, in this embodiment), a rotating extruder die <b>404</b>, and a quick disconnect mechanism <b>406</b> for disconnecting the rotating extruder die <b>404</b>, all located on the extruder assembly <b>102</b>. The extruder pumps <b>406</b> serve to pump product into the extruder die <b>404</b>. The wire cutting assembly <b>104</b> of this embodiment contains a harp <b>408</b> with a plurality of grooves <b>410</b> with a wire <b>412</b> running across the grooves <b>410</b> for the length of the harp <b>408</b>. The wire cutting assembly <b>104</b>, as depicted, is easily removable from the rest of the apparatus. Servo drives and gear boxes <b>414</b> provide for precision control of the component parts of the present invention, including but not limited to the extruder pumps <b>402</b>, the wire cutting assembly <b>104</b>, and the extruder die <b>404</b>. Further, safety ribs <b>416</b> supply an extra layer of protection between the input feed system and the moving parts of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the wire cutting assembly <b>104</b> is equipped with an adjustment mechanism <b>502</b> to advance or retard the wire position of the wire assembly <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further shows a detailed view of the rotating extruder die <b>404</b>. Shown for two-color extrusion, two product channels <b>504</b> and <b>506</b> for receiving product are present on the rotating extruder die <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A first advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that one standard extruder assembly <b>102</b> may be provided with a diverse array of primary feed systems, making the system available for a wide range of products. A variety of primary feed systems may be mounted on single extruder assembly <b>102</b>. As a result, the primary feed system may be quickly changed. For example, in order to better accommodate jams, jellies, and light viscose creams and light viscose dough, stainless steel hoppers which are completely jacketed may be utilized, providing for accurate temperature controls. Such an embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. By way of further example, for aerated creams and/or ice creams, one or more hoppers may be simply replaced by a feeding manifold, providing a consistent supply to the pump system of the product while guaranteeing a high level of accuracy, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As another example, for more viscose dough and heavy creams, stainless steel jacketed hoppers may be provided with wide-diameter electro-servo driven feed rollers in order to help provide consistent feed to the pump system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment with driven feed rolls <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A second advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that the lobes in the extruder pumps <b>402</b> are single profile and of full machine width. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, no intermediate bearings, plates, or other obstacles are used, keeping the extruder pumps <b>402</b> completely free for any number or position of nozzles. As a result, the entire width of the machine may be used for the extrusion of slabs of product.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A third advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that, for low speed depositing, wire cutting, and the continuous production of extruded product, the product may be dropped onto a belt or directly onto an oven band. Since production often requires the extruding nozzles to keep pace with the velocity of the belt or band, the extrusion system of the present invention is designed to be used at an exceptionally high pacing speed. Moving a complete extruder assembly <b>102</b> is possible, but due to the substantial weight of the extruder (including cables, feeding tubes, etc.), it is severely limited in speed and causes several critical maintenance points. Additionally, it is often difficult to cover all of the moving parts of a complete moving machine, creating numerous safety concerns around the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Instead, the extrusion system of the present invention employs a pacing stencil die. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the complete machine may be placed on a pivot stand <b>106</b>, allowing the extruder die <b>404</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to follow the band or belt at a precisely controlled and reciprocating rotating speed for the desired deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the pacing extruder die <b>404</b>, as applied to two-color extrusion. One of ordinary skill in the art will note that any number of product lanes may be used without disrupting the process herein disclosed. The extruder die <b>404</b> begins in a &#x201c;dwell&#x201d; position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, having already had product pumped into it by the two extruder pumps <b>402</b>. The wire <b>412</b> meanwhile moves up in a substantially vertical motion into cutting position. As used herein, &#x201c;substantially vertical motion&#x201d; shall mean the movement of an object in a vertical motion with negligible to no movement in any other direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the extruder die <b>404</b> rotates forward at a programmed velocity, the speed adaptable to a speed of production by means of the drives and gearboxes <b>414</b>. As the extruder die <b>404</b> rotates, the extruded product is cut by the stationary wire <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once the extruder die <b>404</b> reaches a &#x201c;final well position&#x201d; depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the wire moves down in a substantially vertical motion to a &#x201c;clear&#x201d; position. At this point the extruded product may be deposited. The stencil die may then rotate backwards, reaching the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, with the wire in the &#x201c;clear&#x201d; position. Now the extruder pumps <b>402</b> may pump further product into the rotating extruder die <b>404</b>, which is positioned to receive the product via two product channels <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>. Another iteration of the described process is then ready to proceed. As a result of this process, the need to move the complete machine is eliminated, the requirement for maintenance is tempered, and the number of safety concerns is significantly reduced, all while achieving accurate and speedy deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Because of the rotating extruder die <b>404</b>, the complete extruder may be pivoted up to <b>450</b>, giving ample access to the bottom of the unit for sanitation or maintenance. The use of this adjustment, however, is not required to control the height of an oven band and take advantage of accurate depositing or extruding.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A fourth advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that, as demonstrated in the discussion of the third advantage, wire cutting requires only slight vertical movement, and negligible to no horizontal movement, of the wire <b>412</b> on the wire cutting assembly <b>104</b>. The need for horizontal movement is eliminated because of the rotating motion of the pacing extruder die <b>404</b>. The upward vertical movement puts the wire in position to cut as the extruder die <b>404</b> rotates and the downward vertical motion frees the wire from the dough when the wire cutting is complete. In an embodiment, the wire <b>412</b> of the wire cutting assembly <b>104</b> may be electro-servo controlled. Consequently, the simplicity of the vertical motion facilitates rapid cutting speeds. Further, within a few minutes, both the harp <b>408</b> (to which the wire <b>412</b> is attached) and the complete wire-cut assembly <b>104</b> (including the motor drive) may be removed from the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A fifth advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that the pump body <b>402</b> is constructed from segments and assembled in a unique and sanitary manner. Moreover, by using standard components, machines of any required width may be efficiently assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is thus believed that the operation and construction of various embodiments of the present invention will be apparent from the foregoing description. It will be obvious that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing form the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
