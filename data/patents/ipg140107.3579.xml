<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to delay lines and delay lock loops using delay lines, and, more particularly, in one or more embodiments, to a delay line providing improved linearity and duty cycle symmetry.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of circuits are included in integrated circuits, such as memory devices. One such circuit is a delay lock loop (&#x201c;DLL&#x201d;), a typical example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The DLL <b>10</b> includes a delay line <b>14</b>, which, as explained in greater detail below, includes a large number of gates coupled to each other in series. The delay line <b>14</b> receives a reference clock signal CLK<sub>REF </sub>and generates an output clock signal CLK<sub>OUT </sub>having a delay relative to the reference clock signal CLK<sub>REF </sub>that is controlled by a delay control signal DelCtrl. The delay control signal DelCtrl adjusts the delay provided by the delay line <b>14</b> by altering the number of gates through which the CLK<sub>REF </sub>is coupled. The DLL <b>10</b> also includes a phase detector <b>16</b> and delay controller <b>18</b> coupled to outputs of the phase detector <b>16</b> for adjusting the delay of the delay line <b>14</b>. The phase detector <b>16</b> compares the phase of the reference clock signal CLK<sub>REF </sub>to the phase of an output clock signal CLK<sub>OUT </sub>generated by delay line <b>14</b> to determine a phase error. The CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal is thus used as a feedback clock signal, although other signals derived from the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal may instead be used as the feedback clock signal. The feedback clock signal is coupled to the input of phase detector though a model delay circuit <b>20</b>. The model delay circuit <b>20</b> delays the feedback clock signal by substantially the sum of the input delay of the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal being coupled to the phase detector <b>16</b> and the output delay of the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal being coupled from the delay line <b>14</b>. As a result, the phase of the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal is accurately synchronized to the phase of the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal. If the phase detector <b>16</b> is a digital phase detector, it typically generates an UP signal if the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal leads the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal by more than a first phase error. The delay controller <b>18</b> responds to the UP signal by increasing the delay of the delay line <b>14</b> to reduce the phase error. Similarly, the phase detector <b>16</b> generates a DN signal if the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal lags the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal by more than a second phase error. In that case, the delay controller <b>18</b> responds to the DN signal by decreasing the delay of the delay line <b>14</b> to again reduce the phase error. The phase detector <b>16</b> generates neither an UP signal nor a DN signal if the magnitude of the phase error is between the first phase error and the second phase error.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The DLL <b>10</b> can be used for a variety of functions in a memory device and in other integrated circuit devices. For example, the DLL <b>10</b> can be used in a memory device to perform such functions as synchronizing one signal, such as a data strobe signal DQS, to another signal, such as an external clock signal as long as a delay in coupling the external clock signal to the DLL<b>10</b> and a delay in coupling the DQS signal from the DLL<b>10</b> are compensated for by corresponding model delays in the feedback path of the DLL <b>10</b>. The DQS signal can then be used to latch data at a time that is synchronized with the external clock signal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The degree to which the DLL <b>10</b> is able to lock the phase of the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal to the phase of the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal is largely determined by the delay adjustability of the delay line <b>14</b>. If the delay of the delay line <b>14</b> can only be adjusted in relatively coarse steps, the error between the phase of the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal and the phase of the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal can be relatively large. For this reason, it is desirable for the delay line <b>14</b> to have a large number of gates or other delay devices. A large number of gates or other delay devices allows the delay of the delay line to be adjusted in a larger number of steps. For example, if the delay line <b>14</b> has 72 delay stages, the delay line <b>14</b> can adjust the delay of the delay line in approximately 5 degree steps (i.e., (360&#xb0; minus delay of model delay circuits)/72). Although a large number of gates or other delay devices provides a great deal of delay adjustability, it can also result in a large power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to allow the delay of a delay line to be adjusted in relatively fine steps to provide high accuracy without consuming a significant amount of power, a phase mixer (not shown) can be used to interpolate between relatively coarse steps. Using a phase mixer, the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal is delayed relative to the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal by the sum of the coarse steps provided by the delay line and fine steps provided by the phase mixer. Significantly, the minimum step size is then the size of a fine step.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Unfortunately, conventional DLLs using a combination of a delay line and a phase mixer to delay the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal relative to the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal can suffer a number of performance limitations, primarily because the delay lines typically used have two inverting gates in each of a plurality of delay stages. As a result, the phase mixer must interpolate over a larger range in order to provide a given size of the fine step. Additionally, phase mixers interpolating over a large range often exhibit excessive non-linearity because the non-linearity of a phase mixer is normally a fixed percentage of the range over which the phase mixer interpolates. Thus, the larger coarse step provided by two inverting gates can result in an undesirable degree of non-linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is therefore a need for a delay line that provides good duty cycle symmetry, and that allows a phase mixer to interpolate over a relatively small range and provide good phase mixer linearity.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A typical prior art DLL <b>30</b> using a delay line in combination with a phase mixer is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The DLL <b>30</b> may include the same phase detector <b>16</b> and model delay <b>20</b> used in the DLL <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A delay line <b>50</b> included in the DLL <b>30</b> includes a plurality of delay stages <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that are coupled to each other in series. The first delay stage <b>54</b><i>a </i>receives the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal. Each of the delay stages <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>includes a pair of series-coupled NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> and an exit NAND gate <b>60</b>. The NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> are enabled by respective EnNx signals applied to the respective delay stages <b>54</b>. When enabled, each delay stage <b>54</b> couples a clock signal applied to the input of the delay stage <b>54</b> to the output of the delay stage. Each of the delay stages <b>54</b> in the delay line <b>50</b> also receives a respective exit control signal ExitEnx, which enables the respective exit NAND gate <b>60</b> so that the gate <b>60</b> can couple a received clock signal to an input of an exit tree <b>70</b>. The exit tree <b>70</b> includes a pair of NAND gates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> coupled to the exit NAND gates <b>60</b> of the delay line as shown. The exit tree <b>70</b> applies two clock signals EvenOut and OddOut, which are delayed from each other by the delay of the two NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, to an input of a phase mixer <b>80</b>. The phase mixer <b>80</b> generates a feedback clock signal CLK<sub>FB </sub>with a phase that is interpolated between the delay between the EvenOut and OddOut signals. As with the DLL <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the CLK<sub>FB </sub>signal is applied to one of the inputs of the phase detector <b>16</b>. The phase detector <b>16</b> responds to a comparison between the phase of the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal and the CLK<sub>FB </sub>signal by selectively generating UP and DN signals.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In operation, a delay controller <b>84</b> includes conventional logic used to generate delay control signals, such as EnNx signals, ExitEnx signals, and an INTER signal. For example, delay controller <b>84</b> could generate high EnNx signals that are applied to the NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in a delay stage <b>54</b> selected in response to the UP and DN signals. The delay controller <b>84</b> also applies high EnNx signals to the respective NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in all of the delay stages <b>54</b> upstream from the selected delay stage <b>54</b> and low EnNx signals to the respective NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in all of the delay stages <b>54</b> downstream from the selected delay stage <b>54</b>. As a result, the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal is coupled through the selected delay stage <b>54</b> and all of the delay stages <b>54</b> upstream from the selected delay stage <b>54</b>. However, the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal is not coupled through the delay stages <b>54</b> downstream from the selected delay stage <b>54</b> because the low EnNx signals applied to these stages disable the NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in those stages, thereby avoiding power being wasted in these stages.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The delay controller <b>84</b> also applies a high ExitEnx signal to exit NAND gate <b>60</b> in the selected delay stage <b>54</b>, and it applies respective low ExitENx signals to the exit NAND gate <b>60</b> in each of the other delay stages <b>54</b>. The low ExitEnx signal applied to the NAND gate <b>60</b> in each of the remaining stages causes the NAND gate <b>60</b> to output a high, which enables the NAND gates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> in the exit tree <b>70</b> so that the selected delay stage <b>54</b> can couple its input and output through the NAND gates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. Thus, only the selected delay stage <b>54</b> is enabled to output EvenOut and OddOut signals. In this manner, the delay controller <b>84</b> selects one of the delay stages <b>54</b> in the delay line <b>50</b>. The delay controller <b>84</b> also generates an INTER value that causes the phase mixer <b>80</b> to interpolate between the EvenOut and OddOut signals to minimize the phase error determined by the phase detector <b>16</b>. Therefore, the delay line <b>50</b> is used to apply a coarse adjustment to the delay of the CLK<sub>FB </sub>signal, and the phase mixer <b>80</b> is used to interpolate within the coarse delay to apply a fine adjustment to the phase of the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The DLL <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> performs well in a variety of conventional applications, but nevertheless exhibits a variety of undesirable traits and limitations. The problems with conventional DLLs, such as the DLL<b>30</b>, are due primarily to the fact that each delay stage in the delay line <b>50</b> has two inverting gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> to ensure good duty cycle control. In most inverting delay circuits, the transition from a first logic level to a second logic level is faster than the transition from the second logic level back to the first logic level. As a result, if other inverting logic elements, such as a single NAND gate and an inverter was used for each delay stage, the NAND gate might have different rise and fall times than the inverter, which would be accumulated from all of the delay stages, thereby resulting in duty cycle error, which would result in the CLK<sub>FB </sub>signal not having a 50% duty cycle. A deviation from a duty cycle of 50% can be particularly problematic for many applications. For example, a DQS signal is used in current memory devices to latch data on both the rising edge and the falling edge of the DQS signal. Therefore, if the CLK<sub>OUT </sub>signal does not have a 50% duty cycle and it is used to generate the DQS signal, the rising and falling edges of the DQS signal will generally not occur at the center of the period during which the data to be latched are valid. Such skews that can occur in the timing of the DQS signal relative to the data can thus prevent the proper data from being latched. The uses of two NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in each stage <b>54</b> of the delay line <b>50</b> avoids the problem of duty cycle skew because the signal applied to every stage always transitions both high and low on each transition of the signal before the signal is propagated to the output of that stage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The phase detector <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has characteristics that limit the performance of the DLL <b>30</b>. First, the use of two NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> or other inverting delay devices for each stage limits the minimum size of the coarse step to the delay of two NAND gates. As a result, the phase mixer <b>80</b> must interpolate over a larger range in order to provide a given size of the fine step. Second, two NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> or other inverting delay devices for each stage provide a relatively large delay which can adversely affect the ability of the phase mixer <b>80</b> to linearity adjust the delay of the delay line <b>50</b>. To provide optimum performance, the delay provided by the phase mixer <b>80</b> should be a linear function of the value of an interpolation signal so that the sizes of all of the fine steps are equal to each other. Insofar as the non-linearity of a phase mixer is normally a fixed percentage of the range over which the phase mixer interpolates, the larger coarse step required to cover two NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> or other inverting delay devices results in a greater degree of non-linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A DLL <b>100</b> using a delay line <b>120</b> in combination with a phase mixer <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The DLL <b>100</b> may use the same delay controller <b>84</b> used in the DLL <b>30</b>, and it may provide the same EnNx and ExitEnx signals. Similarly, DLL <b>100</b> may use the same exit tree <b>70</b> used in the DLL <b>30</b>, and it may receive the same ExitEnx signals and output the EvenOut and OddOut* signals. Therefore, an explanation of the structure and operation of the delay controller <b>84</b> and the exit tree <b>70</b> will not be repeated. The DLL <b>100</b> differs from the DLL <b>30</b> by using a delay line <b>120</b> that is different from the delay line <b>50</b> used in the DLL <b>30</b>, and it uses a phase inverter <b>130</b>, which is not used in the DLL <b>30</b>. Of course, a DLL according to other embodiments of the invention may have other differences from the DLL <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The delay line <b>120</b> includes a plurality of delay stages <b>124</b>, each of which includes only a single NAND gate <b>126</b>, although other embodiments may use other inverting delay (e.g., logic) devices such as NOR gates and inverters, to name two such delay devices. As a result, the size of the coarse step over which the delay of the delay line <b>120</b> is adjusted may be approximately half the size of the coarse step of the delay line <b>50</b> used in the prior art DLL <b>30</b>. However, unlike the delay line <b>50</b>, the output from each delay stage <b>124</b> of the delay line <b>120</b> is the delayed complement of the phase of the input to that delay stage <b>124</b>. As a result, the coarse step of the delay line <b>120</b> is the difference between the phase shift through the NAND gate <b>126</b> and 180 degrees. The size of this coarse step would normally be significantly larger than the size of the coarse step provided by the delay line <b>50</b>, and would thus defeat the major advantage to using a single NAND gate <b>126</b> or other inverting delay device for each stage rather than two NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> for each stage <b>54</b> as used in the delay line <b>50</b>. The 180 degree phase shift could, of course, be eliminated by using a non-inverting delay device in each stage. But doing so would cause the delay devices in each of the delay stages to transition in the same direction. As a result, any difference in the time to transition between logic levels in opposite directions in each delay stage would be magnified by the number of delay stages in the delay line <b>120</b>, which might result in the delay line creating substantial duty cycle skew. For example, a rising edge transition of an input signal applied to a delay line <b>120</b> containing only non-inverting delay devices would result in all of the delay devices transitioning from high-to-low. On the next transition of the input signal, i.e., from high to low, the non-inverting delay devices would all transition from low-to-high. If the low-to-high transition required more time than the high-to-low transition, the duty cycle of the input signal would be skewed by all of the delay devices, thus resulting in a significant deviation from a 50% duty cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The DLL <b>100</b> allows use of the delay line <b>120</b> with a single inverting delay device in each stage by using the delay line <b>120</b> in combination with the phase inverter <b>130</b>. As explained in greater detail below, the phase inverter <b>130</b> passes the EvenOut signal without inverting it and inverts the OddOut* signal to provide an OddOut signal that is no longer the complement of the EvenOut signal. The phase inverter <b>130</b> can have the same propagation delay for both the EvenOut signal and the OddOut signal so that the phase of the EvenOut signal differs from the phase of OddOut signal by only the propagation delay though one of the NAND gates <b>126</b>. As a result, the size of the coarse delay over which the phase mixer <b>110</b> is only approximately half the size of the coarse step over the phase mixer <b>80</b> used in the DLL <b>30</b> must interpolate. Therefore, the linearity of the phase mixer <b>110</b> used in the DLL <b>100</b> should be significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The delay line <b>120</b> used in the DLL <b>100</b> does invert the CLK<sub>REF </sub>signal over an odd number of delay stages <b>124</b> to provide either the EvenOut signal or the OddOut* signal. However, the mismatch between the number of rising edge transitions of the CLR<sub>REF </sub>signal compared to the number of falling edge transitions of the CLK<sub>REF </sub>is a single leading edge or rising edge transition. Therefore, for example, if there are 72 delay stages <b>124</b>, the CLK<sub>REF </sub>may have a duty cycle that deviates from 50% only to the extent of a disparity in the rise time and fall time of a single delay stage <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A phase inverter <b>130</b> according to one embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The phase inverter <b>130</b> includes a pair of series coupled inverters <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, the first of which <b>140</b> receives the EvenOut signal and the last of which generates one of the signals applied to the phase mixer. The OddOut signal is applied to the first of a series of three inverters <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>. The final inverter <b>154</b> has its output coupled to the other input of the phase mixer <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Insofar as the OddOut signal is the complement of the EvenOut signal, the signals output from the phase inverter <b>130</b> have the same phase in the same manner that the phase mixer receives signals having the same phase in the prior art circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It may appear that the OddOut signal would be delayed relative to the EvenOut signal by more than the delay of one delay stage because the OddOut signal is inverted by three inverters <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> while the EvenOut signal is inverted by only two inverters <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>. However, transistors (not shown) in the inverters <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> are fabricated with a size that causes the collective delay of the two inverters <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to be equal to the collective delay of the three inverters <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>. As a result, the transistors in the inverter <b>140</b> have different electrical characteristics from the transistors in the inverter <b>150</b>, and they would therefore load the respective signal lines coupled to their inputs to different degrees. To equalize the loads on each of these signal lines, an impedance compensating device, such as an extra inverter <b>160</b> having the same electrical characteristics as the inverter <b>150</b>, is connected to the input of the inverter <b>140</b>. Similarly, an extra inverter <b>164</b> having the same electrical characteristics as the inverter <b>140</b> is connected to the input of the inverter <b>150</b>. As a result, both inputs to the phase inverter <b>130</b> have the same input impedance. However, in other embodiments of the phase inverter <b>130</b>, the extra inverters <b>160</b>, <b>164</b> are not used. Also, of course, other embodiments of the phase inverter <b>130</b> may use different designs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although the present invention has been described with reference to the disclosed embodiments, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the invention. For example, as explained above, the delay controller <b>84</b> includes conventional logic that selectively applies EnNx signals to the NAND gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in each delay stage <b>54</b> to disable the delay stages <b>54</b> downstream from a selected delay stage. However, in other embodiments of the delay line <b>50</b>, the gates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in all of the delay stages <b>54</b> may be permanently enabled, particularly if power consumption is not an issue. In such cases, rather than using a permanently enabled gate, inverters may be used in place of gates. Such modifications are well within the skill of those ordinarily skilled in the art. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
