<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to contact centres and, more particularly, testing the operation of contact centres.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Contact centres are recognised as systems with which a person communicates via telephone, typically to receive information, make a purchase, report a problem or any range of like activities. A contact centre may include one or more interactive voice response (IVR) systems that provide verbal prompts to solicit responses for automated branching of voice queries. The caller responds by pushing buttons on their telephone keypad, or by voice response. While calls to the contact centre may be entirely conducted within the IVR, callers may be transferred to a human agent. The agent talks directly to the caller, and typically interacts with a computer system to further assist the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Detecting operational issues with contact centres is desirable, and such issues are desirably detected and resolved before they are noticed by callers. Poor-quality interactions can adversely affect a company's reputation and, ultimately, profits. Contact centres are often a first point of contact with callers and consequently set a first impression with callers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various methods and systems exist for testing IVR-based systems. One technique involves load and performance testing the IVR by generating bulk volume calls that are directed at the IVR. The test calls directed at the IVR conform to a &#x201c;test script&#x201d; that determines certain parameters of the test calls. There are various existing techniques for specifying a &#x201c;test script&#x201d; for generating calls for bulk call testing, and many techniques are proprietary to particular vendor solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Contact centres that use agents introduce a human factor and are consequently less amendable to analysis. While IVR systems are intended to behave as designed, human agents are often used precisely because the caller's requirements are not predictable. Naturally, the behaviour, skills and performance of agents also vary. Techniques for testing contact centres that involve the use of human agents would thus form a welcome addition to the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides for a system and method for operating performance of a contact centre by simulating calls in the contact centre in an automated manner. Simulation of calls is achieved with the use of virtual agents that mimic the behaviour of human agents that ordinarily deal with caller enquiries in a contact centre. A set of virtual agents, which can mirror their human counterparts, can be generated and assigned activities and behaviours that simulate the behaviour of human agents. These virtual agents can thus be enlisted in testing campaigns placed within the contact centre environment, and assigned to answer calls as if they were in fact human agents, in accordance with the usual operation of the contact centre environment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Contact centre operation can thus be simulated by placing calls into a contact centre environment just as callers do, though in an automated manner. Virtual agents can be used to simulate the behaviour of actual agents, though in a predetermined manner. Variability in particular virtual agent behaviours can be introduced by effectively specifying a probability distribution to certain parameters. As an example, the duration of certain intervals may be assigned a minimum and a maximum duration, and the actual duration determined as a random interval with a uniform distribution between the minimum and maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The progression of the actual call is recorded and the data consolidated with that of other calls so that performance can be reported and analysed in any way that may prove useful. Monitoring the operation and performance of contact centres can highlight operational issues that may require attention. Various benefits may arise from resolving such issues before callers notice them as problems.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents an architecture of a CTI system for testing contact centre performance. The system is based around a platform <b>100</b> that is accessed through a portal <b>105</b> via the web <b>110</b>. The portal <b>110</b> allows users <b>115</b> to access and operate the platform for testing the contact centre <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The contact centre <b>120</b> operates using products supplied by Genesys Telecommunications Labs, Inc., of California, United States of America. The platform <b>100</b> as described herein is specifically designed to operate in conjunction with a Genesys environment, though can be adapted to run any analogous system. The client environment <b>120</b> incorporates a Genesys T-Server <b>130</b>, a Genesys Routing Layer <b>140</b> and a Genesys Configuration Layer <b>150</b>. Agents <b>160</b> that operate the contact centre are connected to the Genesys T-server <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further information regarding the Genesys environment can be obtained directly from Genesys publications that deal with the Genesys Framework architecture and applications, and deployment of the Genesys architecture. As an example, a relevant publication is <i>Genesys Framework </i>7.5 <i>Deployment Guide</i>, which is available through Genesys Technical Support website or Genesys <i>Documentation Library DVD</i>, and can be obtained from Genesys upon request. The content of this reference is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A Genesys Configuration Profile for the client environment <b>120</b> is utilized with the platform <b>100</b>. The Genesys Configuration Profile specifies:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The Genesys Configuration Server details from which agent details are imported</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The details for T-Server <b>130</b> to which the agents connect</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Genesys Configuration Server details are required to import agent details from the Configuration Server as part of a Virtual Agent creation process. This information is also used to refresh Virtual Agent details on commencement of a Campaign run.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To configure a Configuration Server, the following fields are specified:

<p id="p-0024" num="0032">One or more Behaviours are defined before creating Virtual Agents and running Campaigns. A Behaviour specifies how a Virtual Agent handles an interaction and consists of an ordered sequence of Activities to be performed by the Virtual Agent for each interaction received (for example, an inbound call).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0033">This section defines the general attributes of the Behaviour. Enter the following information to create the new Behaviour:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0037">Activities represent the individual actions to be performed by a Virtual Agent as part of the handling of an interaction. Each Activity is defined by an Activity Type, a duration, and any associated user data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0038">Behaviours of Virtual Agents are designed to mimic real (e.g., human) agent behaviours when dealing with interactions. Consequently, the allowable sequence of Activities that form a Behaviour is restricted to a subset of those that actually occur in a real contact centre environment. For example, the CallOnHold Activity cannot immediately follow the CallRinging Activity, as a CallInbound Activity is first required to establish the interaction. There are some simple rules defining the possible sequence and combinations of Activities. Most of these are quite intuitive, for example, CallInbound cannot precede CallRinging, CallInbound cannot follow AfterCallWork, and so on. These rules are made for the sake of convenience and practicality.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a state chart of the behaviour activity sequence, in which each state and the flow of states is indicated as shown. The Activity sequence state chart provides a graphical representation of the allowable Activity sequences and transitions that form a Behaviour. Each Activity in the state chart shows:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0040">The allowable Activity/Activities that can precede the Activity (predecessors).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0041">The allowable Activity/Activities that can follow the Activity (successors).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a table that provides a related representation of the business rules that are applied to the creation of Behaviours. This table also shows additional information such as the minimum and maximum durations allowable for each Activity, and whether or not Attached Data is supported as part of the Activity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, behaviours can consist of the following Voice Activity Types:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">

        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0046">CallOnHold&#x2014;Instructs the Virtual Agent to place the call on hold. The duration of this Activity contributes to the overall &#x201c;hold time&#x201d; of the call.</li>

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0050">There is no &#x201c;call release&#x201d; Activity. Calls are automatically released under the following circumstances:

</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0054">For voice Behaviours, a call is always initiated with a &#x201c;ringing&#x201d; event. Hence, &#x2018;CallRinging&#x2019; is selected by default as the first &#x2018;Activity Number&#x2019; and &#x2018;Activity Type&#x2019;.

<p id="p-0042" num="0066">Once a Behaviour is saved, it may be edited, deleted or cloned. A Behaviour cannot be deleted if it has been assigned as a &#x2018;Default Behaviour&#x2019; for one or more Agents, or if it is in use in a Campaign. An error message is displayed upon attempting to delete a Behaviour that is in use. To delete a Behaviour that is currently in use, first a different Behaviour is assigned as the &#x2018;Default Behaviour&#x2019; for all Virtual Agents and/or Campaigns using the Behaviour to be deleted. The clone function creates a copy of the Behaviour and simplifies the process of creating similar Behaviours and/or creating new Behaviours based on an existing Behaviour.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Virtual Agents</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0067">Virtual Agents are used in Campaigns to represent actual agents in a contact centre environment. Whilst related and dependent to a limited extent on agent (Person) objects in the Genesys Configuration Manager Environment, which may be otherwise referred to as &#x2018;Genesys Agents&#x2019;, Virtual Agents are stored as a physically separate data entity within the testing platform <b>100</b>. Each Virtual Agent serves as a counterpart to a corresponding Genesys Agent and as such there is a one-to-one relationship between Virtual Agents and Genesys Agents. While certain applications may find a different set of Virtual Agents useful, a set of Virtual Agents corresponding to actual agents is obviously helpful when simulating the operation of the contact centre environment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0068">For a Virtual Agent to be imported into the platform <b>100</b>, the agent needs to exist in the Genesys Configuration Manager. As Virtual Agents are used to log-in to the client environment <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0069">Creating a &#x2018;New Virtual Agent&#x2019; involves the following editable fields:
<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

        <li id="ul0016-0004" num="0077">Skills&#x2014;The skill names and corresponding proficiencies assigned to the agent in Genesys Configuration Manager. Proficiencies (skill levels) are displayed in parentheses following the skill name.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0078">To import a Virtual Agent, the employee ID of the Genesys Agent is entered via the portal. A default Behaviour is assigned to the Virtual Agent using the &#x2018;Default Behaviour&#x2019; drop-down list. A description for the Virtual Agent is entered, and the results saved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0079">If Virtual Agent details are successfully retrieved from Genesys Configuration Server, these details are displayed in the relevant fields and the Virtual Agent is saved. An error message is displayed if the no agent with a matching employee ID is found.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0080">Before a Virtual Agent can be used in a Campaign, one or more T-Server relationships must be defined for the Virtual Agent. A T-Server relationship specifies the login details to be used by the Virtual Agent when logging into a particular T-Server <b>130</b>. In this way, T-Server relationships are akin to &#x201c;login profiles&#x201d; for a Virtual Agent&#x2014;they specify what and where the Virtual Agent logs into. Each Virtual Agent may define only one relationship for each T-Server <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0081">T-Server relationships are used in Campaigns to specify the login attributes of the Virtual Agent for a particular Campaign. So for example, a Virtual Agent may have two T-Server relationships defined&#x2014;such as with T-Servers <b>130</b> in different sites or locations. As an example, there may be separate relationships defined for a T-Server based in Sydney, another for a T-Server based in Melbourne. Therefore, a Campaign may be created to run a simulation where the Virtual Agent logs into a Sydney T-Server, and another Campaign created to run a simulation where the Virtual Agent logs into the Melbourne T-Server. T-Server relationships may be used in more than one Campaign.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0082">T-Server relationships may be added for T-Servers <b>130</b> that have been defined in the testing platform <b>100</b> via the portal <b>105</b>. Creating T-Servers configurations in the platform <b>100</b> is described in further detail above. If no T-Server relationships are defined for a Virtual Agent, the Virtual Agent does not appear in a selection list for a Campaign.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0083">To define a T-Server relationship for a Virtual Agent the following fields are defined:
<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0084">T-Server Name&#x2014;Contains a list of available T-Servers. Since only one relationship can be defined for each T-Server <b>130</b> for each Virtual Agent, only T-Servers with no existing relationship with the Virtual Agent are displayed.</li>
        <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0085">DN&#x2014;Directory Number to be registered for use by the Virtual Agent.</li>
        <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0086">Switch Login&#x2014;The Switch Virtual Agent Login configured and assigned to the agent in Genesys. Used to log the Virtual Agent into the switch/PABX.</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0089">Deleting a T-Server relationship for a Virtual Agent affects existing Campaigns containing the Virtual Agent-T-Server relationship combination. Deleting a T-Server relationship that is currently used by a Virtual Agent in a Campaign removes the Virtual Agent from the Campaign. A T-Server Relationship can also be edited. All Campaigns using the updated Virtual Agents-T-Server relationship are updated with the new details.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0090">Before deleting a Virtual Agent, verify that the Virtual Agent is no longer required for use in any Campaigns. Deleting a Virtual Agent that is currently used in a Campaign automatically removes the Virtual Agent from the Campaign.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Campaigns</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0091">Behaviours and Virtual Agents may be used in Campaigns once they have been created. Campaigns are used as the basis for simulation campaigns and define:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0092">The duration of the simulation campaign.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0093">The start/date time of the simulation campaign.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0115">An advantage of the testing platform <b>100</b> is that it enables simulation of a contact centre environment <b>120</b>, consequently providing insight into its operation and the ability to analyse the results of Campaign runs through reporting capabilities. There are two major categories of reporting available&#x2014;Real-time reports and Historical reports.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0116">Real-time reports provide dynamically updated information and statistics on Campaigns that are in progress. When there are one or more Campaigns running, the &#x2018;Virtual Agent Status&#x2019; report is enabled. Historical reports provide information and statistics on all Campaigns that have been executed in the past and include the following reports:</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0117">Call Distribution Report</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0118">Caller Type Handled by Virtual Agent Report</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0119">Campaign Calls Report</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0120">Virtual Agent Activity Report</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0121">Historical reports are predominantly provided in the form of summary reports containing aggregated performance metrics, with the ability to drill-down to data for individual Virtual Agents, interactions and activities. As historical data is stored for all Campaign runs, historical reports for different Campaign runs can be used to compare different &#x201c;what-if&#x201d; scenarios and varying contact centre environments and/or conditions. It is also possible to view historical reports for Campaigns that are currently in progress, however, the data contained within the reports is not dynamically updated and the report has to be reloaded to retrieve the most up-to-date data.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0122">Real-time reports are available for all Campaign runs that are currently in progress, and an associated snapshot is available, indicating key information.</p>
