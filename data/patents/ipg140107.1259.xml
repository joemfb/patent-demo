<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the art, devices that generally function to provide a wire about an article are known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,504 describes an apparatus that includes a mechanism for forming a U-shaped loop of a tying wire, a mechanism for guiding the U-shaped loop to wind it around an external surface of a portion of an article to be tied, a mechanism for twisting the closed end and the other end of the U-shaped loop, and a mechanism for cutting the tying wire at an appropriate time to an appropriate length.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By way of further example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,279,970 describes an automatic knot-tying device for tying a discrete knot about an article, such as a bundle of wires. The device functions by pulling a filament transversely around the article and includes a hand-held housing and a knot-tying mechanism within that housing comprised of a hollow nozzle for leading the filament toward the article, a wrapping ring for wrapping the filament around the article, and a plurality of pins that extend into and retract out of the path of the filament to form the knot. The operation is finished by cinching and cutting the loose filament so that the resulting knot is discrete and secure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,648,378 also describes an automatic knot-tying device for tying a discrete knot about an article, such as a bundle of wires. The device works by pulling a filament, such as the FAA-approved lace, transversely around the article. The device includes a hand-held housing and a knot-tying mechanism within that housing comprised of a plurality of carriage rings, for wrapping the filament around the article, at least one shuttle for moving the filament between the carriage rings and along the article at the appropriate steps, and a plurality of hooks for pulling the filament away from the article at the appropriate steps. The operation is finished by cinching, cutting, and reloading so that the resulting knot is discrete and secure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the devices described in these publications, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, generally work for their intended purpose, the following describes an improved knot tying device and cartridge system for providing tying filament thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Described hereinafter is an improved knot tying device and a cartridge system for providing tying filament thereto, such as, by way of example only and without limitation, a multi-stranded lace, a single-stranded lace, an FAA-approved lace, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, the knot tying device may include a pair of rings (which are preferably separable) that surround the article where each of the pair of rings has a continuous channel formed therein with the channels of each of the pair of rings being located opposed to one another, a shuttle attachable to the filament (which assembly may include a filament feeding mechanism as well as a gripping mechanism) where the shuttle is caused to be moved during a knot tying process between and within the channels of each of the pair of rings and thereby around and along a length of the article, for example by use of selectively activated electromagnets, and at least one hook for pulling the filament away from the article at appropriate times during the knot tying process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The knot-tying mechanism may alternatively include a shuttle adapted to releasably grasp the filament, wherein the shuttle moves in a circular path on a single knot forming plane and a device for pulling the filament away from the article at appropriate times during a knot tying process and for rotating the filament to thereby form loops through which the shuttle carrying the filament is passed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The cartridge preferably has a housing that is sized and arranged to be releasably attached to the knot tying device. The housing has an opening through which pre-cut or loosely coupled lengths of the filament can be drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">While the foregoing provides a general description of the subject device and system, a better understanding of the objects, advantages, features, properties and relationships of the subject device and system will be obtained from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings which set forth illustrative embodiments and which are indicative of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In many industries, both military and commercial, such as the aircraft, automotive, and appliance industries, wire bundles, or harnesses, are used extensively in the manufacturing processes of various products. Each bundle, or harness, generally comprises two or more wires that are customarily tied together at various points along their lengths to help ensure safety and durability, as well as a generally clean design. The subject knot tying device and cartridge system for providing tying filament thereto, particularly FAA and/or military approved lace, function to allow an operator to tie required knots around such articles.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to the Figures, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-13</figref> is an exemplary knot tying device <b>10</b>. Preferably, the knot tying device <b>10</b> is incorporated into a housing (not illustrated for the sake of clarity) and is sized and configured to allow the device to be hand carried and operated. As will become apparent, the knot tying device <b>10</b> is usable to tie a filament <b>12</b> about an article <b>14</b> to be tied, such as a wire bundle. The filament <b>12</b> is supplied to the knot tying device <b>10</b> from a user replaceable spool <b>16</b> which is mountable to the device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or, in a further embodiment, the filament <b>12</b> can be supplied to the knot tying device <b>10</b> from a user replaceable cartridge <b>18</b> which is also mountable to the device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and described in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For tying a knot around the article <b>14</b>, the knot tying device <b>10</b> includes a filament carrying shuttle assembly <b>20</b> (to which is fed filament <b>12</b> from the filament delivery device <b>16</b>/<b>18</b> that is being utilized), a pair of oppositely facing, i.e., left and right, ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> between which the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> is moved while carrying the filament <b>12</b>, and a looping hook assembly <b>26</b> which functions to pull the filament <b>12</b> during operation away from the article <b>14</b> to thereby provide openings through which the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> will pass to thereby create knots&#x2014;such as illustrated by way of example only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A-14L</figref>. The shuttle assembly may itself include a feeding mechanism to assist in moving the filament <b>12</b> to a gripping mechanism which is used by the shuttle assembly to carry the filament <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For moving the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> around the exterior surface of the article <b>14</b> and between the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, i.e., across the article <b>14</b>, and, more particularly, to move the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> between and within channels <b>28</b> that are formed in the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (which channels <b>28</b> preferably have a depth such that, when the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> is within a channel of one of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> will be clear of the channel of the other of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>&#x2014;which channel depth may be at least sufficient to ensure that the shuttle will not be allowed to fall out of the channel), each of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is provided with an associated plurality of electromagnet coils which, when selectively activated, function to attract (or repel) and thereby direct the movement of the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> as desired to perform the knot tying steps. The electromagnetic coils may be embedded within the channels of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, may be positioned adjacent to an exterior, backside surface of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, or the like without limitation. As will be appreciated, the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> is thus preferably constructed with a ferrous material (possibly even with a magnetic material) to allow the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> to be drawn to (or repelled from) one or more of the plurality of electromagnetic coils that is currently being activated. While not required, the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are preferably constructed from a non-ferrous material. In any event, the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are preferably constructed from a durable material that will present minimal friction as the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> is being drawn between and within the channels <b>28</b> of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. As will further be appreciated, the knot tying device <b>10</b> will include a processor and associated instructions for selectively activating the plurality of electromagnetic coils in a given sequence to thereby cause the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> to be moved around the article <b>14</b> as desired to form a given knot. The processor and associated instructions may also be used to control other mechanisms, such as motors, actuators, solenoids, etc, of the knot tying device <b>14</b> as will be readily appreciated. Accordingly, the knot tying device <b>10</b> may be provided with electrical power, such as from a battery, wall outlet, etc., to provide power to the processor, any motors, actuators, solenoids, etc. In certain circumstances, it will also be appreciated that other power sources, such as pneumatic power, could be used to drive any moveable/driven parts described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a yet further embodiment, for moving the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> around the exterior surface of the article <b>14</b> and between the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, one or more electromagnets <b>60</b> (which would be selectively activatable as needed to move the shuttle assembly) may be mounted on a further driven plate <b>62</b>, such as a gear, that is positioned adjacent to the exterior backside of each of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. As will be appreciated, the driven plate <b>62</b>, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, may be controlled to rotate about the article <b>14</b> to thereby cause the electromagnet(s) <b>60</b> to rotate about the article <b>14</b> which electromagnet(s) <b>60</b>, when selectively activated, will cause the shuttle assembly to be moved within and between the stationary ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. In addition, to allow for the feeding of the article into the device, the driven plate <b>62</b> may include an opening such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, which may be separable in the manner of the ring assemblies, or the like without limitation. Yet further, the driven plate <b>62</b> may carry one or more counter weights <b>64</b> as necessary to balance the driven plate <b>62</b> during rotation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For allowing the article <b>14</b> to be placed into the knot tying device <b>10</b>, the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be made so as to be separable. By way of example only, the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may comprise a lower half and an upper half wherein the upper half is moveable relative to the lower half to thereby create a space in which the article <b>14</b> may be inserted. To this end, the back ends of the upper half of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be pivotally connected <b>30</b> to the device housing (with, in this example, the lower half of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> being fixed to the device housing) with a motor or the like driven linkage <b>32</b>&#x2014;which may be trigger operated&#x2014;being further coupled the upper half of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> where the driven linkage <b>32</b> is moveable to cause the upper half of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to be opened and closed relative to the lower half of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. While this describes one manner for opening and closing the ring assemblies, i.e., to create a separation between the ring assembly halves, it will be appreciated that alternatives may be utilized, such as causing the lower half of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to be moveable with the upper half of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> being fixed, by causing both halves of the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to be moveable, and the like. Once the article <b>14</b> has been placed within the knot tying device <b>10</b>, e.g., the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> have been opened to create a space into which the article <b>14</b> is positioned, a driven clamping assembly <b>34</b> can be lowered onto the article <b>14</b> to thereby clamp the article into position within the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For tensioning the filament <b>12</b> during the knot tying process, a driven tensioning mechanism <b>36</b> is provided. In the illustrative example, the tensioning mechanism <b>36</b> comprises an arm <b>38</b> that is pivotally attached to the housing and a hook <b>40</b> that is rotatably attached to the arm <b>38</b>. During the knot tying operation, the arm <b>38</b> of the tensioning mechanism <b>36</b> may be driven so as to be lowered into an area between the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> whereupon the hook <b>40</b> can be driven so as to rotate and hook around the filament <b>12</b> as the filament <b>12</b> spans between the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the tensioning mechanism <b>36</b> may be driven so as to be lowered into an area between the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and the hook driven to rotate with the filament <b>12</b> being then passed over the hook. After the filament <b>12</b> is hooked in either of these manners, the arm <b>38</b> can be driven so as to be raised to thereby provide tension to the filament <b>12</b>. As the knot tying operation proceeds, a spring, induced motor torque, or the like associated with the tensioning mechanism <b>36</b> will function to maintain the tension on the filament <b>12</b>. After the knot tying operation is completed, the arm <b>38</b> can be driven back into the area between the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (if necessary) and the hook <b>40</b> driven to rotate to thereby release or unhook the filament <b>12</b> from the tensioning mechanism <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It will also be appreciated that the tensioning mechanism can be moved tangentially to the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to provide tension to the filament <b>12</b>. In preferred embodiments, the tension the device applies to the filament used to bundle the wires can be user definable.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Like the tensioning mechanism, the looping hook assembly <b>26</b> comprises at least one hook <b>42</b> that is to be driven into and out of the area between the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to hook and release/unhook the filament <b>12</b> as necessary to create space in which the shuttle assembly <b>20</b>, while carrying filament <b>12</b>, may pass to thereby create the desired knot. In addition, the looping hook assembly <b>26</b> may be desired to be tangentially moveable with respect to the ring assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. For this purpose, the hook <b>42</b> may be mounted to a driven rack and pinion assembly as particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. The hook <b>42</b> may also be driven to rotate to further provide for the hooking of and releasing/unhooking of the filament <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For cutting the filament <b>12</b> after a knot has been tied around the article <b>14</b> by the knot tying device <b>10</b>, a trimming mechanism <b>44</b> is provided. By way of example only, the trimming mechanism <b>44</b> comprises a fixed blade and a moveable blade between which the filament <b>12</b> is positioned. To thereby cut the filament <b>12</b>, the moveable blade is driven to be moved relative to the fixed blade whereupon the two blades will close upon the filament <b>12</b>. In the exemplary trimming mechanism illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the moveable blade is driven to be moved through use of a rack and pinion assembly. As will be appreciated, other assemblies/mechanisms for moving the moveable blade and/or trimming the filament <b>12</b> could be employed without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For feeding the filament <b>12</b> to the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> whereupon a mechanism associated with the shuttle assembly will function to grasp the filament <b>12</b>, a feed assembly <b>46</b> is provided. In an exemplary embodiment, the feed assembly <b>46</b> comprises a pair of driven rollers. It will be appreciated that other mechanisms capable of performing this function could also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As noted above, in a further embodiment of the knot tying device <b>10</b>, a cartridge <b>18</b>, comprising an enclosed housing and an opening through which filament is to be drawn, can be used as the supply of tying filament. In this regard, the cartridge <b>18</b> can be removeably insertable into the knot tying device <b>10</b>, for example by being snap-fit, slid-fit, post-mounted, or the like to the device housing, and can, as desired, include pre-determined lengths of filament <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the pre-determined lengths of filament can be loosely coupled together such that, once the first filament length is drawn into the knot tying device <b>10</b> and used to tie a knot, additional filament lengths will be continually drawn into the knot tying device <b>10</b>, i.e., they will follow a previously drawn filament length, until the supply of knot tying filament lengths is exhausted. Such loose coupling of the ends of filament lengths can be accomplished through the use of adhesives, scoring of an overall length of filament, providing a perforated leader between filament lengths, or the like without limitation. In such an embodiment, the filament lengths can be placed within the cartridge in a fanned or stacked relation, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. While not required, a spring mechanism or the like can be provided to bias the filament lengths towards, in the illustrated example, the bottom of the cartridge at which is located the opening from which the filament lengths are to be drawn. It is desirable that such cartridges <b>18</b> be refillable. It will also be appreciated that such filament lengths could be provided on a spool <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a further embodiment, the filament lengths are pre-cut (which may include leaders) and are intended to be removed from the cartridge <b>18</b> one at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For moving the filament lengths from the cartridge <b>18</b> to the shuttle assembly <b>20</b>, e.g., the first filament length in the case of loosely coupled filament lengths or each filament length in the case of pre-cut filament lengths, a feeding assembly <b>50</b> is provided. In the illustrated example, the feeding assembly <b>50</b> comprises a driven element <b>52</b> which is adapted to grasp an end of an exposed filament length, i.e., accessible through the opening <b>54</b> in the cartridge <b>18</b>, whereupon the driven element <b>52</b> is driven to carry the grasped filament length to the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> for collection thereby. For this purpose, the driven element <b>52</b> may be carried on a rack and pinion assembly as illustrated. It will be understood, however, that other mechanisms can be used to move the driven element <b>52</b> from the cartridge <b>18</b> to the shuttle assembly <b>20</b> without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It will additionally be appreciated that, should the filament <b>12</b> have pre-cut or loosely coupled lengths, a trimming mechanism may not be required.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a further exemplary knot tying device is illustrated. Generally, the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> includes a filament carrying shuttle <b>2600</b> which is caused to be moved in a circular path around a wire bundle <b>2602</b> and at least one device <b>2604</b> (of which two are illustrated) for releasably pulling the filament away from the wire bundle <b>2602</b> at appropriate times during the knot tying process and for rotating the filament to form loops through which the shuttle <b>2600</b> is passed during the knot typing process. During the knot tying process, the shuttle <b>2600</b> will move in the circular path in a single plane that is generally transverse to the wire bundle. Filament is fed to the shuttle <b>2600</b> by a filament supply device <b>2606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For moving the shuttle <b>2600</b> in either direction along the circular path, the shuttle <b>2600</b> is provided with a toothed outer surface which is adapted to be driven by correspondingly toothed drive gears <b>2608</b> as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. As the shuttle <b>2600</b> is caused to be moved by the drive gears <b>2608</b>, the shuttle is further supported by rollers <b>2610</b>. As will be appreciated, the number of drive gears <b>2608</b> and rollers <b>2610</b> can be varied as needed depending upon, for example, the size of the shuttle <b>2600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To drive the drive gears <b>2608</b>, and thereby cause the shuttle <b>2600</b> to be moved about the circular path, the drive gears <b>2608</b> may be mounted to a wobble plate <b>2612</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The wobble plate <b>2612</b> is caused to be wobbled by a driven gear <b>2616</b> and, the wobbling motion of the wobble plate <b>2612</b>, is transferred to the drive gears <b>2608</b> via an eccentric pin <b>2614</b> and an output shaft <b>2615</b>. More particularly, as the wobble plate <b>2612</b> wobbles, the eccentric pin <b>2614</b> is caused to rotate and the output shaft <b>2615</b>, coupled thereto, likewise rotates to drive a drive gear <b>2608</b> coupled thereto. The driven gear <b>2616</b> may be driven by a chain, belt, gears, or the like which would be coupled to a motor. Alternatively, the drive gears <b>2608</b> may be caused to rotate by being coupled directly to a motor without the use of the described wobble plate mechanism, such as by being driven by a chain, belt, gears, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For tying a knot around the wire bundle <b>2602</b>, the shuttle <b>2600</b> is caused to be moved over a hook <b>2618</b> or hooks of the device <b>2604</b> whereupon the device <b>2604</b> (and hook <b>2618</b>) is caused to be retracted, i.e., moved away from the wire bundle <b>2602</b>, to thereby form a loop as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. To this end, the device <b>2604</b> is mounted to a support <b>2620</b> which is adapted to move laterally with respect to the wire bundle <b>2602</b> and to rotate. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21D</figref>, the support <b>2620</b> is particularly rotated to thereby orient the loop at an angle with respect to the circular path traveled by the shuttle <b>2600</b> to thereby allow the shuttle <b>2600</b> to pass through the loop and, accordingly, under the filament as held by the hook <b>2618</b>. The support <b>2620</b> can be rotated both clockwise and counter-clockwise to created loops through which the shuttle <b>2600</b> can pass by being moved in the clockwise and counter-clockwise direction, respectively. Once the shuttle <b>2600</b> has been moved through a loop, the hook <b>2618</b> can be moved to release the filament whereupon the filament may be tightened against the wire bundle <b>2602</b>, for example via further movement of the shuttle <b>2600</b>. To provide the hook <b>2618</b> with movement, the hook <b>2618</b> is pivotally mounted to a housing <b>2622</b>, which is carried by the support <b>2620</b>, within which is a positioned a reciprocating device used to pull or push the hook <b>2618</b> with respect to the housing <b>2622</b> to thereby move the hook <b>2618</b> between a filament latching position and a filament releasing position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For further controlling the position of the filament during the knot tying process, the system <b>2606</b> which is used to feed the filament to the shuttle <b>2600</b> is also rotatable in a plane that is generally transverse to the circular path of travel of the shuttle <b>2600</b>. More particularly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>, the system <b>2606</b> can be rotated in a first direction, e.g., towards the right as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, to thereby cause the filament to be applied to a right side of the area in which the knot is being formed and the system <b>2606</b> can be rotated in a second direction, e.g., towards the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, to thereby cause the filament to be applied to the left side of the area in which the knot is being formed. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a positioning pin <b>2626</b> may be provided for engaging with a knot being formed when the filament is being tightened to thereby prevent the knot from being moved from the knot tying location as, for example, the shuttle <b>2600</b> is being moved to tighten the filament about the wire bundle <b>2602</b>. Preferably, the positioning pin <b>2626</b> is arranged on a moveable device such that the pin <b>2626</b> can be retracted or otherwise moved out of engagement with the filament during such times as the device is being used to form the knot or otherwise wrap the wire bundle <b>2602</b>. The positioning pin <b>2626</b> is additionally preferably arranged to provide a force upon the knot in a direction that is generally tangential to the wire bundle <b>2602</b> at the point of the knot.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">To insert and remove the wire bundle <b>2602</b> from the device <b>10</b>&#x2032;, the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; is provided with an opening. To facilitate the movement of the shuttle <b>2600</b> in the circular path during the knot tying process, the opening is preferably closed (wholly or partially) by a moveable gate <b>2628</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>. The moveable gate <b>2628</b> may therefore include further drive gears <b>2630</b> and a support structure <b>2632</b> (which may be rollers, a surface, or the like) for moving and supporting the shuttle <b>2600</b> through the moveable gate <b>2628</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the moveable gate <b>2628</b> has an integrated drive train to drive the drive gears <b>2630</b> which drive train may be coupled to the same devices that function to drive the driven gears <b>2616</b>. As will be appreciated, a further drive mechanism would be provided to move the moveable gate <b>2628</b> into and out of position relative to the opening of the device <b>10</b>&#x2032;. In a further embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the moveable gate <b>2628</b> need not be provided as the shuttle <b>2600</b> is sized to span the gap created by the opening of the device <b>10</b>&#x2032;. Specifically, in such an embodiment the shuttle <b>2600</b> would have a length that ensures that, when the shuttle <b>2600</b> spans the gap created by the opening of the device <b>10</b>&#x2032;, the shuttle <b>2600</b> will be engaged with at least one of the drive gears <b>2608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To maintain a wire bundle <b>2602</b> in proper position when inserted into the device <b>10</b>&#x2032;, the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; may additionally include a bundle securing device <b>2630</b>. The bundle securing device <b>2630</b> includes a retractable arm <b>2632</b> having disposed on one end thereof a bundle engaging portion <b>2634</b>. The retractable arm <b>2632</b> may be driven, for example via use of a motor <b>2636</b> having an output shaft which carries a worm gear <b>2638</b> which, in turn, drives a toothed gear <b>2640</b> which engages with corresponding teeth formed on the retractable arm <b>2632</b>. The retractable arm <b>2632</b>, and accordingly the bundle engaging portion <b>2634</b>, may thus be driven into, or retracted from, a wire bundle <b>2620</b> via appropriate clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of the worm gear <b>2638</b> coupled to the output shaft of the motor <b>2636</b>. For retractable arm <b>2632</b> is preferably arcuately shaped, and thereby driven in an arc as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, to thereby allow the arcuately shaped, bundle engaging portion <b>2634</b> to secure and properly orient wire bundles <b>2620</b> of various sizes against a back wall <b>2642</b> of the housing, which is also arcuately shaped, in the vicinity of the device <b>2604</b>, i.e., a location in the vicinity of where the knot is to be formed. Because the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; may accept wire bundles <b>2602</b> of various sizes, the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be equipped with a further device that functions to stop rotation of the <b>2636</b> (or to allow slippage of the arm <b>2632</b> against the driving force of the motor <b>2636</b>) when the retractable arm <b>2632</b> securely presses a wire bundle <b>2602</b> against the back wall <b>2642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For more accurately feeding the filament to the shuttle <b>2600</b>, the feeding device <b>2606</b> is arranged to be retractable into and away from the shuttle <b>2600</b>. To this end, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the feeding device <b>2606</b> may be provided with a motor <b>2644</b> and associated drive mechanism <b>2646</b> for drive the feeding device <b>2606</b> towards and away from the shuttle <b>2600</b>. In addition, to more accurately feed the filament to the shuttle <b>2600</b>, upon arriving at the shuttle <b>2600</b> the forward end of the feeding device <b>2606</b> will function to separate biased gripping elements <b>2648</b> of the shuttle device <b>2600</b> to position the filament between the gripping elements <b>2648</b> whereby, upon the feeding device <b>2606</b> being retracted, the gripping elements <b>2648</b> will close upon the fed filament and grasp the filament for movement via movement of the shuttle <b>2600</b>. The gripping elements <b>2648</b> may be pivotally mounted to the shuttle <b>2600</b> and may be biased to close upon each other via use of spring or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As will be appreciated, movement of the various moveable elements of the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be controlled via a controller having associated instructions and, by the controller, the elements of the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be moved in various different manners to cause the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; to tie various different types of knots around wire bundles <b>2602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described previously, the device may also carrying a disposable spool or cartridge <b>2650</b> which carries a length of filament for tying knots around one or more wire bundles <b>2602</b>. Such an exemplary device <b>20</b>&#x2032; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. In addition, the device <b>10</b>&#x2032;, which may be handheld, may include a shoe horn type arm <b>2652</b> for use in guiding a wire bundle <b>2602</b> into the opening of the device <b>10</b>&#x2032; as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">While specific embodiments of the subject invention have been described in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of this disclosure. For example, it is to be appreciated that the programming can allow for the control of the elements to thereby tie one of multiple different types of knots, which type of knot to be tied may be user selectable. Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the invention which is to be given the full breadth of the appended claims and any equivalents thereof.</p>
