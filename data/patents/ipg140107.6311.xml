<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the field of data processing systems. More particularly, this invention relates to the control of security mechanisms, such as, for example, malware scanners, internet firewalls, email scanners etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Security threats to data processing systems are becoming increasingly common and increasingly potentially damaging. Accordingly, it is known to provide one or more security mechanisms for carrying out security actions within data processing systems. Examples of such security mechanisms are malware scanners, email scanners, internet firewalls and the like. To at least some extent these security mechanisms are reactive in the sense that as new security threats emerge these security mechanisms require configuration changes or updates in order to deal with the new security threats. As an example, when a new computer virus is discovered, this may be of a type which is not identified and can evade the existing computer virus scanners. These computer virus scanners need updating with an additional computer virus signature for the newly released computer virus before they can identify and counteract that new computer virus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A trend within the field of security threats to data processing systems is that such threats to data processing systems can propagate and become serious at an increasingly rapid rate. As an example, computer virus writers may try to specifically design their computer viruses to spread rapidly such that they can cause significant damage before the providers of computer virus scanning programs can react and develop the appropriate necessary updated computer virus signature files and the data processing systems users download and install those new computer virus signatures. A modern mass mailer computer virus may propagate at such a rate that a significant and damaging world-wide outbreak of a computer virus can arise within a matter of a few tens of minutes after the computer virus is first released.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is known to provide alert messaging to users in the form of emails to inform them of newly arising computer security threats. As an example, a computer virus scanner provider may provide a service for registered users whereby, if they so wish, they will receive notification emails when the computer virus scanner provider becomes aware of a new computer virus outbreak. The user upon reading this email notification can then decide what security measures they wish to take for their own system to deal with the newly arising threat.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A problem with the existing alerting mechanisms is that they require the user to open, read and act upon the alerting email message. This takes a finite amount of time that may be too long to forestall a damaging security breach. Furthermore, computer virus writers are aware of the issue of security counter measure response times and tend to release their computer viruses at times of day when they believe a large number of users will be out of office hours such that security counter measures will not be taken until the following day by which time significant damage will have been caused. Computer viruses may be released during the night-time of the target victim users or perhaps at the start of a holiday weekend for the target victim users.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Viewed from one aspect the present invention provides a computer program product for controlling computers to control at least one security mechanism of a data processing apparatus, said computer program product comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">link establishing code operable to establish an authenticated secure network communication link between said data processing apparatus and a remote alert message generating computer;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">alert message generating code operable to generate an alert message with said remote alert message generating computer;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">alert message transferring code operable to transfer said alert message from said remote alert message generating computer to said data processing apparatus via said authenticated secure network communication link; and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">triggering code operable to automatically trigger at least one security action by said at least one security mechanism of said data processing apparatus in response to said alert message as configured by user programmable response configuration parameters of said data processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present technique recognises the inadequacy in the current alert messaging techniques with respect to the increasing need for rapid countermeasures and addresses this problem by providing that the alert message itself automatically triggers security actions at the user's computer in accordance with a response configuration set up by the user. This arrangement is resistant to spoofing or hacking in that an authenticated secure communication link is used for passing the alert messages. Furthermore, the technique enables a rapid automatic security action response to be achieved when desired and yet provides user programmable response configuration parameters such that individual users can tailor the degree to which they wish to allow security actions to be automatically triggered. It may be that particular policies or configuration of a user mean that certain automated security actions are not wanted whereas others would be wanted.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Whilst it would be appreciated that the authenticated secure network communication link could take a variety of different forms, it is particularly convenient to use an internet link, such as a http protocol communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The authenticated secure network communication link could take a variety of different forms but preferably employs authentication by exchanging data using public and private key encryption. One or both parties to the communication may wish to authenticate the recipient before sending or receiving the alert message or acting upon the alert message.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The security mechanisms in which security actions may be automatically triggered can take a variety of different forms including a network malware scanner (malware including computer viruses, worms, Trojans, banned files, banned images, etc), an email scanner, a network internet firewall, a network security policy manager, a desktop interne firewall and a desktop malware scanner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be appreciated that the alert message may carry a data payload of a variety of different types. This data payload can be advantageously small since it generally represents control data rather than large data files, such as virus signature libraries. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the alert message can include one or more of a risk assessment level indicator, a date of issue of the alert message, a time of issue of the alert message, a name identifying a threat addressed by the alert message, a pointer to an internet location where additional information concerning the alert message may be found, a transport type associated with the alert message threat and configuration data permitting a temporary countermeasure to be established.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the case of an alert message including configuration data permitting temporary countermeasures to be established, the security action which may be automatically triggered includes automatically implementing the temporary countermeasure. This is highly advantageous in that, for example, when a new security threat arises out of office hours, an alert message including a suggested temporary countermeasure may be sent out to users and automatically trigger that temporary countermeasure to be put in place without the need for the user to be present or take any action themselves. One example might be a new internet access based attempt to gain unauthorised access to computer systems via an internet port. This threat could be temporarily counteracted by sending out an automated action that will trigger the internet firewall computer programs to block that communication port until a proper permanent countermeasure can be put in place.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In preferred embodiments of the invention, when the alert message includes a risk level indicator, then the programmable response configuration parameters can allow a user to specify what levels of risk would be allowed to automatically trigger different types of response. As an example, a security threat classified by the software provider as of a high risk in the alert message may be allowed to automatically trigger the installation of a temporary countermeasure and the downloading and updating of, for example, computer virus signature files. In contrast, an alert message which specifies a threat risk of low may be permitted only to trigger generation of an alerting notification to the user that such an alert message has been received. The user can then decide on their own whether to undertake farther security actions depending upon their perception of the degree of threat posed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Whilst it will be appreciated that this technique might be used between a single alert message generator and a single data processing system user, the technique is particularly useful when the alert messages are sent to a plurality of users as may be stored within a list of destination computers. In such an environment many software users can benefit from the rapid alert message generation and automatic security action triggering centrally provided by the software provider.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Whilst it will be appreciated that the current technique involves operations upon different computers, e.g. upon the alert message generation computer and the destination data processing system, aspects of the invention are also the individual computers within the overall system. It is quite possible that the alert message generating computer could be located in one country and the data processing systems upon which automatic triggering of security actions is required is in a different country.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A further aspect of the invention provides a method of controlling at least one security mechanism of a data processing apparatus, said method comprising the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">establishing an authenticated secure network communication link between said data processing apparatus and a remote alert message generating computer;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">generating an alert message with said remote alert message generating computer;</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">transferring said alert message from said remote alert message generating computer to said data processing apparatus via said authenticated secure network communication link; and</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">automatically triggering at least one security action by said at least one security mechanism of said data processing apparatus in response to said alert message as configured by user programmable response configuration parameters of said data processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A still further aspect of the invention provides apparatus for controlling at least one security mechanism of a data processing apparatus, said apparatus comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">link establishing logic operable to establish an authenticated secure network communication link between said data processing apparatus and a remote alert message generating computer;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">alert message generating logic operable to generate an alert message with said remote alert message generating computer;</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">alert message transferring logic operable to transfer said alert message from said remote alert message generating computer to said data processing apparatus via said authenticated secure network communication link; and</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">triggering logic operable to automatically trigger at least one security action by said at least one security mechanism of said data processing apparatus in response to said alert message as configured by user programmable response configuration parameters of said data processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The above, and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a service provider's server computer <b>2</b> coupled via the internet <b>4</b> to a user's data processing system <b>6</b>. The service provider can provide a variety of different security mechanisms which may be implemented by the data processing system user. As an example, if the data processing system <b>6</b> includes a file server <b>8</b>, a firewall server <b>10</b>, an email server <b>12</b> and a plurality of client computers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, then the file server <b>8</b> includes a malware scanner <b>16</b> and a network security policy manager (such as for example ePolicy Manager as produced by Networks Associates Inc). The firewall server <b>10</b> include a network internet firewall computer program <b>20</b>, the email server <b>12</b> includes an email scanner computer program <b>22</b> and the client computers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> include desktop malware scanners <b>24</b> and desktop internet firewall computer programs <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The software provider will typically employ staff who continuously monitor for the emergence of new security threats such that countermeasures may be rapidly provided to their customers. The security threats could take a variety of different forms and may be applicable to one or more than one of their different security mechanism products <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. The service provider's server <b>2</b> has access to a subscriber list database <b>28</b> which includes internet addresses to which a http protocol data transfer may be made to carry an alert message produced when a new security threat is identified. Customers may pay a fee to be on the subscriber list <b>28</b> and receive such alert messages, or alternatively such alert messages may be provided free to all registered users, or other arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates a computer program thread which may be operating on the alert message generating computer (service provider's server <b>2</b>). At step <b>30</b>, the system waits until a new threat is identified by the service provider. It will be appreciated that this step will in practice be performed by a human who receives a customer report of some unusual activity or a suspicious file submission or the like. Step <b>30</b> may be considered as the person initiating the alert message generating operation. At step <b>32</b> the alert message is generated. As previously mentioned, the alert message will typically be composed of information identified by a security analyst who will classify the security threat and suggest a temporary countermeasure as well as other actions. Parts of the alert message may be automatically formed, such as the date and time of the alert message. The authentication signing of the alert message is automated as part of step <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step <b>34</b> the first destination computer to which the alert message is to be sent is selected from the subscriber list <b>28</b>. At step <b>36</b> an authenticated secure communication link is established with the destination computer by an exchange of PGP signed messages. This exchange may be one directional or two directional. As an example, the destination computer may wish to authenticate that the alert message is from the genuine service provider, but it may be less important for the service provider to authenticate that the message is being sent to an authenticated destination computer. It is however important that the authenticated secure communication link is resistant to spoofing as this automated triggering of security actions should itself be resistant to being used as a security vulnerability. If the authentication at step <b>36</b> fails, then processing proceeds to step <b>38</b> If the authentication at step <b>36</b> succeeds, then processing proceeds to step <b>40</b> at which the alert message is sent to the destination computer. The alert message may be encrypted as well as being signed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At step <b>38</b> a determination is made as to whether or not the alert message has yet been attempted to be sent to the last destination computer within the subscriber list <b>28</b>. If this test indicates that there are further destination computers to which the alert message is to be sent, then processing proceeds to step <b>42</b> at which the next destination computer is selected before processing returns to step <b>36</b>. If the last destination computer has been subject to an attempt to send the alert message, then the thread terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram schematically illustrating a computer program thread executing on a destination computer to automatically respond to alert messages. At step <b>44</b> the system monitors for an attempt to establish an authenticated secure communication from the service provider's server <b>2</b>. This may involve listening at a particular internet port for data originating from a particular source.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When such an attempt to establish an authenticated secure communication link is detected, processing proceeds to step <b>46</b> at which the communication link attempt is authenticated by an exchange of PGP signed messages as previously discussed. If this authentication fails, then processing of the thread terminates. If the authentication succeeds, then processing proceeds to step <b>48</b> at which the alert message from the service provider's server <b>2</b> is received. When the alert message has been received it is decrypted and read.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>50</b> the local response configuration parameters applicable to the read alert message are themselves read for the destination computer concerned. These local response configuration parameters are user programmable. As an example, when this automatically triggered security action mechanism is first installed on the destination computer, the user may be prompted to specify which risk assessment levels they wish to permit to automatically trigger countermeasure actions, which to trigger software updates, which to trigger administrator notifications etc. The appropriate configuration parameters for the alert message risk level and security mechanism concerned are read at step <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>52</b> the security action specified by the alert message in accordance with the local response configuration parameters is automatically triggered. This security action may be, for example, blocking of emails with a certain title using the email scanner <b>22</b>, blocking of internet access to particular internet ports with the network internet firewall <b>20</b> or the desktop internet firewall <b>26</b>, quarantining or other triggered action in response to detection of a particular file by the network malware scanner <b>16</b> or the desktop malware scanner <b>24</b> or a change in a networkwide security parameter such as applying malware scanning to a new file type by the security policy manager <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the example contents of an alert message. It will be appreciated that this is only one example and a variety of different data may be contained within the alert message. The data illustrated includes a risk assessment level, a date of the alert message, a time of the alert message, a threat name of the security threat addressed by the alert message, a URL specifying where further information regarding the threat may be found, data specifying the transport type for the threat, e.g. email, internet, file transfer etc, and a content filter which can be considered to specify a temporary countermeasure that may be applied. The content filter in the case of an email scanner could be an email title. The content filter in the case of a security action within the security manager would be data encoding an action to be automatically triggered by the security manager <b>18</b> if permitted by the user's configuration rather than a content filter as understood in the context of an email scanner. The countermeasure specified in the content filter varies depending upon the security mechanism to which it is directed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates response configuration parameters which may be user programmable at the destination computer. In this example, for each risk assessment level the configuration parameters specify which of a plurality of different automatically triggered actions are to be permitted if specified by an alerting message. In the example illustrated, it will be seen for risk assessment levels indicative of a high degree of threat more of the automatically triggered actions are permitted compared with risk assessment levels indicative of a low level of risk. The response configuration parameters allow different computer users to tailor how they will respond to the alert messages.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates a general purpose computer <b>200</b> of the type that may be used to implement the above described techniques. The general purpose computer <b>200</b> includes a central processing unit <b>202</b>, a random access memory <b>204</b>, a read only memory <b>206</b>, a network interface card <b>208</b>, a hard disk drive <b>210</b>, a display driver <b>212</b> and monitor <b>214</b> and a user input/output circuit <b>216</b> with a keyboard <b>218</b> and mouse <b>220</b> all connected via a common bus <b>222</b>. In operation the central processing unit <b>202</b> will execute computer program instructions that may be stored in one or more of the random access memory <b>204</b>, the read only memory <b>206</b> and the hard disk drive <b>210</b> or dynamically downloaded via the network interface card <b>208</b>. The results of the processing performed may be displayed to a user via the display driver <b>212</b> and the monitor <b>214</b>. User inputs for controlling the operation of the general purpose computer <b>200</b> may be received via the user input output circuit <b>216</b> from the keyboard <b>218</b> or the mouse <b>220</b>. It will be appreciated that the computer program could be written in a variety of different computer languages. The computer program may be stored and distributed on a recording medium or dynamically downloaded to the general purpose computer <b>200</b>. When operating under control of an appropriate computer program, the general purpose computer <b>200</b> can perform the above described techniques and can be considered to form an apparatus for performing the above described technique. The architecture of the general purpose computer <b>200</b> could vary considerably and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is only one example.</p>
