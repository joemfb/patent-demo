<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 2009-32584, filed on Apr. 15, 2009 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of supplying power, a power supply apparatus for performing the method and a display apparatus having the apparatus. More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of supplying power for reducing power loss, a power supply apparatus for performing the method and a display apparatus having the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid crystal display apparatus may include a display panel, which displays images using the light transmittance of liquid crystal molecules, and a backlight assembly disposed under the display panel to provide the display panel with light.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The display panel may include an array substrate, a color filter substrate and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the array substrate and the color filter. The array substrate may include a plurality of pixel electrodes and a plurality of thin-film transistors (TFTs) electrically connected to the pixel electrodes. The color filter substrate may include a common electrode and a plurality of color filters.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal layer, the arrangement direction of the liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal layer is changed so that the light transmittance is changed. For example, when the light transmittance is increased to a maximum value, the display panel realizes a white image having a high luminance. However, when the light transmittance is decreased to a minimum value, the display panel realizes a black image having a low luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The backlight assembly may include an inverter. The inverter converts a direct current (DC) voltage into an alternating current (AC) voltage. The DC voltage is applied to the backlight assembly according to a brightness control voltage from an external device. An inverter controller included in the inverter turns on a light source by providing the light source with the converted AC voltage and controls the brightness of the light source. The DC voltage may be provided from a power supply apparatus included in the display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The power supply apparatus receives an AC voltage from an external AC input part to provide the DC voltage to the inverter and the display panel. However, a power factor at an input part receiving the AC voltage decreases when the power supply apparatus converts the AC voltage to the DC voltage by using a capacitor input type rectifier. Additionally, power loss is caused by switching operations of switching elements in the power supply apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there is a need for a method of supplying power to improve a power factor and reduce power loss, a power supply apparatus for performing the method, and a display apparatus having the power supply apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a method of supplying power. The method includes rectifying an input voltage received from an external device, transforming a first voltage across a first primary coil and a second primary coil into a second voltage across a secondary coil isolated from the primary coils, the first voltage based on the rectified input voltage, providing a feedback current from the secondary coil to the primary coils, using a series resonance to convert the second voltage to an output voltage, and outputting the output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a power supply apparatus. The power supply apparatus includes an alternating current to direct current (AC-DC) rectifier, a transformer, a feedback inductor, a resonance unit, and a primary switch and an auxiliary switch. The AC-DC rectifier rectifies an input voltage received from an external device. The transformer includes a primary coil having a first primary coil and a second primary coil, and a secondary coil isolated from the primary coil.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a display apparatus. The display apparatus includes a display panel, a panel driving unit, a backlight unit and a power supply apparatus. The power supply apparatus includes an alternating current to direct current (AC-DC) rectifier, a transformer, a power factor correction unit, a resonance unit and an active clamp unit. The AC-DC rectifier rectifies an input voltage received from an external device. The transformer includes a primary coil having a first primary coil and a second primary coil, and a secondary coil isolated from the primary coil. The transformer transforms a first voltage of the primary coil into a second voltage of the secondary coil in a transformation ratio. The power factor correction unit includes a feedback inductor which increases or decreases a feedback current linearly by controlling the transformation ratio, based on a voltage applied to the first primary coil and the rectified input voltage. The resonance unit outputs an output voltage by rectifying the second voltage provided from the secondary coil. The active clamp unit adjusts the level of the first voltage based on a duty ratio, which is adjusted in accordance with the output voltage.</p>
