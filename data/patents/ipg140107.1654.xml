No. 6,908,387, entitled &#x201c;PLAYER TRACKING COMMUNICATION MECHANISMS IN A GAMING MACHINE,&#x201d; filed Aug. 3, 2001, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to game playing methods for gaming machines such as video slot machines and video poker machines. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for providing player tracking services on a gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are a wide variety of associated devices that can be connected to a gaming machine such as a slot machine or video poker machine. Some examples of these devices are player tracking units, lights, ticket printers, card readers, speakers, bill validators, ticket readers, coin acceptors, display panels, key pads, coin hoppers and button pads. Many of these devices are built into the gaming machine or components associated with the gaming machine such as a top box which usually sits on top of the gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, utilizing a master gaming controller, the gaming machine controls various combinations of devices that allow a player to play a game on the gaming machine and also encourage game play on the gaming machine. For example, a game played on a gaming machine usually requires a player to input money or indicia of credit into the gaming machine, indicate a wager amount, and initiate a game play. These steps require the gaming machine to control input devices, including bill validators and coin acceptors, to accept money into the gaming machine and recognize user inputs from devices, including touch screens and button pads, to determine the wager amount and initiate game play.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After game play has been initiated, the gaming machine determines a game outcome, presents the game outcome to the player and may dispense an award of some type depending on the outcome of the game. A game outcome presentation may utilize many different visual and audio components such as flashing lights, music, sounds and graphics. The visual and audio components of the game outcome presentation may be used to draw a players attention to various game features and to heighten the players interest in additional game play. Maintaining a game player's interest in game play, such as on a gaming machine or during other gaming activities, is an important consideration for an operator of a gaming establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One related method of gaining and maintaining a game player's interest in game play are player tracking programs which are offered at various casinos. Player tracking programs provide rewards to players that typically correspond to the player's level of patronage (e.g., to the player's playing frequency and/or total amount of game plays at a given casino). Player tracking rewards may be free meals, free lodging and/or free entertainment. These rewards may help to sustain a game player's interest in additional game play during a visit to a gaming establishment and may entice a player to visit a gaming establishment to partake in various gaming activities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, player tracking programs may be applied to any game of chance offered at a gaming establishment. In particular, player tracking programs are very popular with players of mechanical slot gaming machines and video slot gaming machines. In a gaming machine, a player tracking program is implemented using a player tracking unit installed in the gaming machine and in communication with a remote player tracking server. Player tracking units are usually manufactured as an after-market device separate from the gaming machine. Many different companies manufacture player tracking units as part of player tracking/accounting systems. These player tracking/accounting systems are used in most casinos. Most casinos utilize only one type of player tracking system (i.e. from one manufacturer) while the type of player tracking system varies from casino to casino.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An example of a hardware and/or software implementation of a player tracking system with respect to a number of gaming machines is described as follows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a number of gaming machines with player tracking units connected to servers providing player tracking services. In casino <b>150</b>, gaming machines <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> are connected, via the data collection unit (DCU) <b>106</b> to the player tracking/accounting server <b>120</b>. The DCU <b>106</b>, which may be connected to up to 32 player tracking units as part of a local network in a particular example, consolidates the information gathered from player tracking units in gaming machines <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> and forwards the information to the player tracking account server <b>120</b>. The player tracking account server is designed 1) to store player tracking account information, such as information regarding a player's previous game play, and 2) to calculate player tracking points based on a player's game play that may be used as basis for providing rewards to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In gaming machine <b>100</b> of casino <b>150</b>, a player tracking unit <b>107</b> and slot machine interface board (SMIB) <b>105</b> are mounted within a main cabinet <b>8</b> of the gaming machine. A top box <b>6</b> is mounted on top of the main cabinet <b>8</b> of the gaming machine. In many types of gaming machines, the player tracking unit is mounted within the top box <b>6</b>. Usually, player tracking units, such as <b>107</b>, and SMIBs, such as <b>105</b>, are manufactured as separate units before installation into a gaming machine, such as <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The player tracking unit <b>107</b> includes three player tracking devices, a card reader <b>24</b>, a key pad <b>22</b>, and a display <b>16</b>, all mounted within the unit. The player tracking devices are used to input player tracking information that is needed to implement the player tracking program. The player tracking devices may be mounted in many different arrangements depending upon design constraints such as accessibility to the player, packaging constraints of a gaming machine and a configuration of a gaming machine. For instance, the player tracking devices may be mounted flush with a vertical surface in an upright gaming machine and may be mounted flush or at a slight angle upward with a horizontal in a flat top gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The player tracking unit <b>107</b> communicates with the player tracking server via the SMIB <b>105</b>, a main communication board <b>110</b> and the data collection unit <b>106</b>. The SMIB <b>105</b> allows the player tracking unit <b>107</b> to gather information from the gaming machine <b>100</b> such as an amount a player has wagered during a game play session. This information may be used by the player tracking server <b>120</b> to calculate player tracking points for the player. The player tracking unit <b>107</b> is usually connected to the master gaming controller <b>104</b> via a serial connection using a wire serial connector and communicates with the master gaming controller <b>104</b> using a serial communication protocol. The serial connection between the SMIB <b>105</b> and the master gaming controller <b>104</b> may be through the main communication board <b>110</b>, through another intermediate device or through a direct connection to the master gaming controller <b>104</b>. In general, communication between the various gaming devices is provided using wire connectors with proprietary communication protocols. As an example of a proprietary serial communication protocol, the master gaming controller <b>104</b> may employ a subset of the Slot Accounting System (SAS protocol) developed by International Game Technology of Reno, Nev. to communicate with the player tracking unit <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Typically, when a game player wants to play a game on a gaming machine and utilize the player tracking services available through the player tracking unit, a game player inserts a player tracking card, such as a magnetic striped card, into the card reader <b>24</b>. After the magnetic striped card has been so inserted, the player tracking unit <b>107</b> may detect this event and receive certain identification information contained on the card. For example, a player's name, address, and player tracking account number encoded on the magnetic striped card, may be received by the player tracking unit <b>107</b>. In general, a player must provide identification information of some type to utilize player tracking services available on a gaming machine. For current player tracking programs, the most common approach for providing identification information is to issue a magnetic-striped card storing the necessary identification information to each player that wishes to participate in a given player tracking program.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">After a player has inserted her or his player tracking card into the card reader <b>24</b>, the player tracking unit <b>107</b> may command the display <b>16</b> to display the game player's name on the display <b>16</b> and also, may optionally display a message requesting the game player to validate their identity by entering an identification code using the key pad <b>22</b>. Once the game player's identity has been validated, the player tracking information is relayed to the player tracking server <b>120</b>. Typically, the player tracking server <b>120</b> stores player tracking account records including the number of player tracking points previously accumulated by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">During game play on the gaming machine, the player tracking unit <b>107</b> may poll the master gaming controller <b>104</b> for game play information such as how much money the player has wagered on each game, the time when each game was initiated and the location of the gaming machine. The game play information is sent by the player tracking unit <b>107</b> to the player tracking server <b>120</b>. While a player tracking card is inserted in the card reader <b>24</b>, the player tracking server <b>120</b> may use the game play information provided by the player tracking unit <b>107</b> to generate player tracking points and add the points to a player tracking account identified by the player tracking card. The player tracking points generated by the player tracking server <b>120</b> are stored in a memory of some type on the player tracking server.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As suggested above, a player's incentive for using the player tracking services is awards provided by the gaming machine operator (e.g., the casino). Some incentives of a casino for providing player tracking services is to generate &#x201c;brand&#x201d; loyalty, gather valuable information that may be used for marketing and provide better customer services. Unfortunately, when player tracking identification information is not provided to the player tracking server <b>120</b> via the player tracking unit <b>107</b>, player tracking points are not accrued for a game player participating in a game play session on gaming machine <b>100</b>. For example, when a player tracking card is not inserted into the card reader <b>24</b>, the player tracking card has been inserted incorrectly or the card reader is malfunctioning, or the game player does not have a player tracking card, a game player may not obtain player tracking points while participating in game play on gaming machine <b>100</b>. This happens more frequently than one might imagine and may be discouraging to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Player tracking cards and player tracking programs are becoming more and more popular. They have become a de facto marketing method of doing business at casinos. The programs allow a casino to identify and reward customers based upon their previous game play history. In particular, a goal of the casinos is to identify and then to provide a higher level of service to certain groups of players identified as especially valuable to the casinos. For instance, players that visit the casino, on average, once a week may be deemed as &#x201c;special&#x201d; customers and the casino may desire to cultivate a &#x201c;special&#x201d; relationship with these customers. As indicated, a disadvantage of current player tracking programs using player tracking cards is that a game player may simply forget to bring her card, forget to insert it into the gaming machine, insert the card incorrectly into the card reader or not may not have a card. In each of these cases, the player will fail to earn player tracking points and the player is deprived of awards that would otherwise be provided. Further, the casino is deprived of valuable marketing information and is unable to provide loyalty incentives. In addition, the casino is unable to cultivate a special relationship with the player because their playing attributes remain unknown. Thus, in view of the above, it would be desirable to provide apparatus and methods for player tracking programs that allow both casinos and players to avoid and correct errors resulting from incorrect use of a player tracking system and that allow a casino to better serve &#x201c;special&#x201d; players.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a front diagram for a housing or chassis <b>200</b> enclosing a number of interface peripherals which may be used as player tracking interface devices, for one embodiment of the present invention. The front plate <b>230</b> is covered with a decorative skin <b>265</b> with a silk-screen logo <b>266</b>. In addition to the player tracking interface devices described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the player tracking housing <b>200</b> includes a wireless interface <b>264</b>, a camera <b>262</b> and a finger-print reader with platen <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The display <b>215</b> is a color LCD. Other display technologies such as organic electro-luminescent devices may be used with the display <b>215</b>. A portion of the LCD <b>215</b> may be used at times to visually convey gaming information as described in regards to light <b>216</b>. For instance, a border region <b>261</b> around the perimeter of the display may flash green to indicate a player has requested a drink. In this embodiment, the light <b>216</b> surrounds a top portion of the display <b>215</b> and parts of the side of display <b>215</b>. In another embodiment, the light <b>216</b> may be located across the top portion of the display <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The camera <b>262</b> may be used for security purposes, promotional purposes and to enter biometric information. For instance, the camera <b>262</b> may deter tampering with a player tracking unit or gaming machine. As another example, a picture of a player may be recorded when they win a jackpot and used for a promotion. As another example, the camera may be used with feature recognition software to identify the player. Similarly, the finger-print reader <b>260</b> may be used to read a player's fingerprint which is used to determine their identity. As another example, the microphone <b>207</b> may be used with voice recognition software to recognize a player's voice for player authentication purposes. Thus, a voice signal input into the microphone <b>207</b> may be compared with a stored voice print to identify the player. In some embodiments, biometric input devices may be used to supplement information read from a card inserted in the card reader or to even replace the card reader <b>225</b>. A description of a finger print reader as an identification device is provided in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/172,787, filed Oct. 14, 1998, by Wells, et al., entitled &#x201c;Gaming Device Identification method and Apparatus,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein in its entirety and for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The wireless interface <b>264</b> may be used to communicate with a portable wireless device worn or carried by a player, a casino service representative or maintenance technician. For example, rather than inserting a card into the card reader <b>225</b>, a player may wear or simply carry a wireless communication device that may be about the size of a player tracking card. When the player is near the machine, a wireless interface device <b>264</b> and the wireless device worn by the player may automatically detect each other establish communications allowing gaming information to be transferred between the wireless devices.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As example, the wireless interface device <b>264</b> may use a wireless communication standard such as Bluetooth&#x2122; to communicate with portable wireless devices using this standard although other wireless communication protocols such as IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11x (e.g. other IEE802.11 standards), hiperlan/2, and HomeRF may also be used. Bluetooth devices communicate on a frequency of 2.45 Gigahertz. Typically, Bluetooth devices send out signals in the range of 1 milliwatt. The signal strength limits the range of the devices to about 10 meters and also limits potential interference sources. Interference is also limited by using spread-spectrum frequency hopping. For instance, a device may use 79 or more randomly chosen frequencies within a designated range that change on a regular basis up to 1,600 times a second. Thus, even if interference occurs, it is likely only to occur for a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When Bluetooth-capable devices come within range of one another, an electronic conversation takes place to determine whether they have data share or whether one needs to control the other. The connection process is performed automatically. Once a conversation between the devices has occurred, the devices form a network. Bluetooth systems create a Personal-Area Networks (PAN) or &#x201c;piconets&#x201d;. While the two or more devices in a piconet remain in range of one another, the distances between the communications devices may vary as the wireless devices are moved about. Once a piconet is established, such as between the wireless interface device <b>264</b> and a portable wireless device, the members of the piconet randomly hop frequencies in unison so they remain in touch with another and avoid other piconets that may be operating in proximity to the established piconet. When Bluetooth is applied in a casino environment, many such piconets may be operating simultaneously. Details of the Bluetooth&#x2122; standard and the Bluetooth&#x2122; special interest group may be found at www.bluetooth.com.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment of the present invention, the microphone <b>207</b> and speaker <b>209</b> may be used to input gaming information and aurally communicate gaming information. For instance, the microphone <b>207</b> may be used with voice recognition software executed by: a) a logic device on the player tracking unit or b) a master gaming controller in a gaming machine, may be used recognize verbal requests for gaming services. For instance, the player may request a drink by saying &#x201c;order me a drink&#x201d; into the microphone <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The speaker <b>209</b> may be used to aurally communicate gaming information to the player or someone else using the gaming machine. For instance, when a card has been inserted incorrectly in the card reader <b>225</b>. A message, such as &#x201c;card not inserted correctly,&#x201d; may be projected from the speaker. Simultaneously, although not required, the light <b>216</b> may flash red to draw the players attention. Voice messages from the speaker <b>209</b> may be projected in different languages. For example, for a Japanese speaking game player messages may be in Japanese, for a Spanish speaking game player the messages may be in Spanish while for an English speaking player the messages may be in English. The language preferred by the player may be stored as player tracking information on a player tracking card or the player may be able to specify their language using one of the input devices on the player tracking unit. The player tracking information on the player tracking card may be based on a user profile previously established by the player which may be used to select the language used by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In general, the same game information may be communication visually, aurally or both visually and aurally. Further, one type of game information may be communicated only aurally while another type of game information may be communicated only visually. For visual communication of game information, combinations of illumination devices in the light <b>216</b>, the light <b>211</b> and the back-lit key pad buttons (e.g. <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> and <b>223</b>) may be illuminated in different color and light patterns that may vary with time and may last for only a specific duration. For instance, when the gaming machine has been idle for a specific period time some of the lights (e.g. <b>216</b> or <b>211</b>) on the housing <b>200</b> may flash in a pattern for a specific amount of time at specific intervals to attract a player's attention. As another example, an error condition detected in the player tracking unit may result in visual response which remains on until the error condition is cleared by an operator. For aural communication of game information, various sounds and verbal message may be projected from a sound projection device such as the speaker <b>209</b>. These sounds or messages may vary with time and may last for a specific duration of time.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The player tracking housing <b>200</b> may be installed in a gaming machine. In response to a game event or bonus game event generated from the game played on the gaming machine, the illumination devices may be illuminated and/or a sound may be projected from the sound projection device. The game event or bonus game event may also be generated from a game played on one or more gaming machines in communication with the gaming machine where the player tracking housing <b>200</b> is mounted such as gaming machines connected together around a gaming carousel. In addition, the game event may be generated from a remote gaming device such as player tracking server connected to the gaming machine. For example, all players playing a group of gaming machines (e.g. 25 cent denomination machines) in communication with the remote gaming device may be awarded free credits, free airline miles, or another prize. As another example, in response to a signal generated from a proximity sensor on the player tracking unit, such as an infrared device or a Bluetooth device that is activated when a person is in front of the gaming machine, the illumination devices may be illuminated and/or a sound may be projected from the sound projection device to attract a player's attention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In particular embodiments, to indicate a status of a card inserted in the card reader <b>225</b>, the one or more of the illumination devices may illuminated and/or a sound, such as a voice message, may be projected from the sound projection device. The card status may be an invalid card, an abandoned card or an incorrectly inserted card. In addition, the one or more illumination devices may be illuminated and/or a sound may be projected from the sound projection device to indicate 1) a special status of a player, 2) to indicate an amount of credits (e.g., 51, 105, 205, etc.), a range of credits (e.g. 0-100, 101-200, 201-300, etc.) or a level (e.g. 1000 points=level 1, 5000 points=level 2 and win a free jacket, 15,000=level 3 and win a free trip; points may be player tracking points or some other point system) earned by the player during a game play session on the gaming machine, 3) to indicate a service request by the player such as a drink request, 4) to indicate a status of a gaming device located on the gaming machine such as a hopper, a drop door or a printer, 5) a status one or more of the player tracking interface devices located on said player tracking unit, 6) a jackpot is pending and requires a &#x201c;hand&#x201d; payout, 7) an error condition has been detected on the gaming machine or the player tracking unit and 8) a special promotion is being offered at a gaming establishment where the player tracking unit is installed. The special promotion may be a live video broadcast, dinner shows, gifts as well as other goods and services. Many different types of gaming information may be visually or aurally communicated using the present invention and is not limited to the examples provided above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a player tracking unit <b>300</b> of the present invention connected to a master gaming controller <b>104</b> on a gaming machine and a player tracking server <b>120</b>. The player tracking unit <b>300</b> includes a logic device <b>310</b> enclosed in a logic device housing and a number of player tracking interface devices including a card reader <b>225</b>, a display <b>215</b>, a key pad <b>220</b>, a light panel <b>216</b>, a microphone <b>207</b>, a speaker <b>209</b>, a wireless interface and other player tracking interface devices <b>356</b> enclosed in a device housing <b>311</b>. The logic device <b>310</b> for the player tracking unit and the player tracking interface devices may be enclosed in a single housing (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>) or separate housings.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The logic device <b>310</b> may include a processor for executing software allowing the player tracking unit to perform various player tracking functions such as communicating with the player tracking server <b>120</b>, communicating with the master gaming controller <b>104</b> or operating the various peripheral devices such as the card reader <b>225</b>, the display <b>215</b>, the key pad <b>220</b> and the light panel <b>216</b>. For instance, the logic device <b>310</b> may send messages containing player tracking information to the display <b>215</b>. As another example, the logic device <b>310</b> may send commands to the light panel <b>216</b> to display a particular light pattern and to the speaker <b>209</b> to project a sound to visually and aurally convey game information. The logic device <b>310</b> may utilize a microprocessor and/or microcontrollers. For instance, the light panel <b>216</b> may include a microcontroller that converts signals from the processor <b>302</b> to voltage levels for one or more illumination devices. In one embodiment, application software for the player tracking unit <b>300</b> and configuration information for the player tracking unit may be stored in a memory device such as an EPROM <b>308</b>, a non-volatile memory, hard drive or a flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The player tracking unit may include a memory <b>316</b> configured to store: 1) player tracking software <b>314</b> such as data collection software, 2) player tracking communication protocols (e.g. <b>320</b>) allowing the player tracking unit <b>300</b> to communicate with different types of player tracking servers, 3) device drivers for many types of player tracking interface devices (e.g. <b>330</b>), 4) voice recognition software for receiving voice commands from the microphone <b>207</b>, <b>5</b>) a secondary memory storage device such as a non-volatile memory device, configured to store gaming software related information (The gaming software related information and memory may be used in a game download process or other software download process.), and 6) communication transport protocols (e.g. <b>340</b>) such as TCP/IP, USB, Firewire, IEEE1394, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11x (e.g. other IEEE 802.11 standards), hiperlan/2, and HomeRF allowing the player tracking unit to communicate with devices using these protocols or communication protocols allowing the logic device to communicate with different types of master gaming controllers (e.g. master gaming controllers using different types of communication protocols), such as <b>104</b>. Typically, the master gaming controller, such as <b>104</b>, communicates using a serial communication protocol. A few examples of serial communication protocols that may be used to communicate with the master gaming controller include but are not limited to USB, RS-232 and Netplex (a proprietary protocol developed by IGT, Reno, Nev.).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A plurality of device drivers may be stored in memory <b>316</b> for each type of player tracking device. For example, device drivers for five different types of card readers, six different types of displays and 8 different types of key pads may be stored in the memory <b>316</b>. When one type of a particular peripheral device is exchanged for another type of the particular device, a new device driver may be loaded from the memory <b>316</b> by the processor <b>302</b> to allow communication with the device. For instance, one type of card reader in the player tracking unit <b>300</b> may be replaced with a second type of card reader where device drivers for both card readers are stored in the memory <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the software units stored in the memory <b>316</b> may be upgraded as needed. For instance, when the memory <b>316</b> is a hard drive, new device drivers or new communication protocols may be uploaded to the memory from the master gaming controller <b>104</b>, the player tracking server <b>120</b> or from some other external device. As another example, when the memory <b>316</b> is a CD/DVD drive containing a CD/DVD designed or configured to store the player tracking software <b>314</b>, the device drivers and other communication protocols, the software stored in the memory may be upgraded by replacing a first CD/DVD with a second CD/DVD. In yet another example, when the memory <b>316</b> uses one or more flash memory units designed or configured to store the player tracking software <b>314</b>, the device drivers and other communication protocols, the software stored in the flash memory units may be upgraded by replacing one or more flash memory units with new flash memory units storing the upgraded software. In another embodiment, one or more of the memory devices, such as the hard-drive, may be employed in a game software or player tracking software download process from a remote software server.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment of the present invention, a minimal set of player tracking software applications <b>314</b>, communication protocols <b>340</b>, player tracking communication protocols and device drivers may be stored on in the memory <b>316</b>. For instance, an operating system, a communication protocol allowing the player tracking unit <b>300</b> to communicate with a remote server such as the player tracking server <b>120</b> and one or more common player tracking applications may be stored in memory <b>316</b>. When the player tracking unit is powered-up, the player tracking unit <b>300</b> may contact a remote server <b>120</b> and download specific player tracking software from the remote software. The downloaded software may include but is not limited to one or more particular player tracking applications that are supported by the remote server, particular device drivers, player tracking software upgrades, and a particular communication protocol supported by the remote server.

In addition, the logic device <b>310</b> may be configured to allow the master gaming controller <b>104</b> to send instructions to the player tracking interface devices via the logic device <b>310</b>. As an example, after a card has been inserted into the card reader <b>225</b>, the processor logic <b>310</b> may determine that the card is for a gaming application controlled by the master gaming controller <b>204</b> and send a message to the master gaming controller <b>104</b> indicating a card has been inserted into the card reader. In response, to the message from the logic device, the master gaming controller <b>104</b> may send a series of commands to the player tracking interface devices such as a &#x201c;read card&#x201d; instruction to the card reader <b>225</b>, a flash light pattern &#x201c;A&#x201d; command to the light panel <b>216</b>, and a &#x201c;display message&#x201d; instruction to the display <b>215</b> via the logic device <b>310</b>. The instructions from the master gaming controller <b>104</b> to the player tracking interface devices may be obtained from gaming application software executed by the master gaming controller <b>104</b>. The gaming application software may or may not be related to player tracking services.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The player tracking unit <b>300</b> may include one or more standard peripheral communication connections (not shown). The logic device <b>310</b> may be designed or configured to communicate with the master gaming controller <b>104</b> and the player tracking interface devices using a standard peripheral connection, such as an USB connector, and using a standard communication protocol, such as USB. The USB standard allows for a number of standard USB connectors that may be used with the present invention. The player tracking unit <b>300</b> may contain a hub connected to the peripheral communication connection and containing a plurality of peripheral communication connections. Details of using a standard peripheral communication connection are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,014, issued Jun. 26, 2001, by Stockdale, et al., entitled, &#x201c;STANDARD PERIPHERAL COMMUNICATION,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein in its entirety and for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, more details of using a player tracking system in the context of game play on a gaming machine are described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a video gaming machine <b>2</b> of the present invention is shown. Machine <b>2</b> includes a main cabinet <b>4</b>, which generally surrounds the machine interior (not shown) and is viewable by users. The main cabinet includes a main door <b>8</b> on the front of the machine, which opens to provide access to the interior of the machine. Attached to the main door are player-input switches or buttons <b>32</b>, a coin acceptor <b>28</b>, and a bill validator <b>30</b>, a coin tray <b>38</b>, and a belly glass <b>40</b>. Viewable through the main door is a video display monitor <b>34</b> and an information panel <b>36</b>. The display monitor <b>34</b> will typically be a cathode ray tube, high resolution flat-panel LCD, or other conventional electronically controlled video monitor. The information panel <b>36</b> may be a back-lit, silk screened glass panel with lettering to indicate general game information including, for example, the number of coins played. The bill validator <b>30</b>, player-input switches <b>32</b>, video display monitor <b>34</b>, and information panel are devices used to play a game on the game machine <b>2</b>. The devices are controlled by circuitry (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) housed inside the main cabinet <b>4</b> of the machine <b>2</b>. Many possible games, including traditional slot games, video slot games, video poker, video black jack, video keno, video pachinko, lottery games and other games of chance as well as bonus games may be provided with gaming machines of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The gaming machine <b>2</b> includes a top box <b>6</b>, which sits on top of the main cabinet <b>4</b>. The top box <b>6</b> houses a number of devices, which may be used to add features to a game being played on the gaming machine <b>2</b>, including speakers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, a ticket printer <b>18</b> which may print bar-coded tickets <b>20</b> used as cashless instruments. The player tracking unit mounted within the top box <b>6</b> includes a key pad <b>22</b> for entering player tracking information, a florescent display <b>16</b> for displaying player tracking information, a card reader <b>24</b> for entering a magnetic striped card containing player tracking information, a microphone <b>43</b> for inputting voice data, a speaker <b>42</b> for projecting sounds and a light panel <b>44</b> for display various light patterns used to convey gaming information. A player playing a game on the gaming machine <b>2</b> or a person near the gaming machine may view the light patterns from the light panel <b>216</b>. In other embodiments, the player tracking unit and associated player tracking interface devices, such as <b>16</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, may be mounted within the main cabinet <b>4</b> of the gaming machine, on top of the gaming machine, or on the side of the main cabinet of the gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Understand that gaming machine <b>2</b> is but one example from a wide range of gaming machine designs on which the present invention may be implemented. For example, not all suitable gaming machines have top boxes or player tracking features. Further, some gaming machines have two or more game displays&#x2014;mechanical and/or video. And, some gaming machines are designed for bar tables and have displays that face upwards. Still further, some machines may be designed entirely for cashless systems. Such machines may not include such features as bill validators, coin acceptors and coin trays. Instead, they may have only ticket readers, card readers and ticket dispensers. Those of skill in the art will understand that the present invention, as described below, can be deployed on most any gaming machine now available or hereafter developed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Returning to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when a user wishes to play the gaming machine <b>2</b>, he or she inserts cash through the coin acceptor <b>28</b> or bill validator <b>30</b>. In addition, the player may use a cashless instrument of some type to register credits on the gaming machine <b>2</b>. For example, the bill validator <b>30</b> may accept a printed ticket voucher, including <b>20</b>, as an indicia of credit. As another example, the card reader <b>24</b> may accept a debit card or a smart card containing cash or credit information that may be used to register credits on the gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Prior to beginning a game play session on the gaming machine <b>2</b>, a player may insert a player tracking card into the card reader <b>24</b> to initiate a player tracking session. In some embodiments, after inserting their card, the player may be visually prompted on the display screen <b>16</b> or aurally prompted using the speaker to enter identification information such as a PIN code using the key pad <b>22</b>. Typically, the player tracking card may remain in the card reader <b>24</b> during the game play session. As another example, the gaming machine may transfer player tracking information from portable wireless device worn by the player via a wireless interface device (not shown) on the gaming machine <b>2</b>. An advantage of using a portable wireless device is that the transfer of player tracking information is automatic and the player does not have to remember to correctly insert a player tracking card into the gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In a player tracking session on the gaming machine, features of the player's game play during a game play session on the gaming machine, such as an amount wagered during the game play session, may be converted to player tracking points and stored in the player's player tracking account on a player tracking server. Later, accumulated player tracking points may be redeemed for rewards or &#x201c;comps&#x201d; for the player such as free meals or free rooms. Usually, the player tracking card inserted into the card reader contains at least player tracking account information. When the card is inserted correctly into the card reader <b>24</b>, the information stored on the card, such as the player's account information, may be read by the card reader and transferred by a logic device on the player tracking unit (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to the player tracking server. The player tracking account information allows the player tracking server to store player tracking points accumulated during the game play session to the appropriate account. When player tracking information is not provided by the player, for instance, when the player tracking card has been inserted incorrectly into the card reader <b>24</b>, player tracking points are not accumulated.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">During the course of a game, a player may be required to make a number of decisions, which affect the outcome of the game. For example, a player may vary his or her wager on a particular game, select a prize for a particular game, or make game decisions which affect the outcome of a particular game. The player may make these choices using the player-input switches <b>32</b>, the video display screen <b>34</b> or using some other device which enables a player to input information into the gaming machine. Certain player choices may be captured by player tracking software loaded in a memory inside of the gaming machine. For example, the rate at which a player plays a game or the amount a player bets on each game may be captured by the player tracking software.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">During certain game events, the gaming machine <b>2</b> may display visual and auditory effects that can be perceived by the player. These effects add to the excitement of a game, which makes a player more likely to continue playing. Auditory effects include various sounds that are projected by the speakers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Visual effects include flashing lights, strobing lights or other patterns displayed from lights on the gaming machine <b>2</b>, from lights behind the belly glass <b>40</b> or the light panel on the player tracking unit <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">After the player has completed a game, the player may receive game tokens from the coin tray <b>38</b> or the ticket <b>20</b> from the printer <b>18</b>, which may be used for further games or to redeem a prize. Further, the player may receive a ticket <b>20</b> for food, merchandise, or games from the printer <b>18</b>. The type of ticket <b>20</b> may be related to past game playing recorded by the player tracking software within the gaming machine <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, these tickets may be used by a game player to obtain game services. In addition, when the player has inserted a player tracking card in the card reader to initiate a player tracking session, to prevent the player from leaving or &#x201c;abandoning&#x201d; their card in the card reader <b>24</b>, a voice message, such as &#x201c;please remove your card,&#x201d; may be projected from the sound projection device <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of a number of gaming machines each with a player tracking unit connected in a player tracking system where the player tracking units utilize light panels and wireless interface devices to communicate gaming information. Four gaming machines <b>600</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> each with a player tracking unit <b>200</b>, a light panel <b>216</b> and a wireless interface <b>264</b> are connected to the player tracking server <b>120</b> via the data collection unit <b>106</b>. As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the light panels <b>216</b> may be used to visually communicate gaming information to an interested parties, such as a game player, a casino service representative, or a maintenance technician. The wireless interface devices <b>264</b> may be used to communicate gaming information to a portable wireless devices carried by different individuals such as game players, casino service representatives or a maintenance technician. As described above, wireless communication standard such as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11a, IEEE802.11b, IEEE802.11x (e.g. other IEEE802.11 standards such as IEEE802.11c, IEEE802.11d, IEEE802.11e, etc.), hiperlan/2, and HomeRF, may be used to provide communications between the wireless interface device <b>264</b> and a portable wireless interface device.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The portable wireless devices carried by different individuals may be designed or configured to selectively establish communications with the player tracking units <b>200</b> broadcasting various messages via the wireless interfaces <b>264</b>. For instance, a service wireless interface device <b>606</b> may be designed or configured to only establish communications with a player tracking unit when the unit is broadcasting a maintenance request message. Thus, when the service wireless interface device <b>606</b> receives another type of message, such as a message indicating a player has requested a drink, the device will ignore the message and not establish communications with the player tracking unit broadcasting that message. In another example, the host wireless interface device <b>604</b> may only establish communications with one of the player tracking units <b>200</b> when the player tracking unit has determined that a game player with &#x201c;special&#x201d; status is at their machine and then, sent a message indicating the status of the player to the host wireless interface device <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment, a maintenance technician may carry a portable wireless interface device <b>606</b> used for service of a player tracking unit or a gaming machine. A light panel <b>216</b> on gaming machine <b>602</b> may display a message such as a flashing red light indicating the gaming machine or the player tracking unit requires service. The maintenance technician may see the flashing red light and approach the machine. As the maintenance technician approaches the gaming machine <b>602</b> carrying the service wireless interface device <b>606</b>, in response to a maintenance request message broadcast via wireless interface <b>264</b> on gaming machine <b>602</b>, the service wireless interface device may establish wireless communications with the gaming machine <b>602</b>. In one embodiment, the service wireless interface device may be a personal digital assistant. The service wireless interface device may also receive broadcast messages from gaming machines <b>600</b>, <b>601</b> and <b>603</b>. However, unless these other gaming machines are also broadcasting a maintenance request message, the service wireless interface device <b>606</b> will not establish communications with these gaming machines. After establishing communications with gaming machine <b>602</b>, the service wireless interface device <b>606</b> may receive information regarding the nature of the maintenance service request. For instance, an interface such as a display screen on the device <b>606</b> may display a message indicating a hopper needs to filled, a ticket tray needs to be filled or a gaming device is operating incorrectly. Based upon the information displayed on the wireless interface device <b>606</b>, the maintenance technician may take an appropriate action such as filling the hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In another embodiment, a casino service representative may wear portable wireless device, such as a watch with colored lights. The colored lights on the watch may be used to indicate the status of the player. For example, using a portable wireless interface device <b>602</b>, the player may have established a player tracking session on gaming machine <b>600</b>. When the casino service representative is within range of the wireless interface device <b>264</b> on gaming machine <b>600</b>, such as walking by the player playing a game on a gaming machine, a light on their watch may flash green to indicate the player is a special customer. The light mechanism on their watch may be activated in response to gaming information received from the wireless interface device <b>264</b>. The rate of flashing may increase as the casino service representative approaches the player so that the casino service representative can select the correct player if a number of players are playing nearby. The gaming information included in a message broadcast from gaming machine <b>600</b> may also indicate a location of the player such as a machine number where they are playing. Thus, a message may be displayed on a visual interface on the watch, such as &#x201c;go to machine <b>600</b>.&#x201d; The casino service representative may then offer the special customer one or more services according to their &#x201c;status&#x201d; as determined by the casino.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another example, a portable wireless device carried by the casino service representative may include an audio interface of some type such as an ear-piece inserted in their ear. When the casino service representative is within range of the wireless interface device <b>264</b>, the representative may hear message in response to gaming information received from the wireless interface <b>264</b>, such as, &#x201c;Jane Doe at gaming machine <b>600</b> is a special customer and likes drink A.&#x201d; The casino service representative may then respond to the message by asking the player if they would like a drink such as &#x201c;drink A&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">An advantage of using a wireless interface to communicate gaming information, such as a player's status, to a casino service representative, over using a signaling means such as a light on the player tracking unit is that individuals other than casino personnel are less likely to be able to determines the player's status. When anyone can easily discern the signaling means used to indicate the player's status, it may draw undesired attention to the player. For instance, an easily discernable signaling means may increase the special player's chances of becoming a theft target.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart of a method for visually providing gaining information on a gaming machine. In <b>700</b>, an input signal relating to a game event is received by a logic device on the player tracking unit. The input signal may be from but is not limited a gaming machine, a player tracking server, an external device such as a portable wireless device and one or more player tracking interface devices located on the player tracking unit. The input signal may contain gaming information specifying a type of event. For instance, the message the input signal may contain information indicating a player tracking card has been inserted incorrectly. In <b>705</b>, the player tracking unit may determine a visual and/or aural response to the game event. One response to the game event may be no response. The visual response may be a light pattern to be implemented on one or more illumination devices located on the player tracking unit, such as adjacent to the display. An aural response may be sound or a voice message that will be projected from a sound projection device located on the player tracking unit. A duration of the visual response or aural response may be determined. The visual response and aural response may be repeated for a fixed duration of time. For example, an illumination device may be flashed for 10 seconds or an illumination device may remain illuminated in until an error condition is cleared.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In <b>710</b>, one or more illumination devices, such as illumination devices adjacent to a display, near a card reader, behind a back-lit key pad and combinations thereof, may be illuminated to convey a visual response to the game event. Also, a sound may be projected from a sound projection device, such as speaker, to convey an aural response to the game event. In <b>715</b>, in response to a second event, such as the duration of the visual response or aural response ending or an error condition being cleared, the visual response or aural response is terminated. For instance, a player may insert a player tracking card incorrectly and receive a visual response or aural response from the player tracking unit. Then, the player may remove the card and then the visual response or aural response to the incorrectly inserted card may be terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram of a player tracking network of the present invention.

For instance, the controller module <b>1001</b> may receive regular updates of available entertainment selections from one or more remote servers via the network interface modules <b>1004</b> and the host proxy module <b>1003</b> and may update the menus that may be displayed on the unit. In one embodiment, a player may be able to customize their video and audio selection menus. For example, the player may be able to select favorite sports teams, favorite TV shows, favorite music selections or favorite music categories. When a player registers at the player tracking unit (inputs identification information, the entertainment preference information for an individual player may be retrieved by the controller module <b>1001</b> from a remote server and used to generate custom entertainment selection menus for the player.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The controller module <b>1001</b> may control output entertainment menus using the user interface software <b>1005</b>. Via the user interface software <b>1005</b>, which may include logic for defining the hardware-software interface and logic for controlling various hardware devices, the controller module <b>1001</b> may be able to display the menus to a display on the player tracking unit and receive entertainment selections via one or more internal or external input devices, such as a touch screen or a hand-held remote as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">When the player tracking unit has received an input requesting an entertainment selection, the controller module may launch an second application that allows the entertainment selection to presented on the user interface, such as but not limited to a video player <b>1010</b>, an audio player <b>1012</b> and a web-browser <b>1014</b>. These applications may accept inputs from the user interface that are used to operate features of the application. For example, during playback, the video player may accept inputs for playing, forwarding, rewinding, pausing, stopping, increasing/decreasing the volume and slow motion of a video feature being played by the video player. The inputs may be generated from a remote input device, such a remote control or a local input device, such as input buttons on the player tracking unit or a touch screen on the display of the player tracking unit.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In yet another embodiment, the controller module <b>1001</b> may control promotion software <b>1022</b> that presents various promotional features on the user interface of the player tracking unit. The promotional features may utilize the multimedia capabilities of the player tracking unit, such as video and audio presentations via the user interface on the player tracking unit. The promotional features may include 1) attraction presentations to attract a player to the gaming machine, 2) advertising for various casino services, 3) promotional awards, such as a bonus award on a gaming machine, promotional credits for game play, and coupons for casino services, such as discounted or free food and entertainment.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The promotional activities presented on the player tracking unit may be selected based upon game play activity on the gaming machine. For instance, certain promotions may be offered to a player based on how long they have been playing on a particular machine, how much they have wagered and how much they have won. Further, the promotional activities may be selected for a particular user using demographic information obtained from the user, such as information input using a player tracking card.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The promotion and attraction presentations and a schedule for promotions/attraction may be regularly updated via downloads from a remote server. The promotion and attraction presentations may be updated to reflect different events throughout the year. For instance, during holiday periods, the graphics and sound used in the video and audio portions of advertising, attraction features or promotions presented on the player tracking unit may reflect holiday themes or seasonal themes, such as but not limited to leprechauns and clovers with Irish music around St. Patrick's day, patriotic symbols and music around 4<sup>th </sup>of July and Halloween symbols and music around Halloween.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In another embodiment, advertising, promotions and attraction features may be based upon player identification information for a player at the gaming machine. For example, a player may be offered a special promotion or a special attraction feature may be played for the player on the day of their birthday or around the time of their birthday. As another example, special promotions or special attraction features may be played for players that are considered highly valuable to the casino. As another example, if a picture is available of the player, the picture may be integrated into an attract feature tailored to the player. The player identification information may be obtained from the player via a loyalty program, such as player tracking club. When the player initiates a player tracking session on the gaming machine, identification information about the player can be obtained and used to tailor specific promotions and attract features to the player at the gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In another embodiment, a number of different gaming activities may be enabled via gaming software executed on the gaming machine. These gaming activities include but are not limited to: 1) a game of chance played on the player tracking unit, 2) a sports book for wagering on sporting events that may be viewed with the player tracking unit, 3) bonus games, 4) progressive games and 5) linked games including cooperative games and tournament games. The gaming applications on the player tracking may be independent of the gaming activity played on the host gaming machine or linked to the gaming activities on gaming machine. For instance, a bonus game played on the gaming machine may be triggered as a result of gaming events on the gaming machine, such as but not limited, an amount of money wagered on the gaming machine in a game play session or a bonus game may be triggered independently of game activity, such as at random.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The player tracking unit may be used to support linked game applications. For instance, during a tournament, a user may be able to view a status board for the participants playing in the tournament, such as leader board via the player tracking display or hear status information for the tournament. In a cooperative game, the user may be able to view or hear status information for the cooperative game via the player tracking interface. In one embodiment, in a cooperative game, a group of player's on different gaming machines may try to gather a number of items in a treasure hunt via game play on each of their respective host gaming machines. The progress of the group of player's, such as the number of items found for the group and items needed by the group may be displayed on the player tracking unit.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Peer-to-peer communication between different player tracking units may allow different groups of player tracking units to be linked and unlinked for cooperative or competitive game play. For instance, a user on one gaming machine may send out a message to a group of other gaming machines asking whether anyone wishes to join in a competitive or cooperative game or messages for cooperative or competitive linked games may be sent out regularly from a remote server. Once a group of player's has elected to join in a linked game, their gaming machines may be linked together via peer-to-peer communications between the player tracking units on the gaming machines. After the linked game is over, the player tracking units gaming machines may end the link allowing for different groups to form and break-up over time.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In another embodiment, the controller module <b>1001</b> may execute messaging software <b>1016</b> that allows messages to be sent from one player tracking unit to another player tracking unit. The messaging software may allow a user at a first gaming machine to request communications with another user at a second gaming machine via the player tracking units on each of the gaming machines. After, the messaging software <b>1016</b> may be able to determine whether the requested user is currently registered with another gaming machine on the player tracking network via the gaming machine's player tracking unit. For instance, in one embodiment, the messaging software may contact a remote server or router that tracks user activity on different gaming machines and can match a user to a particular player tracking unit. In another embodiment, the messaging software <b>1016</b> may broadcast a message to the other player tracking units connected to a local area network requesting communications with the requested user that may be registered at one of the player tracking units on the network.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">When the requested user is located at a second player tracking unit, the first player tracking unit requesting the communications may establish a peer-to-peer communication link with the second player tracking unit. Then, the users at the two player tracking units may communicate with one another directly. The messages may be in different formats such as text, voice, video and combinations thereof. The text, voice and video formats may utilize the multimedia capabilities of the player tracking unit including the multimedia board, display, microphone, sound projection devices and input devices. At the end of the communication session, the peer-to-peer link is terminated between the player tracking units. In the present invention, peer-to-peer message communications is not limited to communications between two player tracking units. Peer-to-peer message communications may be generated three or more player tracking units to allow &#x201c;conference&#x201d; type communications between different groups of player tracking units.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Peer-to-peer communications may also be used to allow groups of player tracking units to simultaneously present common multimedia functions. For instance, two or more players may wish to watch the same &#x201c;sporting event&#x201d; and send messages to each other about the game while they are playing the gaming machine. Using the peer-to-peer link on the player tracking unit, the communication link and the simultaneous broadcast of the sporting events may be coordinated between the player tracking units. In another embodiment, two or more players may desire to listen to the same music while they are playing the gaming machine and even trade musical selections. Using the peer-to-peer communication link, two or more player tracking units may be able to share musical (including music videos) and video selections for play on one or both of the player tracking units.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In yet another embodiment, peer-to-peer communications may be used to share contents between other player tracking units and gaming machines in the peer-to-peer network. For instance, when a first player tracking unit receives a request for a video program, the first player tracking unit may attempt to locate the requested program on a nearby player tracking unit. When a nearby player tracking unit has the requested program, the first player tracking unit may establish a peer-to-peer communication link the nearby player tracking unit and download the requested program from the nearby player tracking unit. The peer-to-peer transfer may provide a faster download then from a remote server and may lessen the bandwidth used on the local area network.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>1100</b> of registering a gaming machine using a player tracking unit of the present invention to one or more servers in communication with the player tracking unit. The registration process may be referred as auto-provisioning. In the present invention, the player tracking unit and the host gaming machine may be registered as a single entity or the player tracking unit and the host gaming machine may be registered as separate entities. When the player tracking unit is registered separately from the gaming machine, additional information identifying the player tracking unit may be sent to the local servers in <b>1130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In <b>1105</b>, the player tracking unit is powered-up and may perform a variety of self checks. Typically, the player tracking unit receives power from its host gaming machine. However, the power supply may be independent (unswitched) of the gaming machine power supply and the player tracking unit may remain with power even when the gaming machine power is off. The player tracking unit and the gaming machine may be powered-up at the same time. The gaming machine and the player tracking unit may be powered-up together for a number of reasons, such as after it has been moved, after maintenance, after a power-failure or hardware failure and during initial installation.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In <b>1110</b>, after the player tracking determines it is operating properly, it may establish a network connection, retrieve a date and a time data from a network time protocol server and set an internal clock on the player tracking unit (see description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) using the retrieved time and date. The date and the time provided by the network time protocol server may be used in the communication process between the player tracking unit and other network devices.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In <b>1115</b>, the player tracking controller on the player tracking unit may establish communications with the master gaming controller on its host gaming machine. In <b>1120</b>, again for communication purposes, the player tracking unit and the master gaming controller may synchronize clocks using the time and date retrieved from the network time protocol server. In <b>1125</b>, the player tracking unit may receive gaming machine identification information from the host gaming machine. The information transfer may be initiated by the gaming machine or the player tracking unit.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In <b>1130</b>, a registration message is sent to one or more local servers on the local area network that may communicate with the player tracking unit and/or the host gaming machine. The registration message may include but is not limited to 1) a request to register with the server for communication purposes. The registration message 1) a time and a date, 2) gaming machine identification information, 3) player tracking unit identification information and 4) a registration purpose (installation, power failure, machine movement, maintenance, etc). When the registration process has been initiated by an operator at the host gaming machine, the identification information may include operator identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Depending on the registration purpose, different information may be sent to the host server. For instance, for a power-failure, the time and date of the power-failure may be sent to the host server. For security, this information may be compared with other records maintained by the server. As another example, a machine has been moved, its new location and old location may be sent to the server and compared with records of a movement schedule and previous records for the location of the gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The communications between the player tracking unit and other devices on the network, such as during the registration process, may employ various security protocols and identification schemes including encryption to ensure secure and authenticated communications. Details of secure communication methods that may be employed with the present invention are described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/732,650, filed Dec. 7, 2000 and titled, &#x201c;Secure Virtual Networks in a Gaming Machine&#x201d; and co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/116,424, filed Apr. 3, 2002, titled, &#x201c;Secure Virtual Networks in a Gaming machine,&#x201d; each of which is incorporated herein in their entirety and for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In <b>1135</b>, the player tracking unit may receive a reply from each of the one or more local servers and determine its login status for the host gaming machine and/or the player tracking unit. In <b>1140</b>, when the gaming machine does not have authorization from a server, the player tracking may send a message to the gaming machine indicating that it does not have authorization and any possible reasons for the failure. The gaming machine may receive the information and attempt to perform self-diagnostics. When the registration process is being initiated by an operator, the gaming machine may display the reason for the failure to an operator. In response, the operator may attempt to remedy the problem and retry the registration process.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In <b>1145</b>, when the gaming machine and/or the player tracking unit has been authorized for communications with a particular server, the player tracking unit and/or the gaming machine may begin normal communications with the server that has approved device. In one embodiment, a registration server may be used to authorize communications between a plurality of servers and the player tracking unit requesting an authorized communication connection. For instance, the registration server may authorize communications between the player tracking unit and its host gaming machine with a player tracking/accounting server, a cashless system server and a progressive. As noted above, the registration process may be carried out with each server individually. The authorization server may also be used to track communication requests between different devices, such as for peer-to-peer communications between different player tracking units and authorize peer-to-peer communications on the network.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In another embodiment, a single registration server, such as a floor control server, may be used as a player tracking unit registration site for all of the player tracking units in the player tracking system. Application servers, such as, a cashless system server, a gaming software server and a player tracking accounting server, may also register with the registration server. Thus, the registration server may act as a central registration agency and route messages to appropriate applications provided by the application servers. An advantage of this approach is that a new server providing a new application or an old server providing a new application may be added to the system without requiring all of the player tracking units to register with the server supplying the new application. Instead, the server with the new application may only have to register with the registration server and then the registration server will route messages for communications between the player tracking units and the newly registered application.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>1200</b> of shutdown procedure (un-register) for a gaming machine with a player tracking unit of the present invention. In the shutdown procedure, the gaming machine and player tracking unit are disconnected from one or more servers in communication with the player tracking unit. In a gaming machine without a player tracking unit but with a network connection, this procedure may be implemented by the master gaming controller on the gaming machine. The shutdown procedure may be initiated for a number of reasons, such as but not limited to, prior to moving the gaming machine or bringing down the gaming machine power for maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In <b>1205</b>, authorization information, such as identification information, is input into the gaming machine and received by the player tracking unit. The identification information may be for the person and/or the device requesting the shutdown. The authorization information may be input via an interface on the gaming machine or an interface on the player tracking unit. When the identification information is input via an interface on the gaming machine, the gaming machine may transmit the identification information to the player tracking unit. After receiving the identification information, the player tracking unit may send a message to a remote server with the identification message requesting authorization to begin a shutdown of the gaming machine. In <b>1210</b>, the player tracking unit receives a reply message in regards to the shutdown request. The player tracking unit or master gaming controller may check the message to determine whether the requested shutdown has been approved.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In <b>1210</b>, when the requested shutdown request has been disapproved (e.g., the operator incorrectly entered their identification information or the identification information is invalid), the shutdown procedure is not allowed to continue. When the shutdown request has been approved, in <b>1215</b>, the reason for initiating the shutdown may be input. Next, in <b>1220</b>, the shutdown procedure may be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In <b>1225</b>, via the player tracking unit, a shutdown request message may be sent one or more servers via the local area network. The shutdown request message may include but is not limited to 1) gaming identification information, 2) date and time, 3) reason for the shutdown or disconnection from the network, 4) operator identification information and 5) state data for the gaming machine. The state data may include but is not limited to metering data and contents of the gaming machine's non-volatile memory. After receiving the shutdown request message and examining its contents, each of the one or more servers may send a reply message indicating that they have received a shutdown message and authorizing or not authorizing the shutdown request.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In <b>1230</b>, the reply message is checked to determine whether the shutdown request has been authorized. When the shutdown request has been authorized, in <b>1235</b>, the gaming machine operator may be notified via either the player tracking interface or the gaming machine interface, that shutdown request has been approved. Then, the operator, in <b>1260</b>, may power-down the gaming machine and the player tracking unit. In other embodiments, the gaming machine and player tracking unit may be remotely powered down without intervention from the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In <b>1240</b>, when the shutdown request has not been approved, a status message indicating defects in the request may be displayed to an operator. In <b>1245</b>, it is determined whether to retry to send the data and attempt to correct the defect. When a retry is attempted, the method returns to <b>1225</b>. When a retry is not attempted, in <b>1255</b>, a decision is made whether to power-down the gaming machine. When a power-down is not chosen, in <b>1265</b>, the gaming machine may return to its previous state. When a power down is forced, in <b>1260</b>, the power may be turned off. However, the player tracking unit, gaming machine and system server may log the abnormal shutdown by the operator that forced the shutdown.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In another embodiment, to automate the shutdown procedure/log-off procedure, a special single purpose card, such as smart card, magnetic striped card, or input device, such as a hand-held computer, that may interface with the player tracking unit may be programmed to implement the shutdown procedure. For instance, a smart card may be programmed with the shutdown command, authorization access data and the reason for the shutdown. Upon insertion of the smart card into a card reader on the player tracking unit, data may be uploaded and the logout may be commenced without further interrogation of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. For instance, while the gaming machines of this invention have been depicted as upright models having top box mounted on top of the main gaming machine cabinet, the use of gaming devices in accordance with this invention is not so limited. For example, gaming machine may be provided without a top box or the gaming machine may be of a slant-top or table top design.</p>
