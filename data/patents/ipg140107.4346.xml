<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for assistance in roaming and call capacity comprises the transmission of a first message to obtain information regarding access point capacity prior to transmitting a data flow. The first message identifies the priority level of the data flow and a requested medium time for the data flow. Thereafter, an access point transmits a second message that identifies whether the requested medium time is available for the data flow. This may involve setting of a &#x201c;zero&#x201d; value in the medium time allowed if there are no resources available or a reduced medium time if limited resources are offered to the requesting wireless device.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention relate to the field of communications, and in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, to a network and method for assisting wireless devices in making informed roaming decisions, without sacrificing the Quality of Service (QoS) of existing connections and for allowing the wireless devices to be aware of admission control status without going through a high overhead message exchange process such as association and authentication.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">GENERAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over the last decade or so, many commercial and governmental entities have installed communication networks in order to allow their employees access various network resources. To improve efficiency and to support mobility, many wireless access enhancements have been added to local, personal, and wide area networks. Based on these enhancements, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Personal Area Networks (PANs) and Wide Area Networks (WLANs) have been and continue to be utilized by more and more users.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For instance, a WLAN supports communications between a number of wireless devices without any required line of sight for such communications. In current network configurations, multiple Access Points (APs) are connected using a distribution system, which may be a wireless or wired network, such as an Ethernet network for example, and each AP operates as a relay station by supporting communications between resources of the distribution system and wireless stations (STAs). STAs are fixed or mobile wireless devices, where the mobile devices enable users to alter their physical locations (e.g. roam), but still communicate over the network.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In wireless networks, &#x201c;roaming&#x201d; refers to the ability of a STA to move from one AP coverage area to another without any interruption in service or loss in connectivity. Apart from basic connectivity, it is important to maintain the same Quality of Service (QoS) for some applications such as voice and video, when a STA roams from one AP to another. Currently, when a STA wants to roam or associate with an AP, there are two primary methods that can be followed in order to assist the STA in making roaming decisions in compliance with the network's admission control constraints. &#x201c;Admission control&#x201d; is a network QoS procedure that is used to determine how bandwidth and latency are allocated to streams with various requirements. Admission control schemes are normally implemented at the APs to control the traffic entering the network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this first method, an AP periodically broadcasts load information, such as the number of stations associated with that AP or the total medium time available for example, as part of the beacons. However, this load information is unreliable because it does not provide an accurate representation of local constraints and other administrative policies. The granularity of aggregate medium time advertised in a load element is also insufficient for the STA to make appropriate roaming decisions based on QoS requirements, as it does not indicate the medium time per priority or access category. In addition, the AP may not update all the information contained in these periodic frames accurately before every transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The second method involves associating to an AP, performing any necessary authentication and then negotiating QoS, such as using the ADDTS (ADD TSPEC) request. The AP may reject such a request after association and authentication, using a response message such as an Add Traffic Stream (ADDTS) response frame. When the request is rejected, the STA roams to another AP to restart the association and authentication process. While the first method is unreliable, the second method features high overhead because the STA needs to associate and possibly authenticate with the AP before making roaming decisions based on the inability to support requested QoS at the AP.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, after the acceptance of a STA's QoS request at the AP followed by the association of the STA, if the AP wants to re-adjust the QoS based on changes in local constraints or the RF environment or to allow an emergency call for a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system, the AP has no graceful mechanism to modify an existing reservation. The AP has to actually disconnect the STA or delete the reservation or degrade the quality of the existing connections without an explicit notification to the STA in order to modify an existing reservation.</p>

Examples of various types of components forming processor <b>200</b> include, but are not limited or restricted to general purpose processor, application specific integrated circuit, programmable gate array, a digital signal processor, a micro-controller and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although not shown, one or more APs (e.g., AP <b>120</b><sub>1</sub>) comprise a processor, memory and a wireless transceiver as described above. However, in addition to association/roaming module <b>240</b>, AP <b>120</b><sub>1 </sub>also includes an admission control module, normally software that is executed in order to respond to a message from a wireless device, such as STA <b>130</b> or even another AP for example, inquiring on support of a QoS request flow. Such operations of a wireless device and AP are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is contemplated that STA <b>130</b> may transmit first message <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in order to ascertain whether one or more of the network APs (e.g., AP <b>120</b><sub>1 </sub>and AP <b>120</b><sub>2</sub>) has sufficient resources to accommodate a requested number of flows with certain QoS priority levels and other QoS parameters. For instance, first message <b>300</b> may be an unsolicited message that occurs before or during association with an AP such as PROBE REQUEST message, an ASSOCIATION REQUEST message or the like. In fact, where STA <b>130</b> is associated with AP <b>120</b><sub>1</sub>, the transmission may be directed to ascertaining roaming information from another AP (e.g., AP <b>120</b><sub>2</sub>) or may be directed to AP <b>120</b><sub>1 </sub>in order to gauge the capacity at that AP.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A second message <b>350</b> is returned by the AP with information regarding the AP's resources that may be made available to STA <b>130</b>, if the STA initiates an association and an actual traffic flow request such as an ADDTS. In general, second message <b>350</b> may be any message that is transmitted in response to first message <b>300</b>, which may occur before or during association with the AP. Examples of second message <b>350</b> include, but are not limited or restricted to a PROBE RESPONSE message and an ASSOCIATION RESPONSE message.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to one embodiment of the invention, first message <b>300</b> may be a PROBE REQUEST message or any other message that includes an Admission Control Information Element <b>305</b>. Admission Control Information Element <b>305</b> comprises a plurality of fields: an Element Identifier (ID) <b>310</b>, an optional Length field <b>320</b> and one or more (N&#x2267;1) QoS Request fields <b>330</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>330</b><sub>N</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Herein, according to one embodiment of the invention, Element ID <b>310</b> identifies the particular type of information element <b>300</b> (e.g., specific vendor or information element identifier) while Length <b>320</b> specifies its size. Additional entries within Admission Control Information Element <b>305</b> include one or more (N) QoS Request(s) <b>330</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>330</b><sub>N</sub>. Each QoS Request (e.g., QoS Request <b>330</b><sub>i</sub>, where 1&#x2266;i&#x2266;N) includes a corresponding Flow Priority sub-field <b>340</b><sub>i </sub>and Medium Time sub-field <b>345</b><sub>i</sub>, respectively. Of course, it is contemplated that QoS Request <b>330</b><sub>i </sub>may be implemented with additional sub-fields other than those listed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, according to one embodiment of the invention, each QoS Request (e.g., QoS Request <b>330</b><sub>i</sub>) comprises information <b>400</b> that includes a corresponding Flow Priority sub-field <b>340</b><sub>i </sub>and Medium Time <b>345</b><sub>i</sub>. Flow Priority sub-field <b>340</b><sub>i </sub>includes a value that represents the priority of the requested flow, where higher priorities are assigned to information types that are most adversely affected by latency, throughput or jitter. Currently, these priority values may include, but are not limited or restricted to &#x201c;0&#x201d; background, &#x201c;1&#x201d; best efforts, &#x201c;2&#x201d; video and &#x201c;3&#x201d; voice corresponding to the Access Category Index (ACI) defined in the 802.11e/WMM specification. Values 4-255 are reserved, and thus, it is contemplated that the priority values may be different for other network embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Medium Time sub-field <b>345</b><sub>i </sub>for QoS Request <b>330</b><sub>i </sub>indicates a requested medium time according to predetermined units of time (e.g., 32 microseconds &#x201c;&#x3bc;s&#x201d;). The definition of the medium time is defined in IEEE 802.11e and WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Similarly, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, second message <b>350</b>, such as a PROBE RESPONSE message for example, includes an Admission Control Information Element <b>500</b> that is returned by an AP in receipt of PROBE REQUEST message <b>300</b>. According to this embodiment of the invention, PROBE REQUEST message <b>300</b> may be received by AP <b>120</b><sub>2</sub>, where STA <b>130</b> is not currently associated with AP <b>120</b><sub>2 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As a result, at a minimum, AP <b>120</b><sub>2 </sub>returns PROBE RESPONSE message <b>350</b> that includes Admission Control Information Element <b>500</b> having at least Medium Time sub-fields <b>505</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>505</b><sub>N</sub>, which identify the amount of medium time (in the predetermined units of time) that are allowed (or available) to STA <b>130</b> for &#x201c;N&#x201d; requested flows. Of course, the same exchange may occur for ASSOCIATION REQUEST and ASSOCIATION RESPONSE messages implemented with an Admission Control Information Elements <b>300</b> and <b>500</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an exemplary flowchart of an embodiment of the operations performed by wireless device and/or AP for roaming and capacity determinations is shown. First, the wireless device (STA) issues a first message that comprises a specific Admission Control information element including one or more QoS Requests each associated with a particular data flow (block <b>600</b>). Each QoS Request identifies the priority and a desired medium time for the data flow. Examples of the first message include, but are not limited or restricted to a PROBE REQUEST message in accordance with any IEEE 802.11 standard.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Upon receiving the message and determining that it has sufficient resources to accommodate the QoS Request, the AP transmits a message including the Admission Control information element to the STA (block <b>610</b>). An example of the second message includes, but is not limited or restricted to a PROBE RESPONSE message. The AP need not reserve any resources based on the first message. Instead, the AP sets within the Admission Control information element to a value that identifies the amount of medium time (in the predetermined units of time) that is allowed (or available) to the STA (block <b>620</b>). In general, the value could range between &#x201c;zero&#x201d; (where no AP resources are available) to the medium time requested (where sufficient AP resources are available). For instance, in certain situations, the AP may return a medium time that is different from and lower than the requested medium time. The STA may accept the lower medium time or seek communication support from another AP. The AP may also indicate the reason for the modified QoS or the reason for the denial, in the response message.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is contemplated that this admission control assistance procedure may be used for VoIP phones (STAs), mobile video or other wireless voice and video devices. For VoIP phones, where Call Admission Control (CAC) is enabled, the configured limits (e.g., maximum calls) may be taken into account while responding to the first message. If CAC is not enabled, the AP may use local constraints, the current traffic condition and maximum capacity to derive the medium time value.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Currently, as described in the IEEE 802.11e standard, Traffic Specification (TSPEC) is the primary mechanism for communicating QoS parameters. In accordance with TSPEC, a STA sends TSPEC requests to an AP in the form of an Add Traffic Stream (ADDTS) management action frames (e.g., ADDTS Request message). Thereafter, the AP evaluates if there are available resources to meet the requested TSPEC, and if not, the AP may respond to the ADDTS Request message with an ADDTS Response message, which may offer the STA with an alternate TSPEC (perhaps with lower performance QoS parameters) or may deny the TSPEC request entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, after the STA has already associated and successfully negotiated TSPEC using the ADDTS Request/Response exchange, the AP may want to modify the QoS characteristics within allocated flows of this STA. Currently, this is accomplished only through a Delete Traffic Stream (DELTS) message, which disconnects or degrades the communications between the STA and AP. Instead, an establishment of a new QoS Action frame is proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of the operations for degrading QoS characteristics for allocated flows of an STA based on a new QoS Action frame exchange is shown. Herein, when an STA is already associated and successfully negotiated a TSPEC, in the event that the AP wishes to reduce the QoS characteristics for an allocated flow, it transmits a Modify Traffic Stream (MODTS) ACTION message (blocks <b>700</b>, <b>710</b> and <b>720</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, MODTS ACTION message <b>800</b> comprises a TSPEC field <b>810</b>, which follows the same format as defined in the IEEE 802.11e standard but is adapted to indicate degraded QoS parameters. The AP may send MODTS ACTION message <b>800</b> for one or more flows from the same STA. A Status code <b>820</b> indicates the reason for MODTS ACTION message <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, upon receipt of MODTS ACTION message <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the STA optionally responds with a MODTS STATUS message <b>900</b> (block <b>730</b>). An embodiment of MODTS STATUS message <b>900</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. MODTS STATUS message <b>900</b> includes information on whether the STA accepts the modified TSPEC or it is going to look for a new AP. Such information may be identified by a selected value set within a Status Code field <b>910</b> of MODTS STATUS message <b>900</b>. As a result, the AP is able to degrade QoS characteristics for a given flow without disconnection of the STA-AP communications.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the invention has been described in terms of several embodiments, the invention should not limited to only those embodiments described, but can be practiced with modification and alteration within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For instance, according to another embodiment of the invention, the QoS Request field of the first message includes a sub-field that identifies a requested resource other than medium time including, but not limited or restricted to bits per second, jitter, latency, frame size and frames per second. The second message would include a subfield that identifies the allowed or allocated resources that can be provided from a second wireless device (e.g., AP) to a second wireless device (e.g., STA). The description is thus to be regarded as illustrative instead of limiting.</p>
