<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods to determine drug hydrophobicity and to quantify changes in drug hydrophobicity that optimize drug function by means of differential scanning calorimetry of an endothermic phase transition of a base protein-based polymer, specifically of an elastic-contractile model protein, to which is attached the drug to be evaluated for its hydrophobicity in terms of the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>have been developed. Also described herein is the preparation of nanoparticles comprised of protein-based polymers, specifically of elastic-contractile model proteins, designed for the binding and desired release rate of a specific drug or class of drugs. Further described herein is a means of targeting the drug-laden nanoparticle to a cell by means of decorating the nanoparticle surface with a molecular entity that selectively binds to the diseased cell or disease causing organism, e.g., by decorating the drug-laden nanoparticle surface with synthetic antigen-binding fragment to an up-regulated receptor characteristic of the diseased cell.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to the fields of molecular biophysics, chemistry and immunology. More particularly, the invention relates to compositions and methods for optimizing drug efficacy, drug delivery by means of nanoparticles, and targeting drug-laden nanoparticles to diseased (e.g., carcinogenic) or pathogenic cells in a subject.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multidrug resistance is a significant problem in the pharmaceutical industry, and may be achieved by the activation of cellular membrane transporters. Drugs and certain proteins are transported across the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, for example, by energy-activated pumps. The outer membrane component of these pumps is a channel that opens from a sealed resting state during the transport process. ABCB1 exporter proteins confer drug resistance by pumping the drug out of the cell before the drug can function or exert its intended effect (e.g., kill a cancer cell). Classical inhibitors of the ABC exporter proteins are bulky hydrophobic molecules that overload the capacity of the hydrolysis of two ATP molecules to expel the drug by disruption of the hydrophobic associations, but these inhibitors lack specificity and are associated with significant side effects, disrupting important functions of ABC function in tissues throughout the body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods for designing drugs and other therapeutic agents that are able to frustrate the activity of cellular exporter proteins and prevent expulsion of the drug or other therapeutic agent from a cell are greatly needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Described herein is a method to determine drug hydrophobicity and to quantify changes in drug hydrophobicity that optimize drug function by means of differential scanning calorimetry of an endothermic phase transition of a base protein-based polymer, specifically of an elastic-contractile model protein, to which is attached the drug to be evaluated for its hydrophobicity in terms of the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>. Also described herein is the preparation of nanoparticles comprised of protein-based polymers, specifically of elastic-contractile model proteins, designed for the binding and desired release rate of a specific drug or class of drugs. Further described herein is a means of targeting the drug-laden nanoparticle to a cell by means of decorating the nanoparticle surface with a molecular entity that selectively binds to the diseased cell or disease causing organism, e.g., by decorating the drug-laden nanoparticle surface with synthetic antigen-binding fragment to an up-regulated receptor characteristic of the diseased cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">ABC exporter proteins contain two subunits related by a two-fold symmetry axis and comprised of three parts: the globular nucleotide binding domain (NBD) also called the catalytic head, a neck region at the upper reaches of which is a hydrophobic gate, and a transmembrane domain comprised of twelve &#x3b1;-helices, six helices from each subunit. The catalytic head contains two ATP molecules contributing to the association of the two components of the globular head and enclosing an aqueous/polar chamber overlying the hydrophobic gate. The &#x3b3;-phosphate of the triphosphate, which arches over at the top of the aqueous/polar chamber and resides about 30 &#x212b; above the hydrophobic gate. The substrate binding site resides approximately centered within the transmembrane helices some 70 &#x212b; below the &#x3b3;-phosphate and some 40 &#x212b; below the hydrophobic gate. The hydrolysis of a single molecule of ATP results in no transport; the simultaneous hydrolysis of both molecules of ATP is required to achieve transport of a single molecule of substrate. In our view the some 15 kcal/mol of energy released on hydrolysis two ATP molecules arises from the increased hydration of the more polar 2ADP plus 2P<sub>i </sub>(inorganic phosphate). The required hydration comes on opening (dissociation) of the hydrophobic gate some 30 &#x212b; below the 2 adenosine diphosphates and 2 inorganic phosphates. The specific molecular details of the opening involve the nature of hydrophobic hydration and entails knowledge of the thermodynamics of protein hydration, specifically the hydration of charged and hydrophobic moieties of the protein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">&#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, the change in free energy of hydrophobic hydration derives from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data and gives rise in Table 1 to a Hydrophobicity Scale for amino acid side chains in both charged and uncharged states, and in Table 2 for prosthetic groups, for example, the redox couples for oxidized and reduced states of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), of FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), and so on, and for drugs that may be considered for frustrating the export capacity of ABC exporter proteins. Determination of &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>is described herein.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">&#x394;G<sub>ap</sub>, the apolar-polar repulsive free energy for hydration that arises from the counterintuitive competition for hydration between apolar (hydrophobic) and polar (e.g., charged) species. The understanding of &#x394;G<sub>ap </sub>arises from characterization by acid/base and redox titrimetry of the free energy conversions of which designed elastic-contractile model proteins (ECMPs) are capable, for example, visual demonstration of chemical energy producing mechanical work, i.e., chemo-mechanical transduction, and demonstrations of electrical energy producing mechanical work, i.e., electro-mechanical transduction, that is the &#x201c;pumping of iron,&#x201d; the lifting and lowering of weights.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The initial insight into competition for hydration between apolar and polar groups comes from the 1937 study of Butler of the water solubility of a series of linear alcohols from methanol to n-pentanol. The Gibbs free energy for solubility is stated, &#x394;G(dissolution)=&#x394;H&#x2212;T&#x394;S, where &#x394;H/CH<sub>2</sub>=&#x2212;1.5 kcal/mol and [&#x2212;T&#x394;S]/CH<sub>2</sub>=+1.7 kcal/mol. This means that hydration of oil-like hydrophobic groups is exothermic, i.e., hydration of oil-like groups is a favorable reaction. Why then is n-octanol with seven CH<sub>2 </sub>groups, instead of the four CH<sub>2 </sub>groups of n-pentanol, insoluble in water. It is because the [&#x2212;T&#x394;S] term grows positive faster than the &#x394;H term grows negative with each addition of a CH<sub>2 </sub>group, such that by n-octanol the [&#x2212;T&#x394;S] term is more positive than the &#x394;H term is negative. The result is a positive &#x394;G(dissolution), which results in insolubility.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The design and determination of the hydrophobicity of drugs with which to frustrate ABC exporter proteins in their capacity to confer multi-drug resistance is described herein. In the methods, the hydrophobicity of drugs, such as the Oxaliplatin, Cisplatin, and Carboplatin series, is increased in a step-wise manner to determine the exact hydrophobicity of the hydrophobically modified drug by placing the series in a Hydrophobicity Scale for the drugs, and the series is tested for their effectiveness in decreasing the rate of export by an appropriate assay system of the appropriate ABC exporter protein. The methods identify a drug hydrophobicity that is sufficient to frustrate export, while not significantly interfering with the drug efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The hydrophobicity scale described herein provides an exact measure of the maximal hydrophobicity of the drug. The methodology determines the hydrophobicity by attachment to a suitable ECMP and determines the DSC of the phase transition. The heat of the transition (&#x394;H<sub>t</sub>) at the transition equals T<sub>t</sub>&#x394;S<sub>t</sub>. The value obtained is a maximal value because at a temperature below the transition all groups are fully hydrated, the structure is a largely disordered coiled coil, and on phase separation essentially all of the hydrophobic hydration is lost as the hydrophobic groups associate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Table 1 provides values of &#x394;G<sup>o</sup><sub>HA</sub>, the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, for all of the amino acid side chains of protein and where applicable in their different functional states, neutral or charged, etc. Using the data in Table 1, the &#x394;G<sup>o</sup><sub>HA </sub>for a hydrophobic domain (Urry D W. The change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association: Derivation and evaluation by means of inverse temperature transitions. Chem Phys Letters 2004; 399:177-83) was calculated as has been done, for example, for the three defined sides of the &#x3b3;-rotor of the F<sub>1</sub>-motor of ATP synthase

        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">(Urry D W. Cell Biol Int 2006; 30: 44-55). The effect of hydrolysis of a single ATP to ADP plus Pi with a properly focused cone of hydration directed toward associated hydrophobic domains would be the dissociation of the pair of associated hydrophobic domains up to a &#x394;G<sup>o</sup><sub>HA </sub>of +7 to +8 kcal/mol. This is achieved by means of studies on designed elastic-contractile model proteins. The contribution of each amino acid side chain to the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association has been determined, including a value for Ser-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>of about +8 kcal/mol on phosphorylation of Ser).</li>

<p id="p-0016" num="0016">Simultaneous hydrolysis of two molecules of ATP in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporter protein, for example Sav1866, opens a transmembrane channel to release drug from the cell and confers drug resistance, e.g., gives rise to methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Based on this mechanism, pharmaceutical design strategies can be employed for overloading the capacity of two molecules of ATP to open access to the channel for export. Crystal structure analyses of the <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>exporter protein Sav1866, in its &#x201c;outward facing conformation,&#x201d; of MsbA of <i>Salmonella typhimurium </i>in both its &#x201c;inward and outward facing conformations&#x201d; the mammalian ABC exporter protein, P-glycoprotein, indicate the same mechanism to be relevant to human carcinoma cells and certain drug resistant pathogens. Description of the transport mechanism utilizes two thermodynamic quantities&#x2014;&#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, and &#x394;Gap, an apolar-polar repulsive free energy for hydration, derived from studies on designed elastic-contractile model proteins (ECMPs). These quantities also allow design of remarkably biocompatible ECMPs as drug delivery vehicles with remarkable control of release profiles and of ECMPs that provide the means of developing pharmaceuticals for blocking multi-drug resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">For the proposed mechanism of the ABC exporter protein, Sav1866, hydrophobic dissociation sufficient to open the channel for passage of the molecule to be exported through the cell membrane to the cell exterior calculates to require some 14 kcal. Therefore, the simultaneous hydrolysis of two molecules of ATP is required to open the channel sufficiently for drug expulsion from the cell. The structure of Sav1866 determined by Dawson and Locher (Dawson R J P, Locher K P. FEBS Ltrs 2007; 581: 935-8. Protein Data Bank, Accession Code 2ONJ; Dawson R J P, Locher K P. Nature 2006; 443: 180-5. Protein Data Bank, Accession Code 2HYD) is beautifully designed to achieve transport as the result of simultaneous hydrolysis of each of two molecules of bound ATP (represented in the crystal structure of Sav1866 as two AMP-PNP, the stable analogue of ATP). Briefly, Sav1866 is a dimer containing two identical binding sites for ATP, and the triphosphate end of each ATP is connected by an aqueous cone to its half of the hydrophobic association that must be opened for export of the drug to the cell exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">Reported crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub>-motor (also referred to as the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase) of ATP synthase (Menz et al., Cell 2001; 106: 331-41. Protein Data Bank, Accession Code 1H8E; Abrahams et al., Nature (London) 1994; 370: 621-8. Protein Data Bank, Accession Code 1BMF) and of the molecular chaperon, GroEL/GroES (Xu et al., Nature 1997; 388: 741-50. Protein Data Bank, Accession Code 1OAN), provide the opportunity to demonstrate the use of &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, and &#x394;Gap, the apolar-polar repulsive free energy for hydration, in describing the mechanism whereby these important naturally occurring proteins function (Chapters 7 and 8 of Urry D W. What sustains life? Consilient mechanisms for protein-based machines and materials. Springer (Birkhauser), LLC, New York, ISBN: 08176 4346 X. 2006). Further knowledge of &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>and &#x394;Gap derive from physical characterizations of designed basis sets of ECMPs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">For controlled release of pharmaceuticals, positively charged drugs packaged in negatively charged ECMP result in zero-order release. Once the rate of drug release and its &#x394;Gap have been determined for one member of a related family of ECMP, the release rates for another member of the family can be calculated from the acid-base titration data. For example, from the pKa shift, &#x394;Gap=2.3RT&#x394;pKa, and also from the positive cooperativity graphically determined from a Hill plot to obtain &#x394;Gap=(&#x2202;&#x394;G/&#x2202;&#x3b1;)<sub>T </sub>where &#x2202;&#x3b1; defines the change in degree of ionization over which the &#x2202;&#x394;G occurs (See Table 3 below). Thus, the thermodynamics of model protein hydration can be determined for a designed ECMP with a known release rate and used to calculate the release rates of a drug from a related ECMP for which only the acid-base titration data has been determined.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0062">Described herein is the development and use of a hydrophobicity scale based on the change in Gibbs free energy of hydrophobic association, methods of producing a therapeutic drug for treating or preventing a disease or condition that is capable of down-regulating exporter protein activity (responsible for drug resistance) in a cell based on the hydrophobicity scale, therapeutic drugs produced according to these methods, compositions including same, and nanoparticles for delivering a therapeutic drug as described herein. In these methods, the hydrophobicity of a drug or candidate drug is optimized, resulting in a drug that is able to decrease or prevent exporter protein activity in a cell and thus decrease or prevent export of the drug from the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">A nanoparticle as described herein is conjugated or bound to at least one molecule for targeting a particular cell type. The at least one molecule may be a protein or peptide of bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or viral origin, or a fragment derived from these antigens, a carbohydrate, or a carbohydrate mimetic peptide. A nanoparticle can be conjugated to two or more different molecules for targeting a particular cell type (e.g., two or more different cell-specific targeting molecules) The at least one molecule (i.e., surface exposed molecules) can be conjugated to or bound to a nanoparticle by any suitable means known in the art. For example, peptide or polypeptide antigens can be chemically linked to the nanoparticles or made contiguous with the model protein by recombinant DNA methodology. Conjugation methods include chemical complexation, which may be either ionic or non-ionic in nature, electrostatic binding, or covalent binding.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Development of A change In Gibbs Free Energy For Hydrophobic Association-Based Hydrophobicity Scale</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">Described herein is a hydrophobicity scale based on the change in Gibbs free energy of hydrophobic association. Increase in entropy of water drives endothermic phase transition of hydrophobic association. For a narrow phase transition the chemical potential, &#x3bc;, of the molecules in the phase separated, hydrophobically associated state, &#x3bc;<sub>HA</sub>, and the solution, hydrophobically dissociated state, &#x3bc;<sub>HD</sub>, are equal. Therefore, at constant temperature and pressure, i.e., at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs free energy for the phase transition is zero, (&#x394;G<sub>t</sub>)<sub>TP</sub>=0 and &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>=T<sub>t</sub>&#x394;S<sub>t</sub>. For the breadth of the transition of elastic-contractile model proteins [ECMP], it is written:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>H</i><sub>t</sub><i>&#x2248;T</i><sub>t</sub><i>&#x394;S</i><sub>t</sub>,&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
i.e., the heat of the transition, &#x394;H<sub>t </sub>in kcal/mol, is approximated by the product of the temperature of the transition, T<sub>t </sub>in &#xb0; K, times the entropy change attending the transition, &#x394;S<sub>t </sub>in kcal/&#xb0; K-mol.
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">As the phase transition for (GVGVP)<sub>n </sub>(SEQ ID NO:4) is endothermic, &#x394;H<sub>t </sub>is positive, and therefore by Eqn. (1), &#x394;S<sub>t </sub>is positive. Since the endothermic phase transition that occurs on raising the temperature is of a two-component system (water plus model protein),
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>S</i><sub>t</sub>(total system)=[&#x394;<i>S</i><sub>t</sub>(model protein)+&#x394;<i>S</i><sub>t</sub>(water)]&#x3e;0.&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Eqn. (2) is a statement of the 2nd law of thermodynamics that the entropy of the total system must increase with temperature, that is, &#x394;S<sub>t</sub>(total system) is positive. But since the model protein goes to a more dense, lower entropy state and even a structured state, &#x394;S<sub>t</sub>(model protein) is negative. Yet
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>S</i><sub>t</sub>(water)=[&#x394;<i>S</i><sub>t</sub>(total system)&#x2212;&#x394;<i>S</i><sub>t</sub>(model protein)]&#x3e;0,&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">Since the model protein component increases in order (rather than decreases) on raising the temperature, this phase transition has been called an inverse temperature transition, and the total increase in entropy of water is greater yet than the magnitude obtained from the endothermic transition measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The increase in entropy of the water, as it goes from ordered hydrophobic hydration to bulk water, drives the entire inverse temperature transition exhibited by (GVGVP)<sub>n </sub>(SEQ ID NO:4) and, importantly, overwhelms the oppositely signed exothermic component, e.g., van der Waals interactions, and the decrease in entropy on self-assembly of the protein component. The endothermic inverse temperature transition is driven entirely by the increase in entropy of water, as structured hydrophobic hydration becomes less-ordered bulk water.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">The van der Walls interaction is exothermic for the hydrophobic association attending the ITT, yet the ITT is endothermic. Thus, the van der Walls interaction does not provide the driving force for hydrophobic association. The derivation of the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, and evaluation by inverse temperature transition of hydrophobic association has been reported previously (D. W. Urry, The Change in Gibbs Free Energy for Hydrophobic Association: Derivation and Evaluation by means of Inverse Temperature Transitions. Chem. Phys. Letters 399 (2004) 177-183.), and is given more simply below. For sufficiently narrow phase transitions the enabling statement of Eqn (1) may be written for each of two different pentamer compositions, e.g.,</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data of &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) and &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>(GVGIP) (SEQ ID NO:8) in FIG. 1 of Luan and Urry, J Phys Chem 95:7896-7900, 1991 provide a specific example of the difference that defines &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the areas of the curves represent the endothermic heats and the difference in areas for the inverse temperature transition gives the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, a value of &#x2212;1.5 kcal/mol-pentamer due to the addition of a single CH<sub>2 </sub>to give (GVGIP) (SEQ ID NO:8). This is the same value of 1.5 kcal/mol-CH<sub>2 </sub>for the addition of a single CH<sub>2 </sub>as determined by Butler for the alcohol series.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">Accordingly, &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>as defined is dominated by the endothermic transition of the conversion of hydrophobic hydration to bulk water, but it also includes a smaller exothermic component (Rodriguez-Cabello et al., Chem Phys Letters 388:127-31, 2004), considered to be the release of heat due to van der Waals' interactions resulting from hydrophobic association. Thus, the favorable exothermic heat due to van der Waals' interaction, often considered to be the basis for the hydrophobic effect, in fact, is of the opposite sign to that of an endothermic inverse temperature transition that drives hydrophobic association. Importantly, &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>contains the contribution of van der Waals contacts and any other exothermic interactions that may accompany hydrophobic association, but, of course, &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>is dominated by the differences in the endothermic conversion of hydrophobic hydration to bulk water between the reference state (GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) and (GVGIP) (SEQ ID NO:8) test state.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">Cold denaturation of proteins, where lowering the temperature results in hydrophobic dissociation and formation of exothermic hydrophobic hydration, is the reverse process from raising the temperature to elicit an endothermic inverse temperature transition of hydrophobic association. Obviously, cold denaturation of proteins is driven by the exothermic formation of hydrophobic hydration and occurs with the endothermic loss, of the lesser energy consideration, of van der Waals contacts. Simply stated, the report of P. L. Privalov (Crit. Revs Biochem Mol Biol 25:281-305, 1990) shows the inverse temperature transition to be central to the protein subunit assembly of a long list of biology's proteins, as has been extensively shown by means of systematically designed elastic-contractile model proteins. Therefore, an understanding of &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>and &#x394;G<sub>ap</sub>, described below, become central to the design of protein-based polymers (and of amphiphilic polymers, in general) as biomaterials for use in the aqueous milieu of biology and of the function of the proteins of biology.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">The following describes development of the &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>-based Hydrophobicity Scale. Because the temperature of the inverse temperature transition for (G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP)<sub>n&#x2248;200 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:9) may be outside of the experimentally accessible temperature range, either below 0&#xb0; C. or above 80&#xb0; C., and in order to utilize results for sparse, non-self-interacting substitutions, the statement of experimentally used pentamer composition may effectively be considered as poly[f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>(G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP),f<sub>V</sub>(GVGVP)] (SEQ ID NO:10) where f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub> and f<sub>V </sub>are the mole fractions of pentamers in the polymer with f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>+f<sub>V</sub>=1. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. The linear set of data points, for say f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>=01, 0.2, and 0.3 versus &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>, are linearly extrapolated to f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>=1. This allows proper comparison of the data for f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>=1 with f<sub>V</sub>=1, which is the experimental reference value for (GVGVP)<sub>n</sub>. (SEQ ID NO:4). The boldfaced &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>(G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP), (SEQ ID NO:2), &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>(GVGVP), (SEQ ID NO:4), T<sub>t</sub>(G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP) (SEQ ID NO:2) and T<sub>t</sub>(GVGVP), (SEQ ID NO:4), signify that the values are for f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>=1 and f<sub>V</sub>=1 whether obtained from homopolypentapeptides directly, or as necessary, on extrapolation to f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>=1 to obtain &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>(G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP)<sub>n&#x2248;200 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:9) or T<sub>t</sub>(G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP) (SEQ ID NO:2). For experimental values obtained on polymers with f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>&#x3c;1, i.e., poly[f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>(G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP),f<sub>V</sub>(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:10) representing the first ECMP basis set, &#x394;H<sub>t </sub>would not be boldfaced and might be explicitly written for an ECMP composition of f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>=0.2 as &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[0.2(G<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>GVP) (SEQ ID NO:2),0.8(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4)].</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">Once the values are determined by difference with &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, they are translated so the reference polymer is taken as (GGGVP (SEQ ID NO:11), as this residue is considered to be close to neutral, being neither polar nor apolar.

The data for the naturally occurring amino acid residues are given in Table 1 and plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in terms of T<sub>t </sub>versus &#x394;G<sup>o</sup><sub>HA</sub>. The result is an interesting sigmoid-shaped curve, which may also serve to estimate &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>when only T<sub>t </sub>is known.
</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">Comparisons for the hydrophobicities of the amino acid residues: From Table 1 we may note that the effect of the addition of a single &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; moiety as occurs on replacement of Val by Leu gives a change of &#x2212;1.55 kcal/mol-CH<sub>2</sub>, again essentially that of the &#x2212;1.5 kcal/mol-CH<sub>2 </sub>found by Butler (Butler JAV Trans Faraday Soc 33:229-238, 1937) for the methanol to n-pentanol series discussed above. One should also note the large effect of ionization by comparing Glu(COOH) and Glu(COO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) with a &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>of 5.2 kcal/mol-pentamer and of Lys(NH<sub>2</sub>) and Lys(NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) with a &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>of 3.5 kcal/mol-pentamer.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">Furthermore a set of data for chemical attachment of a number of biologically relevant groups is given in Table 2. In this case most of the &#x394;G<sup>o</sup><sub>HA </sub>values have been obtained by taking the experimental T<sub>t</sub>, suitably extrapolated to f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub>=1 to obtain T<sub>t</sub>, and reading the value of &#x394;G<sup>o</sup><sub>HA </sub>from the sigmoid curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Interesting are the changes in the value of &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>on reduction of an N-methyl nicotinamide (NMeN<sup>+</sup>+H<sup>+</sup>+2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;NMeNH) to give &#x2212;9 kcal/mol, of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (i.e., NADH<sup>+</sup>+H<sup>+</sup>+2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;NADH<sub>2</sub>) to give &#x2212;7.5 kcal/mol, and of flavin adenine dinucleotide (i.e., FAD+2H<sup>+</sup>+2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;FADH<sub>2</sub>) to give &#x2212;4.5 kcal/mol. The relative magnitudes of the foregoing biologically relevant groupings fit well with their biological roles, e.g., with respect to the roles of NAD and FAD in the electron transport chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">ECMPs are useful for designing drugs with a preferred drug hydrophobicity. Drugs are designed which to frustrate multi-drug resistance imparted by P-glycoprotein and microbial ABC exporter proteins. The inhibitors of P-glycoprotein are substantially hydrophobic molecules that bind by hydrophobic and aromatic interactions. Efforts to design drugs with a preferred drug hydrophobicity would be aided by an accurate means of quantifying the hydrophobicity of drugs designed to limit the capacity whereby simultaneous hydrolysis of two ATP to two ADP and two HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>could expel the drugs from the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">According to the &#x394;G<sub>ap </sub>mechanism discussed above for the function of ABC exporter proteins&#x2014;Sav1866 of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, MsbA of <i>Salmonella typhimurium </i>and P-glycoprotein of mammals, the task of ABC exporter proteins is to disrupt hydrophobic associations in order to open a transit pathway through the cell membrane to the extracellular space. For Sav1866 disruption of hydrophobic association is a challenge that requires the simultaneous hydrolysis of two ATP molecules. A typical design modification for drugs as described herein is to increase the hydrophobicity of the drug to challenge the exporter protein's capacity to disrupt the hydrophobic associations required to open the channel to the outside of the cell and to move the drug through it.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">Drug design is accomplished by the determination of &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>(drug) using ECMP. With the derivation of &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association and the use of the first ECMP basis set, it becomes possible by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to develop the &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>-based Hydrophobicity Scales for amino acid residues (both in their charged and uncharged states), see Table 1, and for other chemical functionalities of biology, such as cofactors, coenzymes, prosthetic groups, phosphorylations, sulfations, nitrations, and so on, see Table 2. By the same approach, the hydrophobicities of drugs and hydrophobic modifications of drugs can be determined, and drug hydrophobicity tables can be prepared. Thus, for the first drug, Drug1(h<sub>0</sub>) with a reference hydrophobicity (h<sub>0</sub>), there would be developed a table of hydrophobicity values with the entries, &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>[Drug1(h<sub>0</sub>)], &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>Drug1(h<sub>1</sub>), &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>Drug1(h<sub>2</sub>), . . . &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>Drug1(h<sub>n</sub>). This series of hydrophobically modified drugs would then be examined for efficacy in destroying the pathogen or the human carcinoma cell, and for interfering with effectiveness of the ABCB1 exporter protein to pump the series&#x2014;[Drug1(h<sub>0</sub>)], [Drug1(h<sub>1</sub>)], [Drug1(h<sub>2</sub>)], . . . [Drug1(h<sub>n-1</sub>)], [Drug1(h<sub>n</sub>)]&#x2014;out of the cell. One could then plot, for example, the ratio of (efficacy to destroy pathogen or diseased cell)/(rate of export from cell). The drugs having the larger values of the ratio become preferred candidate drugs. It should be appreciated that the preferred hydrophobicity for a given drug could differ, for example, for Sav1866 of <i>Staphylococcus aereus</i>, for MsbA of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, and for human P-glycoprotein, as there are differences in the hydrophobicities of the hydrophobic gates and the hydrophobic binding of the drug at the substrate binding site.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">The same considerations of a quantified optimization of drug hydrophobicity may be considered relevant to ABC transport proteins in general and even to drugs binding at whatever site. The &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>-based Hydrophobicity Scale described herein is the only hydrophobicity scale that provides the desired change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Methods of Optimizing Drug Hydrophobicity</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">Methods of producing a therapeutic drug for treating or preventing a disease or condition that is capable of down-regulating exporter protein activity in a cell are described herein. In these methods, the hydrophobicity of a drug or candidate drug is optimized, resulting in a drug that is able to decrease or prevent exporter protein activity in a cell and thus decrease or prevent export of the drug from the cell. A typical method of producing a therapeutic drug for treating or preventing a disease or condition that is capable of down-regulating exporter protein activity in a cell includes the following steps. A drug that is used for treating or preventing the disease or condition or that is a candidate drug for treating or preventing the disease or condition is provided. The drug is modified to increase hydrophobicity of the drug, resulting in at least a first modified drug having a hydrophobicity higher than that of the drug. The drug or the at least first modified drug is modified to increase hydrophobicity of the drug or the at least first modified drug, resulting in at least a second modified drug having a hydrophobicity higher than that of the drug and that of the at least first modified drug. A change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association-based hydrophobicity scale is used to determine the hydrophobicities of the drug, the at least first modified drug, and the at least second modified drug. The drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug are tested for efficacy of treating or preventing the disease or condition. In some embodiments, a value is assigned for efficacy for each of the drug, at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug. The drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug are tested for a capacity to decrease a rate of export of the drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug from a cell. A value can be assigned for the decreased rate of export for each of the drug, at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug. For each of the drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug, a ratio of the value for efficacy to the value for the decreased rate of export can be determined. In an embodiment wherein such a ratio is determined, the drug (of the drug, the at least one modified drug, and the at least second modified drug) having the highest ratio of value for efficacy to the value for the decreased rate of export is identified as a therapeutic drug for treatment or prevention of the disease or condition. In some embodiments, it is not necessary to determine a ratio as described above. In some embodiments, one can determine which of the drug, the at least one modified drug, and the at least second modified drug is best suited for a particular application based on either the efficacy of each, or the rate at which they are exported from a cell.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">In a typical embodiment, the step of determining a ratio of the value for efficacy to the value for the decreased rate of export includes identifying an optimal hydrophobicity for down-regulating exporter protein activity in the cell. In the method, at least a third modified drug is produced and is tested. In some methods, at least a fourth modified drug is produced and is tested. In some embodiments, five or more (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, etc.) modified drugs are produced before one is identified as an optimized therapeutic drug for treatment or prevention of a disease or condition. Generally, when administered to a cell, the therapeutic drug increases hydrophobic associations that are to be disrupted before opening of at least one transmembrane channel within at least one exporter protein in the cell, the at least one exporter protein activity conferring drug resistance to the cell. A therapeutic drug modified as described herein having an optimal hydrophobicity can have any hydrophobicity suitable for decreasing a rate of export of the drug, but generally has a hydrophobicity in the range of about &#x2212;2 kcal/mole to about &#x2212;20 kcal/mole. Therapeutic agents (drugs) described herein can be optimized for delivery to any type of cell, i.e., for preventing or decreasing activity of exporter proteins that would export the drug from the cell. For example, the cell can be a <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>cell, and the at least one exporter protein can be Sav1866. In another example, the cell is a <i>Salmonella typhimurium </i>cell and the at least one exporter protein is MsbA. In a further example, the cell is a mammalian cell and the at least one exporter protein is a P-glycoprotein.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">Down-regulating exporter protein activity typically includes reducing or preventing disruption of a hydrophobic association by simultaneous hydrolysis of two ATP molecules required for exporter protein activity in the cell. A disease to be treated or prevented using the compositions and methods described herein can be any disease or condition. For example, the disease or condition is cancer. In another example, the disease or condition is infection by a pathogen. Any suitable method can be used for increasing hydrophobicity of a therapeutic agent (e.g., drug). In a typical embodiment, increasing hydrophobicity of a therapeutic agent (e.g., drug) includes at least one of the following: adding one or more aliphatic groups, adding one or more aromatic groups, adding one or more heteroaromatic groups, and adding one or more of a combination thereof. A nonexhaustive list of additional examples of methods of increasing hydrophobicity of a therapeutic agent (e.g., drug) include: adding one or more methyl groups, adding one or more ethyl groups, adding one or more ethylene groups, adding one or more propyl groups, adding one or more propylene groups, adding one or more isopropyl groups, adding one or more isobutyl groups, adding one or more t-butyl groups, adding one or more cyclobutyl groups, adding one or more cyclopentyl groups, adding one or more cyclohexyl groups, adding one or more phenyl groups, adding one or more purine or pyrimidine group(s), adding one or more nicotinamide, and adding one or more flavinoid groups.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">In one example of a method of producing a therapeutic drug for treating or preventing a disease or condition that is capable of down-regulating exporter protein activity in a cell, which exporter protein activity confers drug resistance on the cell, the method includes the following steps. A drug that is used for treating or preventing the disease or condition or that is a candidate drug for treating or preventing the disease or condition is provided. An ECMP with which to determine drug hydrophobicities is designed; the ECMP is based on (GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) and utilizes the First ECMP basis set, which is written, in general, as poly[f<sub>V</sub>(GVGVP),f<sub>X</sub>(GXGVP)] (SEQ ID NO:5), where f<sub>V </sub>and f<sub>X </sub>indicate the mole fractions of the composite pentamers in the polymer, i.e., f<sub>V</sub>+f<sub>X</sub>=1, and X is the functional residue to which the drug is to be bound, for example, either covalently by amide linkage to a glutamic acid or aspartic acid or to lysine or by disulfide linkage to a cysteine residue or by ion-pairing and hydrophobic association, ion-dipole and hydrophobic association, and dipole-dipole interactions and hydrophobic association, etc. For a=(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) and b&#x2261;(GXGVP) (SEQ ID NO:2), specific compositions might be written as (aaaaabaaaa)<sub>n </sub>for f<sub>X</sub>=0.1, (aabaaaabaa)<sub>n </sub>for f<sub>X</sub>=0.2, and (aabaabaaba)<sub>n </sub>for f<sub>X</sub>=0.3, and so on where n is within the range of 10 to 400 or preferably 100 to 200. The ECMP is based on (GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) and utilizes the Second ECMP basis set, which is written, in general, as given at the top of Table 3 for highly charged drugs such as sulfated or phosphorylated drugs, for example, Betamethazone phosphate, wherein the hydrophobicity of the ECMP itself must be increased by Val replaced by Phe to achieve the phase separation of hydrophobic association below physiological temperature. The hydrophobicities in terms of the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>, of hydrophobic modifications to a base drug, e.g., Drug1, are determined. The change in Gibbs free energy is exactly the desired quantity for living organisms, because it is the free energy for conditions of constant temperature (T) and pressure (P) under which living organisms normally function. Determining the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, &#x394;G<sub>HA </sub>is achieved by a model protein system that exhibits an inverse temperature transition (ITT) to hydrophobic association on raising the temperature. The model system being used, the ECMP, is based on the repeating pentamer, (GVGVP)<sub>n</sub>, (SEQ ID NO:4) and carefully designed analogues. The ECMP go from being essentially totally disordered random coils of pentamers, completely hydrated below the temperature of the ITT with the hydrophobic groups having their full complement of hydrophobic hydration, to essentially complete loss of hydrophobic hydration in the process of the phase separation called an inverse temperature transition (ITT). It is called an ITT because the model protein becomes more ordered on hydrophobic association, which would be contrary to the Second Law of Thermodynamics if it were not for the transition being driven by the overall increase in disorder as ordered (pentagonal rings of) hydrophobic hydration becomes disordered bulk water as hydrophobic groups associate.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">In one embodiment the original drug with an initial hydrophobicity (h<sub>0</sub>), designated as Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>), is covalently bound as Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>)-ECMP at mole fraction f<sub>D1</sub>=0.1 and dissolved in 0.15 N saline solution at pH 7.4 using 0.01 M phosphate and at low temperature below the onset of the inverse temperature transition. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the solution is determined to give &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>)] at f<sub>D1</sub>=0.1. This is repeated for f<sub>D1</sub>=0.2 and f<sub>D1</sub>=0.3. In general, a plot of f<sub>D1 </sub>versus &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>)] gives a straight line that includes the data points for f<sub>V</sub>=1, and f<sub>D1</sub>=0.1, f<sub>D1</sub>=0.2 and f<sub>D1</sub>=0.3, which allows linear extrapolation to f<sub>D1</sub>=1. The heat of the transition at the intercept of f<sub>D1</sub>=1 is bold-faced &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[Drug<sub>t</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>)] to indicate the change in heat in kcal/mol pentamer (GXGVP) (SEQ ID NO:2). The process is then repeated with Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>1</sub>) to obtain &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[Drug1<sub>t</sub>(h<sub>t</sub>)]. The increase in hydrophobicity, i.e., in the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, due to the drug modification becomes, &#x394;G<sub>HA</sub>{[Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>)]&#x2212;[Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>1</sub>)]}=&#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[Drug<sub>t</sub>(h<sub>t</sub>)]&#x2212;&#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[Drug<sub>t</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>)]. The same is continued for [Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>2</sub>)], [Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>3</sub>)] . . . [Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>n</sub>)]. To place these values on a scale in which &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>(GGGVP) (SEQ ID NO:11)=0, a quantity of &#x2212;2.5 kcal/mol is added to all values of &#x394;H<sub>t</sub>[Drug<sub>1</sub>(h<sub>j</sub>)]. The same procedure is followed for a second drug, Drug<sub>2</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>), and so on. The drug (e.g., Carboplatin (Systematic (IUPAC) name: azanide; cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid; platinum) is modified by adding an appropriate functional group, (e.g., two methyl groups to give azanide; cyclobutane-3,3-dimethyl-1,1-dicarboxylic acid; platinum), resulting in at least a first modified drug having a hydrophobicity higher than that of the drug. This is an example of the kind of stepwise increase in hydrophobicity to be considered. The methods described herein provide the capacity to provide an accurate measure of the change in the Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association, which provides the best opportunity to frustrate of the ABC exporter protein responsible for multi-drug resistance while allowing the drug to yet function in the destruction of the pathogen or of the mammalian carcinoma cell. This can be extended to all ABC transporter proteins and generalized to the optimization of all drugs at their site of action.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">The drug or the at least first modified drug is modified by adding an appropriate functional group (e.g., phenyl group to Carboplatin to give azanide; cyclobutane-3-phenyl-1,1-dicarboxylic acid; platinum), resulting in at least a second modified drug having a hydrophobicity higher than that of the drug and that of the at least first modified drug. Another example of a drug, Drug<sub>2</sub>(h<sub>0</sub>), is Oxaliplatin (Systematic (IUPAC) name: (R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane(ethanedioate-O,O)platinum). The change in composition of the drug for an increased hydrophobicity can be denoted as Drug<sub>2</sub>(h<sub>1</sub>). In the example of Oxaliplatin, increases in hydrophobicity could be increased by steps of an added methyl, for example, Systematic (IUPAC) name: (R,R)-1,2-diamino-4-methylcyclohexane(ethanedioate-O,O)platinum, and then a second methyl as in Systematic (IUPAC) name: (R,R)-1,2-diamino-4,5-dimethylcyclohexane(ethanedioate-O,O)platinum. Both Carboplatin and Oxaliplatin are reported to destroy cancerous cells by cross-linking DNA and both are exported from the cell by P-glycoprotein, thereby conferring multi-drug resistance that is to be frustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">The drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug are tested for efficacy of treating or preventing the disease or condition, and a value is assigned for efficacy for each of the drug, at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug. The drug is tested for its capacity to slow (frustrate) the rate export of the drug from the cell with a competent ABC exporter protein that confers drug resistance, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug for rate of export from a cell, and a value is assigned for the rate of export for each of the drug, at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug. For each of the drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug, a ratio of the value for efficacy of drug action to the value for the rate of drug export is determined, wherein one of the drug, the at least one modified drug, and the at least second modified drug having the highest ratio of value for efficacy to the value for the rate of export from the cell is identified as a therapeutic drug for treatment or prevention of the disease or condition.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Compositions Including Therapeutic Agents With Optimized Hydrophobicities</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">Described herein are compositions including therapeutic agents (e.g., drugs) having optimized hydrophobicities for decreasing or preventing exporter protein activity in a cell. A typical composition includes a therapeutic drug produced by the following steps. The hydrophobicity of a drug or candidate drug is optimized, resulting in a drug that is able to decrease or prevent exporter protein activity in a cell and thus decrease or prevent export of the drug from the cell. A typical method of producing a therapeutic drug for treating or preventing a disease or condition that is capable of down-regulating exporter protein activity in a cell includes the following steps. A drug that is used for treating or preventing the disease or condition or that is a candidate drug for treating or preventing the disease or condition is provided. The drug is modified to increase hydrophobicity of the drug, resulting in at least a first modified drug having a hydrophobicity higher than that of the drug. The drug or the at least first modified drug is modified to increase hydrophobicity of the drug or the at least first modified drug, resulting in at least a second modified drug having a hydrophobicity higher than that of the drug and that of the at least first modified drug. A change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association-based hydrophobicity scale is used to determine the hydrophobicities of the drug, the at least first modified drug, and the at least second modified drug. The drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug are tested for efficacy of treating or preventing the disease or condition. In some embodiments, a value is assigned for efficacy for each of the drug, at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug. The drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug are tested for a capacity to decrease a rate of export of the drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug from a cell. A value can be assigned for the decreased rate of export for each of the drug, at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug. For each of the drug, the at least first modified drug and at least second modified drug, a ratio of the value for efficacy to the value for the decreased rate of export can be determined. In an embodiment wherein such a ratio is determined, the drug (of the drug, the at least one modified drug, and the at least second modified drug) having the highest ratio of value for efficacy to the value for the decreased rate of export is identified as a therapeutic drug for treatment or prevention of the disease or condition.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">A therapeutic drug produced by this method typically has a hydrophobicity of about &#x2212;2 kcal/mole to about &#x2212;20 kcal/mole, and is capable of reducing or preventing export of the drug from a cell by exporter proteins. In a composition, the therapeutic drug is present at a concentration sufficient for decreasing or preventing disruption of hydrophobic associations required for opening of at least one transmembrane channel within at least one exporter protein in the cell. Therapeutic agents (drugs) described herein can be optimized for delivery to any type of cell, i.e., for preventing or decreasing activity of exporter proteins that would export the drug from the cell. For example, the cell can be a <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>cell, and the at least one exporter protein can be Sav1866. In another example, the cell is a <i>Salmonella typhimurium </i>cell and the at least one exporter protein is MsbA. In a further example, the cell is a mammalian cell and the at least one exporter protein is a P-glycoprotein. In a typical embodiment, the therapeutic drug treats or prevents cancer or infection by a pathogen.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Synthesis of Nanoparticles Conjugated to Peptides or Polypeptides</heading>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">Nanoparticles for delivering a cargo to a specific cell type and for promoting an immune response against a particular pathogen, antigen or cancer are described herein. A typical method of synthesizing nanoparticles conjugated to an antigen peptide or protein is as follows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> part 1, (GVGVP)<sub>251 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:3) represents the base elastic-contractile model protein in this case of 251 repeats of the base pentamer, that is, a model protein of uniform chain length of 1255 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 102,659 Daltons. This was made by means of recombinant DNA technology using standard techniques as described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">No new specialized techniques were required for the use of recombinant DNA technology in the production of protein-based polymers. A basic monomer gene or a gene segment is chosen such that the total length would be no more than about 150 bases, encoding for a sequence of 50 amino acid residues. In general, when designing a gene to be expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, the codon preferences for <i>E. coli </i>are used, whereas if the desire is to produce the polymer in tobacco, the codon preferences for tobacco are used. Thus one designs a DNA sequence for a basic monomer gene, including the sequences of the restriction sites as required for the protein to be expressed and the plasmid to be used. The next step is to prepare the full-length double-stranded 150 base pair monomer gene with additional bases for defined restriction sites as required for insertion into a given plasmid or vector. This begins with chemical synthesis of two base sequences of 80 to 90 bases, one from the 3&#x2032; end and the other from the 5&#x2032; end. The chemically synthesized sequences pair with each other using the overlap in their central region. Then the remarkable polymerase chain reaction (PCR, of forensic and other frame) completes the double strand. An appropriate strain of bacteria (e.g., <i>E. coli</i>) is for the transformation and growing up of the transformed <i>E. coli </i>containing many plasmids, each plasmid with one copy each of the monomer gene. The plasmids are harvested, the monomer genes excised by the appropriate restriction enzyme(s), and the sequence of the monomer gene verified.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">Using appropriate oligonucleotide adaptors and ligase enzyme, the monomer genes are polymerized. This is called concatenation or concatemerization. The result can be a series of genes containing repeats of the monomer gene. Each band in lane 2 is a gene differing in size by one monomer gene (See FIG. 13 of D. W. Urry, A. Nicol, D. T. McPherson, C. M. Harris, T. M. Parker, J. Xu, D. C. Gowda and P. R. Shewry &#x201c;Properties, Preparations and Applications of Bioelastic Materials.&#x201d; In <i>Encyclopedic Handbook of Biomaterials and Bioengineering&#x2014;Part A&#x2014;Materials</i>, Vol. 2, D. L. Wise, D. J. Trantolo, D. E. Altobelli, M. J. Yazemski, J. D. Gresser and E. R. Schwartz, Eds. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, pp. 1619-1673, 1995). Also, in the particular concatenation for polymerizing of (GVGVP)<sub>10 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:21), the carboxyl end restriction site is used that adds another GVGVP, such that the final gene encodes for (GVGVP)<sub>n&#xd7;10+1 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:4) or [(GVGVP)<sub>10</sub>]n (GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:22).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">Having constructed the gene, it is now excised and inserted into an expression vector. The expression vector then is used to transform a strain of <i>E. coli </i>that is specialized for expression of the designed protein-based polymer. A portion of transformed <i>E. coli</i>, stored in a glycerol stock, is used to grow an inoculum for addition to a large fermentor. The choice of media depends on the strain of microbe and chosen expression vector. It generally includes a chemical inducer to turn on the expression, a carbon source (e.g., glucose or glycerol), a nitrogen source (often as a source of amino acids), salts, other cofactors as may be provided, for example, by a yeast extract, and an antibiotic to which the transformed <i>E. coli </i>are selectively resistant. The fermentor conditions are optimized with respect to O2 flow, stirring rate, pH, and so forth as required for the expression system. Fermentors ranging in size from a few liters to thousands of liters are commercially available. The product is (GVGVP)<sub>251</sub>. For production by <i>E. coli </i>there is an important issue of the removal of <i>E. coli </i>toxic proteins. Because poly(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) has been chemically synthesized and adequately purified, it was established that these elastic protein-based polymers exhibited extraordinary biocompatibility (Dan W. Urry, Asima Pattanaik, Mary Ann Accavitti, Chi-Xiang Luan, David T. McPherson, Jie Xu, D. Channe Gowda, Timothy M. Parker, Cynthia M. Harris, and Naijie Jing, &#x201c;Transductional Elastic and Plastic Protein-based Polymers as Potential Medical Devices,&#x201d; in <i>Handbook of Biodegradable Polymers</i>, ed. by Domb, Kost, and Wiseman, Harwood Academic Publishers, Chur, Switzerland, pp. 367-386, 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">Now the First ECMP Basis Set can be indicated, in general, in terms of pentamer compositions as poly[f<sub>V</sub>(GVGVP),f<sub>X</sub>(GXGVP)] (SEQ ID NO:5) where f<sub>V</sub>+f<sub>X</sub>=1, that is, a formula f<sub>V</sub>=0.9 and f<sub>X</sub>=0.1 means a polymer with 9 (GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:4) pentamers for every one (GXGVP) (SEQ ID NO:2) pentamer. By means of membrane dialysis, the chemically synthesized polymers have mean molecular weights of the order of 82,000 Daltons. When preparation is by biosynthesis, the ECMP are of one fixed length and the repeating sequence may be most commonly of six pentamers, but often ten pentamers, and sometimes nine or even twelve pentamers. A particular family of six repeating pentamers, i.e., a poly (30 mer), constitutes the Second ECMP Basis Set as listed below:</p>

The F represents the phenyalanine (Phe) residue having in the design replaced a V (valine, Val) residue. These polymers were biosynthesized using recombinant DNA technology and expressed by <i>E. coli </i>fermentation.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">Decoration of the surface of drug-laden ECMP nanoparticles as described herein is useful for the purpose of targeting the drug delivery vehicle to the desired cell for localized drug release. One example of an entity with which to target would be synthetic antigen-binding Fab1-Fab2 fragments that target cancerous cells with up-regulated estrogen receptors.

Kinsel, Eva Szabo, Geoffrey L. Greene, John Konrath, George S. Leight, and Kenneth S. McCarty, Jr. Also, sequences of Fab1 and Fab2 fragments for binding to the estrogen receptor may be obtained by such as The Kabat Database of Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. The Fab 1 and Fab2 sequences would be added to the DNA sequence, each for a designed ECMP, such that the amino end of ECMP sequences would be contiguous with the carboxyl end of the Fab. These Fab-ECMP would be incorporated into the drug-delivery nanoparticle at the desired percentage of surface coverage.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">To give a sense of the length of the ECMP in comparison with the nanoparticle diameter, if laid out in the dynamic &#x3b2;-spiral conformation, the ECMP would be longer than the diameter of a 50 nm diameter nanoparticle. Now the 1.8 nm diameter &#x3b2;-spiral conformation can fold back on itself and it is believed that three &#x3b2;-spirals supercoil to form a twisted filament of 5 nm diameter that can be seen in electron micrographs of negatively stained filaments (See FIGS. 5, 6, and 7 of Dan W. Urry, &#x201c;Free Energy Transduction in Polypeptides and Proteins Based on Inverse Temperature Transitions,&#x201d; <i>Prog. Biophys. Molec. Biol. </i>57, 23-57, 1992). Furthermore, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, the dimensions of the synthetic antigen-binding Fab1-Fab2 fragment, based on crystallographic data, would be 7 nm in length and grossly characterized as an elliptical cylinder with a 5.2 nm major axis and 3.3 nm minor axis that would jut out of the spherical nanoparticle along the axis of a diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">50 nm diameter cationic drug delivery nanoparticles (ECMPdd) were constructed (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>). These nanoparticles were of the ECMP, (GVGVP GVGFP GEGFP GVGVP GVGFP GFGFP)<sub>42 </sub>(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:7), which is 253 pentamers. The ECMP (GVGVP GVGFP GKGFP GVGVP GVGFP GFGFP)<sub>45 </sub>(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:23) was also constructed. By way of example, one gene will be constructed by utilizing the appropriate restriction site to attach the gene for Fab1 to the DNA sequence encoding for a protein-based polymer to give Fab1-(GVGVP GVGFP GEGFP GVGVP GVGFP GFGFP)<sub>42 </sub>(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:7) labeled (ECMPdd/Fab 1). A second gene will be prepared to produce Fab2-(GVGVP GVGFP GKGFP GVGVP GVGFP GFGFP)<sub>45 </sub>(GVGVP) (SEQ ID NO:23), identified as (Fab2ECMPdd). Then the gene products, ECMP<sup>&#x2212;</sup>dd/Fab1 and ECM<sup>P+</sup>dd/Fab2, are to be combined in a 1:1 ratio in dilute solution to form the associated ECMP<sup>&#x2212;</sup>dd/Fab1-Fab2ECM<sup>P+</sup>dd, yielding synthetic antigen binding fragments oriented appropriately to bind the antigenic site of an upregulated receptor of a cancerous cell.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">The ECMP<sup>&#x2212;</sup>dd/Fab 1-Fab2ECMP<sup>+</sup>dd are added to the particular ECMPdd at a ratio to give the desired extent of decoration on the surface of the nanoparticle and the properties of the ECMP are such that they exclude the more polar Fab1-Fab2 protein by an apolar-polar repulsive free energy of hydration, &#x394;Gap, from the interior to the charged surface of the nanoparticle. The surface area of a 50 nm diameter is 7,854 nm<sup>2</sup>, and the area occupied by the Fab1-Fab2 is about 53 nm<sup>2 </sup>such that 10% coverage of the surface would involve 15 Fab1-Fab2 constructs and 20% coverage of the surface would require 30 Fab1-Fab2 constructs. Each surface construct, a synthetic antigen-binding fragment, could be grossly described as a cylinder 7 nm in length aligned on a radial extension pointing directly out of the spherical nanoparticle surface (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). The cylinder may be approximated with an elliptical cross-section of a 5.2 nm major axis and a 3.3 nm minor axis with the major axis twisted by about 100&#xb0; (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). The distal end of the cylinder would contain the antigen-binding site, which is seen in gray scale as a largely black end of the cylinder, that is an extremely hydrophobic end inserts into the antigenic site of the receptor (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Construction of ECMP-nanoparticles (ECMPddnp) for Controlled Drug Release</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">By way of example a most hydrophobic composition with all V replaced by F will be used which would give the lowest, most-prolonged release profile. This is the example of the bottom curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of (GFGFP GEGFP GFGFP GFGFP GEGFP GFGFP)<sub>n </sub>(SEQ ID NO:24). Then subsequent less hydrophobic ECMP can be considered by simply decreasing the number of V replaced by F. The n for (GFGFP GEGFP GFGFP GFGFP GEGFP GFGFP)<sub>n </sub>(SEQ ID NO:24), labeled ECMP<sub>2E/10F</sub>, could vary from 0.5 to 100, but for the nanoparticle purposes considered here 30 to 60 would be preferred. The nanoparticle size is dependent on the temperature and concentration at which quenching is carried out (F. Sciortino, M. U. Palma, D. W. Urry and K. U. Prasad, &#x201c;Nucleation and Accretion of Bioelastomeric Fibers at Biological Temperatures and Low Concentrations,&#x201d; <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>157, 1061-1066, 1988.), and, due to the E residue, on the pH (Dan W. Urry, ShaoQing Peng, Jie Xu, and David T. McPherson, &#x201c;Characterization of Waters of Hydrophobic Hydration by Microwave Dielectric Relaxation,&#x201d; J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 119, 1161-1162, 1997.).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">Cross-linking by cobalt 60 of a relatively lower dose than the common 20 Mrads used for (GVGVP)<sub>&#x2dc;200 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:25), say 2 to 8 Mrads, which with a lessened call for elastic modulus, fewer cross-links would allow for greater swelling for uptake of the FabECMP, discussed below. By adding a K (lysine, Lys) residue at a suitable interval, for example, (GFGFP GEGFP GFGFP GFGFP GEGFP GFGFP GFGFP GKGFP GFGFP GFGFP GEGFP GFGFP)<sub>n </sub>(SEQ ID NO:26), labeled ECMP<sub>1K3E/20F</sub>, cross-linking can be achieved by a water soluble carbodiimide as used in Dan W. Urry, Jie Xu, Weijun Wang, Larry Hayes, Frederic Prochazka, and Timothy M. Parker, &#x201c;Development of Elastic Protein-based Polymers as Materials for Acoustic Absorption.&#x201d; <i>Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc</i>.: Materials Inspired by Biology, 774, 81-92, 2003 (See section Mechanical Properties of Cross-linked Fibers). The ratio, ECMP<sub>2E/10F</sub>:ECMP<sub>1K3E/20F </sub>can be varied to control extent of chemical cross-linking. The pH of the reaction mixture is also relevant. It should be noted that the pK of the carboxylate of ECMP<sub>2E/10F </sub>would be of the order of 6.2 (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and that of the K residue will also be shifted toward physiological pH. These polymers can each be ionized, which leads to ion-pairing making ease of cross-linking to form an amide cross-link. A cross-linked 1:1 ratio would result in a nanoparticle for carrying cationic drugs. The D (aspartic acid, Asp) residue could, of course, also be used for the negative. Formation of an ECMPddnp for an anionic drug carrier would utilize K and/or R (argenine, Arg) and/or H (histidine, His) and would utilize fewer F residues, because of the lower solubility provided by the positive charges of K and/or R and/or H.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">The loading of the nanoparticles with drug is assisted by determining loading profiles on non-cross-linked ECMP as demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for a series of compositions of increasing hydrophobicity. The ECMP is dissolved in normal saline at pH 7.4. A small amount of drug is then added and the onset temperature of phase separation is determined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. This is continued stepwise for a given composition, e.g., K/0F, and then is repeated for a more hydrophobic polymer until a loading profile as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is obtained. This determines which compositions can be used for the particular drug. This, with the pK of the functional group of the ECMP, provides information on the relative release rates that will occur, and with the release rate of one composition and the pK of each composition the release rate for each composition can be approximated. The chosen ECMP or the several of the most interesting ECMPs are then made into nanoparticles and the conditions for loading have been determined.</p>
