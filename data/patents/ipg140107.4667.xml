<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One embodiment of the present disclosure entails a system having a controller to receive from a first communication device a telephone number of a second communication device which is subscribed to a contact book account of the system, submit a verification code to the second communication device, submit a request to the first communication device for the verification code, receive the verification code from the first communication device, provide the first communication device access to update in whole or in part a second contact book of the second communication device stored in the contact book account, receive from the first communication device one or more entries of a first contact book of the first communication device, merge the one or more entries of the first contact book with one or more entries of the second contact book, thereby generating an updated second contact book, and store the updated second contact book in the contact book account.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the present disclosure entails a computer-readable storage medium having computer instructions for receiving from a first communication device a request to synchronize at least a portion of a first contact book of the first communication device with a second contact book of a second communication device, submitting to the second communication device a notice of the request, receiving an authorization indicator from one of the first and second communication devices, synchronizing the portion of the first contact book with the second contact book responsive to a validation of the authorization indicator, and storing the synchronized contact book in a contact book account of the second communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another embodiment of the present disclosure entails a method involving synchronizing a first contact book of a first communication device with a second contact book of a second communication device responsive to submitting an authentication code to the second communication device, and receiving the authentication code from one of the first and second communication devices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment of the present disclosure entails a first communication device having a controller to transmit to a system a request to synchronize a first contact book of the first communication device with a second contact book of a second communication device, receive from the system a request for a verification code transmitted by the system to the second communication device, transmit to the system the verification code, and transmit to the system the first contact book for synchronization with the second contact book.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of a first communication system <b>100</b> for delivering media content. The communication system <b>100</b> can represent an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) broadcast media system. In a typical IPTV infrastructure, there is a super head-end office (SHO) with at least one super headend office server (SHS) which receives national media programs from satellite and/or media servers from service providers of multimedia broadcast channels. In the present context, media programs can represent audio content, moving image content such as videos, still image content, and/or combinations thereof. The SHS server forwards IP packets associated with the media content to video head-end servers (VHS) via a network of aggregation points such as video head-end offices (VHO) according to a common multicast communication method.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The VHS then distributes multimedia broadcast programs via a local area network (LAN) to commercial and/or residential buildings <b>102</b> housing a gateway <b>104</b> (e.g., a residential gateway or RG). The LAN can represent a bank of digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAMs) located in a central office or a service area interface that provide broadband services over optical links or copper twisted pairs to buildings <b>102</b>. The gateway <b>104</b> distributes broadcast signals to media processors <b>106</b> such as Set-Top Boxes (STBs) which in turn present broadcast selections to media devices <b>108</b> such as computers or television sets managed in some instances by a media controller <b>107</b> (e.g., an infrared or RF remote control). Unicast traffic can also be exchanged between the media processors <b>106</b> and subsystems of the IPTV media system for services such as video-on-demand (VoD). It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the media devices <b>108</b> and/or portable communication devices <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be an integral part of the media processor <b>106</b> and can be communicatively coupled to the gateway <b>104</b>. In this particular embodiment, an integral device such as described can receive, respond, process and present multicast or unicast media content.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The IPTV media system can be coupled to one or more computing devices <b>130</b> a portion of which can operate as one or more common web servers for providing portal services over an Internet Service Provider (ISP) network <b>132</b> to fixed line media devices <b>108</b> or portable communication devices <b>116</b> by way of a wireless access point <b>117</b> providing Wireless Fidelity or WiFi services, or cellular communication services (e.g., GSM, CDMA, UMTS, WiMAX, etc.). One of said portals can correspond to a contact book management system (herein referred to as CBMS <b>130</b>). The CBMS <b>130</b> can be used for archiving, managing, and synchronizing contact books of a multiplicity of communication devices as described by method <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A satellite broadcast television system can be used in place of the IPTV media system. In this embodiment, signals transmitted by a satellite <b>115</b> can be intercepted by a satellite dish receiver <b>131</b> coupled to building <b>102</b> which conveys media signals to the media processors <b>106</b>. The media receivers <b>106</b> can be equipped with a broadband port to the ISP network <b>132</b>. Although not shown, the communication system <b>100</b> can also be combined or replaced with analog or digital broadcast distributions systems such as cable TV systems.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of a second communication system <b>200</b> for delivering media content. Communication system <b>200</b> can be overlaid or operably coupled with communication system <b>100</b> as another representative embodiment of said communication system. The system <b>200</b> includes a distribution switch/router system <b>228</b> at a central office <b>218</b>. The distribution switch/router system <b>228</b> receives video data via a multicast television stream <b>230</b> from a second distribution switch/router <b>234</b> at an intermediate office <b>220</b>. The multicast television stream <b>230</b> includes Internet Protocol (IP) data packets addressed to a multicast IP address associated with a television channel. The distribution switch/router system <b>228</b> can cache data associated with each television channel received from the intermediate office <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The distribution switch/router system <b>228</b> also receives unicast data traffic from the intermediate office <b>220</b> via a unicast traffic stream <b>232</b>. The unicast traffic stream <b>232</b> includes data packets related to devices located at a particular residence, such as the residence <b>202</b>. For example, the unicast traffic stream <b>232</b> can include data traffic related to a digital subscriber line, a telephone line, another data connection, or any combination thereof. To illustrate, the unicast traffic stream <b>232</b> can communicate data packets to and from a telephone <b>212</b> associated with a subscriber at the residence <b>202</b>. The telephone <b>212</b> can be a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone. To further illustrate, the unicast traffic stream <b>232</b> can communicate data packets to and from a personal computer <b>210</b> at the residence <b>202</b> via one or more data routers <b>208</b>. In an additional illustration, the unicast traffic stream <b>232</b> can communicate data packets to and from a set-top box device, such as the set-top box devices <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. The unicast traffic stream <b>232</b> can communicate data packets to and from the devices located at the residence <b>202</b> via one or more residential gateways <b>214</b> associated with the residence <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The distribution switch/router system <b>228</b> can send data to one or more access switch/router systems <b>226</b>. The access switch/router system <b>226</b> can include or be included within a service area interface <b>216</b>. In a particular embodiment, the access switch/router system <b>226</b> can include a DSLAM. The access switch/router system <b>226</b> can receive data from the distribution switch/router system <b>228</b> via a broadcast television (BTV) stream <b>222</b> and a plurality of unicast subscriber traffic streams <b>224</b>. The BTV stream <b>222</b> can be used to communicate video data packets associated with a multicast stream.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the BTV stream <b>222</b> can include a multicast virtual local area network (VLAN) connection between the distribution switch/router system <b>228</b> and the access switch/router system <b>226</b>.

To accomplish a communication session between CDs, an originating IMS CD <b>401</b> can submit a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP INVITE) message to an originating P-CSCF <b>404</b> which communicates with a corresponding originating S-CSCF <b>406</b>. The originating S-CSCF <b>406</b> can submit the SIP INVITE message to an application server (AS) such as reference <b>410</b> that can provide a variety of services to IMS subscribers. For example, the application server <b>410</b> can be used to perform originating treatment functions on the calling party number received by the originating S-CSCF <b>406</b> in the SIP INVITE message.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Originating treatment functions can include determining whether the calling party number has international calling services, and/or is requesting special telephony features (e.g., *72 forward calls, *73 cancel call forwarding, *67 for caller ID blocking, and so on). Additionally, the originating S-CSCF <b>406</b> can submit queries to the ENUM system <b>430</b> to translate an E.164 telephone number to a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) if the targeted communication device is IMS compliant.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts an exemplary method <b>700</b> operating in portions of communication systems <b>100</b>-<b>400</b>, and communication device <b>600</b> operating in said systems. Method <b>700</b> begins with step <b>702</b> in which the CBMS <b>130</b> opens a contact book account for a first communication device (CD) operating in one of the aforementioned communication systems. As described earlier, the first CD can represent a wireless or wireline communication device. As a wireless communication device, the first CD can represent a cellular phone, a cordless phone, a computer with WiFi communications, a wireless PDA, or another suitable wireless communication device. As a wireline communication device, the first CD can represent an STB capable of storing contact book information and processing calls, a tethered phone, a softphone operating from a computer tethered to a DSL line, and so on. The first CD can also represent a circuit-switched communication device (e.g., PSTN, or cellular), or a packet-switched communication device (e.g., VoIP). In sum, the first CD can represent any present or next generation communication device which is capable of engaging in a communication session (voice, text, or otherwise) with another communication device over a communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Step <b>702</b> can be invoked by the CBMS <b>130</b> responsive to a request received from the first CD over one of the aforementioned communication systems <b>100</b>-<b>400</b>, or from a user opening an account through portal <b>530</b> by common means (e.g., an Internet browser) and registering the first CD by providing a communication identifier (e.g., E.164, SIP URI, or other means of identification), name and address of user of the first CD, and so on. The contact book account can also include a profile of desired operations such as a synchronization schedule, an exception list to preclude merging of contacts book entries with contact books of other CDs, and so on. Once the contact book account is established, the first CD can upload in step <b>704</b> its contact book to the CBMS <b>130</b>. This step can occur responsive to a signal transmitted by the CBMS <b>130</b> to the first CD indicating that the contact book account is available to store its contact book. Once the contact book of the first CD is received, the CBMS <b>130</b> in step <b>706</b> stores it in the contact book account, and from thereon, maintains synchronicity between the stored copy and the local contact book copy of the first CD.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The CBMS <b>130</b> can employ any suitable synchronization protocol in step <b>706</b>. For example, the CBMS <b>130</b> and the first CD can employ a synchronization markup language (SyncML) protocol to maintain synchronicity. The SyncML protocol is defined by a standards body known as the Open Mobile Alliance (or OMA). Other suitable synchronization protocols can be applied to the present disclosure. The CBMS <b>130</b> can be programmed in step <b>706</b> to periodically monitor the status of the local contact book of the first CD according to a synchronization schedule established by the user of the first CD in step <b>702</b> during device registration.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In step <b>708</b>, the CBMS <b>130</b> can receive a request from a second CD to synchronize its contact book with the contact book of the first CD. The second CD can represent any one of the communication device embodiments identified for the first CD. The request submitted to the CBMS <b>130</b> by the second CD can include a communication identifier of the second CD (e.g., an E.164 telephone number or SIP URI) so that the CBMS can identify which contact book account the second CD is seeking to synchronize to. To authorize this request, the CBMS <b>130</b> can submit in step <b>710</b> a notice with an authorization indicator (such as a verification code) to the first CD. The notice can describe to the user of the first CD the request submitted by the second CD. As a security measure, the CBMS <b>130</b> can submit a request to the second CD in step <b>712</b> for the authentication indicator transmitted to the first CD.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The authorization indicator can represent a personal identification number, an alphabetic string, a numeric string, an alphanumeric string, or any other suitable indicator that can uniquely identify the authentication process taking place. The authorization indicator is transmitted by the CBMS <b>130</b> to the first CD since the user of the first CD is the owner of the contact book account, and thereby can decide whether to provide the user of the second CD access to enter the authentication indicator in the second CD responsive to the request submitted in step <b>712</b>. Transmitting the authentication indicator to the first CD provides the CBMS <b>130</b> a means to authenticate that the user of the second CD is the same as the user of the second CD, or if the users are different, that the user of the first CD authorizes the user of the second CD to synchronize its contact book with the contact book of the first CD.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step <b>714</b>, the CBMS <b>130</b> receives an authentication indicator from the second CD. If CBMS <b>130</b> determines that the authentication indicator is valid by way of for example detecting a match between the received authentication indicator and the authentication indicator transmitted to the first CD, then the CBMS proceeds to step <b>718</b> where it notifies the second CD that it has been authorized to synchronize its contact book with the contact book of the first CD. Otherwise, the CBMS <b>130</b> proceeds from step <b>716</b> to step <b>712</b> where it informs the second CD of the failed attempt and requests resubmission of the authorization indicator. The CBMS <b>130</b> can be programmed to limit the number of failed attempts by the second CD to provide the authentication indicator. When such a limit is reached, the CBMS <b>130</b> can cease present and future communications with the second CD.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Once the second CD receives an indication in step <b>718</b> that synchronization has been authorized, the second CD transmits its contact book to the CBMS <b>130</b> which receives it in step <b>720</b>. The CBMS <b>130</b> can then determine in step <b>722</b> if an exception list has been established. An exception list can be defined by the user of the first CD in step <b>702</b>, or during any point in time by accessing the portal <b>530</b>. The exception list can be used to identify one or more entries in the contact book of the first or second CDs which are not to be merged during synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">If such an exception list exists, the CBMS <b>130</b> can proceed to step <b>724</b> and synchronize the contact books of the first and second CDs according to the established exception list, thereby precluding the merger of one or more entries identified in said list. The synchronized contact books can then be stored by the CBMS <b>130</b> in the contact book account of the first CD. If an exception list has not been established, the CBMS <b>130</b> can proceed to step <b>726</b> where it synchronizes all entries of the first and second contact books without exception, and stores the result in the contact book account. In step <b>728</b>, the CBMS <b>130</b> can direct the synchronization of the updated contact book in the contact book account with the local contact books of the first and second CDs. Step <b>728</b> can be executed at different times for each CD.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, the first CD may have established in step <b>702</b> a synchronization schedule that is to occur only in the evening. The CBMS <b>130</b> can automatically establish a synchronization schedule for the second CD which calls for synchronization of the second CD periodically in the evening, and upon detecting a change in the local contact book of the second CD, the local contact book of the first CD, or the contact book stored in the contact book account. The user of the first CD can access the portal <b>530</b> at any time and modify the synchronization schedules of each of the first and second CDs to accommodate different synchronization schedules.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step <b>730</b>, the CBMS <b>130</b> can monitor updates made to the local contact book of the second CD, the local contact book of the first CD, or the contact book stored in the contact book account. If a change is detected, the CBMS <b>130</b> can be directed to steps <b>722</b>-<b>728</b> as previously described to re-synchronize at least a pair of the three contact book copies according to the respective synchronization schedules of the first and second CDs.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be noted that the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; as used above are illustrative can be interchanged without adversely affecting method <b>700</b> as described.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Upon reviewing the aforementioned embodiments, it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that said embodiments can be modified, reduced, or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described below. For example, method <b>700</b> can be adapted to synchronize more than one contact book of the second CD with the contact book of the first CD. Suppose for example that the second CD is a personal home phone with multiple contact books, each contact book assigned to a different user in a multi-user household. In this illustration, the second CD can request the CBMS <b>130</b> to synchronize in whole or in part more than one of its contact books with the contact book of the first CD stored in the contact book account.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In yet another embodiment method <b>700</b> can be adapted to manage multiple contact books from both the first and second CDs. That is, suppose the first CD also has more than one contact book. The CBMS <b>130</b> can be programmed to open separate contact book accounts for each contact book of the first CD. The CBMS <b>130</b> can be directed by the user of the first CD to assign synchronization of each contact book of the second CD to a respective contact book account of the first CD.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment, method <b>700</b> can be adapted so that the verification steps (<b>710</b>-<b>716</b>) are executed only once. Hence after the second CD has been authorized to synchronize its one or more contact books with the first CD, an authorization indicator will not be requested of the second CD in subsequent synchronization cycles, or in the instance in which the second CD adds another contact book to be synchronized with the one or more contact books of the first CD.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In yet another embodiment, method <b>700</b> can be adapted so that instead of asking the second CD to provide the authorization indicator, the user of the first CD responds with an acknowledgment authorizing the synchronization. In this embodiment, the authentication indicator requested of the first CD by the CBMS <b>130</b> can be a simple response to a prompt provided with the notice of step <b>710</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Select OK if you authorize synchronization of the contact book of the second CD.&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Other suitable modifications can be applied to the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the claims below. Accordingly, the reader is directed to the claims section for a fuller understanding of the breadth and scope of the present disclosure.</p>
