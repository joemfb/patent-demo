<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to U.S. patent application entitled &#x201c;High Efficiency Actuator Method, System and Apparatus&#x201d;, U.S. application Ser. No. 12/705,995 filed on Feb. 16, 2010 and U.S. patent application entitled &#x201c;Passive Variable Impedance Control for an Actuator&#x201d;, U.S. application Ser. No. 12/705,993 filed on Feb. 16, 2010 both of which are assigned to the same assignee as the assignee herein and hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to actuators, and more particularly to passive variable impedance control for an actuator for use in a variety of applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Actuators typically are mechanical devices that are used for moving or controlling a mechanism or system and typically convert energy into some type of motion. Examples of actuators can be found in any number of applications encountered in every day life including automotive, aviation, construction, farming, factories, robots, health care, and prosthetics, among other areas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Every mechanical system designed to move or control a mechanism or system must have one or more &#x201c;prime movers&#x201d; to provide the work needed and one or more &#x201c;transmissions&#x201d; to convey the work from the prime mover to the object that is desired to be moved. Prime movers typically convert electrical or chemical energy to mechanical energy in the form of forces and displacements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of prime movers may include combustion engines, electric motors, biological/artificial muscles, piezo-electrics, shape-memory-alloys, magnetostrictives and dielectrics, among others. Examples of transmissions may include levers, linkages, wheels, gears, pneumatics and hydraulics, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hydraulic systems are generally known and typically include an actuator and one or more valves in fluid communication with a pump that provides fluid to the system at a fixed pressure. Such systems tend to be very inefficient, costly and noisy. This is particularly true in hydraulic systems that rely on &#x201c;throttling&#x201d; of fluid through a valve to provide control in the system where fluid is transitioned from high to low pressure without extracting the energy as useful work but instead wasting that energy primarily in the form of heat.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method of flexibly controlling a system including determining control policies for a system having at least one qualitative state goal for the system to achieve, determining a first current qualitative state of the system and generating a qualitative control and state trajectory, provided the current system state is capable of achieving the at least one goal, that enables the system to proceed from the current state to the goal state in the most cost effective and energy efficient manner to conserve power while maintaining any necessary operational constraints on the system.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention will be described in detail with reference to embodiments that represent examples of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Although specific elements and configurations are described to provide an understanding of the invention, it is to be understood that the specific embodiments, elements and configurations provided are for illustrative purposes only. Other configurations will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the teachings of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is directed to smart hydraulic actuators (SHAs), a term coined by applicants that achieve shock absorption and energy efficiencies, among other features, with superior controllability using novel integrated valves, pressure sensors, accumulators, computer controlled pumps and advanced control algorithms as described in detail herein. Such a system can provide a hydraulic or pneumatic system with more than many times the power density of non-hydraulic or pneumatic systems while achieving the same or even better efficiency. Since hydraulic systems typically are very inefficient with the majority of energy being wasted, providing a hydraulic system having an efficiency equal to or greater than other systems, such as systems having electric motors, is an incredible, novel advance in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an electronic system, for example, the weight of the individual motors, batteries and transmissions is very high while the power output is low thereby providing a low power density. In a system that requires multiple motors, batteries and transmissions, such as a robot where each joint typically has such a requirement, the power density is even less.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a pneumatic system, the compressibility of air provides another variable that may be somewhat harder to control, particularly when fine motor control is needed. The success of such systems can depend on the load to be lifted where low loads may be readily accommodated but for higher loads the compressibility of air becomes more of a factor and fine motion control is more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Robots typically are only capable of the lightest of labor due primarily to the poor power density achievable in high degree of freedom systems having many joints where a separate motor or prime mover is used for each joint. The present invention enables many times improvement in power density by using a transmission system, such as a hydraulic or pneumatic system for example, that allows one prime mover to provide power to many joints at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In use, rarely, if ever, does a robot need to use all its joints at full power at the same time. Thus, the present invention provides an opportunity to share a prime mover among several joints by using a transmission that can split and transmit the work provided by the primer mover to several joints simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention also allows for energy recapture, as described below, thereby providing additional energy savings in a variety of applications such as robotics, automotive, aviation and construction, among other areas. Systems that provide for energy recapture are of most interest in today's environment since they can reduce energy consumption thereby providing a &#x201c;green&#x201d; alternative to traditional systems.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the system of the present invention that is generally illustrated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> utilized in conjunction with a hydraulic application. The main components of the system <b>10</b> include an actuator <b>12</b>, a plurality of valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d</i>, two accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>, a CPU or other computing device or the like <b>18</b>, a computer controllable variable output pump <b>20</b> and a fluid reservoir <b>22</b>. Although the system <b>10</b> in this embodiment is illustrated with regard to a hydraulic application, it is to be understood that the system <b>10</b> can be employed with other non-hydraulic applications if desired and the particular components used as well as the number and position of those components may vary so long as they fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As mentioned above, an actuator typically is some type of mechanical device used for moving or controlling a mechanism or system and typically converts energy into some type of motion. Examples of actuators can be found in any number of applications encountered in every day life including automotive, aviation, construction, farming, factories, robots, health care, and prosthetics, among other areas.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although designs may vary, a hydraulic or pneumatic actuator typically takes the form of actuator <b>12</b> where a piston <b>24</b> is positioned within a cylinder or chamber <b>26</b> with the end <b>28</b> of a connecting rod <b>30</b> of the piston <b>24</b> extending to the outside of the chamber <b>26</b>. The piston <b>24</b> is moved back and forth within the chamber <b>26</b> so that the rod end <b>28</b> can contact various members external to the actuator <b>12</b> (not illustrated) to provide the desired effect.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">One example of the use of such an actuator <b>12</b> would be in robotics (not illustrated) where the rod end <b>28</b> typically is connected to another member, say for an arm joint or other type of structure. By moving the rod end <b>28</b> back and forth the robot arm can be raised and lowered a desired amount. Complex mobile robots can have dozens of actuators <b>12</b> used to provide various motions to the robot. The system <b>10</b> of the present invention, when utilized with a complex robot or the like, enables a plurality of actuators <b>12</b> to be controlled by the same hydraulic fluid and control system thereby reducing the number of components and overall weight, among other benefits, and providing uses that previously have been at least impractical if not impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A number of pressure sensors <b>32</b> can be employed at various points within the system <b>10</b>, each sensor <b>32</b> being connected to the CPU <b>18</b>. A filter <b>34</b> may also be included if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the actuator <b>12</b> of the present invention designed as a single component having at least the valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d</i>, accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>and sensors <b>32</b> integrally formed with the actuator <b>12</b> as one member and in communication with the CPU <b>18</b>. This arrangement, which readily may vary, provides additional efficiencies to the system <b>10</b> as will be described in more detail below. It is to be noted that the location and construction of accumulators <b>16</b> and valves <b>14</b> can vary widely and a compressible working fluid may be utilized with the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d </i>preferably are small, efficient valves that can be of any design so long as they accomplish their intended task. Although poppet valves have been used with success in testing, any other valve may be utilized without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>preferably are &#x201c;passive&#x201d; accumulators that provide the desired impedance or compliance control of the system <b>10</b> without requiring any additional energy from the system <b>10</b>. The accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>also provide energy recovery as described in more detail below and may have a control valve (not illustrated) associated therewith and in communication with the CPU <b>18</b>. The accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are illustrated being in the form of a spring biased piston <b>36</b>, but the design of the accumulators <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>can vary so long as they provide the intended function as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The CPU <b>18</b> can be any desired type of CPU so long as it can execute the software and novel algorithms necessary to monitor and control the system <b>10</b> as desired. The pump <b>20</b> preferably is a variable pressure pump, such as an electric variable pressure pump, that can be controlled by the CPU <b>18</b>. The reservoir <b>22</b> preferably is selected to perform according to the requirements of the system <b>10</b> and typically is a sealed reservoir (not illustrated). It is to be understood, however, that the size, type and design of the CPU <b>18</b>, pump <b>20</b> and reservoir <b>22</b> can vary without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The smart system <b>10</b> of the present invention relies on at least three key design modifications to provide the unique features of the present invention. First, rather than running the pump <b>20</b> at a constant high pressure, the pump <b>20</b> is only run to provide the pressure needed at the moment and, as much as possible, move few actuators <b>12</b> at the same time to reduce throttling losses, if any, among other features.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Second, instead of merely managing the pressure in and out of one side of the actuator <b>12</b> only, manage the pressure on each side of the actuator <b>12</b> independently. This not only allows for more precise control but enables true passive impedance control, maximizes energy savings and allows for energy recapture.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Finally, the control valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d </i>in the present invention are positioned as close as possible to the actuator <b>12</b> and may be integrally formed with the actuator <b>12</b> themselves as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This leads to increased responsiveness due to shorter fluid travel distances along with a decrease in piping losses due to friction or the like both of which can be substantial and contribute to &#x201c;dead-band&#x201d; (described in more detail below) which prevents precise control of the actuator <b>12</b> and severely limits use of hydraulic actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Conventional hydraulic systems (not illustrated) typically are inefficient, large, heavy, noisy and expensive since they tend to emphasize controllability at the sake of these other factors, among others. These over sized, constant maximum-pressure systems tend to provide a pump powerful enough to supply the maximum flow needed for all actuators that might be on at the same time while maintaining the set, very high system pressure to avoid the problem of pressure fluctuations as valves are opened and closed and essentially decouples actuators to simplify control problems.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although such over sized/max pressure systems may reduce control problems associated with coupling actuators together (i.e. having one system influence more than one actuator <b>12</b> as in the present invention) controllability of the individual valves is sacrificed. More particularly, it is more difficult to control fluids a higher pressures differentials. On the other hand, since its simply easier to control fluids at lower pressure differentials as in the present invention than at higher pressure differentials providing fine motion control is much easier at such lower pressure differentials. In addition, it is relatively harder to control flow with hydraulic valves compared to controlling the flow of fluid with a pump providing an incentive to control fluid flow at the pump as much as possible as in the present invention particularly when fine motion control is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It also is to be noted that coupling multiple actuators to a single source of fluid supply is typically avoided by hydraulics and even pneumatic systems. Existing systems fight to keep the system at a high pressure. There is no interest in coupling actuators in such systems since it would be harder to control these systems. As explained in more detail below, the present invention teaches away from the mainstream thinking by coupling actuators to enjoy several advantages not possible with existing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">By running the pump <b>20</b> only at the pressure needed at the moment a number of advantages are provided by the present invention. Since the majority of the noise that may be generated by the system <b>10</b> typically is provided by the prime mover such as the pump <b>20</b>, by keeping the pressure lower the pump <b>20</b> runs less and contributes less noise.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additionally, running at a lower pressures more of the time is easier on the overall system <b>10</b> including the lifetime of the components of the system <b>10</b> and reduces potential leaks since not running at a high pressure all the time. Thus, the system <b>10</b> of the present invention addresses noise and leakage that are at least two concerns with hydraulic and sometimes pneumatic systems.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Long hoses or pipes running from valves to actuators limits the responsiveness of the actuator since pressure waves in fluids flow at the speed of sound while the electrical impulse to open or close the valve travels at the speed of light. Positioning the valves as close as possible to the hydraulic cylinders, as in the present invention, increases the response time in addition to reducing the inertial effects (controllability) and frictional losses (efficiency) of the long narrow hoses running between the valves and the cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Eliminating or at least reducing &#x201c;dead-band&#x201d; (areas where no action occurs) in actuators is an important feature of the present invention which enables more precise controllability of the actuators. In systems with any dead-band any type of controllability is significantly reduced if not impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By using poppet valves, dead-band can be dramatically reduced if not essentially eliminated. In other types of valves, in moving from one state or position to another an intermediate position frequently must be traversed by the valve member which provides significant delays or dead-band in the operation of such valves. As can readily be understood, the more dead-band there is in a valve the less control is provided by a system.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The key modifications of the present invention as noted above, among other modifications, provides the unique features not present in existing systems. The combination of the key modifications and other features of the present invention represents a significant advancement in the art while opening up completely new areas of applications not previously considered due to the problems of such existing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Providing a multitude of states of operation is another important feature of the present invention that contributes to more precise controllability of the actuators. In systems having actuators with only 3 possible states of operation (closed, side one to pressure and side 2 to tank, or side 2 to pressure and side 1 to tank) are quite limited in their controllability and, unlike the system <b>10</b> of the present invention, do not provide an opportunity to manage the pressure on both sides of the cylinder at the same time in a variable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Impedance control in systems is also a desirable feature provided by the present invention since it enables some flexibility in the object being manipulated by an actuator. For example, in a robot arm it frequently is desirable to provide the arm with some flexibility, as opposed to being completely stiff, to reduce any damage or injury to objects or beings that may come in contact with the robot arm. Accumulators in a hydraulic system are seen as the equivalent of capacitors in an electronic system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With the integrated accumulators <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>and individual valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d </i>controlling each side of the piston <b>24</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> the present invention will be able to precisely control not only the position of the piston <b>24</b> but also the passive compliance of each joint or joints (not illustrated) associated with one or more actuators <b>12</b> to provide the desired impedance control. At the same time, dead-band typically from valves will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Additionally, the accumulators <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the present invention achieve adjustable &#x201c;passive&#x201d; impedance control since it utilizes the physics of compliant elements and accumulators to achieve the desired spring characteristic and requires no additional energy. Conversely, &#x201c;active&#x201d; impedance control approaches typically move the actuators in such a way as to mimic compliance characteristics that may be flexible, but requires high bandwidth control and requires constant injection of energy to move the actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The system <b>10</b> of the present invention also enables a form of active impedance control by at least manipulating the appropriate valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d </i>to allow the fluid to flow to other parts of the system <b>10</b>, including both sides of the piston <b>24</b> of the actuator <b>12</b>. As described in more detail below, this form of active impedance can be combined with passive impedance to enhance shock absorption, among other benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A number of tests have been performed to evaluate the use of the accumulators <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the present invention to achieve the desired adjustable passive impedance control. In these tests, the accumulators <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>were connected as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the cylinder <b>26</b> pressure was set independently on either side of the piston of the actuator <b>12</b>. An external load (not illustrated) was applied to the actuator <b>12</b> resulting in a displacement of the actuator <b>12</b>. By measuring the displacement of the actuator <b>12</b> from the load as well as the load itself, the spring constant for a particular charge pressure was determined as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The results of this testing illustrate that a wide range of passive compliance can be achieved with the actuator <b>12</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is to be noted that when the system <b>10</b> of the present invention is used to move a member, such as a robot arm, for example, the robot arm can move in free space and can be somewhat &#x201c;floppy&#x201d; as opposed to a completely rigid robot arm. This is very important in robotic and other applications where the system may be exposed to some type of impact either from the movement of the robot arm or from an external object or projectile that may hit the robot arm or similar member.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Generally speaking, hydraulic fluid is relatively stiff and a piston rod of an actuator typically is rigidly attached to another member, such as a robot arm or leg, for example. If such an arm is subjected to an impact, a spike in the pressure of the system can cause a leak, break the piston or cause damage to other system components.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the present invention, the pressure spike provided by an impact is reduced or eliminated before it can cause a leak or damage to the components of the system <b>10</b>. This is accomplished by enabling at least the accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>to passively store the energy from the pressure spike. In situations where the pressure spike may be quite large, the accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>spread out the pressure event and buy a fractional amount of time to enable the system <b>10</b> to provide additional passive or active impedance control and absorb and/or store the larger pressure spike.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, the accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>enable the system <b>10</b> to absorb a higher displacement of the piston <b>24</b> of the actuator <b>12</b> in nano-seconds without damaging the components of the system <b>10</b>. The accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>preferably are designed to be large enough to enable enough time to allow the system <b>10</b> to switch from passive impedance provided by the accumulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>to active impedance provided by the valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When hydraulic fluid transitions from a high pressure to a lower pressure (such as through a valve, orifice or the like) without extracting the energy as useful work, the energy is wasted as heat. This transition is known as &#x201c;trotttling&#x201d; and creates substantial inefficiencies and should be avoided whenever possible when energy efficiency is important.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As an example, when a hydraulic system is used to raise objects of various weights the system fluid pressure may be maintained at 500 psi or more selected in anticipation of the maximum load or weight the system may be required to move. When the weight being lifted is approximately equal to the system pressure, only minimal fluid energy is lost to heat.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In contrast, when the weight being lifted is less than the system pressure a substantial amount of the fluid energy is lost to heat, typically from throttling, whereby substantially more total energy is used than is necessary to lift the lighter weight. In many applications using ten times more energy (or higher) than is necessary to lift the lighter weight is typical.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Since this excessive energy is in the form of heat, the heat can build up quickly and must be adequately dissipated to avoid affecting system performance or failure. Traditionally, dissipating heat is achieved by providing a large fluid reservoir that enables the fluid to cool down. Providing large fluid reservoirs for cooling is not possible in many applications, such as mobile robotics, and has severely limited the use of hydraulics in may environments that could benefit from the advantages of hydraulics.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Energy inefficiencies also exist in traditional hydraulic applications due to friction in small diameter fluid lines or pipes that typically have long lengths joining the fluid reservoir to the valves and back. It readily can be shown that for every extra inch or length of a 3/16&#x2033; diameter pipe or hose an additional 8 watts of fluid pumping power is required that can lead to the loss of over 1300 watts just in piping losses for a complex hydraulic system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When a transmission system, such as a hydraulic system or the like, is actuated to lift an object say off the ground to a particular height a portion of the energy used to lift the object is converted to gravitational potential energy now stored in the object just lifted. If the system has a 50% efficiency rating, essentially half of the energy was wasted, likely as heat, and half is still stored as potential energy in the object.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the system is actuated to later set the object back down on the ground, it stands to reason that the system should expend less energy to do so. In most systems, however, particularly hydraulic systems, it typically takes just as much energy to place the object down as it did to lift it up since pressure alone is used to both raise and lower the object without being able to take advantage of the gravitational potential energy stored in the object.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Due to the unique arrangement of the system <b>10</b> of the present invention, recapturing this gravitational potential energy can be accomplished. The smart control system <b>10</b> and valve arrangement of the present invention, among other features, can independently connect either side of the hydraulic cylinder <b>26</b> to either pressure or tank/reservoir <b>22</b> to create the possibility of energy recapture. For example, the system <b>10</b> can connect both sides of the cylinder <b>26</b> or actuator <b>12</b> to tank/reservoir <b>22</b> allowing gravity to pull the object down while the cylinder <b>26</b> acts as damper to control the rate of fall of the object.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The system <b>10</b> can also connect both sides of the cylinder <b>26</b> or actuator <b>12</b> to pressure from the pump <b>20</b> which, depending on the orientation of the cylinder <b>26</b>, will either waste a little energy than gravity would pull the object down on its own or instead recapture energy by forcing some of the high pressure hydraulic fluid back into other parts of the system <b>10</b>. Finally, the system <b>10</b> can connect one side of the cylinder <b>26</b> or actuator <b>12</b> to pressure and one side to tank/reservoir <b>22</b> thereby pushing the complete volume of fluid back into the high pressure system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Variables with these operations include how fast the object is to be moved, the current system pressure and whether one or more joints are operating at the same time that could make immediate use of the high pressure fluid, among other variables.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, the system <b>10</b> of the present invention may also provide additional energy recovery and storage capabilities by including one or more additional central accumulators <b>38</b>. The accumulator <b>38</b> may preferably include valve <b>40</b> that can be controlled by the CPU <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When an actuator <b>12</b> is used to move another member, such as a robot arm, for example, the arm can be susceptible to impact as described above. On impact of the arm from another object, the piston <b>24</b> in the actuator <b>12</b> acts like a pump and puts pressure in the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When this occurs, the valve <b>40</b> can be opened to allow the pressure surge or spike to be absorbed and captured by the central accumulator <b>38</b>. Thereafter, the valve <b>40</b> can be closed to keep the energy captured within the accumulator <b>38</b> to be stored therein.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the future, if the system <b>10</b> needs additional pressure rather than run the pump <b>20</b> to provide the higher pressure the valve <b>40</b> can be opened and the stored energy within the central accumulator <b>38</b> can be released to the system <b>10</b>. This essentially provides a power boost to enable the system <b>10</b> to run at a higher pressure without expending any additional energy.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Similarly, when a force is pulling on the piston rod <b>30</b> the increase in pressure in the system <b>10</b> can be used in other portions of the system <b>10</b> particularly if the system <b>10</b> is coupled to additional actuators <b>12</b>. For example, assume the rod <b>30</b> is connected to a robot arm that is holding a weight and gravity pulls on the arm and in turn the rod <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If higher pressure is needed elsewhere in the system <b>10</b>, such as by another actuator (not illustrated) there is no need to run the pump <b>20</b> since the valves <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>14</b><i>d </i>can be activated to supply the needed higher pressure. In such a situation, the system <b>10</b> can let the external force provided by gravity maintain the system <b>10</b> at the current desired pressure or provide an increase in pressure as described.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although various systems can be used for various applications, when a high strength mobile system is needed a hydraulic system typically is preferred. Such systems can provide very high power transmission rates since they can parlay the power initially provided to the pump into energy increases thousands of times greater.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition to the unique arrangement of the system <b>10</b> as described above, applicant's contend that a hydraulic system with ten times the power density of non-hydraulic systems while achieving equivalent or even better efficiency and controllability than non-hydraulic systems is achievable according to the teachings of the present invention. More particularly, by combining the unique system <b>10</b> of the present invention with task flexibility at the planning and control levels significant opportunities exist for revolutionary improvement to hydraulic or similar systems.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, assume a robot (not illustrated) needs to lift, move and place an object. To accomplish this task, a designer would calculate a precise path in 3D space for the robot's end effector or &#x201c;hand&#x201d; to follow expending a significant amount of energy to move the object along the exact path without deviation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The main constraint with existing approaches is the strict requirement that the robot follow the exact path. In reality, the only real requirements are that the robot lift the object and place it in the desired spot within an acceptable amount of time. The path taken (assuming obstacles are avoided) is not important.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This is a subtle but important distinction because it allows for potentially significant control flexibility. For example, the system could move the load along a path that allowed each cylinder to operate near peak efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Although allowing for this &#x201c;task flexibility&#x201d; seems relatively straight forward, it is quite complicated, particularly for mobile systems with complex robot arms, and requires a new cutting edge control system that has the ability to take numerous factors into account when automatically planning paths for the robot arms to follow. This type of new control system has been developed by one of the applicants herein and is known as a Qualitative State Plan (QSP) as described in more detail in &#x201c;Robust Execution of Bipedal Walking Tasks from Biomechanical Principles&#x201d;, A. Hoffman, Ph.D. Thesis, MIT, 2005 and &#x201c;Exploiting Spatial and Temporal Flexibility for Plan Execution of Hybrid, Under-actuated Systems&#x201d;, A. Hoffman and B. Williams, AAAI 2006 the disclosures of both of these being hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Briefly, a QSP represents plans with temporal and spatial flexibility for hybrid discrete/continuous systems such as mobile robots, for example. It is to be understood, however, that a QSP can be applied to a variety of applications if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A QSP consists of a sequence of qualitative states which correspond to discrete operating modes of the system. Each qualitative state has an associated set of continuous dynamic characteristics, a set of temporal and spatial goals, and a set of operating constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Using the above example of a robot needing to lift, move and place an object, key state variables are positions of the hydraulic actuators. Temporal goals are useful for specifying that the state be in a goal region at an acceptable time. The execution system must check that the specified temporal constraints are reasonable; that they are consistent with the temporal limitations arising form the dynamics and actuation limits.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Transitions from one qualitative state to another are defined by events. Events represent temporal boundaries that can be restricted by temporal constraints. Goal regions for qualitative states define requirements for transition from one qualitative state to the next. The role of the QSP Executive is to exploit the flexibility in the QSP constraints in order to maximize optimization criteria such as energy efficiency, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In analyzing a state space to determine feasible trajectories and optimal control policies, sets of feasible trajectories called &#x201c;flow tubes&#x201d; are computed which lead from one qualitative state to another. Multi-Parametric Programming, based on the concept of a Linear Quadratic Regulator, optimally forms state-space regions using convex polytopes and computes optimal control policies for each.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Applicants have utilized multi-parametric programming, combined with a novel temporal constraint compilation technique to compute flow tubes and optimal control policies for humanoid robots. In applying this technique, goal flexibility was used to compensate for disturbances (such as tripping of the robot, for example) and limited actuation.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the present invention, a similar approach can be employed for the system <b>10</b> except goal flexibility is utilized to maximize energy efficiency as well. Here, the problem formulation for this technique consists of a QSP, a dynamic model and a cost function, all of which may vary, that minimized pressure drops across valves in order to maximize efficiency. The resulting control policy recognizes whether the current system state is valid for achieving the goals, and if so, generates a control and state trajectory from the current state to a goal state that minimizes costs and observes operational constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Many of the features of the present invention along with additional information is provided in applicant's white paper entitled &#x201c;Advanced Hydraulics for Mobile Robots&#x201d; (pages 1-12) which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
