<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the Patent Korean Application Nos. 10-2005-0092367, 10-2005-0092368, 10-2005-0092369, 10-2005-0092370, and 10-2005-0092371 filed on Sep. 30, 2005, which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a drum type washing machine, more particularly, to a drum type washing machine having an improved structure of a driving part.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a drum type washing machine is classified into an indirect drive motor drum type washing machine and a direct drive motor drum type washing machine. In the indirect drive motor drum type washing machine, driving power of a motor is indirectly transmitted to a drum via a motor pulley and a belt wound around a drum pulley. Whereas, in the direct drive motor drum type washing machine, a rotor of a BLDC motor (Brushless DC motor) is directly connected to a drum to transmit driving power of a motor to a drum.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The indirect drive motor drum type washing machine may cause energy loss or severe noise in the process of transmitting the driving power, because the driving power is not directly transmitted to the drum, but indirectly transmitted to the drum via the motor pulley and the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, to solve the above problem, demands for a direct drive motor drum type washing machine (hereinafter, a DDM drum type washing machine) have been accordingly increasing, which adapts a BLDC motor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a structure of a conventional DDM drum washing machine will be described briefly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is longitudinally sectional view of a conventional drum type washing machine. The conventional drum type washing machine includes a cabinet <b>1</b>, a tub <b>2</b> mounted within the cabinet <b>1</b> and a drum rotatably mounted within a center of the tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A motor having a stator <b>6</b> and a rotor <b>5</b> is mounted in a rear of the tub <b>2</b>. The stator <b>6</b> is fixed to a rear wall of the tub <b>2</b> and the rotor <b>5</b> is fastened to the drum <b>3</b> by a shaft <b>4</b>, passing through the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cut-away perspective view illustrating some portion of a rear wall of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, a bearing housing <b>7</b> is provided in the rear wall center of the tub <b>2</b> to support a bearing as well as to fasten the stator <b>6</b> to the tub <b>2</b>. The bearing is installed on each outer circumferential surface of both terminal ends of a shaft <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rear wall of the tub <b>2</b> includes a step part <b>21</b> and a non-step part <b>22</b>. A fastening part <b>23</b>, which will be described later, is stepped on a center portion of the step part <b>21</b>, where the bearing housing <b>7</b> is provided, to be fastened to the stator <b>6</b>. A plurality of reinforcement ribs <b>22</b><i>a </i>are formed on the non-step part <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an exterior of the stator <b>6</b>. The conventional stator <b>6</b> includes a core part <b>61</b> having a ring shape for winding a coil <b>66</b> thereto, an insulator <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>, a hall sensor assembly <b>64</b> and a tap housing assembly <b>65</b> for power connection.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The insulator <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> includes a first insulator <b>62</b> and a second insulator <b>63</b> for covering an upper and lower surface of the core part <b>6</b>. A plurality of projection parts <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>a </i>are projected toward a center of the first and second insulator <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> to form a fastening hole <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>therein. The projection part <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>a </i>may be formed as one body with the first and second insulator <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>, or alternatively some portion of the core part <b>61</b> may projected to form the projection part <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each fastening hole <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>is fastened to the fastening part <b>22</b> of the tub rear wall by a bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">At that time, a plurality of position determination protrusions <b>62</b><i>c </i>are formed on the projection part <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the first insulator <b>62</b> to determine the position where the stator <b>6</b> is fastened to the tub <b>2</b>. A plurality of position determination holes <b>23</b><i>a </i>are formed on the fastening part <b>23</b> of the tub rear wall to insert the position determination protrusions <b>62</b><i>c </i>therein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, after the position of the stator <b>6</b> is determined by the position determination protrusions <b>62</b><i>c </i>and holes <b>23</b><i>a</i>, the stator <b>6</b> and the tub <b>2</b> are fastened each other through the fastening holes <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>63</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, since in the fastening structure between the stator <b>6</b> and the tub <b>2</b> each position determination protrusion <b>62</b><i>c </i>is formed in a pin shape having a narrow diameter, there is a problem that the position determination protrusion <b>62</b><i>c </i>may be easily damaged during the assembly or the transportation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Due to the damage of the position determination protrusion <b>62</b><i>c</i>, the process of fastening the stator <b>6</b> to the tub <b>2</b> may not be performed smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Specifically, in a drum type washing machine which directly rotates a drum <b>3</b> by using a BLDC motor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the stator <b>6</b> is directly fastened to a fixed portion of the tub rear wall. But, since the weight of only the stator is 1.5 kg and the spinning rotation speed of a motor for a drum type washing machine having a large capacity is 600&#x2dc;2,000 RPM. Thus, the fastening portion between the stator <b>6</b> and the tub <b>2</b> is easily damaged due to the weight of the stator <b>6</b>, vibration in high speed rotation, and shake/deformity of the rotor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still more, since in a drum type washing machine which uses a BLDC motor and fastens the stator <b>6</b> to the tub <b>2</b>, the radius direction of the stator <b>6</b> is perpendicular to the floor, the damage of the fastening portion between the stator <b>6</b> and the tub <b>2</b> may getting severed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Accordingly, a tub supporter (not shown) made of metal for covering most of the tub rear wall should be arranged between the tub <b>2</b> and the stator <b>6</b> to prevent the damage. However, in that case, an additional assembly work for fastening the tub supporter to the tub rear wall should be added, such that a disadvantage of low productivity may be caused thereby.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a drum type washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An object of the present invention is to provide a drum type washing machine which has an improved structure of a driving part.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a drum type washing machine includes a tub having a fastening part formed on a rear wall thereof; a stator fastened to the fastening part of the tub, the stator having a core part having teeth formed thereon, a coil wound around the teeth, a first insulator for covering a front surface of the core part and a second insulator for covering a rear surface of the core part; a rotor provided in an outer portion of the stator to be comprised in a motor together with a stator; a stator rib formed on an inner front surface of the first insulator with respect to the radial direction of the portion of the first insulator where the coil is wound; and a supporting part provided on a rear wall of the tub to support the stator rib when the stator is fastening to the fastening part of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Here, the stator rib may include a partition rib for separating the portion where the stator is fastened to the fastening part from the portion where the coil is wounded.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The supporting part may include a supporting rib for supporting an inner wall of the partition rib when the stator is fastened to the fastening part of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A plurality of step parts and non-step parts may be formed on the rear wall of the tub in a radial direction the step part may be a portion where a bearing housing is provided and the non-step part may be a portion where the bearing housing is not provided.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Here, the supporting rib may be provided on the non-step part of the tub or formed on the non-step part as one body.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A plurality of reinforcement beads may be formed in the non-step part to reinforce strength of the non-step part, and the supporting rib is fixed to each reinforcement bead. Alternatively, the supporting rib may be formed as one body with the reinforcement bead.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The supporting rib may be provided as an auxiliary piece separated from the tub to be fastened to the non-step part of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The supporting rib may be positioned in the partition rib and high enough to be contacted with an inner wall of the partition wall, not contacted with a front surface of the first insulator when the stator is fastened to the fastening part of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The supporting part may further include a sub-supporting rib for cover an outer wall of the partition rib when the stator is fastened to the fastening part of the tub. Alternatively, the supporting part may include only the sub-supporting rib, because the stator is fixed to the rear wall of the tub with being approximately perpendicular to the floor. Thus, if the supporting part supports the inner wall of the partition rib, the supporting part provided in an upper portion of the stator can fully support the partition rib and the supporting part provided in a lower portion of the stator cannot fully support the partition rib enough. Whereas, if the supporting rib supports the outer wall of the partition rib, the supporting part provided in the upper portion of the stator cannot fully support the partition rib. However, the supporting part provided in the lower portion of the stator can fully support the partition rib.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, it is preferred that the supporting part may include both the supporting rib and the sub-supporting rib, and the supporting part may include either of the two.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The supporting rib may be provided in the step part of the tub. In that case, the supporting rib can be connected to a hall sensor assembly or a tap housing assembly for power connection. Thus, the right-and-left direction width of the supporting rib may be determined to make the fastening portion of the stator corresponding to the fastening position of the tub, in case that the supporting rib is contacted with any one side surface of a hall sensor assembly provided in the first insulator or of a tap housing assembly for power connection.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The supporting rib has a predetermined friction force in a state of being closely contacted with the inner wall of the partition rib to prevent the partition rib from moving. In that case, the supporting rib is made of rubber having compressibility. Meanwhile, in case that the supporting rib is made of robber having compressibility, the supporting rib may move somewhat. Thus, the supporting part may further include a motion-proof bump formed in an outer portion with respect to a radial direction of the supporting rib to prevent the supporting part from moving.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The supporting rib may be formed in a ring shape to surround the fastening part of the tub. In that case, the supporting rib is crossing the step parts and non-step parts. Alternatively, the supporting rib may be formed as one body with the rear wall of the tub. The supporting rib also may be provided as an auxiliary piece separated from the rear wall of the tub and fastened to the rear wall of the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, a fixing part may be formed on the portion of each supporting rib and projected toward each reinforcement bead to be fixed between the reinforcement beads.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The stator rib may include a winding rib projected forwardly along a front surface circumference of the first insulator to wind a connection wire of the coil there around, and may further include the supporting rib together with the winding rib.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In that case, the supporting part may be a bracket having a front surface thereof fastened to the tub and a rear surface thereof fastening the winding rib thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A fastening hole may be formed on the bracket and the winding rib is inserted in the fastening hole to be fastened to the bracket. The supporting part and the tub may be made of different materials or injection-molded in the rear wall of the tub, and alternatively may be fastened to the rear wall as an auxiliary piece.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The drum type washing machine according to the present invention has following advantageous effects.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, since the supporting part is additionally provided on the rear wall of the tub, the fastening position of the stator can be determined more precisely and smoothly when assembling the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Second, even when vibration is generated during the washing or spinning cycle, the damage of the fastening portion between the stator and the tub can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Finally, since the tub supporter in the prior art may be removed, the production process can be simple and production cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view schematically illustrating a DDM drum type washing machine according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the drum type washing machine according to the present invention includes a tub <b>200</b>, a stator <b>600</b> and a rotor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The tub <b>200</b> is mounted within a cabinet <b>1</b> to store wash water therein and a drum <b>3</b> is rotatably mounted within the tub <b>200</b>. At that time, the tub <b>200</b> has a rear wall for fixing the stator <b>600</b> thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The tub <b>200</b> is made of plastic and a bearing housing <b>7</b> made of metal is provided in a center of the tub rear wall to support a bearing as well as to fasten the stator <b>600</b> thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Here, the bearing housing <b>7</b> is made of aluminum alloy and the like and inserted in the tub <b>200</b> when the tub <b>200</b> is injection-molded, such that it is formed as one body with the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a plurality of step parts <b>210</b> and non-step parts <b>220</b> are formed on the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The step part <b>210</b> is stepped to be projected outwardly in comparison with the non-step part <b>220</b>. The plurality of step parts <b>210</b> are formed a predetermined distance toward a radial direction. Together with that, the non-step parts <b>220</b> are provided between the step parts <b>210</b> and not projected.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Especially, a plurality of reinforcement ribs <b>221</b> having a predetermined width are formed along a radial direction of the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b> and a circumference direction in a lattice shape a predetermined distance. The reinforcement rib <b>221</b> has a plate appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The each reinforcement rib <b>221</b> prevents the tub <b>200</b> from being curved or bent when injection-molded and prevents the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b> from being deformed or bent during various cycles, for example, a washing or spinning cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A plurality of fastening parts <b>230</b> are further formed in the center portion of the step parts <b>210</b> where the bearing housing <b>7</b> is provided, and stepped/projected backwardly. A first fastening hole <b>231</b> is formed on each fastening part <b>230</b> to fasten the stator <b>600</b> to the fastening part <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, the stator <b>600</b> is fixed to the tub <b>200</b> and comprised in a motor, together with the rotor <b>5</b> provided outwardly adjacent to the stator <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the stator <b>600</b> includes a core part <b>610</b>, a coil <b>640</b>, a pair of insulators <b>620</b> and <b>630</b> and a stator rib <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Iron plates including a base (not shown) and teeth <b>612</b> are multi-layered to form the core part <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Here, the teeth <b>612</b> have a T-shape, seen from a plane view, and the coil <b>640</b> is wounded around the teeth <b>612</b>, and the base having an approximate ring shape defines a body of the core part <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Also, the pair of insulators <b>620</b> and <b>630</b> are made of insulation material, and formed in a ring shape, same as the shape of the core part <b>610</b>, to surround a rear surface of the core part <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, a plurality of projections <b>622</b> and <b>632</b>, each having a second fastening hole <b>621</b> and <b>631</b> formed therein, are formed on am inner circumferential surface of each insulator <b>620</b> and <b>630</b>, corresponding to each other. Then, each second fastening hole <b>621</b> and <b>631</b> is corresponding to each first fastening hole <b>231</b> of each fastening part <b>230</b> and fastened to each first fastening hole <b>321</b> by a fastening member.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The stator rib <b>650</b> may include a partition rib <b>651</b> and a winding rib <b>652</b>. The partition rib <b>651</b> is formed on a front surface of the first insulator <b>620</b>, which faces the tub <b>200</b>, to separate the portion where the projection part <b>622</b> is formed from the portion and where the coil <b>640</b> is wounded. At that time, the partition rib <b>650</b> is formed in a ring shape having a predetermined height, which is high enough not to contact the partition rib <b>650</b> with the step part <b>210</b> of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The partition rib <b>651</b> prevents water, which might be leaked through the fastening portion between the stator <b>600</b> and the tub <b>200</b>, from flowing into the portion where the coil <b>640</b> is wounded.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A winding rib <b>652</b> is formed between the partition rib <b>651</b> and the portion of the stator <b>600</b> where the coil <b>640</b> is wounded. Some of the connection wire, connected to be wounded around another tooth <b>612</b> after a stator coil of each phase is wounded around any one tooth <b>612</b>, is wound to fix the winding rib <b>652</b>. Thus, the partition rib <b>651</b> is formed in a ring shape along a circumferential direction and has various heights for each connection wire of the phases to secure the insulating distance each other.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The stator <b>600</b> further includes a hall sensor assembly <b>910</b> and a tap housing assembly <b>920</b> for power connection.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The hall sensor assembly <b>910</b> is provided on a front circumferential portion of the first insulator <b>620</b> to measure the position and the speed of the rotor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The tap housing assembly <b>920</b> for power connection supplies power to the coil <b>640</b> of the stator <b>600</b>. The tap housing assembly <b>920</b> for power connection is provided in a circumferential portion of the first insulator <b>620</b> and an end thereof is fastened to a front circumference of the first insulator <b>620</b>. At that time, the hall sensor assembly <b>910</b> and the tap housing assembly <b>920</b> are spaced apart a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The rotor <b>5</b> is provided in an outer portion of the stator <b>600</b>, and the rotor <b>5</b> and the stator <b>600</b> are included with the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At that time, the rotor <b>5</b> is made of iron material to transmit rotation power to the drum <b>3</b> by means of the shaft <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The shaft <b>4</b> passes through the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b> and the inside of the stator <b>600</b>, so that the shaft <b>4</b> is fastened to the drum <b>3</b> in a state of being supported by the bearing housing <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The supporting part <b>800</b>, specifically the supporting rib <b>801</b>, supports the inner wall of the partition rib <b>651</b> formed on the first insulator <b>620</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Although not shown in the drawings, the supporting rib <b>801</b> may be configured to support the winding rib <b>652</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the supporting rib <b>801</b> is formed on the portion of the non-step part <b>220</b>, which is adjacent to the inner wall of the partition rib <b>651</b>, and preferably, the supporting rib <b>801</b> is fixed to each reinforcement rib <b>221</b> formed on the non-step part <b>220</b> of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Also, the supporting rib <b>801</b> is high enough not to be contacted with the front surface of the first insulator <b>620</b> and, preferably, high enough to be contacted with the inner wall of the partition rib <b>651</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Here, the supporting rib <b>801</b> may be formed as one body with the non-step part <b>220</b> of the tub <b>200</b> when the tub <b>200</b> is fabricated, and alternatively may be formed as an auxiliary piece separated from the tub <b>200</b> to be fixed to the non-step part <b>220</b> of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">It is preferred in connection with production cost and the reduction of man hours that the supporting rib <b>801</b> is formed as one body with the non-step part <b>220</b> of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, the supporting rib <b>801</b> is formed on more than two non-step parts <b>220</b> facing each other and more preferably may be formed on each non-step part <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Since the portion where the partition rib <b>651</b> of the stator <b>600</b> is supported by the supporting rib <b>801</b> may be maximized, load is not concentrated on a particular portion of the partition rib <b>651</b>, more specifically, any one supporting rib <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It is preferred that the width of each supporting rib <b>801</b> is wide enough to reinforce the strength of the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b>, in addition to each reinforcement rib <b>221</b> of the tub. Here, the width is approximately 2&#x2dc;5 mm, which is the same as the width of the reinforcement-bead rib <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">It is also preferred that the supporting rib <b>801</b> is roundly formed, tracing the same circular arc as that of the partition rib <b>651</b> of the stator <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">That is for contacting the supporting rib <b>801</b> with the partition rib <b>651</b> so that the supporting rib <b>801</b> may support the partition rib <b>651</b>. Moreover, since the load given to the partition rib <b>651</b> also may be dispersed by the appearance of the supporting rib <b>801</b>, the damage may be prevented, which might be caused in the partition rib <b>651</b> due to partial concentration of load.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Preferably, a position determination groove <b>232</b> is further formed on the fastening part <b>230</b> of the tub <b>200</b> and a position determination protrusion <b>623</b> corresponding to the position determination groove <b>232</b> is further formed on the first insulator <b>620</b> of the stator <b>600</b> to insert the position determination protrusion <b>623</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The position determination protrusion <b>623</b> and the position determination groove <b>232</b> are correspondingly fastened each other when the stator <b>600</b> is fastened to the tub <b>200</b> so that the position of the stator <b>600</b> is determined precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A reference number <b>910</b> without detailed description is a hall sensor assembly and a reference number <b>920</b> without detailed description is a tap housing assembly for power connection.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the supporting part <b>800</b> may further include a sub-supporting rib <b>802</b> provided in the step part <b>210</b> of the tub <b>200</b> to cover the outer wall of the partition rib <b>651</b>, when the stator <b>600</b> is fastened to the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Here, it is preferred that the sub-supporting rib <b>802</b> is formed as one body with the supporting rib <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The above structure is all for supporting the inner wall and the outer wall of the partition rib <b>651</b> securely.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">That case may have an advantage that fastening the stator <b>600</b> to the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b> is getting easier.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, it is more efficient to reinforce the strength of the non-step part <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Even when the drum type washing machine is put into operation and the vibration is generated in the tub <b>200</b> and the stator <b>600</b>, the supporting rib <b>801</b> and the sub-supporting rib <b>802</b> support the entire portion of the partition rib <b>651</b> provided in the stator <b>600</b> to prevent damage of the fastening portion between the stator <b>600</b> and the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A process of fastening the motor to the tub <b>200</b> of the drum type washing machine according to the first embodiment having the above configuration will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">First, each position determination protrusion <b>623</b> of the first insulator <b>620</b> provided in the stator <b>600</b> is correspondingly fastened to each position determination groove <b>232</b> of the fastening part <b>230</b> formed on the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In that case, each supporting rib <b>801</b> formed on the non-step part <b>220</b> of the tub <b>200</b> is arranged inside of the partition rib <b>651</b> formed on the front surface of the first insulator <b>620</b>. Hence, the first fastening hole <b>231</b> of the fastening part <b>230</b> is corresponding to the second fastening hole <b>621</b> and <b>631</b> formed each projection <b>622</b> and <b>632</b> of the stator <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">At that time, each supporting rib <b>801</b> supports the inner wall of the partition wall <b>651</b>. Thus, even though the stator <b>600</b> moves down due to the load thereof during the fastening the stator <b>600</b> to the tub <b>200</b>, the damage of the position determination protrusion <b>623</b> can be prevented. In addition, since the position of the stator <b>600</b> is prevented from moving, the fastening work can be smoothly performed. As described above, the sub-supporting rib <b>802</b> supports the outer wall of the partition rib <b>651</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Once the stator <b>600</b> is fastened to the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b> by the above process, the drum <b>3</b> mounted within the tub <b>200</b> is fastened to the terminal end of the shaft <b>4</b>. Hence, the rotor <b>5</b> is fastened to the other terminal end of the shaft <b>4</b>. At that time, the shaft <b>4</b> is supported by the bearing housing <b>7</b> provided on the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Accordingly, the motor is completely mounted to the tub <b>200</b> via the above process.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 14</figref>, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. In this embodiment, the same elements as above described embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals and description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the second embodiment, a supporting part <b>800</b> supports a stator rib <b>650</b>, too. More specifically, the supporting part <b>800</b> includes a supporting rib <b>801</b> to support a partition rib <b>651</b> formed on the first insulator <b>620</b>, specifically an inner wall of the partition rib <b>651</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Unlike the first embodiment, the supporting rib <b>801</b> of this embodiment may be provided on a surface bent from the step part <b>210</b> out of surfaces of the fastening part <b>230</b> formed in the tub <b>200</b>. That is, the supporting rib <b>801</b> is formed on the step part <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The right-and-left direction width of each supporting rib <b>801</b> may be determined to correspond the first fastening hole <b>231</b> to the second fastening hole <b>621</b> and <b>631</b>, which means the fastening position between the stator <b>600</b> and the tub <b>200</b> in case that the supporting rib <b>801</b> is contacted with any one surface of the hall sensor assembly <b>910</b> provided in the first insulator <b>620</b> of the stator <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Alternatively, the right-and-left direction width of each supporting rib <b>801</b> may be determined to correspond the first fastening hole <b>231</b> to the second fastening hole <b>621</b> and <b>631</b> in case that the supporting rib <b>801</b> is contacted with any one surface of the tap housing assembly <b>920</b> for power connection provided in the first insulator <b>620</b> of the stator <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">That is for preventing each fastening position between the stator <b>600</b> and the tub <b>200</b> from being different. Whereas, the fastening position between the stator <b>600</b> and the tub <b>200</b> is corresponded to by making the width of the supporting rib <b>801</b> appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">By the way, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the supporting part <b>800</b> according to this embodiment may further include a sub-supporting rib <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Here, since the function of the supporting part <b>800</b>, more specifically the function of the supporting rib <b>801</b> and the sub-supporting rib <b>802</b> is the same as described in the first embodiment, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a third embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Much part of this embodiment is similar to the second embodiment but the fact that a supporting rib <b>801</b> has a predetermined friction power. For example, the supporting rib <b>801</b> is made of robber having compressibility to be contacted with an inner wall of a partition rib <b>651</b> formed on the stator <b>600</b>, so that the partition rib <b>651</b> is supported by the supporting rib <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Alternatively, a sub-supporting rib <b>802</b> may be provided in this embodiment like the above embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Here, the supporting rib <b>801</b> made of robber is provided in this embodiment, because it can absorb vibration and also has less danger of damage.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In addition, a motion-proof bump <b>803</b> may be provided in an outer portion with respect to a radial direction of the supporting rib <b>801</b> to prevent the supporting rib <b>801</b> from moving. The motion-proof bump <b>803</b> prevents the stator <b>600</b> from being inclined toward any one direction, such that the fastening between the stator <b>600</b> and the tub <b>200</b> may be precise.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Here, the supporting rib <b>801</b> and the sub-supporting rib <b>802</b> may be provided as an auxiliary piece to be fixed to the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b>, and the motion-proof bump <b>803</b> may be formed as one body with the rear wall of the tub <b>200</b>.</p>
