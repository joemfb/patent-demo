<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to GaN MOSFETs and, more particularly, to an enhancement-mode MOSFET with low leakage current and improved reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">GaN MOSFETS are well known in the art, and are of utilized in high power, high frequency, and high temperature applications. GaN MOSFETS are typically based on the formation of a heterojunction between a GaN region, typically known as the channel layer, and an overlying AlGaN region, typically known as a barrier layer. The GaN channel layer and the AlGaN barrier layer have different band gaps that induce the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) that lies at the junction between the GaN channel layer and the AlGaN barrier layer and extends down into the GaN channel layer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The 2DEG, which functions as the &#x201c;channel&#x201d; of the transistor, produces a high concentration of electrons which causes a conventionally-formed GaN MOSFET to function as a depletion-mode device (nominally on when zero volts are applied to the gate of the device, and the source and drain regions of the device are differently biased).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although there are applications for depletion-mode GaN MOSFETs, the nominally on state of a depletion-mode transistor requires the use of a control circuit during start up to ensure that source-to-drain conduction within the transistor does not begin prematurely. On the other hand, an enhancement-mode GaN MOSFET (nominally off when zero volts are applied to the gate of the device, and the source and drain regions of the device are differently biased) does not require a control circuit because the transistor is nominally off at start up when zero volts are placed on the gate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, to form an enhancement-mode GaN MOSFET, the AlGaN barrier layer must be made thin enough (e.g., a few nm thick) so that when zero volts are applied to the gate of the device, (and the source and drain regions of the device are differently biased) substantially no electrons are present in the 2DEG region, and when a voltage that exceeds a threshold voltage is applied to the gate of the device, (and the source and drain regions of the device are differently biased), electrons accumulate in the 2DEG region and flow from the source region to the drain region.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One problem with reducing the thickness of the AlGaN barrier layer is that high levels of leakage current can pass through the AlGaN barrier layer to the gate, which is conventionally implemented as a Schottky contact. One solution to this problem is to add a gate insulation layer that lies between the AlGaN barrier layer and the gate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Current-generation, enhancement-mode GaN MOSFETs use a variety of deposited oxides to form the gate insulation layer. These deposited oxides include Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, MgO, Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ScO<sub>2</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub>. Of all of these oxides, SiO<sub>2 </sub>has a bandgap Eg of 9 eV and a &#x394;Ec to AlGaN that can be as high as 2.5 eV, thereby leading to the lowest leakage current and a threshold voltage as high as 2.5 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One problem with all of these deposited oxides, including SiO<sub>2</sub>, is that these deposited oxides have a high density of interface states (e.g., greater than 4&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) that results in a large number of trapping sites at the junction between the gate insulation layer and the AlGaN barrier layer. Large numbers of trapping sites lead to the breakdown of the gate insulation layer which, in turn, reduces the long-term reliability of the GaN devices. Thus, there is a need for an enhancement-mode GaN MOSFET that has a low leakage current.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> show a series of cross-sectional views that illustrate an example of a method of forming an enhancement-mode GaN MOSFET <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention. As described in greater detail below, the method of the present invention forms a SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>gate insulation layer on an AlGaN barrier layer (or optional InAlGaN barrier layer) which significantly reduces the formation of interface states at the junction between the gate insulation layer and the barrier layer. Reducing the density of interface states significantly reduces the number of trapping sites which, in turn, improves the long-term reliability on the GaN devices.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the method of the present invention utilizes a conventionally-formed semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>. Substrate <b>110</b> can be implemented as an insulating substrate or with a highly resistive material such as silicon (e.g., &#x3c;111&#x3e;), sapphire, or silicon carbide. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the method of the present invention begins by forming an epitaxial layer <b>112</b> on substrate <b>110</b>. Epitaxial layer <b>112</b>, which is formed in a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) reactor using a conventional process, includes an undoped AlGaN buffer layer <b>114</b>, an undoped GaN channel layer <b>116</b>, and an undoped or n-doped AlGaN barrier layer <b>118</b> (or optionally an undoped or n-doped InAlGaN barrier layer <b>118</b>). The AlGaN buffer layer <b>114</b>, in turn, includes a number of undoped AlGaN layers with different aluminum compositions that are used to mitigate stress.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with the present invention, after epitaxial layer <b>112</b> has been formed, a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b> is epitaxially grown on the AlGaN barrier layer <b>118</b> directly in the same MOCVD reactor as the AlGaN barrier layer <b>118</b> using SiH<sub>4 </sub>and NH<sub>3</sub>. In other words, the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b> is epitaxially grown after the AlGaN layer <b>118</b> is grown without removing the structure with the AlGaN layer <b>118</b> from the MOCVD reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b> is preferably grown to have a thickness of approximately 10-100 nm, with the specific thickness being application dependent. SiN and AlGaN share the same anion, and as a result, produce a lower transition layer <b>119</b> between the Si<sub>3</sub>N4 layer <b>120</b> and the AIGaN barrier layer <b>118</b> that has a very low density of interfacial states, e.g., expected to be less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, after the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b> has been grown, part of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b> is oxidized in a steam/wet rapid thermal oxidation process to form a Si0<sub>2 </sub>layer <b>122</b> that lies on the remaining Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b>. In the present invention, the combination of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>and Si0<sub>2 </sub>layers form a gate insulation layer <b>124</b> of the transistor which has, for example, a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer that is 64 A thick and a Si0<sub>2 </sub>layer that is 128 A thick. The oxidation of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b> produces an upper transition layer <b>121</b> between the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>120</b> and the Si0<sub>2 </sub>layer <b>122</b> that also has a very low density of interfacial states.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, following the formation of SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer <b>122</b>, the method completes the formation of GaN MOSFET <b>100</b> by forming a metal gate region <b>130</b>, a metal source region <b>132</b>, and a metal drain region <b>134</b> in a conventional fashion, e.g., using titanium aluminum contacts, followed by the conventional formation of an overlying passivation layer. The metal gate region <b>130</b> is formed to touch the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer <b>122</b> of gate insulation layer <b>124</b>. The metal source <b>132</b> and metal drain regions <b>134</b> are formed to make an ohmic contact with the GaN channel layer <b>116</b> and the AlGaN barrier layer <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As noted above, the AlGaN of the barrier layer and the GaN of the channel layer have different band gaps, and are conventionally formed to induce a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) that lies at the junction between the AlGaN barrier layer and the GaN channel layer and extends down into the GaN channel layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As further noted above, the 2DEG, which functions as the &#x201c;channel&#x201d; of the transistor, produces a high concentration of electrons which causes a conventionally-formed GaN MOSFET to be a depletion mode device (nominally on when zero volts are applied to the gate of the device and the source and drain regions are differently biased).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, to form GaN MOSFET <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as an enhancement-mode device (nominally off when zero volts are applied to the metal gate region <b>130</b>, and the metal source region <b>132</b> and the metal drain region <b>134</b> are differently biased), the AlGaN barrier layer <b>118</b> must be made thin enough (e.g., a few nm thick) so that when zero volts are applied to the metal gate region <b>130</b> (and the metal source region <b>132</b> and the metal drain region <b>134</b> are differently biased) substantially no electrons are present in the 2DEG region, and when a voltage that exceeds a threshold voltage is a applied to the metal gate region <b>130</b> (and the metal source region <b>132</b> and the metal drain region <b>134</b> are differently biased), electrons accumulate in the 2DEG region and flow from the metal source region <b>132</b> to the metal drain region <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref> show a series of cross-sectional views that illustrate an example of a method of forming an enhancement-mode GaN MOSFET <b>500</b> in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the alternate method of the present invention also utilizes a conventionally-formed semiconductor substrate <b>510</b>. As with substrate <b>110</b>, substrate <b>510</b> can also be implemented as an insulating substrate or with a highly resistive material such as silicon (e.g., &#x3c;111&#x3e;), sapphire, or silicon carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the alternate method of the present invention begins by forming an epitaxial layer <b>512</b> on substrate <b>510</b> in the same manner that epitaxial layer <b>112</b> was formed (in a MOCVD reactor using a conventional process). As a result, epitaxial layer <b>512</b> includes an undoped AlGaN buffer layer <b>514</b>, an undoped GaN channel layer <b>516</b>, and an undoped or n-doped AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b> (or optionally an undoped or n-doped InAlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b>). The AlGaN buffer layer <b>514</b>, in turn, includes a number of undoped AlGaN layers with different aluminum compositions that are used to mitigate stress.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, unlike GaN MOSFET <b>100</b>, the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b> is formed to have a conventional (depletion-mode) thickness and, as a result, induces the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) that lies at the junction between the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b> and the GaN channel layer <b>516</b> and extends down into the GaN channel layer <b>516</b>. The 2DEG that lies at the junction between the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b> and the GaN channel layer <b>516</b> produces a high concentration of electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in accordance with the present invention, after epitaxial layer <b>512</b> has been formed, a mask <b>520</b>, such as a layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>, is formed and patterned on the top surface of the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b>. Once mask <b>520</b> has been formed, the regions exposed by the mask <b>520</b> are dry etched. The dry etch can stop above, at, or below a lowest level of the 2DEG that lies at the top surface of GaN channel layer <b>516</b>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the dry etch stopping just below the lowest level of the 2DEG.)</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the dry etch produces an intermediate MOSFET structure <b>522</b> that has an exposed region <b>524</b>. Following the dry etch, the intermediate MOSFET structure <b>522</b> is next baked in H<sub>2 </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>in the MOCVD reactor to repair damage to the lattice that was caused by the dry etch. In other words, the intermediate MOSFET structure <b>522</b> is baked after the dry etch without removing the intermediate MOSFET structure <b>522</b> from the MOCVD reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after the intermediate MOSFET structure <b>522</b> has been baked, a thin undoped or n-doped AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> (or optionally a thin undoped or n-doped InAlGaN barrier film <b>526</b>) is epitaxially grown on the exposed region <b>524</b>. A top surface of the thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> can lie above, at, or below a lowest level of the 2DEG. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the top surface of the AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> lying at the lowest level of the 2DEG.) The thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> has a thickness that is less than a largest thickness of the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once the thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> has been grown, a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b> is epitaxially grown on the thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> directly in the same MOCVD reactor as the thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> using SiH<sub>4 </sub>and NH<sub>3</sub>. In other words, the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b> is epitaxially grown after the thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> is grown without removing the structure with the thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> from the MOCVD reactor. (As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b> also grows on the side walls of the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b> and on the SiO<sub>2 </sub>mask <b>520</b>.)</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b> is preferably grown to have a thickness of approximately 10-100 nm over the thin AIGaN film <b>526</b>, with the specific thickness being application dependent. As before, the process produces a lower transition layer <b>529</b> between the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b> and the thin AIGaN barrier film <b>526</b> that has a very low density of interfacial states, e.g., expected to be less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, following the growth of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b>, a part of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b> is oxidized in a steam/wet rapid thermal oxidation process to form a SiO<sub>2 </sub>region <b>532</b> that lies on a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>region <b>534</b> which, in turn, lies over the thin AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b> lies laterally adjacent to the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>region <b>534</b>. (The oxidation process also oxidizes the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>layer <b>530</b> that lies over the SiO<sub>2 </sub>mask <b>520</b>, thereby increasing the thickness of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>mask <b>520</b>.)</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the present invention, the combination of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>region <b>534</b> and the Si0<sub>2 </sub>region <b>532</b> forms a gate insulation layer <b>536</b> that lies over the thin AIGaN film <b>526</b> which has, for example, a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>region that is 64 A thick and a Si0<sub>2 </sub>region that is 128 A thick.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, following the formation of SiO<sub>2 </sub>region <b>532</b>, the method completes the formation of GaN MOSFET <b>500</b> by forming a metal gate region <b>540</b>, a metal source region <b>542</b>, and a metal drain region <b>544</b> in a conventional fashion, e.g., using titanium aluminum contacts, followed by the conventional formation of an overlying passivation layer. The metal gate region <b>540</b> is formed to touch SiO<sub>2 </sub>region <b>532</b> of gate insulation layer <b>536</b>. The metal source <b>542</b> and metal drain regions <b>544</b> are formed to make an ohmic contact with the GaN channel layer <b>516</b> and the AlGaN barrier layer <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, GaN MOSFET <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is formed as an enhancement-mode device (nominally off when zero volts are applied to the metal gate region <b>540</b> and the metal source region <b>542</b> and the metal drain region <b>544</b> are differently biased) by forming the AlGaN barrier film <b>526</b> to be thin enough (e.g., a few nm thick) so that when zero volts are applied to the metal gate region <b>540</b> (and the metal source region <b>542</b> and the metal drain region <b>544</b> are differently biased) substantially no electrons accumulate directly under the gate insulation layer <b>536</b> and the metal gate region <b>540</b>, and when a voltage that exceeds a threshold voltage is a applied to metal gate region <b>540</b> (and the metal source region <b>542</b> and the metal drain region <b>544</b> are differently biased), electrons accumulate directly under the gate insulation layer <b>536</b> and the metal gate region <b>540</b> and flow from the metal source region <b>542</b> to the metal drain region <b>544</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One of the advantages of the present invention is that the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>portion of the SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>gate insulation layer significantly reduces the formation of interface states at the junction between the gate insulation layer and the AlGaN barrier layer (or optional InAlGaN barrier layer). Significantly reducing the number of sites where electrons can be trapped significantly improves the long-term reliability of the GaN devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A further advantage of the present invention is that by utilizing SiO<sub>2 </sub>as the capping layer of the SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>gate insulation layer, the present invention has the lowest leakage current and a threshold voltage as high as 2.5 volts (i.e., SiO<sub>2 </sub>has a bandgap Eg of 9 eV and a &#x394;Ec to AlGaN that can be as high as 2.5 eV).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a band diagram that illustrates the leakage current in accordance with the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the band lineup shows that there is limited tunneling in the gate oxide due to the low density of interface states and the wide band gap of SiO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the effective &#x394;Ec from SiO<sub>2 </sub>to AlGaN is greater than 2 eV with a threshold voltage Vt that is greater than 2V.</p>
