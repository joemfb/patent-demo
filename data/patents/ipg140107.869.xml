<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solenoids are used in a myriad of applications in the automotive industry. For example, solenoids may be used in automated or remote valves, such as a canister vent solenoid associated with evaporative emission control systems. Such solenoid valves may be used to control the flow of a variety of fluids (e.g., liquids or gasses). For example, in the context of a canister vent solenoid, the solenoid valve may be used to control the flow of fuel vapors into a charcoal canister. Solenoid valves may be similarly used to control the flow of liquids and vapors for other vehicle systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some applications, it may be desirable to provide control over two input sources. This may be accomplished by providing two separate valves. The use of two separate valves, however, may increase costs and may be difficult to package, particularly in applications where space is at a premium. Additionally, operating two separate valves may further complicate the programming, particularly since it may be necessary or desirable to control the two separate valves independently and/or simultaneously.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By way of an overview, one aspect consistent with the present disclosure may feature a three-port valve comprising a solenoid including two coils coupled to a valve body including two input ports, one output port, and two valve closure members. Three different states of operation of the three-port valve may be selected based on selectively energizing each of the two coils. For example, the three-port valve may have a first state (e.g., a default state) when neither coil is energized, a second state when first coil is energized to move only one of the valve closure members, and a third state when the second coil is energized to move both valve closure members. The three-port valve may therefore provide a more compact assembly compared to having two separate valves. In addition, the three-port valve may use only a single electrical connection whereas two separate valves may need two separate connectors and associated wiring. Moreover, the three-port valve may require fewer hose connections compared to two separate valves because it may eliminate the need for hosing between the valves. Accordingly, the installation and manufacture of the three-port valve may be reduced/less complex.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of an evaporative emissions system <b>10</b> is schematically illustrated. As shown, the evaporative emissions system <b>10</b> may comprise an EVAP canister <b>12</b>, a primary purge vacuum source <b>14</b>, a secondary purge vacuum source <b>16</b>, an engine management controller (PCM/VCM) <b>18</b>, and a three-port valve <b>20</b>. The EVAP system <b>10</b> may control the release of fuel vapors from a fuel tank <b>22</b> during refueling, during elevated temperatures, etc., in which fuel vapors from the fuel tank <b>22</b> of a vehicle <b>11</b> may be displaced from, e.g. due to being pressurized within, the fuel tank <b>22</b> by liquid fuel being delivered to the fuel tank <b>22</b>. Fuel vapors from the fuel tank <b>22</b> may travel to the evaporative emissions canister <b>12</b>, which may serve as a storage device for fuel vapors. The evaporative emissions canister <b>12</b> may contain a medium, such as activated carbon, which may collect the fuel vapors to prevent the vapor from being emitted into the atmosphere. During operation of the internal combustion engine <b>24</b> of the vehicle <b>11</b>, the fuel vapors collected by the evaporative emissions canister <b>12</b> may be released to the engine <b>24</b> and may be consumed by the engine <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment, the three-port valve <b>20</b> may be used during an OBDII emissions vacuum test. In particular, some vehicles <b>11</b> (such as, but not limited to, hybrid vehicles including hybrid plug-in vehicles) may perform an OBDII emission vacuum test for leakage even when the internal combustion engine <b>24</b> is not operating. The three-port valve <b>20</b> may include a first port (i.e., Port <b>1</b>) fluidly coupled to the primary purge vacuum source <b>14</b> (e.g., via primary purge path <b>26</b>), a second port (i.e., Port <b>2</b>) fluidly coupled to the secondary purge vacuum source <b>16</b> (e.g., via secondary purge path <b>28</b>) and a third port (i.e., Port <b>3</b>) fluidly coupled to the EVAP canister <b>12</b> (e.g., via EVAP path <b>30</b>). The three-port valve <b>20</b> may also include an electrical connection <b>32</b> configured to be electrically coupled to the PCM/VCM <b>18</b>. Based on the signal received from the PCM/VCM <b>18</b> (e.g., but not limited to, 12 volt signals), the three-port valve <b>20</b> may selectively open/close the Ports <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> to Port <b>3</b> in one of three valve states.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, cross-sectional views of the three-port valve <b>20</b> are shown illustrating the three-port valve <b>20</b> in three states of operation. The three-port valve <b>20</b> may comprise a valve body <b>40</b> and a solenoid <b>42</b>. The valve body <b>40</b> may comprise Ports <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> as well as a first and a second valve closure member <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> configured to selectively open and seal valve orifices <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, respectively. The solenoid <b>42</b> may comprise a first and a second coil <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> configured to actuate the first and/or the second valve closure members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> such that the three states of the three-port valve <b>20</b> may be selected. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may represent the three-port valve <b>20</b> in a first state (e.g., a default state) in which neither the first nor the second coil <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> is energized. As may be seen, the first valve closure member <b>44</b> may be open to establish a fluid pathway from Port <b>1</b> through the first valve orifice <b>48</b> to Port <b>3</b>. The second valve closure member <b>46</b> may be sealed to the second valve orifice <b>50</b> to seal Port <b>2</b> from Port <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In practice, the first coil <b>52</b> may be energized to produce a magnetic field.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A second return spring <b>95</b> may be provided to urge the poppet valve <b>90</b> in the direction opposite to arrow A.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, by selectively energizing the first or the second coils <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, the three-port valve <b>20</b> may be arranged in one of three states (e.g., the first or default state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the third state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Optionally, the three-port valve <b>20</b> may include a solenoid seal <b>96</b> configured to seal the valve body <b>40</b> to the solenoid <b>42</b> and to prevent fluid from entering the solenoid <b>42</b> from the valve body <b>40</b>. According to one embodiment, the solenoid seal <b>96</b> may be sealed between the valve body <b>40</b>/solenoid <b>42</b> via a circumferential ring <b>97</b> and may extend between the first and second valve rods <b>80</b>, <b>88</b>. The solenoid seal <b>96</b> may also include a first rolling diaphragm <b>98</b> and a second rolling diaphragm <b>99</b>. The first rolling diaphragm <b>98</b> may be configured to roll/unroll with respect to the valve body <b>40</b>/solenoid <b>42</b> as the plunger <b>70</b> moves between the first state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the second and third states (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). In particular, the first rolling diaphragm <b>98</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in a &#x201c;rolled&#x201d; or &#x201c;contracted&#x201d; position and is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> in an &#x201c;unrolled&#x201d; or &#x201c;expanded&#x201d; position. The second rolling diaphragm <b>99</b> may be configured to roll/unroll when the plunger <b>70</b> moves with respect to the first and second valve rods <b>80</b>, <b>88</b> as the plunger <b>70</b> moves between the first state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the second state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). For example, the second rolling diaphragm <b>99</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in an &#x201c;unrolled&#x201d; or &#x201c;expanded&#x201d; position and is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in a &#x201c;rolled&#x201d; or &#x201c;contracted&#x201d; position. The solenoid seal <b>96</b> may be formed a resiliently deformable material such as, but not limited to, rubber, foam, silicon, or the like configured to allow the first and second rolling diaphragms <b>98</b>, <b>99</b> to resiliently roll/bend under repeated cycles of the first and second coils <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the three-port valve consistent with the present disclosure in a first state. While the first valve closure member <b>48</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> having a sealing surface <b>72</b> in the form of a flange <b>72</b><i>a </i>extending generally radially outwardly and away from the distal end region <b>71</b> of the plunger <b>70</b>, the three-port valve <b>20</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may include a sealing surface <b>72</b> which forms a portion <b>100</b> of the solenoid seal <b>96</b>. For example, the portion <b>100</b> of the solenoid seal <b>96</b> may seal against the first valve seat <b>73</b> and the flange <b>72</b><i>a </i>may be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, while the first and second valve closure members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> have been described in a various positions corresponding to the three states or operation, it should be understood that the positions of the first and second valve closure members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> in the various states of operation may be changed depending on the intended application of the three-port valve <b>20</b>. For example, both the first and second valve closure members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> may be opened or closed in the first state (i.e., default state). Additionally, the positions of the first and second valve closure members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> may be changed when the first and second coils <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are energized.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The valve body <b>40</b> may optionally include a cover <b>102</b>. The cover <b>102</b> may facilitate assembly of the valve body <b>40</b>, for example, to facilitate loading of the second valve closure member <b>46</b>. Additionally, the solenoid <b>42</b> may optionally include a plug <b>104</b>. The plug <b>104</b> may facilitate assembly of the three-port valve <b>20</b> (e.g., the solenoid <b>42</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, the three-port valve <b>20</b> can, within one package, provide three states of operation in a single valve when only one or of the two coils <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> is energized. The unique packaging may allow the three-port valve <b>20</b> to be more compact than two separate, 2-port valves and may also allow for a single electrical connector <b>32</b> as part of the three-port valve <b>20</b> to power two independently operated coils <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. This requires less hosing connections as the three-port valve <b>20</b> does not require any connections between the three ports (Ports <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>). The three-port valve <b>20</b> may therefore reduce labor and material costs. The solenoid seal <b>96</b> may provide a unique, dual direction rolling diaphragm that allows movement of the plunger <b>70</b> and the first/second valve rods <b>80</b>, <b>88</b> together or separately, thereby allowing the independent sealing or concurrent sealing of two separate flow paths through the valve body <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The three-port valve <b>20</b> may be used for all sizes and combinations of sizes and types of porting and coils necessary for different applications. Lower flow applications may allow for smaller strokes and thus potential for very short diaphragm design. The secondary vacuum seal (e.g., the second valve closure member <b>46</b>) may be used as system pressure relief if the secondary vacuum source (<b>16</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can address the passage of fuel vapors. As such, one application of the three-port valve <b>20</b> may include applications <b>10</b> requiring a secondary flow path for a vacuum source (<b>16</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to vacate a system <b>10</b> when the primary source of vacuum (<b>14</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through the system <b>10</b> is not available.</p>

The valve may further include a solenoid including a first coil and a second coil, at least one of the first and second coils configured to actuate at least one of the first and second valve closure members when energized. Additionally, the valve may include an electrical connection configured to selectively and individually energize the first and second coils. The valve may be configured to operate in at least three different states of operation. When the valve is in a first state, neither the first nor the second coil is energized and the first and second valve closure members are in first positions.
