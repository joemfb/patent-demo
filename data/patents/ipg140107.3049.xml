<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This patent specification relates to structures of photovoltaic cells (also solar cells). More specifically, it relates to structures of photovoltaic cells comprising numerous nanometer-scale wires, rods and/or tubes to have large power generation capability per unit area. The photovoltaic cells have also highly radiant tolerant, necessary for space applications. These photovoltaic cells can be used in commercial, residential, and also industrial application for power generation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Photovoltaic cells where light is converted into electric power to be fed to external loads electrically connected to the photovoltaic cells have been prevailing in a wide range of application fields such as consumer electronics, industrial electronics and space exploration. In consumer electronics, photovoltaic cells that consist of materials such as amorphous silicon are choices for a variety of inexpensive and low power applications. Typical conversion efficiency, i.e. the solar cell conversion efficiency, of amorphous silicon based photovoltaic cells ranges between &#x2dc;10% [Yamamoto K, Yoshimi M, Suzuki T, Tawada Y, Okamoto T, Nakajima A. <i>Thin film poly</i>-<i>Si solar cell on glass substrate fabricated at low temperature</i>. Presented at MRS Spring Meeting, San Francisco, April 1998.]. Although the fabrication processes of amorphous silicon based photovoltaic cells are rather simple and inexpensive, one notable downside of this type of cell is its vulnerability to defect-induced degradation that decreases its conversion efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast, for more demanding applications such as industrial solar power generation systems, either poly-crystalline or single-crystalline silicon is the choice because of more stringent requirements for better reliability and higher efficiency than the applications in consumer electronics. Photovoltaic cells consisting of poly-crystalline and single-crystalline silicon generally offer the conversion efficiency ranging &#x2dc;20% and &#x2dc;25% [Zhao J, Wang A, Green M, Ferrazza F. <i>Novel </i>19.8% <i>efficient &#x2018;honeycomb&#x2019; textured multicrystalline and </i>24.4% <i>monocrystalline silicon solar cell. Applied Physics Letters </i>7998; 73: 1991-1993.] respectively. As many concerns associated with a steep increase in the amount of the worldwide energy consumption are raised, further development in industrial solar power generation systems has been recognized as a main focus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Group II-VI compound semiconductors, for example CdTe and CdS, have been investigated in the context of having industrial solar power generation systems manufactured at a lower cost with maintaining a moderate conversion efficiency, resulted in a comparable conversion efficiency &#x2dc;17% [Wu X, Keane J C, Dhere R G, DeHart C, Duda A, Gessert T A, Asher S, Levi D H, Sheldon P. 16<sub>&#x2014;</sub>5%-<i>efficient CdS/CdTe polycrystalline thin</i>-<i>film solar cell. Proceedings of the </i>17<i>th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference</i>, Munich, 22-26 Oct. 2001; 995-1000.] to those for the single crystalline silicon photovoltaic devises, however toxic natures of these materials are of great concerns for environment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Group I-III-VI compound semiconductors, such as CuInGaSe<sub>2</sub>, have been also extensively investigated for industrial solar power generation systems. This material can be synthesized potentially at a much lower cost than its counterpart, single crystalline silicon, however conversion efficiency, &#x2dc;19%, comparable to that of single crystalline silicon based cells can be obtained, so far, by only combining with the group II-VI compound semiconductor cells [Contreras M A, Egaas B, Ramanathan K, Hiltner j, Swartzlander A, Hasoon F, Noufi R. <i>Progress toward </i>20% <i>efficiency in Cu</i>(<i>In,Ga</i>)<i>Se polycrystalline thin</i>-<i>film solar cell. Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications </i>1999; 7: 331-316.], which again raise issues associated with toxic natures of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A type of photovoltaic cells designed for several exclusive applications where the main focus is high conversion efficiency generally consists of group III-V semiconductors including GaInP and GaAs. Synthesis processes of single crystalline group III-V are in general very costly because of substantial complications involved in epitaxial growth of group III-V single crystalline compound semiconductors. Typical conversion efficiency of group III-V compound semiconductor based photovoltaic cells, as these types of photovoltaic cells are intended to be, can be as high as &#x2dc;34% when combined with germanium substrates, another very expensive material [King R R, Fetzer C M, Colter P C, Edmondson K M, Law D C, Stavrides A P, Yoon H, Kinsey G S, Cotal H L, Ermer J H, Sherif R A, Karam N H. <i>Lattice</i>-<i>matched and metamorphic GaInP/GaInAs/Ge concentrator solar cells. Proceedings of the World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion </i>(<i>WCPEC</i>-3), Osaka, May 2003; to be published.].</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">All types of photovoltaic cells in the prior arts described above, no matter what materials a cell is made of, essentially falls into one specific type of structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a photovoltaic cell comprising a thick p-type semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and a thin n-type semiconductor layer <b>102</b> formed on an electrically conductive substrate <b>100</b>. A pn-junction <b>103</b> is formed at the interface between the p-type semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>102</b>. Incident light <b>104</b> entering the cell generate electron-hole pairs after being absorbed by the p- and also n-type semiconductor layers <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. The incident light generates electrons <b>105</b><i>e </i>and also holes <b>105</b><i>h </i>in the region near the pn-junction <b>103</b> and also <b>106</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>h </i>in the region far from the pn-junction <b>103</b>. The photo generated electrons (and holes) <b>105</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>e </i>(hereafter considering only electronics, i.e. minority carriers in p-type semiconductors, and the same explanation is applicable for holes, minority carriers in n-type semiconductors, also) diffusing toward the pn-junction <b>103</b> and entering the pn-junction <b>103</b> contribute to photovoltaic effect. This is also vice versa for the holes, existing as minority carriers in n-type semiconductor <b>102</b>. The two key factors that substantially impact the conversion efficiency of this type of photovoltaic cell are photo carrier generation efficiency (PCGE) and photo carrier collection efficiency (PCCE).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The PCGE is the percentage of the number of photons entering a cell and contributing to the generation of photo carriers, which needs to be, ideally, as close as 100%. On the other hand, the PCCE is the percentage of the number of photo-generated electrons <b>105</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>e </i>reaching the pn-junction <b>103</b> and contributing to the generation of photocurrent. For a monochromatic light, the PCGE of &#x2dc;100% can be achieved by simply making the p-type layer <b>101</b> thicker, however, electrons <b>106</b><i>e </i>generated at the region far away from the pn-junction <b>103</b> cannot be collected efficiently due to many adverse recombination processes that prevent photo generated carriers from diffusing into the pn-junction <b>103</b>, thus the basic structure of current photovoltaic cells has its own limitation on increasing the conversion efficiency. Both PCGE and PCCE are mainly dependent on material and structure of the photovoltaic cells, and today's photovoltaic cells are structured in such a way that (a) wide ranges of solar spectrum cannot be absorbed due to its material limitation, and (b) photo carrier's collection efficiency is lower due to its inherent structure. Besides, today's solar cell material is not highly radiation-tolerant. In space application specially, photovoltaic cells should have a structure and material systems, which could generate high-power per unit area and also to highly radiation tolerant.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For both commercial and space applications, therefore, it would be desirable to have photovoltaic cell structures where both the PCGE and the PCCE can be increased simultaneously by having a photo absorption region that is thick enough to capture all the photons entering the cell and a pn-junction that is located at as close to the photo absorption region as possible. It would be further desirable to have, with maintaining ideal PCGE and PCCE, different materials having photo responses at different spectrum to efficiently cover a wide range of spectrum of light that enters a photovoltaic cell. It would be further desirable to have a large junction area within a given volume of a photovoltaic cell so that generated electric power that is proportional to the junction area can be maximized.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown is a photovoltaic cell comprising plurality of nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b> electrically connected to an electrode <b>200</b>. The nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b> can have metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods are further surrounded by an electronic material <b>202</b> having metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The electronic material <b>202</b> is further electrically connected to an electrode <b>203</b>. The electrode <b>200</b> has direct electrical contact to neither the electrical material <b>202</b> nor the electrode <b>203</b>. As described above, the electrode <b>200</b> is intended to serve as a common electrode that connects all wires or rods <b>201</b>. The electrode <b>203</b> is provided for the electronic material <b>202</b>. The interface between the nanometer scale wires or rods <b>201</b> and the electronic material <b>202</b> form pn- or Schottky junctions where built-in potential for both electrons and holes is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to this invention, alternatively the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b> can be formed on separate substrate (not shown here), and the electrode <b>203</b> can be formed on the substrate to have common contact for each nanometer(s)-scale rods or tubes <b>201</b>, necessary for creating junction. In way of an example not way of limitation, the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b> can be made of n-type semiconductor and the electric material <b>202</b> that surrounds the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b> can be made of p-type semiconductor. Incident light <b>204</b> enters the photovoltaic cell through either the electrode <b>203</b> or the electrode <b>200</b> (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the incident light enters the photovoltaic cell through the electrode <b>200</b>). As the incident light <b>204</b> travels through the electronic material <b>202</b>, a numerous number of electrons <b>205</b> in the region near the electrode <b>200</b> and electrons <b>206</b> in the region far from the electrode <b>200</b> are generated. It should be pointed out that electrons are apparently generated all over the region along the thickness of the electric material <b>202</b>. In addition, as the incident light <b>204</b> travels through the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b>, a numerous number of holes <b>207</b> in the region near the electrode <b>200</b> and holes <b>208</b> in the region far from the electrode <b>200</b> are generated. It also should be pointed out that holes are apparently generated all over the region along the thickness of the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b>. Photo-generated electrons <b>205</b> and <b>206</b> in the electronic material <b>202</b> made of p-type semiconductor and photo-generated holes <b>207</b> and <b>208</b> in the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b> made n-type semiconductor, then diffuse toward pn-junctions, created at the interface between the nanometer(s)-scale wires rods <b>201</b> and the electronic material <b>202</b>. At the pn-junctions, the electrons and the holes are swept away by built-in potential, thus photovoltaic effects set in.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Apparent advantage of this invention over conventional photovoltaic cells is directly associated with the fact that, unlike conventional photovoltaic cells, pn-junctions are almost parallel to the direction to which incident light <b>204</b> travels, i.e., for all photo generated carriers in the electronic material <b>202</b>, no matter where they are generated, the distance the photo generated carriers have to diffuse to reach the pn-junctions is within the range of the distance between two nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods existing next to each other and independent to the location where they are generated. Furthermore, for all photo generated carriers in the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>201</b>, no matter where they are generated, the distance the photo generated carriers have to diffuse to reach pn-junctions is within the range of the diameter of the nanometer(s)-scale rods <b>201</b>. On the other hand, as explained in the description for the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in conventional photovoltaic cells where pn-junctions are perpendicular to the direction to which incident light travels, the photo generated carriers generated in region far away from pn-junctions need to diffuse much longer distance (diffusion-length) than that for the photo generated carriers generated near the pn-junctions, thus they have a greater chance to recombine without contributing to photovoltaic effects. Therefore in this invention, PCCE is expected to be much higher than that in conventional photovoltaic cells. In addition, it is evident that the total effective area that contributes to photovoltaic effect in this invention can be increased by 25 times and beyond for a given cell size with realistic assumptions on the dimension of the nanometer(s)-scale structures in the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an alternative preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a photovoltaic cell comprises plurality of nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> are electrically connected to an electrode <b>300</b>. The nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> can have metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The nanometer(s)-scale tubes are further surrounded by an electronic material <b>302</b> having metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The inside of the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> can be either empty or filled up with an electronic material <b>303</b> having metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. Two electronic materials <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> are further electrically connected to an electrode <b>304</b>. The electrode <b>304</b> has direct electrical contact to neither the electrode <b>300</b> nor the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b>. The electrode <b>304</b> is intended to serve as a common electrode that connects all materials inside of the tubes <b>303</b> and outside of the tubes <b>302</b>. The interface between the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> and the electronic materials <b>302</b>/<b>303</b> form pn- or Schottky junctions, thus there are pn- or Schottky junctions on both sides, inside and outside, of the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to this invention, alternatively the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> can be formed on the substrate (not shown here), and the electrode <b>304</b> can be made on the substrate to have a common contact for each nanometer(s)-scale rods or tubes <b>301</b>, necessary for creating junction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In way of an example not way of limitation, the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> can be made of metal and the electronic material <b>302</b> that surrounds the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> and the electronic material <b>303</b> that fills up the inside of the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> can be made of p-type semiconductor, thus a sandwich structure <b>302</b>/<b>301</b>/<b>303</b> forms two Schottky junctions on both sides of the metallic nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b>. Incident light <b>305</b> enters the photovoltaic cell through either the electrode <b>304</b> or the electrode <b>300</b> (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the incident light enters the photovoltaic cell through the electrode <b>300</b>). As the incident light <b>305</b> travels through the electronic material <b>302</b> and <b>303</b>, numerous numbers of electrons <b>306</b> and <b>307</b> (of electron-hole pairs) are generated. It should be pointed out that electrons (of electron-hole pairs) are apparently generated all over the region along the thickness of the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b>. Photo-generated electrons in the electronic material <b>302</b> and the electric materials <b>303</b> made of p-type semiconductor, then diffuse toward Schottky junctions in the sandwich structure <b>302</b>/<b>301</b>/<b>303</b>. At the Schottky junctions, the diffused electrons are swept away by built-in potential, thus photovoltaic effects set in.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to the common advantages already described for the photovoltaic cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, since, in this invention, both inside and outside of the nanometer(s)-scale tubes <b>301</b> form junctions, the effective area that contributes to photovoltaic effects are roughly double the area provided by the cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, thus the total electric power can be increased 50 times and beyond for a given cell size compared to conventional photovoltaic cells.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an alternative preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a photovoltaic cell comprises plurality of nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>401</b> are electrically connected to an electrode <b>400</b>. It is obvious for a person of ordinary skill in the art to recognize the following description applies to a photovoltaic cell comprises plurality of nanometer(s)-scale tubes, instead of wires or rods, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>401</b> can have metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods are further surrounded by multiple layers of different electronic materials <b>402</b>&#x2dc;<b>404</b> having metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The number of layers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is not the limitation, and it is apparent that the number of layers can be a wide range of numbers depending primarily on the thickness of each layer and the height of the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>401</b>. The multiple layers can be dissimilar semiconductors having different bandgaps appropriately tuned to cover a wide range of spectrum of the light entering the cell as described later. The electronic material <b>404</b> is further electrically connected to an electrode <b>405</b>. The electrode <b>400</b> has direct electrical contact to neither the electrical material <b>402</b> nor the electrode <b>405</b>. The electrode <b>400</b> is intended to serve as a common electrode that connects all wires or rods <b>401</b>. The electrode <b>405</b> is provided for the electronic material <b>404</b>. The interface between the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>401</b> and the electronic material <b>402</b>&#x2dc;<b>404</b> form pn- or Schottky junctions where built-in potential for both electrons and holes is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In way of an example not way of limitation, the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>401</b> can be made of n-type semiconductor and the electronic material <b>402</b>&#x2dc;<b>404</b> that surrounds the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>401</b> can be made of three different types of p-type semiconductors having different bandgaps. Incident light <b>406</b> that contains a broad-spectrum range enters the photovoltaic cell through either the electrode <b>405</b> or the electrode <b>400</b> (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the incident light enters the photovoltaic cell through the electrode <b>400</b>). As the incident light <b>406</b> travels through the electronic material <b>402</b>&#x2dc;<b>404</b>, a specific spectrum range in the incident light <b>406</b> is absorbed in a specific layer in the multiple layers of electronic materials <b>402</b>&#x2dc;<b>404</b>, in that, short, middle and long wavelengths in the incident light <b>406</b> can be absorbed subsequently in the layers <b>402</b>, <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> respectively, then numerous number of electron <b>407</b> (and holes) are generated in each layers. Photo-generated electrons in the electronic material <b>402</b>&#x2dc;<b>404</b> made of p-type semiconductor (and vice versa for the holes (not shown here)), then diffuse toward the pn-junctions, created at the interface between the nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>401</b> and the multi layered electronic material <b>402</b>&#x2dc;<b>404</b>. At the pn-junctions, the electrons <b>407</b> are swept away by built-in potential, thus photovoltaic effects set in. Apparently, in addition to the common advantages already described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2&#x2dc;FIG</figref>. <b>3</b> over conventional cells in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the additional advantage of the cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> over the photovoltaic cells described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2&#x2dc;FIG</figref>. <b>3</b> is to have a capability of covering a wide range of spectrum contained in incident light and converting a wide range of spectrum to photo generated carriers. Dozens of different layers could be stacked to catch photons at all energies, to make absorb wide band of solar spectrum, from lower wavelengths (as low as X-ray) to longer wavelength (e.g. long infrared). Addition of the multiple junction of different materials which could absorb wide solar spectrum plus the increasing of the junction area with using of the rod, wires, or tubes help to increase the electrical power energy 50 times and beyond as compared with the conventional solar cell of same size. According to this invention, dozens of materials, which could absorb wide solar spectrum, may or may not require the lattice mismatch with the rod, wires, or tubes. Lattice matched material could increase further increase of the power generation due to reduction of the recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to this invention, the rods, or wires could be GaN materials (n or p type) and the dozens of the materials could be In<sub>1-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>N (p or n type, opposite to GaN rods). With increasing of the Ga contents, the band-gap of InGaN can be increased to close to &#x2dc;3.4 eV which is same as that of the GaN. With increasing of the In contents in InGaN, the band gap can be reduced to &#x2dc;0.65 eV. Photons with less energy than the band gap slip right through. For example, red light photons are not absorbed by high-band-gap semiconductors. While photons with energy higher than the band gap are absorbed&#x2014;for example, blue light photons in a low-band gap semiconductor&#x2014;their excess energy is wasted as heat.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to this invention, alternatively the rods, or wires could be III-V based materials (n or p type) for example InP and the dozens of the materials could be III-V based material for example In<sub>1-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>As (p or n type, opposite to InP rods). In this case, with adjusting of In contents, band gap can be tuned and thereby the wide spectrum of the solar energy can be absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to this invention, alternatively the rods, or wires could be II-V based materials (n or p type) for example CdTe and the dozens of the materials could be II-VI based material for example CdZnS (p or n type, opposite to CdTe rods). In this case, with adjusting of Zn contents, band gap can be tuned and thereby the wide spectrum of the solar energy can be absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to this invention, alternatively the rods, or wires could be Si (or amorphous Silicon materials (n or p type) and the dozens of the materials could be Si: Ge alloy (p or n type, opposite to Si rods). In this case, with adjusting of Ge contents, band gap can be tuned and thereby the wide spectrum of the solar energy can be absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to this invention, alternatively the rods, or wires could be Si, InP, or CdTe (n or p type) and the dozens of the materials, could be different material which could make the junction with the rods (wires or tubes) and each type of material has the specific band gap for absorbing the specific range of solar spectrum. In this way also wide range of solar spectrum can be absorbed, and with increasing of the junction area (due to use of the rods, wires, or tubes), the electrical power generation could be increased tremendously 50 times and beyond.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to this invention, alternatively the nanometer(s)-scale rods <b>401</b> can be formed on the substrate (not shown here), and the electrode <b>405</b> can be made on the substrate to have a common contact for each nanometer(s)-scale rods or tubes <b>401</b>, necessary for creating junction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to this invention, alternatively the nanometer(s)-scale tubes (not shown here) can be formed instead of nanometer(s)-scale rods <b>401</b> and furthermore those nanometer(s)-scale tubes can be either empty or filled up with an electronic material having metallic electrical conduction, p-type or s-type semiconductor electrical conduction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, plurality of photovoltaic cells comprising plurality of nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>501</b> are randomly and electrically connected to an electrode that has arbitrary shapes <b>500</b> (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, triangular shape is illustrated, however any arbitrary shapes can be applicable here) further connected an electrode <b>502</b>. It is obvious for a person of ordinary skill in the art to recognize the following description applies to a photovoltaic cell comprises plurality of nanometer(s)-scale tubes, instead of wires or rods, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The nanometer(s)-scale wires or rods <b>501</b> can have metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction.

The way this photovoltaic cell operates is just the same way in other photovoltaic cells illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2&#x2dc;FIG</figref>. <b>4</b>, therefore, the unique characteristics for this photovoltaic cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the fact that the nanometer(s)-scale wires, rods or tubes, are connected to electrodes that can have, instead of planar surface, three-dimensionally arbitrary shape.
