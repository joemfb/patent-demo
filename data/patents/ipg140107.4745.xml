<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/211,335, filed on Mar. 30, 2009, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to financial transactions system. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to conducting financial transactions without using any traditional financial instrument such as a credit card, debit card, ATM card, gift card, stored value card, prepaid card, cash, check, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The traditional payment cards such as credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards, stored-value cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, etc. can be easily stolen and fabricated. For example, by bribing a waiter in a restaurant, a fraudster can easily steal the card information from a guest of the restaurant. The fraudster can use the stolen card information to pay a nominal fee to numerous background search websites on the Internet to find useful personal information based on the cardholder's name shown on the stolen card. A counterfeit card and a counterfeit identification document, such as a driver's license, can be easily fabricated with present technology.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once a fraudster has stolen or fabricated such card, the fraudster can quickly conduct many illegal financial transactions before the affected financial institutions, organizations or individuals identify the fraud and disable the card. Many individuals, organizations and financial institutions have already suffered tremendous material loss and damages as a result of fraud in financial transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In fact, stealing financial instruments can be easily committed today. Many financial institutions and merchants have kept the personal information including the information of the financial instruments such as credit cards, debit cards, etc. of their clients in their databases. It has become common for employees of financial institutions, merchants, or consumer report companies to steal customers' information, commit fraud, and/or sell the information to fraudsters.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to credit cards, debit cards, etc., checks are still one of the most popular financial instruments today. It is easier to fabricate a counterfeit check than to fabricate a counterfeit card. There are numerous cases related to counterfeit checks which are used together with counterfeit identification documents.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, an online merchant cannot easily tell whether a remote consumer has the correct identity. If correct card information, which can be obtained from a stolen card, and the correct billing address, which can be obtained from Internet search websites, are presented, the merchant cannot easily tell whether the remote consumer is actually a fraudster. An experienced fraudster can easily conduct fraudulent online transactions. As a result, online merchants lose a tremendous amount of money every year.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, mailing new financial instruments to new customers or existing customers when their old financial instruments expire is a major overhead to financial institutions. In addition to the huge amount of resources used in this mailing process, these financial instruments can be easily stolen during the mailing process and susceptible to fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to the examples given above, fraud can be easily committed in the computer age because a user is often identified by a user ID and/or Personal Identification Number (&#x201c;PIN&#x201d;) and a password. Once a fraudster has stolen the user ID and/or PIN and password of another person, that fraudster can conduct many criminal activities through access to this account. Therefore, fraud is a major threat to online banking, online trading, e-commerce, and many other computer related activities.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In summary, financial transactions fraud can be easily committed today, and individuals, organizations, merchants and financial institutions are suffering enormous losses and damages. There is a need for a better financial transactions system.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure enables consumers to conduct financial transactions in a secured manner without the need to use any traditional financial instrument which can be easily stolen or fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a result of the present disclosure, there is no need for consumers to carry traditional financial instruments such as checks, credit cards, debit cards, stored-value cards, pre-paid cards, ATM cards, gift cards, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Traditionally, a client of a financial institution is identified by an account number. For example, a credit card has a credit card account number. A check has a checking account number. A stock trading account has a trading account number. An insurance policy holder has a policy number (or an account number). This is the traditional way for financial institutions to identify and manage billions of clients without any confusion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since an account number is very long and a client may not be able to remember it, it is customary for a financial institution to issue a financial instrument which contains the account number. Therefore, it has been the convention that financial transactions are conducted through cards.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, if the financial instrument information of a consumer is stolen, a fraudster can use the stolen information to fabricate counterfeit financial instruments such as credit cards, debit cards, or checks, etc. or to give fraudulent instructions. Therefore, protecting the financial instruments has been essential to preventing financial transactions fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Many methods have been disclosed throughout history to protect financial instruments. For example, some methods suggest financial institutions to provide consumers with temporary card numbers which will automatically expire when certain criteria are met. Some methods suggest that cardholders should deactivate their card numbers while they are not using the cards and activate their card numbers again before they use their cards. In general, these methods create huge overhead to financial institutions and consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure intends to reduce or eliminate the dependence on the traditional financial instruments such as checks, credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards, pre-paid cards, stored value cards, gift cards, monetary instruments, wire transfers, etc. so that there is nothing for fraudsters to steal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a computer system to conduct financial transactions without using traditional financial instruments includes a computer processor and a memory device coupled to a network and a database stored on the memory device adapted to store associated with a user's account at least two sets of data and contact information of a personal communication device of the user. The first set of data consists of a part of the user's personal identification information which the user knows well without any special effort to memorize. The second set of data is a short data string which the user can memorize with minimum effort. The second set of data ensures the uniqueness of the combination of the first set of data and the second set of data in the database.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The computer system uses a communication module to send a new pass code in substantially real-time to the user's personal communication device in response to receiving the first set of data and the second set of data from a subject and the user's account complying with a pre-defined condition. The pass code has a pre-defined life time. In addition, the computer system uses a transaction processing module which permits the subject to conduct at least one transaction in response to receiving the pass code from the subject before the pass code expires.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a computer system to conduct financial transactions without using traditional financial instruments includes a computer processor and a memory device coupled to a network and a database stored on the memory device adapted to store associated with a user's account at least the identification document information of a government-issued official identification document of the user and contact information of a personal communication device of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The computer system uses a communication module to send a new pass code in substantially real-time to the user's personal communication device in response to receiving the identification document information which is provided by a subject and read by a device interface and the user's account complying with a pre-defined condition. The pass code has a pre-defined life time. In addition, the computer system uses a transaction processing module which permits the subject to conduct at least one transaction in response to receiving the pass code from the subject before the pass code expires.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, a computer system to conduct financial transactions without using traditional financial instruments includes a computer processor and a memory device coupled to a network and a database stored on the memory device adapted to store associated with a user's account at least account identification information and contact information of a personal communication device of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The computer system uses a communication module to send the user's account identification information to the user's personal communication device. The communication module sends a new pass code in substantially real-time to the user's personal communication device in response to receiving the account identification information read by a device interface from a personal communication device provided by a subject and the user's account complying with a pre-defined condition. The device interface is connected to the computer through a network. The pass code has a pre-defined life time. In addition, the computer system uses a transaction processing module which permits the subject to conduct at least one transaction in response to receiving the pass code from the subject before the pass code expires.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a computerized method to protect login security includes (1) storing associated with a user's account at least account identification information and contact information of a personal communication device of the user; (2) sending a new pass code in substantially real-time to the user's personal communication device in response to receiving the account identification information entered by a subject with an attempt to login when the pass code has been given a pre-defined life time; and (3) permitting the subject to login in response to receiving the pass code from the subject before the pass code expires.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a computerized method to open a financial account for a remote subject includes (1) receiving personal identification information from the subject. The personal identification information is read by a device interface from a government-issued official identification document; (2) receiving biometric information from the subject. The biometric information is read by the device interface from the subject; and (3) opening the account based on the subject's identification information when the biometric information read from the subject corresponds to the personal identification information read from the official identification document and the subject is not on a blacklist.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Because financial instruments such as credit cards, etc. can be easily stolen or fabricated, one of the primary goals of the present disclosure is to eliminate the use of the traditional financial instruments. The traditional financial instruments provide an important function of linking a consumer to his/her accounts in financial institutions. Therefore, this linking function has to be provided in a different approach if the traditional financial instruments are eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer can use his/her official identification document to link the consumer to his/her financial account.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer's account identification information is sent to a personal communication device of the consumer, e.g., smartphone, etc. Such account identification information can be transformed into a graphical pattern, e.g., a bar code, which can be displayed on the personal communication device for easy scanning by optical devices. This graphical pattern will link the consumer to his/her financial account. In addition, a consumer can request a change to new account identification from time to time and a new graphical pattern will be sent to the user to make it difficult for fraudster to steal the graphical pattern of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, the consumer's account identification information can be sent to a personal communication device of the consumer and such account identification information can be transformed into acoustic, electronic, electro-magnetic or magnetic signals so that the account identification information of the consumer can be easily read by a device interface. In addition, a consumer can request a change to new account identification from time to time to make it difficult for a fraudster to steal the account identification information of the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Since the new account identification information can be instantly sent to the personal communication device of the consumer, there is no need to worry about shipping, handling and associated fraud which would occur if a traditional financial instrument were used.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a password or pass code can be used to protect the personal communication device so that a fraudster who has stolen a consumer's personal communication device cannot use that personal communication device without the correct password or pass code.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In yet another alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer remembers a number (including an alpha-numerical number) or a data string which can be linked to his/her account. In addition, each consumer can change this number or data string from time to time to make it difficult for a fraudster to know or use this number or data string.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">There are about six billion persons on earth and each one must be uniquely identified to avoid confusion in financial transactions. In addition, each financial institution has to be uniquely identified. That is the reason why a credit card number or a debit card number usually has a length of about 15 to 20 digits.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To many people, it is difficult to remember a number of 15 digits to 20 digits or a data string of equivalent length. In fact, most people only feel comfortable to remember a number up to six or seven digits. On the other hand, a number of six or seven digits can only uniquely identify 1 million or 10 million accounts and is insufficient to cover the entire population on earth for account identification purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, the official identification document, the account identification information and the consumer-memorized number or data string aforementioned can still be stolen by fraudsters. Although no traditional financial instrument is used to link a consumer to his/her financial account, the above approaches are still susceptible to fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the present disclosure, a computer network with device interfaces and a central computer system having memory, a database, and peripherals, collectively referred to as a Cardless Financial Transactions System (CFTS) in this disclosure, connects consumers, organizations, merchants, financial institutions, etc. through the device interfaces. The central computer system is used to manage all the consumers, organizations, merchants, financial institutions, accounts, financial activities, etc. on the network in a secured manner.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For illustration purposes, payment transactions are often used as examples in the present disclosure. However, the present disclosure can be applied to other types of financial transactions in addition to payment transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a person logs into the CFTS computer through a device interface and opens an account with the computer system of the CFTS and provides the CFTS with the person's personal information, including personal identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the embedded information of an official identification document is read by a device interface to provide the personal identification information. Since the official identification document is protected by the respective government, reading the embedded information directly from the official identification document can effectively prevent fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">To make sure that the person is the true owner of the official identification document, the embedded information of the official identification document can be used to authenticate the identity of the person. For example, if the biometrical information of the person, such as fingerprint, iris patterns, photo, etc., corresponds to the biometrical information embedded within or on the official identification document, the person must be the true owner of the official identification document.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Alternatively, if a person can accurately provide some private information, such as personal identification number, which is embedded inside the official identification document, this person is very likely the true owner of the official identification. This authentication approach is much more accurate than the traditional approach which depends on human comparison between the appearance of the person and the photo on the official identification document. Furthermore, since this authentication approach eliminates the need for human involvement, a consumer can open an account at a terminal, kiosk, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The CFTS computer processes the personal information submitted by the person and approves the account opening for the person in compliance with regulations and laws. Once an account is opened, a person can be identified by a set of partial personal identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, a consumer can be identified by a combination of the zip code of the address shown on the consumer's identification document, the year of birth, the last four digits of the ID number, the first two letters of the first name, the first two letters of the last name shown on the ID, the country/state of issuance of the ID, the expiration date of the ID, etc. Because only a set of partial data of the consumer's personal identification information is used, the true identity of the consumer is not disclosed. Furthermore, there is no way to recover the personal identification information of the consumer from or through this set of partial data.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although only a set of partial data of the consumer's personal identification information is used, the probability of a mismatch when two persons having the same set of partial data can be substantially reduced to zero if a sufficient amount of partial data is used. In the current example, the probability for a mismatch is in the magnitude of about 1 out of 10<sup>22</sup>. The number 10<sup>22 </sup>is derived from the approximation of 10<sup>5 </sup>(5 digit zip code)&#xd7;10<sup>2 </sup>(year of birth based on two digits of a 100-year life span)&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>(4 digits of ID number)&#xd7;26<sup>2 </sup>(2 letters of first name)&#xd7;26<sup>2 </sup>(2 letters of last name)&#xd7;200 (estimated number of participating countries)&#xd7;365&#xd7;4 (a 4-year effective period for the ID).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Even if two consumers have the same set of partial data, such confusion can be easily resolved by other methods. For example, the computer system of CFTS can assign an additional number with a very short length, such as six digits, to distinguish among the persons who happen to have the same set of partial personal identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Since there are only about 6 billion persons on earth (i.e., 6&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>), the total number of persons who may have the same set of partial personal identification data is a very small number if a sufficient amount of partial personal identification data is used. As a result, a number of a few digits will be more than sufficient to identify the entire population on earth when a set of partial personal identification data is also used for identification purposes. In fact, it is possible that even 2 or 3 digits will be sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Since only a few digits are assigned by the computer system of the CFTS, a consumer only needs to remember this short number of a few digits because the consumer should know his/her own personal identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For the purpose of this disclosure, this short number is referred to as Account Identification Number (AIN). As a result, the equivalent account identification (which is equivalent to the traditional account number) of the CFTS can be a combination of the AIN and a set of personal identification data. For example, a possible account identification of the CFTS can be composed of the 5-digit zip code of the consumer, the last 4 digits of the consumer's phone number, and a 6-digit AIN. In general, a consumer remembers his/her zip code and phone number. As a result, a consumer only needs to remember his/her short AIN.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the AIN is assigned by the CFTS computer. To further reduce the need for consumers to memorize numbers, in another embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer can suggest his/her own preferred AIN and the CFTS computer can approve the particular AIN if no other person in the CFTS database, whose set of partial personal identification data is identical to the consumer's, has used the suggested AIN yet.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If zip code is not used in a particular country or area, a possible account number of the CFTS can be composed of, for example, the last 5 digits of the official identification document number of the consumer, the last 4 digits of the consumer's primary phone number, and a 6-digit AIN assigned by the CFTS computer. In fact, many other different sets of partial personal identification information can be used to achieve the same goal.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Since only partial personal identification information is used, the identity of the consumer cannot be recovered from a set of partial personal identification information and the privacy of the consumer is fully protected.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, if privacy is not a concern, the personal phone number of a person and the country code and the area code of the person can uniquely identify a person.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, this short AIN also contains one or two control digits to further strengthen the security of the account number of CFTS. For example, a control digit can be derived by taking the last digit from the sum of all other digits of the CFTS account identification. Another example is that a control digit is obtained by taking the last digit of the sum of the square of each of the other digits of the CFTS account identification.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As a result of these control digits, not all numbers can be used for account identification in the CFTS database. These control digits can effectively reduce the chance that a fraudster can randomly pick a number and use it as the CFTS account identification.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The above approach of using partial personal identification information to identify an account can also be used by an automatic checkout stand, an ATM terminal, a kiosk, or other types of device interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the event that a consumer cannot remember this short AIN of a few digits, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer can use his/her identification document to conduct financial transactions. The information on the identification document can be entered by the consumer, the merchant, or the financial institution. It is preferable to use the &#x201c;official&#x201d; identification documents for this purpose because official identification documents are protected by the respective government organizations which issued the official identification documents.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment of the present invention, a device interface, such as a terminal, can read the information embedded within or on the identification document. As a result, a consumer can pay goods or services with his/her identification document at an automatic checkout stand.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is no need to send all the information of the identification document to the CFTS computer. To protect the consumer's personal identification information which can be stolen during the data transmission, a set of partial data of the personal identification information can be used for identification purposes. For example, the 5-digit zip code, the last 6 digits of the identification document number and the initial of the last name can be used for identification purposes. In this example, the chance for a mismatch is one out of 2.6 trillion (i.e., 26&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a Personal Identification Number (PIN) can be used with dual purposes (1) to eliminate the chance of mismatch and (2) to enhance the security.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the PIN can be assigned by the CFTS computer. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the PIN can be suggested by the consumer and will become effective after the approval by the computer of the CFTS.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a PIN can be composed of some digits suggested by the consumer and some digits assigned by the CFTS computer. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, an AIN or a part of the AIN can also be used as the PIN. In yet another alternative embodiment of the present invention, a PIN or a part of the PIN can also be used as the AIN.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If privacy is not a concern, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the entire identification document number can be used for account identification purposes to reduce the probability of mismatches. Since there are many different countries, states and governments that may issue identification documents, such as driver licenses, passports, etc., an identification document number may not be unique. Under such circumstances, a PIN and/or AIN can eliminate such confusion. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the identification document number, the zip code and the PIN and/or AIN can be jointly used to reach the account identification goal.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The above identification document approach can also be used by an automatic checkout stand, an ATM terminal, a kiosk, or other types of device interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Alternatively, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the CFTS computer system can send account identification information to a personal communication device of the consumer. The personal communication device of the consumer can send such account identification information to the payee's device interface for account identification purposes through optical, acoustic, electronic, magnetic, and/or electro-magnetic mediums.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For security purposes, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a PIN and/or AIN can also be used to protect such transactions. The above approach can also be used by an automatic checkout stand, an ATM terminal, a kiosk, or other types of device interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the consumer uploads his/her recent photo into the computer system of the CFTS. Because a person's face is exposed to the public everyday and many online social networks may have already posted the photo of the person on the Internet, the photo of a consumer is generally not considered to be &#x201c;private information.&#x201d; This photo can be used to enhance the security of the CFTS.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, in order to open an account, a consumer may upload his/her name and tax ID so that the CFTS can verify the existence of the consumer through government records. Because each consumer has one unique tax ID in a country, each consumer has only one chance to open an account with the computer of the CFTS. If a duplicate tax ID is detected, the CFTS can conduct an investigation to identify which consumer has the correct tax ID and can filter out the fraudster. The tax ID can be encrypted in the database, or encrypted in a separate database, so that nobody can see or use it after the account opening process.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">To comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the computer system may screen the consumer against the regulatory lists to ensure that the CFTS can conduct transactions with the consumer in compliance with applicable regulations and laws. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the computer system of CFTS can conduct transactional monitoring to detect suspicious activities in compliance with applicable regulations and laws.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer may provide information about a financial account under the consumer's name. The CFTS can conduct a transaction with the consumer's financial account and request the consumer to report the amount and/or the type of transaction. If the consumer cannot report it correctly, the consumer may be a fraudster because he/she cannot tell what is going on in his/her own financial account. The financial account information can be encrypted so that nobody can see or use it.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">To ensure that the personal identification information stored in the CFTS database is up-to-date, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer may update his/her personal identification information in the CFTS database whenever there is a change of the information. For example, when a consumer moves to another state, his/her driver's license and address may be changed and the consumer may update the personal identification information stored inside CFTS's database.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the CFTS computer system can detect a possible address change if the locations of a consumer's transactions have been substantially changed to a new area. Upon such detection of a possible address change, the computer system can send a message to the consumer and request the consumer to update his/her personal identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer may provide one or more contact phone numbers and/or email addresses for contact purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer may input into the CFTS database a list of questions and answers which are designed by the consumer and relate to unique knowledge known only by the consumer. For example, a question may be &#x201c;What is the name of a person who sat next to me during 1<sup>st </sup>grade?&#x201d; The answer to this question will be similarly unique. Because the questions are designed by the consumer, the chance for a fraudster to know the answers is substantially negligible. For the purposes of this disclosure, these questions are referred to as &#x201c;challenge questions.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the challenge question may be &#x201c;What is the key code?&#x201d;, and a consumer is required to input a key code into the device interface of the CFTS computer. For the purposes of this disclosure, a key code is an alpha-numeric combination designed by the consumer, substantially like a password. The chance for another person to know or correctly guess the key code is low.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">To further strengthen the protection of the consumer, in yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, the CFTS may use each key code only once during a pre-defined period of time. The consumer may update the key code periodically. Alternatively, the consumer can store multiple key codes at one time to avoid the burden of frequently updating the key codes.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">To provide additional protection to the consumer, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer can select his/her own user ID, Personal Identification Number, AIN, password, etc. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer can change his/her user ID, Personal Identification Number, AIN, password, etc. from time to time as an extra protection against theft of these data used by the CFTS.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Because each user of the CFTS registers with the computer system of CFTS and uses the CFTS services based on a unique identity, the CFTS can conduct financial transactions for the user. There are many ways to transfer funds electronically between an entity's (e.g., payer's) account in a financial institution and the entity's account in the CFTS. For example, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, an Automatic Clearing House (&#x201c;ACH&#x201d;) transaction can complete such an electronic fund transfer at a very low cost today.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In other embodiments of the present disclosure, debit card networks, credit card networks, ATM or other real time and non-real time networks can be used to transfer funds electronically between an entity's account in a financial institution and the entity's account in the CFTS.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As a result, any consumer, organization, merchant or financial institution can transfer funds to another consumer, organization, merchant or financial institution through the CFTS. The CFTS can become a common platform for consumers, businesses and financial institutions to conduct commercial activities.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">After the consumer has opened an account with the computer of the CFTS, if a fraudster tries to use the consumer's stolen identity to conduct a financial transaction at a bank, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a teller can enter into the computer system of the CFTS a subset of partial personal identification information used by the CFTS. The computer system of the CFTS can search its database to find and display the photo of the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Alternatively, in another embodiment of the present disclosure, the teller can scan an official identification document of the fraudster instead of manually entering the subset of partial personal identification information into the computer system of CFTS. The computer system of CFTS can search its database to find and display the photo of the consumer. The teller can deny the fraudster's transactions if he/she does not correspond to the photo of the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If the teller cannot distinguish the fraudster based on the photo of the consumer, in another embodiment of the present disclosure, the teller can ask a challenge question or request a key code designed by the consumer. If the person cannot answer the challenge question or give the key code correctly, this person is possibly a fraudster.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the teller can request the person to provide an additional piece of partial personal information. The computer system of the CFTS can compare the additional piece of information of the person with the consumer's information stored in the CFTS database to determine whether the person is the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, authorized personnel of a financial institution can call the consumer's phone number, which was provided by the consumer and stored in the CFTS database, to verify whether the consumer is the same person conducting the transactions at the financial institution. In an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, authorized personnel of a financial institution can send an email to the consumer to verify whether the consumer has requested the financial institution to conduct a particular transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the teller can inform the CFTS computer if the teller rejects the transaction and the CFTS computer can send an alert information message to the consumer so that the consumer is alerted of a possible fraud against the consumer. Similarly, if a fraudster tries to use the consumer's identity to purchase goods or services at a merchant after stealing the consumer's identity, in other embodiments of the present disclosure, the photo of the consumer, the challenge questions, the key codes, and/or the additional partial information can be used to detect the fraudster.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the merchant informs the CFTS computer if the merchant rejects the transaction and the CFTS computer can send a message to the consumer so that the consumer may be alerted that there is a possible fraud against the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">If a fraudster tries to use the consumer's identity to purchase goods or services online, in another embodiment of the present disclosure, the challenge questions, the key codes and/or the additional partial personal information can be used by the online merchants to detect the fraudster.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, if the CFTS computer rejects the transaction because the answer is wrong, the CFTS computer can also send a message to the consumer so that the consumer is alerted of a possible fraud against the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the CFTS can alert the consumer's financial institutions after identifying a possible identity theft and/or fraud against the consumer so that the financial institutions can act to protect the consumer and the financial institutions.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a computer system can use the alert provided by the CFTS computer to implement additional provisions to protect the consumer, the financial institutions and possibly other clients of the financial institutions. An additional software system can be established in the computers of the financial institutions for anti-fraud purposes based on the alert provided by the CFTS computer.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As a result, the CFTS also enables consumers, financial institutions and merchants to jointly detect and prevent fraud in financial transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">To further automate the process of financial crime prevention, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the transaction networks of financial institutions, such as the credit card network, debit card network, trading network, insurance network, etc. can be linked to the CFTS computer so that a consumer's photo, challenge questions, key codes, and/or additional information can be used by consumers, merchants or financial institutions when they conduct transactions through these transaction networks.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In another embodiment of the present invention, the CFTS can be integrated into the existing networks for credit cards, debit cards, stored value cards, ATM cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">To facilitate anti-fraud payment transactions for a consumer, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer (e.g., the payer) can give the merchant (i.e., the payee) the payer's CFTS account identification (which consists of AIN and a set of partial personal identification data), the payer's official identification document, or the account identification information transmitted from the personal communication device through, for example, a bar code, electronic signal, acoustic, magnetic signal, electro-magnetic signal, etc. The payee can then enter the account identification or the official identification document number into the device interface provided by the CFTS computer over the network. Alternatively, the official identification document number, bar code, acoustic, electronic signal, magnetic signal, or electro-magnetic signal can be read by a device interface the PIN or AIN can also be used as an option.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition, the payee or payer can enter a dollar amount the payer is supposed to pay. If there is a sufficient amount of money in the payer's CFTS account to cover the payment amount, the CFTS computer can freeze the amount of money in the payer's account and issue a new &#x201c;pass code&#x201d; which value cannot be predicted before the issuing. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the pass code, the dollar amount, and/or the payee's name are sent to the payer by a text message, voice mail, instant message, etc. through a mobile phone, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or other personal communication devices. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the pass code, the dollar amount, and/or the payee's name are sent to the payer by email, land line phone, or fax.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">After receiving the pass code and confirming the dollar amount and the payee's name, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the payer may give the pass code to payee who can enter the pass code into the device interface of the CFTS computer. If the pass code entered by the payee matches the pass code sent to the payer, the CFTS computer can transfer the frozen amount of money in the payer's account into the payee's account and the payment transaction is completed. Alternatively, the payer can enter the pass code into the payee's device interface for a point of sale transaction, or enter the pass code into payee's computer user interface for an online transaction or a transaction at an automatic checkout stand. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, after receiving the pass code, a payer can send a text message, instant message, email, fax, voice mail, etc. to the computer of the CFTS to approve a particular transaction based on the particular pass code associated with the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The financial transactions referred to in the present disclosure are not limited to payment transactions. The same system and method can be used for other types of financial instructions. For example, in another embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer (e.g., a stock trader) can give a stockbroker (i.e., the counter party) the stock trader's CFTS account identification, the stock trader's identification document, or an optical, acoustic electronic, electro-magnetic or magnetic signal from the trader's personal communication device. The stockbroker can then input the account identification, the identification document number, or receive an optical, acoustic, electronic, electro-magnetic or magnetic signal through the device interface of the CFTS computer. In addition, the stockbroker can enter the transactional details given by the stock trader. If the stock trader's account meets the trading requirements for this particular transaction, the CFTS computer can freeze the amount of money involved in the stock trader's account to cover the transaction cost and issue a new &#x201c;pass code&#x201d; which value cannot be predicted before the issuing.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the pass code, the transaction details and/or the stockbroker's name are sent to the stock trader by a text message, instant message, voice mail, etc. through a cellular phone, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or other personal communication devices. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the pass code, the transaction details and/or the stockbroker's name are sent to the stock trader by email, land line phone, fax, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">After receiving the pass code and confirming the transactional details and the stockbroker's name, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the stock trader may give the pass code to the stockbroker who can enter the pass code into the device interface of the CFTS computer. If the pass code entered by the stockbroker matches the pass code sent to the stock trader, the CFTS computer can complete the transaction based on the instructions given by the stock trader.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Alternatively, the stock trader can enter the pass code into stockbroker's device interface for a point of sale transaction, or enter the pass code into stockbroker's user interface for an online transaction. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, after receiving the pass code, a stock trader can send a text message, instant message, email, fax, voice mail, etc. to the computer of CFTS to approve a particular transaction based on the particular pass code associated with the transaction. In addition to stock trading transactions, other financial transactions can be conducted in a similar manner through the CFTS computer.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the CFTS computer can change the consumer's (or payer's) AIN or PIN at the request of the consumer (or payer).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the pass code is given a fixed amount of life time. If the correct pass code is not entered into the device interface of the CFTS computer within that fixed amount of time, the pass code can expire, the transaction can be automatically canceled and the frozen amount of money in the consumer's account can be released back to the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">To further protect the consumer, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, if a pre-defined number of wrong pass codes have been entered against a consumer's account, the consumer's account can be frozen because somebody may be trying to commit fraud against the consumer through trial-and-error. The frozen account can be reset (i.e., unfrozen) to normal condition by the consumer. The consumer can also request the CFTS computer to change its account identification or AIN before resetting the account status back to normal condition.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, if the dollar amount of a single transaction has exceeded a threshold set by the consumer, the consumer's account can be frozen until the consumer resets the account back to normal condition. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, if the aggregate amount of transactions of a consumer's account during a pre-defined period of time has exceeded a threshold set by the consumer, the consumer's account can be frozen. This frozen account can be reset to normal condition by the consumer. In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, if the total number of transactions in a consumer's account during a pre-defined period of time has exceeded the threshold set by the consumer, the consumer's account can be frozen. The consumer can reset or unfreeze the account.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The consumer can log into the CFTS computer to reset the consumer's account. Alternatively, the counter party (or payee) or consumer can enter an authorization code which is only known to the consumer to reset the account.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Since the pass code is newly generated by the computer of CFTS in each transaction, the counter party of the transaction cannot steal money from the consumer because the counter party does not know what the pass code is in each transaction until the consumer has confirmed the dollar amount and provided the pass code to the counter party. Since the pass code is sent only to the consumer, a third party is prevented from stealing money from the consumer because the third party does not receive the pass code to complete the transaction. Consequently, even if the counter party or a third party has stolen the CFTS account identification, the identification document or the optical, acoustic, electronic, electro-magnetic, or magnetic signal of the consumer, the counter party or the third party cannot commit fraud against the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Because the amount of payment is verified and frozen in the consumer's account first before the pass code is generated and sent to the consumer, the consumer cannot default on the payment.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Consequently, the CFTS is useful for all kind of financial transactions, including point-of-sale transactions when two parties meet face-to-face, online transactions and remote transactions when the counter parties (or payees) cannot verify who the consumers (or payers) are.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, when a payer places an order on the Internet, the payer can enter the payer's CFTS account identification, which consists of the AIN and a set of partial personal identification data, into the user interface of the Internet merchant. This CFTS account identification is resent by the Internet merchant to the CFTS computer which can send a pass code to the payer. Then, the payer can enter the pass code into the user interface of the Internet merchant. This pass code is resent by the Internet merchant to the CFTS computer to transfer the payment from the payer's CFTS account to the payee's CFTS account and the transaction is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, after receiving the pass code, a payer can send a text message, instant message, email, fax, voice mail, etc. to the computer of CFTS to approve a particular transaction based on the particular pass code associated with the transaction. As a result, the payer can securely complete the online transaction without releasing any personal identification information, suppressing the possibility of fraud, and protecting both the payer and the payee.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a payer can order goods or services remotely through a phone call by giving the payee the payer's CFTS account identification. After the payee enters the payer's CFTS account identification into a device interface of the CFTS, the CFTS computer sends a pass code to the payer. The payer provides the payee with the pass code to complete the transaction. As a result of the present disclosure, the payee can complete the transaction without the need to know the payer's identity and both parties are fully protected in the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a payer can complete the payment transaction by himself at an automatic checkout stand. The payer can enter his CFTS account identification into the checkout stand, which can resend the payer's CFTS account identification to the CFTS computer. Alternatively, the payer's official identification document or the optical, acoustic, electronic, electro-magnetic or magnetic signal transmitted by the payer's personal communication device can be read by the checkout stand. The PIN can also be used as an option. The CFTS computer can send the pass code to the payer, for example, by text message, instant message, voice mail, email, etc. to the payer's PDA, mobile phone, etc. Then, the payer can enter into the checkout stand the pass code. The pass code will be sent to the CFTS computer to transfer the payment from the payer's account to the payee's account and the transaction is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, after receiving the pass code, the payer can send a text message, instant message, voice mail, email, fax, etc. to the CFTS computer to approve a particular transaction based on the particular pass code associated with that transaction. Both payer and payee are fully protected against fraud in this transaction and the payer's identity is not disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Similarly, the CFTS account identification, the consumer's personal identification document and/or the optical, acoustic, electronic, electro-magnetic or magnetic signal transmitted by the payer's personal communication device can be used at an ATM, kiosk, or other types of device interfaces. A new pass code will be sent to the consumer's personal communication device after the consumer's CFTS account has been identified through the CFTS account identification, the consumer's personal identification document and/or the optical, electronic, acoustic, electro-magnetic or magnetic signal transmitted by the payer's personal communication device. The consumer can enter the pass code into the ATM, kiosk, or the other types of device interface. If the pass code is correct, the consumer can proceed to conduct financial transactions through the ATM, kiosk or the other types of device interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The present disclosure can also be used to protect the CFTS account user ID, password and/or PIN against theft. Traditionally, a security token device is used to protect login security. Such an approach is generally expensive because hashing, synchronization, digital signature, cryptography and/or other complicated technology are required to produce a token. In addition, the token device itself costs money. Furthermore, a fraudster can still steal the token device from a user.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, after a user (e.g., a consumer, merchant, or financial institution) has correctly entered the user ID, password and/or PIN when the user tries to login from a source application, a new pass code is generated by the system. Since no hashing, synchronization, digital signature, cryptography or other complicated technology is required to generate a pass code, the CFTS computer system can easily produce such a pass code at very low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">This pass code is immediately sent to a destination other than the source application from which the user is attempting login. For example, the destination can be an email address, phone number, etc. based on the contact information of the officially registered user stored inside the system. The user has to enter the correct pass code into the system to complete the login process before the pass code expires. As a result, even if a fraudster has stolen the user ID, password and/or PIN, the fraudster cannot log into the system without having the important pass code. Because the pass code is different in each login, a third party is unable to steal such a pass code.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">There is no need to purchase any token device which can become very expensive. The login process of the present disclosure can be quickly implemented as long as the user has some communication device, such as a mobile phone which is very popular today.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Therefore, the present disclosure provides an enhanced protection to computer-based systems against financial transactions fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The system of the present disclosure can potentially replace all the traditional payment instruments and, at the same time, provide improved protection for consumers, organizations, merchants and financial institutions. Furthermore, there is no need for consumers to carry the traditional financial instruments such as cash, check, credit card, debit card, prepaid card, gift card, stored-value card, ATM card, monetary instruments, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Moreover, the present disclosure can quickly and securely transfer money to any place with access to the CFTS. The CFTS becomes a Global Remittance Network.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As an additional convenience to the consumer, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a consumer can go shopping without carrying the traditional financial instruments such as cash, credit card, debit card, prepaid card, stored-value card, gift card, check, monetary instrument, etc. For example, the merchant can enter the dollar amount and the consumer's CFTS account identification into the device interface of the CFTS. The consumer can obtain the pass code from his/her personal communication device and give it to the merchant to complete the transaction. This option is very useful to protect young children whose parents do not feel comfortable letting children carry cash or pre-paid cards for safety reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In fact, a consumer can easily conduct any payment as long as he/she carries a personal communication device such as mobile phone, smartphone, smartbook, PDA, etc. As a result, in the event that a consumer forgets his/her wallet containing financial instruments (e.g., cash, credit/debit/gift cards, etc.), he/she could still pay the merchant through his/her CFTS account. If the consumer also forgets to carry the cellular phone, PDA, etc., he/she can still use the merchant's computer to log into the CFTS to directly transfer funds from the consumer's CFTS account to the merchant's CFTS account.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In summary, many different embodiments and combinations of embodiments are disclosed in the present invention to protect a financial transaction against fraud. A particular embodiment or a particular combination of embodiments can be applied for a financial transaction based on the risk involved in the financial transaction. Alternatively, the choice of a particular embodiment or a particular combination of embodiments can be made based on commercial reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As contemplated in the described embodiments, one of many possible combinations is described below as an example. The computer system of the Cardless Financial Transactions Network (&#x201c;CFTS&#x201d;) <b>500</b> and a network, such as the Internet <b>600</b> enable a consumer <b>100</b>, a financial institution <b>200</b>, a retail store <b>300</b> and an online merchant <b>400</b> to conduct secured financial transactions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Reference should now be made to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in combination with the system diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which together illustrate how a consumer can open an account with the computer system of CFTS <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">First (block <b>2001</b>), a device interface reads the embedded information from consumer's official identification document. The device interface authenticates the identity of the consumer <b>100</b> by comparing the embedded identification information with the information provided by the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>2002</b>). For example, if the fingerprint of the consumers <b>100</b> matches the biometric information embedded within the official identification document, the consumer <b>100</b> must be the owner of the official identification document.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">According to the authentication result, the device interface may take a different action (decision block <b>2003</b>). If the consumer's identity is not correct (No branch <b>2004</b>), i.e., the identity of the consumer <b>100</b> cannot be authenticated, the device interface rejects the consumer <b>100</b> from opening an account (block <b>2010</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">If the consumer's identity is correct (YES branch <b>2005</b>), i.e., the consumer <b>100</b> is the owner of the official identification document, the CFTS computer <b>500</b> will determine whether the consumer <b>100</b> is on the blacklist used by the CFTS computer <b>500</b> (decision block <b>2006</b>). This blacklist includes the information provided by government agencies (e.g., Office of Foreign Assets Control) and commercial organizations.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">If the consumer <b>100</b> is on the blacklist (YES branch <b>2007</b>), the consumer is rejected from opening an account (block <b>2010</b>). If the consumer <b>100</b> is not on the black list (NO branch <b>2008</b>), the consumer is permitted to proceed to complete the process and open an account with the CFTS computer <b>500</b> (block <b>2009</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">After the consumer <b>100</b> has opened an account with the CFTS computer <b>500</b>, the consumer <b>100</b> can conduct secured financial transactions with a retail store <b>300</b> at point of sale or with a remote merchant <b>400</b> via phone call. The flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> in combination with the system diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrate how these kinds of transactions can be conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The consumer <b>100</b> provides the retail store <b>300</b> or the remote merchant <b>400</b> with a set of partial personal identification data, e.g., the last 4 digits of the driver's license number and the 5-digit zip code. In addition, the consumer <b>100</b> provides the retail store <b>300</b> or the merchant <b>400</b> with his/her CFTS account identification number (AIN). The retail store <b>300</b> or the merchant <b>400</b> enters the partial personal identification and AIN of the consumer <b>100</b> into a device interface of the CFTS (block <b>3001</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The set of partial personal identification data and the AIN of the consumer <b>100</b> are sent to the CFTS computer <b>500</b> via network <b>600</b>. The CFTS computer <b>500</b> uses the received information to identify the account of the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>3002</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The CFTS computer <b>500</b> determines whether there is a sufficient amount of money in the consumer's account for the transaction (decision block <b>3003</b>). If there is not a sufficient amount of money (NO branch <b>3004</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> rejects the transaction (block <b>3012</b>). If there is a sufficient amount of money (YES branch <b>3005</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> freezes the amount for the transaction and sends a new pass code to the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>3006</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The consumer <b>100</b> gives the pass code to the retail store <b>300</b> or the merchant <b>400</b>, which enters the pass code into the device interface of the CFTS (block <b>3007</b>). The CFTS computer <b>500</b> determines whether the received pass code is the same pass code sent to the consumer <b>100</b> (decision block <b>3008</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">If the pass code is incorrect (NO branch <b>3009</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> rejects the transaction (block <b>3012</b>). If the pass code is correct (YES branch <b>3010</b>), i.e., the same pass code is received, the CFTS computer <b>500</b> completes the transaction for the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>3011</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Sometimes, retail store <b>300</b> may permit consumer <b>100</b> to interact directly with the device interface in the retail store <b>300</b>. In addition, an automatic checkout stand may expect the consumer <b>100</b> to interface directly with the checkout stand. Furthermore, for online commercial activities, a consumer <b>100</b> may interact directly with the user interface provided by the online merchant <b>400</b> via the network <b>600</b>. Under such circumstances, the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> in combination with the system diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrate how these transactions can be conducted on the CFTS.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The consumer <b>100</b> enters a set of partial personal identification data, e.g., the last 4 digits of the driver's license number and the 5-digit zip code, and AIN into a device interface which sends the entered data to the CFTS computer <b>500</b> via network <b>600</b> (block <b>4001</b>). The CFTS computer <b>500</b> uses the received information to identify the account of the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>4002</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The CFTS computer <b>500</b> determines whether there is a sufficient amount of money in the consumer's account for the transaction (decision block <b>4003</b>). If there is not a sufficient amount of money (NO branch <b>4004</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> rejects the transaction (block <b>4012</b>). If there is a sufficient amount of money (YES branch <b>4005</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> freezes the amount for the transaction and sends a new pass code to the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>4006</b>). The consumer <b>100</b> enters the pass code into the device interface which sends the pass code to the CFTS computer <b>500</b> (block <b>4007</b>). The CFTS computer <b>500</b> determines whether the received pass code is the same pass code sent to the consumer <b>100</b> (decision block <b>4008</b>). If the pass code is incorrect (NO branch <b>4009</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> rejects the transaction (block <b>4012</b>). If the pass code is correct (YES branch <b>4010</b>), i.e., the same pass code is received, the CFTS computer <b>500</b> completes the transaction for the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>4011</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Alternatively, a consumer <b>100</b> can use the bar code sent by the CFTS computer <b>500</b> to his/her personal communication device to complete a secured financial transaction. The flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> in combination with the system diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrate how this kind of transaction is conducted on CFTS.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">A device interface at the retail store <b>300</b> reads the bar code from the personal communication device of the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>5001</b>) and sends the bar code data to the CFTS computer <b>500</b> via network <b>600</b>. The CFTS computer <b>500</b> uses the bar code to identify consumer's account (block <b>5002</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The consumer enters his/her personal identification number (PIN) into the device interface which sends the PIN to the CFTS computer <b>500</b> via network <b>600</b> (block <b>5003</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The CFTS computer determines whether the PIN entered by the consumer <b>100</b> is correct or not (block <b>5004</b>). If the PIN is incorrect (NO branch <b>5005</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> rejects the transaction (block <b>5016</b>). If the PIN is correct (YES branch <b>5006</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> determines whether there is a sufficient amount of money in the consumer's account for the transaction (decision block <b>5007</b>). If there is not a sufficient amount of money (NO branch <b>5008</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> rejects the transaction (block <b>5016</b>).

<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The consumer <b>100</b> enters the pass code into the device interface which sends the pass code to the CFTS computer <b>500</b> (block <b>5011</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The CFTS computer <b>500</b> determines whether the received pass code is the same pass code sent to the consumer <b>100</b> (decision block <b>5012</b>).

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The system and method of the present disclosure can also enhance the login security of a computer system. The flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates how a fraudster cannot log into a computer system even with a correct User ID and Password.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">A subject enters a correct User ID and Password in order to log into a computer system (block <b>6001</b>). Based on the correct User ID and Password, the computer system sends a new pass code to the registered user (block <b>6002</b>).

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The system and method of the present disclosure can also be used to conduct financial transactions through a personal identification document. The flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> in combination with the system diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrate how financial transactions can be completed this way.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">A device interface reads the embedded data from a personal identification document of the consumer <b>100</b> and sends the embedded data to the CFTS computer <b>500</b> (block <b>7001</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The CFTS computer <b>500</b> uses the data received from the device interface to identify the account of the consumer <b>100</b> (block <b>7002</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The CFTS computer <b>500</b> determines whether the consumer's account permits the requested transaction (decision block <b>7003</b>). For example, if the consumer's account is a credit account, the account permits the requested transaction when the account has available credit for the transaction. If the consumer's account is a prepaid account, the account permits the requested transaction when the account has sufficient money for the transaction. If the account does not permit such a transaction (NO branch <b>7004</b>), the CFTS computer <b>500</b> rejects the transaction (block <b>7012</b>).
