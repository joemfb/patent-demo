<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. national application under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371(b) of international Application Ser. No. PCT/CN2009/070606 filed Mar. 2, 2009, which claims the benefit of Chinese Patent Application No. 20081006549.1, filed Feb. 29, 2008, the disclosures of both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a carrier, more particularly to a device for carrying people or other objects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many disasters such as fires, earthquakes and terrorist attacks seriously threaten people's safety. In the event of a disaster, sometimes rescue personnel cannot timely arrive. Therefore, a useful self-help crowd escape device is especially required for high-rise buildings to carry trapped persons or other objects.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, provided is an escape device for high-rise buildings, which comprises: an escape capsule; a speed up gear mounted to the escape capsule; a track provided with a rack with which the speed up gear is engaged so that the escape capsule can move along the track; and a damper including a rotor, wherein the speed up gear in operation drives the rotor into rotation and the damper is capable of converting a portion of kinetic energy of the escape capsule to electric energy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another embodiment, it is to provide an escape system for high-rise buildings comprising two escape devices, wherein each of the escape devices comprises: an escape capsule; a speed up gear mounted to the escape capsule; a track provided with a rack with which the speed up gear is engaged so that the escape capsule can move along the track; and a damper including a rotor, wherein the speed up gear in operation drives the rotor into rotation and the damper is capable of converting a portion of kinetic energy of the escape capsule to electric energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The escape device for high-rise buildings provided herein has at least one of the following effects. By using the speed up gear, the persons' potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy to be input into the damper. Then, the damper converts the kinetic energy to electric energy in real time so as to slow down the escape capsule and not to need any power supply. The obtained electric energy can be stored or consumed by a resistor. Since the movement of the escape capsule is limited by one or more tracks, the running of the escape capsule may not be influenced by the wind. The security and stability of the escape device of the present invention are improved. Two escape capsules of the escape device can be used circularly to carry a crowd of trapped persons. The escape device can be stopped at any position at a building.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Hereinafter, a detailed description of the present invention will be given with reference to the appended drawings and embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An escape device for high-rise buildings disclosed herein can be used to rapidly carry persons trapped in a high-rise building down to the ground in the event of disasters such as fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks and so on. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the escape device for high-rise buildings comprises a first escape capsule <b>7</b>, a first damper <b>519</b>, a first track <b>10</b> and a second track <b>15</b>. The first escape capsule <b>7</b> for carrying the trapped persons can move along a first channel formed between the first track <b>10</b> and the second track <b>15</b> so as to move to the ground or the roof of the building in a predetermined path. In this way, the movement of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> may not be influenced by the surrounding such as wind. A first rack <b>13</b> is installed on at lease one of the first and second tracks <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>. In this embodiment, the first rack <b>13</b> is installed to the first track <b>10</b>. A first speed up gear <b>4</b> engaged with the first rack <b>13</b> is provided in the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. The first speed up gear <b>4</b> in operation can drive a rotor of the first damper <b>519</b> into rotation and the first damper <b>519</b> can control the rotation of the first speed up gear <b>4</b> through a transmission mechanism so as to control the speed of the first escape capsule <b>7</b>, the principle of which will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment, the transmission mechanism is a first speed up mechanism <b>522</b>. In an implementation, the first speed up mechanism <b>522</b> is, for example, a cycloidal pin gear speed-up mechanism. A speed-control capsule <b>17</b> is provided on the top of the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. The first damper <b>519</b>, the first speed up mechanism <b>522</b> and the first speed up gear <b>4</b> are installed in the speed-control capsule <b>17</b>. The first damper <b>519</b> is provided to restrict the acceleration of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> when the first escape capsule <b>7</b> descends.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the escape device for high-rise buildings according to the present invention may further comprise a brake assembly used to slow down or stop the motion of the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. By using the brake assembly, the first escape capsule <b>7</b> can be automatically stopped at the roof of the building or manually stopped at any floor of the building.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the brake assembly may comprise a brake wheel <b>53</b>, a brake-belt <b>54</b>, a brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b>, a brake-belt positioning rod <b>527</b>, a rotating-arm <b>59</b>, a rotating-arm fixing latch <b>56</b>, a tension-spring <b>57</b>, a tension-spring fixing latch <b>58</b>, a pull-cable <b>510</b>, a pull-cable tube <b>513</b>, an tube end fixing element <b>511</b>, a brake operating box <b>512</b> and an operating handle <b>515</b>. Hereinafter, the connection and operation of the components of the brake assembly will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The brake wheel <b>53</b>, the brake-belt <b>54</b>, the brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b>, the brake-belt positioning rod <b>527</b>, the rotating-arm <b>59</b>, the rotating-arm fixing latch <b>56</b> and the tension-spring <b>57</b> may be disposed within the speed-control capsule <b>17</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first end of the stretched tension-spring <b>57</b> can be fixedly connected to the tension-spring fixing latch <b>58</b>, and a second end of the tension-spring <b>57</b> is connected with a first end of the rotating-arm <b>59</b> and a first end of the brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b>. The rotating-arm <b>59</b> can rotate about the rotating-arm fixing latch <b>56</b> so as to stretch the tension-spring <b>57</b>. When the rotating-arm <b>59</b> is rotated to a stop position, the brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b> connected with the brake-belt <b>54</b> is pulled by the tension-spring <b>57</b>. The brake-belt <b>54</b> partially surrounds the brake wheel <b>53</b>. In this case, the brake-belt <b>54</b> is pulled by the brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b> so as to clasp the brake wheel <b>53</b>. On the contrary, when the rotating-arm <b>59</b> is rotated to an operation position, the brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b> is pushed by the rotating-arm <b>59</b>. In this case, the brake-belt <b>54</b> is released by the brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b> so as to release the brake wheel <b>53</b>. The brake-belt positioning rod <b>527</b> is movably connected with the brake-belt <b>54</b> at the joint <b>528</b> for preventing the brake-belt <b>54</b> from falling away from the brake wheel <b>53</b> so as to ensure that the brake-belt <b>54</b> and the brake wheel <b>53</b> properly fit with each other. The combination of the tension-spring <b>57</b>, the rotating-arm <b>59</b>, the brake-belt pulling rod <b>55</b> and the operating handle <b>515</b> forms a brake operator for use.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the present embodiment, the rotation of the rotating-arm <b>59</b> is controlled by the operating handle <b>515</b> through the pull-cable <b>510</b> which is enclosed by the pull-cable tube <b>513</b> fixed by the tube end fixing element <b>511</b>. Specifically, a first end of the pull-cable <b>510</b> is connected with a second end of the rotating-arm <b>59</b>, and a second end of the pull-cable <b>510</b> is connected with the operating handle <b>515</b>. The operating handle <b>515</b> is assembled in the brake operating box <b>512</b> fixed on the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. The operating handle <b>515</b> is configured to extend out of the brake operating box <b>512</b> through a sliding slot <b>531</b> provided on a wall of the brake operating box <b>512</b>, and is capable of moving along the sliding slot <b>531</b> and thereby switching between a brake position <b>515</b><i>a </i>and a release position <b>515</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In operation, when the operating handle <b>515</b> is switched by a user from its brake position <b>515</b><i>a </i>to the release position <b>515</b><i>b</i>, the rotating-arm <b>59</b> is thereby rotated to its operation position due to the effect of the pull-cable <b>510</b> connected to the handle <b>515</b>, in turn, the first escape capsule <b>7</b> begins to move upwards or downwards as stated above. On the contrary, when the operating handle <b>515</b> is switched by a user from its release position <b>515</b><i>b </i>to the brake position <b>515</b><i>a</i>, the rotating-arm <b>59</b> is thereby rotated to its stop position due to the effect of the tension-spring <b>57</b>. Then, the first escape capsule <b>7</b> is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the brake assembly may further comprise an emergency stop mechanism. The emergency stop mechanism comprises a rod positioning box <b>524</b> mounted in the first escape capsule <b>7</b>, a reset spring <b>525</b> provided within the box <b>524</b>, an upper brake rod <b>521</b>, and a lower brake rod <b>518</b>. The upper brake rod <b>521</b> and the lower brake rod <b>518</b> are slidably assembled in the rod positioning box <b>524</b>. The reset spring <b>525</b> is connected between the upper and lower brake rods <b>521</b> and <b>518</b>. The lower end of the lower brake rod <b>518</b> is wedge-shaped. A push-rod <b>516</b> passing through a push-rod positioning box <b>517</b> is provided with a first end thereof disposed close to the wedge-shaped surface of the lower brake rod <b>518</b>. And, a second end of the push-rod <b>516</b> extends into the brake operating box <b>512</b> and is adjacent to the operating handle <b>515</b>. The push-rod positioning box <b>517</b> is used to limit the movement of the push-rod <b>516</b>. To prevent one end of the push-rod <b>516</b> from immerging in the through-hole <b>540</b>, a sleeve <b>529</b> hoops the push-rod <b>516</b> to limit the axial movement of the push-rod <b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the first escape capsule <b>7</b> moves upwards, the upper brake rod <b>521</b> will first be hit by the ceiling of the building, so as to compress the reset spring <b>525</b> and in turn push the lower brake rod <b>518</b> down. The wedge-shaped surface of the lower brake rod <b>518</b> will successively push the push-rod <b>516</b> to switch the operating handle <b>515</b> from its release position <b>515</b><i>b </i>to its brake position <b>515</b><i>a </i>so that the first escape capsule <b>7</b> is stopped and held on the top floor.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show an example of the first damper <b>519</b> for generating electric power and a resistant force opposite to the force produced by the gravity due to the weight of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> and the persons stood therein. The first damper <b>519</b> comprises a rotor <b>5191</b> made of a magnetic material (e.g. permanent magnetic steel), a stator <b>5192</b> including coil windings, a bearing base <b>5193</b>, a outlet box <b>5195</b>, a damper shaft <b>5196</b> and a three-phase wire <b>5197</b>. The damper shaft <b>5196</b> is connected with a shaft of the first speed up mechanism <b>522</b> and the rotor <b>5191</b>. The rotor <b>5191</b> is connected with the brake wheel <b>53</b> so that the brake and movement of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> can be controlled by clasping or releasing the brake wheel <b>53</b>. The three-phase wire <b>5197</b> is leaded from the outlet box <b>5195</b> provided on the bearing base <b>5193</b> to any load. As stated above, the shaft of the first speed up mechanism <b>522</b> is connected with the rotor <b>5191</b> through the damper shaft <b>5196</b>. When the first escape capsule <b>7</b> descends, the gravity due to the weight of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> and the persons stood therein drives the first speed up gear <b>4</b> to rotate so as to drive the rotor <b>5191</b> rotates at a high speed, which in turn causes a relative motion between the closed loop and the permanent magnetic field, so that electric current is generated in the closed loop due to the relative motion therebetween. In this case, a magnetic force opposite to the gravity is also produced so as to continuously balance the acceleration generated by the gravity. The speed of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> can be controlled within a preset safe speed range automatically. Thus, the first escape capsule <b>7</b> may not land onto the ground at an unsafe speed with a high kinetic energy so as to ensure the persons' safety.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the escape device for high-rise buildings may further comprises an energy-consumption assembly <b>61</b> and a rectifier assembly <b>613</b>. The rectifier assembly <b>613</b> is placed in the speed-control capsule <b>17</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>. The three-phase wire <b>5197</b> of the first damper <b>519</b> is connected to the rectifier assembly <b>613</b>. The electrical power produced by the first damper <b>519</b> is feed to the energy-consumption assembly <b>61</b> via the rectifier assembly <b>613</b>. The cooperation of the first damper <b>519</b>, the rectifier assembly <b>613</b> and the energy-consumption assembly <b>61</b> can automatically control the speed of the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. That is, the three components constitute an automatic speed-control system. The rectifier assembly <b>613</b> can convert AC to DC for energy consumption and improve the security of the circuit to ensure the persons' safety. In this embodiment, the first damper <b>519</b> is a permanent three-phase damper, the rectifier assembly <b>613</b> is a three-phase parallel rectifier bridge, and the energy-consumption assembly <b>61</b> comprises a power-consumption resistor <b>611</b>, a cooling fan <b>612</b> and a bulb <b>615</b> connected in parallel. The electric energy output by the permanent three-phase damper is rectified by the three-phase parallel rectifier bridge and then fed to the power-consumption resistor <b>611</b>, the cooling fan <b>612</b> and the bulb <b>615</b>. In an embodiment, the power-consumption resistor <b>611</b> has adjustable resistance values.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the electric energy is consumed mainly by the power-consumption resistor <b>611</b> in the manner of heat energy and the rest of the electric energy is consumed by the cooling fan <b>612</b> and the bulb <b>615</b>. The bulb <b>615</b> can illuminate the first escape capsule <b>7</b> for the trapped persons to enhance their sense of security. In an embodiment, the first damper <b>519</b> can be connected to an output power interface <b>614</b> for providing electric energy. The cooling fan <b>612</b> can be used to cool the power-consumption resistor <b>611</b> to take away the generated heat. Moreover, the bulb <b>615</b> consuming some of the electric energy can decrease the heat output from the power-consumption resistor <b>611</b>. Thus, the temperature of each of the first damper <b>519</b>, the power-consumption resistor <b>611</b> and the electromagnetic loop can be controlled under a predetermined value. This design can achieve the thermal balance so as to ensure that the first damper <b>519</b> is capable of continuously operating in normal capacity for a long distance. Therefore, the escape device for high-rise buildings of the present invention can be suitable for a building with relatively great height. It is understood by those skilled in the art, the escape device for high-rise buildings of the present invention may comprise an input power interface (not shown) for providing electric energy to the first damper <b>519</b> if required.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, one or more first limiting wheels <b>6</b> are mounted on walls of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> for horizontally positioning the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. At least a portion of each of the first limiting wheels <b>6</b> is tightly coupled with the first track <b>10</b> or second track <b>15</b> so that the first limiting wheels <b>6</b> is slidable along the first track <b>10</b> or second track <b>15</b>. In this embodiment, there are eight first limiting wheels <b>6</b>, four of which are disposed at the top of the first escape capsule <b>7</b> and the other four of which are disposed at the bottom of the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. This design is to prevent the first escape capsule <b>7</b> from swinging or rotating during the descent.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first escape capsule <b>7</b> may further comprise an entrance rolling door <b>71</b> and an exit rolling door <b>72</b> for the trapped persons' entrance/exit. The entrance and exit rolling doors <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> and the limiting wheels <b>6</b> are provided for enhancing the security and stability of the escape device for high-rise buildings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the escape device for high-rise buildings may further comprise a second escape capsule <b>5</b>, a second damper, a third track, a fourth track and a pulley mechanism. The pulley mechanism comprises a cord <b>1</b>, a first fixed pulley <b>3</b>, a positioning pulley <b>9</b> and a second fixed pulley <b>8</b>. The pulleys <b>3</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> can be installed to the ceiling of a building. The second escape capsule <b>5</b> can carry the trapped persons in the same way as the first escape capsule <b>7</b> and move along a second channel formed between the third and fourth tracks. At lease one of the third and fourth tracks is installed with a second rack. In this embodiment, the second rack is installed to the third track. The second escape capsule <b>5</b> is provided with a second speed up gear engaged with the second rack. The movement of the second speed up gear is controlled by the second damper through a transmission mechanism. The two ends of the cord <b>1</b> of the pulley mechanism are connected with the first and second escape capsules <b>7</b> and <b>5</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The configuration of the second escape capsule <b>5</b> may be same to that of the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. The escape device for high-rise buildings of the present invention can further comprise another brake assembly used to brake or hold on the second escape capsule <b>5</b>, which is same to the one used to the first escape capsule <b>7</b>. Furthermore, the second escape capsule <b>5</b> can be provided with second limiting wheels on its sidewalls for horizontally positioning the second escape capsule <b>5</b>. At least a portion of each of the second limiting wheels is locked with the third or fourth tracks and the second limiting wheels can slide along the third or fourth tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the first, second, third and fourth tracks are designed to be I-shaped. The building can be provided with a harbor apartment in which the first, second, third and fourth tracks are installed. One or more doors <b>12</b> are provided in the harbor apartment for entering the escape capsules. In another embodiment, each floor of the building can be provided with a harbor apartment for escape.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, the operation of the escape device for high-rise buildings will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Normally, the first and second escape capsules <b>7</b> and <b>5</b> may be set at the top floor and ground, respectively. In the event of a disaster, persons trapped on the top floor get on the first escape capsule <b>7</b> through the entrance rolling door <b>71</b> and then close the door <b>71</b>. Then, the first escape capsule <b>7</b> starts to run down by switching the operating handle <b>515</b> from its brake position <b>515</b><i>a </i>to its release position <b>515</b><i>b</i>. When the first escape capsule <b>7</b> lands onto the ground, the carried persons can get off through the exit rolling door <b>72</b>. At the same time, the second escape capsule <b>5</b> initially placed on the ground have been pulled upwards by the cord <b>1</b> to the top floor. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, when the upper brake rod <b>521</b> of the second escape capsule <b>5</b> hits the ceiling of the building during moving up, the reset spring <b>525</b> will be compressed and then push the lower brake rod <b>518</b> down. The pushed lower brake rod <b>518</b> will successively push the push-rod <b>516</b> to switch the operating handle <b>515</b> from its release position <b>515</b><i>b </i>to its brake position <b>515</b><i>a </i>so that the second escape capsule <b>5</b> is stopped and held at the top floor. Then, the residual persons on the top floor can get on the second escape capsule <b>5</b> for escape. The process stated above can be repeated until all trapped persons are saved. Using the escape device for high-rise buildings of the present invention, a crowd of persons trapped in a building can save themselves without needing any assistance so as to save time.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">By switching the operating handle <b>515</b> from its release position <b>515</b><i>b </i>to its brake position <b>515</b><i>a</i>, the first or second escape capsule also can be stopped at any floor to save the persons trapped thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If one of the first and second escape capsules <b>7</b> and <b>5</b> is out of control or the cord <b>1</b> is broken off unexpectedly, the other can still be normally operated to carry the trapped persons onto the ground.</p>
